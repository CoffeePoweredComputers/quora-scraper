            "answer_text": "\u2018It ended up being a dark and stormy evening\u2019 is a scene-setting cliche. Bulwer-Lytton didn\u2019t coin the phrase ... which can be indicates he resorted to it as one might to \u2018once upon a time\u2019 or \u2018a number of years ago in a land far away\u2019. If you will be telling a story, it might be an acceptable lead-in. We\u2019re not as critical of the spoken word and familiarity with a stock phrase in a joke or story can add to a listener\u2019s sense of anticipation. (This now works ironically with \u2018it was a dark and stormy night\u2019 because most listeners or viewers recognize the cliche and expect what follows to be deliberately overblown for their amusement.) But, again, as the opening line of a novel, it\u2019s unoriginal and trite. An Incipit should never be insipid. (Though, in this case, the \u2018tastelessness\u2019 comes from being too ... well, flavoursome.) Most writers are aware that \u2018it was\u2019 is a very poor start to any sentence, never mind the opening line of your novel. (\u2018The night was dark and stormy\u2019 is marginally better ... but is still rather lazy, especially the \u2018dark\u2019 which, even the most forgiving would have to admit, adds very little to the sense of night.) Other responses have pointed out Purple prose and the remainder of the opening sentence has that sense of melodrama, designed to catapult the reader directly into a state of elevated tension. Paul Clifford, Bulwer-Lytton\u2019s 1830 novel about a highwayman who falls in love, belongs to the popular adventure genre of that era and so extravagant prose with fanciful plot twists and Gothic settings can be expected ... a florid style which \u2018it was a dark and stormy night\u2019 has come to represent. So, think of it as just like flickering lightening plus the clatter of thunder at dramatic moments in thrillers and scary films ... or, much more likely now, comedies that play on this well-worn cliche.  And that is why \u2018it had been a dark and stormy evening\u2019 is indeed derided. ",

            "answer_text": "Because \u201cIt was a dark and stormy night\u201d is not the full line. Here\u2019s the full line from Edward Bulwer-Lytton\u2019s novel Paul Clifford: It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents - except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of lamps that struggled against the darkness. Do you see more clearly now what\u2019s wrong with the full line? I can do no better than to quote the writer Kit Whitfield\u2019s discussion of this line Kit Whitfield's Blog: Opening Line: (she had a series on her blog First sentence posts! about analyzing the first lines of famous novels) On the one hand, it's lavishly over-written. Before we've had time to catch our breath Bulwer-Lytton is pounding us with storms, rain, torrents, violent gusts of wind, rattling rooftops and struggling flames: water, wind and fire swirl all over the place, sweeping us into the novel in no doubt that things are going to be dramatic. The 'pathetic fallacy' is a common device in literature and describes the attribution of human emotions to the landscape, usually to express or accentuate a character's emotional state. This isn't quite a pathetic fallacy - 'violent' and 'fiercely' are just on the naturalistic side of the line - but it is, you might say, a stylistic pathetic fallacy. By beginning with such a ferocious setting, Bulwer-Lytton is telling us in no uncertain terms - and no succinct ones either - that this is going to be a story of extreme events and larger-than-life characters. (The story concerns a romantic highwayman, a subject that should surprise no one after such an opening.) This is one of the main reasons why 'It was a dark and stormy night' has become such a catchphrase: it's unquestionably purple prose. And she follows it with The fall probably has a lot to do with the fact that it's not the only aside. Our cynicism has been primed by a much clumsier one early on: 'the rain fell in torrents - except at occasional intervals...' While the description of those intervals that follows is pacy and vivid enough to distract us if we allow it to - this is prose written to be gulped, not sipped - that really is a bit of a clanger. When a writer throws everything into describing one kind of drama, storms and torrents in full flow, then checks that flow with an 'except' - and 'except at occasional intervals', which has a dry and pedantic ring that doesn't at all suit the tone - it sounds unfortunately as if he'd lost his focus. Loss of focus never looks good, but when it happens between one kind of extreme and another, with a qualification in the middle that smacks more of the inkstain and pince-nez than the swash and buckle, the effect is unavoidably bathetic. I strongly recommend you read the whole thing, as Whitfield goes deeply into both what this line does well and what it does poorly. Her Opening Lines posts really were great; it\u2019s a shame that, due to life circumstances I do not know, she has stopped writing or updating her blog. So the reason that \u201cIt was a dark and stormy night\u201d became such a cliche is not the \u201cit was a dark and stormy night\u201d, but the gushing torrent of purple prose that follows, except at occasional intervals, when it is checked by a parenthetical (for it is in 19th-century melodrama that our scene lies). When Madeleine L\u2019Engle begins A Wrinkle In Time with \u201cIt was a dark and stormy night\u201d and stops there, doing a paragraph break and spending the next paragraph introducing her protagonist Meg Murry, it actually works quite well. \u201cAn inexperienced writer is usually well advised not to start with a description of the weather or the landscape: it can be done, and sometimes it can be done beautifully, but it runs the risk of beginning with a sentence in which nobody's there and nothing happens,\u201d says Kit Whitfield. L\u2019Engle, a more skilled writer, gives us the \u201cdark and stormy night\u201d setting the tone and being informative, and then immediately gives us the somebody there, Meg, and details about what she is doing and implications of how she is feeling. IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT. In her attic bedroom Margaret Murry, wrapped in an old patchwork quilt, sat on the foot of her bed and watched the trees tossing in the frenzied lashing of the wind. Behind the trees clouds scudded frantically across the sky. Every few moments the moon ripped through them, creating wraithlike shadows that raced along the ground. The house shook. Wrapped in her quilt, Meg shook. That novel is a classic, and a classic for a reason. But Bulwer-Lytton, bless his heart, didn\u2019t know to leave well enough alone. ETA: I love most of the comments so far, even the ones that disagree with this but give a sound argument to support their views. But this is proving a very popular answer and I have a life, so I\u2019m closing comments. Thanks to all. ",
