            "answer_text": "\u2014Life in the Velvet Gutter\u2014 Growing up in the mountains honed my senses and taught me invaluable lessons in life. I learned to appreciate being alone without being lonely, comfortable in my own company and secure with the fact that I could always count upon myself to provide whatever support I needed. I found very little solace elsewhere; not from my brothers, and most certainly not from The Parents. Ours was a blended-family\u2014divided. I discovered that nature would nurture me whenever I felt depleted in spirit. A hike in the forest was the only thing which would revitalize my energy and reset my attitude, ripe with the turmoil of teenage angst. During childhood, I often felt drained of essence. There were vampires living in those mountains; they not only sucked my spirit dry, but also siphoned off what few reserves of empathy and compassion I had left for other people. I was raised in a nightclub barroom. My parents were sole proprietors of The Velvet Garter Saloon, which sat nestled beneath a sentinel of fragrant pines\u2014 den of iniquity and heart of mountain community, Main Street. Once the mill shut down, a Tidal Wave of Despair swept through town. Those who were lucky enough to escape the initial flood, left town in a great wagon-train of U-Hauls\u2014 Westward-Ho pioneers uprooting their families, seeking out the metropolis of success. Those who didn\u2019t flee were stuck there\u2014chained by the shackles of depression and trapped within those snow-capped mountains forever. Welfare checks were converted to whiskey as the unemployed drowned their sorrows, pickling their livers in bottles of cheap gin, reminiscing on good times, and living in halcyon days past. There were not enough jobs in town to go around, and so they amassed like a flutter of dusty moths, drawn by the steady amber glow of a strong rye. Broken and discouraged, they claimed a stool at the bar (where they would remain sitting for years and years) until their yellowing eyes shone as brightly as the neon lights outside. They huddled around their glasses of melting ice cubes, drunken and puking, smoking and swaying to the sad music playing on the juke box. I earned a dollar for soda pop and video games whenever I worked at the club. There were many times that I simply swept around their feet, patrons too drunk to move as they drained their glasses and caught Dad\u2019s eye\u2014 a refill please, and this time, make it a double! I'd crawl underneath to collect the used cocktail napkins which had been momentarily suspended and held by ice-ring to sweating glasses. Eventually broken by the hoist, those napkins were ignored once they lost contact with glass, slowly drifting ever downwards beneath the patron's feet\u2014disabled paper airplanes left to flutter their way to the barroom floor. I\u2019ve collected a lifetime\u2019s surplus of dampened napkins in my time at The Velvet Garter Saloon. It's where I tasted my first French kiss, seasoned with bile and forcibly delivered by toothless Octogenarian mouth, alongside the vulgar lights of Pac-Man arcade games. (He had been a teacher at one time.) Disgusting. It's where the Drunken and Puking, confessed their most indelicate and obscene sins to a child. It's where I learned that the salty tongue of lewdness can indeed sting, and words do hurt! My virgin fingers were left stinging, chapped from the strong antiseptic bucket where I dipped and re-dipped the rag again and again, in an attempt to erase the bathroom grafitti which proclaimed that I was an eleven-year-old slut. It is where a never-ending stream of nomadic band musicians played their weekend gigs, sustained by liquid courage (compliments of the house) until they were left staggering\u2014too drunk to drive back down the treacherous mountain pass. There were many occasions I encountered these hungover strangers in our hallway, the next morning, wearing nothing but underwear, unaware that their temporary lodging was actually our private residence, and which several other children (younger than myself) called home. Good Morning! It's where I first witnessed drugs, and fisticuffs, and parking lot sex. It's where I was groped and teased relentlessly. It's where I lost my parents\u2014night owls chained to the business until we children barely met with them by daylight. It's where I was abandoned to play hide and seek, and was never found. Still, we went about our sunlit school routines, bringing home decent grades on our report cards to hang by magnet on the \u2018fridge\u2014the family bulletin board of progress. Our sole means of communication. We only knocked on The Parents\u2019 door if it was an absolute emergency. Daytime was naptime for vampires like my folks. They were too overworked to care what I did or where I was. I spent a lot of time alone, fishing the streams, hiking the neverending pine needle trails. My senses, numbed by cigarette smoke and dimly-lit barroom glow, suddenly grew keen as I explored the wilderness and observed nature; I found comfort within the mountain's shadow. I communed with porcupine, otter and deer. I pulled native trout from some of the best trout streams in these United States. I let them go, undocumented and without benefit of photograph. Nobody would have believed my stories of the three-pound whoppers I'd landed, anyway. One day, I woke up and discovered, by surprise, that I'd somehow turned into an adult. It seemed like a blink of an eye. I graduated high school in an outdoor ceremony at the foot of my beautiful mountain. My mother was in the audience, but dad was too busy working at The Velvet Garter Saloon to attend. I understood. I was given a suitcase as a graduation gift. The very next morning I packed it with all my worldly belongings and escaped. As I drove out of town, I only looked back once. I watched as the town disappeared in a frenzy of pines. (It suddenly looked so small.) I left before the mountain could trap me. Like it did all the others. ",

            "answer_text": "Man, path, fog and all Yesterday I listened to an interview where Douglas Murray spoke about the issues he dealt with in the latest book. Amongst other things he paraphrased Milan Kundera. Mankind walks in a fog, we stumble on a path and we make the path as we go. That's not the interesting point, the point is as interesting as he says: when we look back, we see the path, we see the man but we don't see the fog. Everything looks inevitable once you've been through it because it has happened, but as you're going through it, all you can do is to have the brightest lights shining that you've got and tread carefully. Don't just stampede fueled by self-righteousness and certainty. I loved that, not just the message \u201cdon't just stampede fueled by self-righteousness and certainty\u201d, but the fact that we can\u2019t but simply do what we think is right at the moment we take the step.  The original quote Man proceeds in the fog. But when he looks back to judge people of the past, he sees no fog on their path. From his present, which was their faraway future, their path looks perfectly clear to him, good visibility all the way. Looking back, he sees the path, he sees the people proceeding, he sees their mistakes, but not the fog Murray\u2019s other point was, exactly what the quote suggests, that we shouldn\u2019t, therefore, judge historical figures without taking in consideration the fog that they had to navigate through. So, with that quote on the first page of the book, the title would be Man, path, fog and all This is why we should do what we love! Since the path forward is foggy, might as well take each step dancing to our rhythm. ",
