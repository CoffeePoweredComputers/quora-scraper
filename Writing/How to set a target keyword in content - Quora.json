            "answer_text": "You can set a target keyword in content by SEO tool at here Here are some keyword phrases I found at SEMrush. Within a few minutes, I had an Excel spreadsheet filled with 30,000 keyword ideas from a Fortune 100 company. Despite some high rankings, clearly the company has plenty of opportunities to rank better:  Even if you find keywords among the data that\u2019s available, you still need to know whether people are really searching for them. Your list might look suitable, but search counts matter. Yes, sometimes you should target a keyword phrase with 1,000 monthly searches. Quite often, you may want something less competitive. I don\u2019t rule out keyword phrases with 50 searches a month, but I also don\u2019t jump at ones with 30,000 searches. If I do go that high, it\u2019s because the keyword phrase is relevant and the website has much going for it, especially in terms of inbound links. 2. Is the keyword phrase relevant? Does the keyword phrase really match what your business does or whom it targets? Years ago, someone told me he wanted to rank for \u201ce-commerce.\u201d It never occurred to him that this term might be a little broad. In a case like this, he should have considered \u201ce-commerce\u201d as part of a keyword phrase, like \u201ce-commerce solution provider.\u201d Remember, though, that the keywords you choose must look like a natural part of what you\u2019re writing. Also, keep in mind that spelling can make a difference. \u201cSwing set\u201d may be the preferred term for playground equipment, but many people search for \u201cswingset.\u201d You don\u2019t want to use the \u201cwrong\u201d word and appear like you can\u2019t spell correctly. (Though with something as common as \u201cswing set,\u201d you could probably go with a version on one page and another spelling on a different page.) 3. Are we buying this keyword phrase through paid search? Paid search, including buying ads on Google, is another source of keyword research that your company may already have on hand. But many companies settle for performance from paid search and skip SEO to their detriment. If you\u2019re buying a keyword for paid search, you ought to make sure it\u2019s also a viable candidate for SEO and content marketing. For example, a large specialty retailer may invest in the keyword \u201cGE dishwasher.\u201d If it\u2019s working because the paid search conversions are acceptable, then it may also be worth pursuing with SEO. How do we target keywords? Now that we know what targeted keywords are, how do we come up some? Initial List First, start by making a list of all the words and phrases that apply to your business. This list should include services, products, geographic areas served, target markets and industries, and any other phrases you can think of. Test Searches Next, put yourself in your customer\u2019s shoes and begin to perform actual Google searches on your starter keyword list. Note the results that you get for each phrase. How many results came up? Were the first page results close to what you would be looking for if you were looking for a business like yours? If not, then think about how you would revise the search and note the new search. Refine You can usually eliminate single words that are vague and not specific to you and your industry. For instance, for The Social Media Hat, a search on \u201csocial media\u201d is too vague. We would want to target \u201csocial media news\u201d or \u201csocial media marketing.\u201d You can also eliminate your business name. Your website should mention your business name often enough that it will automatically be the first result on any searches, without you actually targeting that phrase. Use singular words only, no plural, and do not use periods or special characters. You should now have a list of actual search phrases that your potential customers might use. Competitive Analysis Next, go back through the list and do another Google search. This time, look at the number of results again, and also note the other businesses and competition that come up for each keyword phrase. Do you get millions of results? Are there pages and pages of competitors listed? If so, you may want to consider leaving this phrase out of your targeted list. That doesn\u2019t mean your site won\u2019t come up in searches for this phrase, and that you can\u2019t use the phrase within your site; it just means we aren\u2019t going to target this phrase, in the hope that by targeted other, less-competitive phrases, our efforts might pay off more. Taking The Social Media Hat as an example again, \u201csocial media company\u201d receives over 2 billion results in a Google search, and is flush with other social media marketing companies. To be competitive, we should refine the search further and target a less competitive keyword phrase. ",
