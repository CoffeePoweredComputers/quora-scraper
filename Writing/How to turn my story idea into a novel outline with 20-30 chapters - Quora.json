            "answer_text": "What I do is write a description of the story in narrative form, as if I\u2019m telling you about my book. I write it as an outline without any indentations. It\u2019s just a list of bullet statements, like this\u2026 John and Scott meet on the sidewalk in front of Sara\u2019s apartment.John tells Scott that he intends to marry Sara.Scott gets very angry and says he\u2019s going to hire an alien to transport his sorry ass to another planet.Scott takes out his phone and calls his alien friend.Twenty minutes later a spaceship lands in the parking lot across the street.An alien comes out of the spaceship and kicks Scott\u2019s ass instead of John\u2019s.Sara watched it happen from her window.Sara feels sorry for Scott for getting his ass kicked by the alien and falls in love with Scott.You get the idea. Each sentence tells one single element of the story. By telling the story this way, with it broken up into bullet points, it\u2019s very easy to drag one element to some other location in the story\u2014just drag and drop. After I\u2019ve written the outline like this, I go back and add \u201c(POV)\u201d at the end of a sentence where the point of view changes. This helps me find the right places to insert scene changes or chapter breaks. Once this is finished, in my last book, I sent the outline off to a developmental editor who helped me polish the story\u2019s arc. Once that\u2019s done, I start writing. I delete statements from the outline once I\u2019ve written the story that covers that single element. I write, delete it from the outline, and write some more. Sometimes I\u2019ll skip an element and highlight it with a note for how I want to change it. I tend to prefer working back and forth from the outline to the narrative. ",

            "answer_text": "First, create a list of what you need to include in the novel to tell your story. List things such as: How does the story begin? What is the climax? How do the main characters get from the beginning to the climax? What happens to them after the climax? Anything? What background information do the readers need to know about the main characters so they understand a bit of why the characters do what they do? Why do the main characters do what they do? What would be an interesting way of giving that background information within the flow of the plot without much interruption? After that list is made, create a plot line and put the events and info on the most interesting and logical places on that plot line. That\u2019s your outline. Let the outline and the anticipated attention span of your audience tell you how many chapters you need. Section the plot line into chapters\u2014keep this fluid and changeable. Then write. ",

            "answer_text": "If it\u2019s a novel, just do some basic outlining of the storyline and characters on some index cards \u2014 and then get cracking on the writeup. Go straight into writing up the first draft. Write it to completeness or near-completeness first. Don\u2019t agonise over details like spelling, grammar, phraseology, etc \u2014 those things you pick up later in the revisions, updates and editing. Once you have your first draft in near-complete form sitting in front of your eyeballs, then you\u2019ll know what kind of revisions, updates, restructurings, corrections, etc, you\u2019ll need for it. Or whether it really does need the full monty of 20 to 30 chapters. ",

            "answer_text": "Write it. Go old school and brainstorm your topic. Do research, determine what you want to talk about and breakdown each subtopic in bite-sized pieces. You should be able to pull a minimum 3 supporting points you want to cover within each chapter (topic). Once you've determine the supporting points, break those down further into topic sentences, this will help with starting each point once you begin to piece it altogether. If you're writing fiction with characters, determine the goal/motive/conflict of each character, do research on the setting, determine your theme and create a backstory for each character. This will assist with developing your plot and building your story arc. It's not an unattainable feat, you just have to put in the work and commit. ",

Pick any number of novels by different writers and you\u2019ll see the Chapters are all different in length and topic. These issues are probably done in post. Good luck in your project. ",

Then I\u2019d put together a list of signicant characters in the story, and develop profiles of each of those characters, with as much detail as possible. Even if some of that detail doesn't make it into the story, it will spawn ideas for outline sections. But, ultimately, it's all about the writing. You can revise as you go; drop, combine, or add characters and their profiles; reorder sections; and so on. Good luck. ",
