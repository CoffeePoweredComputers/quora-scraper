            "answer_text": "The sort of slip of the tongue or pen that you have described actually meets the classic definition of a Malapropism:   the use of an incorrect word in place of a word with a similar sound, resulting in a nonsensical, often humorous utterance. An example is Yogi Berra's statement: \"Texas has a lot of electrical votes,\" rather than \"electoral votes\". The word malapropism comes ultimately from the French mal \u00e0 propos meaning \"inappropriate\" via \"Mrs. Malaprop\", a character in the Richard Brinsley Sheridan comedy The Rivals (1775) who habitually misused her words. Dogberryism comes from \"Officer Dogberry\", the name of a character in the William Shakespeare play Much Ado About Nothing.  These are the two best-known fictional characters who made this kind of  error\u2014there are many other examples. Malapropisms also occur as errors in natural speech. Malapropisms are often the subject of media  attention, especially when made by politicians or other prominent  individuals.[1] One form of malaropism is sometimes called a Freudian slip or parapraxis  named after Sigmund Freud, who, in his 1901 book The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, described and analyzed a large number of seemingly trivial, bizarre, or nonsensical errors and slips. [2] Another is catachresis, one meaning of which is:  Replacing an expected word with another, half rhyming word, with an entirely different meaning from what one would expect. Example: \"I'm ravished!\" for \"I'm ravenous!\" or for \"I'm famished!\" \"They build a horse\" instead of they build a house.
