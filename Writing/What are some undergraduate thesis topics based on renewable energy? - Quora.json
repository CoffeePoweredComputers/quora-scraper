            "answer_text": "Dark, Start by mindmapping the topic of Renewable Energy. I\u2019ll show it as an outline here, but I use the pictographs whenever possible. Renewable Engergy Bio FuelsGarbageCollectingProcessingReusing cooking oilNuclearBreeder reactorsReactorsLocatingdisposing wasteElectricalWindLocating wind farmsimpacts to wild lifeReliabilityEfficiencySolarLocating solar collectorsPV or heat collectionsMaterials for collectorselectrical storageWaterHydro-electric damsSelecting locations for damsTidal energySo, do you find anything interesting in any of these topics? What other areas do you find interesting? If you\u2019re interested on the impacts of wind farms on humans, your research question could become \u201cWhat are the health impacts to people who live near wind farms?\u201d For a hydro-electric project, \u201cHow can we improve efficiencies on micro-hydro-electric dams?\u201d Solar, \u201cWhat is the optimal temperature for batteries to ensure their longevity and maximum useful power? (This has an interesting optimization function!) Look for connections between an area of renewables and something else that interests you. Remember that you will need to make the thesis very focused or it will be way too long. Good luck! ",
