            "answer_text": "Dear Veronica, I know you\u2019ve heard of coronavirus. Normally, it\u2019s a virus that causes the common cold. You\u2019ve gone through that hundreds of times before (the cold caused by this coronavirus), so it\u2019s no big deal, right? Sure. But what\u2019s about to invade the world, including your country, will be anything but \u201cno big deal.\u201d In fact, it\u2019s going to be a VERY big deal. You\u2019ll learn lots of things, both good and bad, during the next several months. First off, you\u2019ll learn what you can deal with. I know that you\u2019re a walker. I\u2019ve seen you\u2014walking fast for exercise in the parks in the evenings. It\u2019s been fun, hasn\u2019t it? You see dogs walking their owners, pet cute, furry felines you see walking the streets in the adjoining neighborhoods, and gaze up at the sky, feeling the nice, cold air that comes in the wintertime. I know that you also like eating out. Whether it\u2019s been fast food (not healthy, BTW), Chinese, Italian, or seafood, you\u2019ve enjoyed a good meal out because you like the food, the atmosphere, and the people. Yes, these are great activities, so I would tell you right now to enjoy them (and the other activities you do) while you still can, because you\u2019re about to enter the stay-at-home period. I know you like being out and about, doing things, but you\u2019ll need to stay in because of this virus that is 100 times worse than the coronavirus that\u2019s made you sick for a few days. And it won\u2019t be just you but everyone else, too. \u201cIt\u2019s for your own good,\u201d as someone\u2019s mom might say. Yes\u2014and it\u2019s true. But I know you\u2019ll do it. You know why? Because you\u2019ve always been one to follow rules, and because you also care about not getting infected and possibly infecting others. That doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t go out (you\u2019ll have to and only for necessities), but when you do, you\u2019ll be the careful, diligent Veronica you\u2019ve always been and put on a mask to protect yourself and others. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll do and will expect others to do the same. Another thing I\u2019ve noticed about you is how idealistic you are; you expect that the people you meet will be good people (and most of them are) and act decently. That\u2019s a great thing to be, Veronica, but you\u2019re about to be sorely disappointed. You\u2019ll be upset to read about people protesting and deliberately disobeying orders to put on masks and stay home because they believe it\u2019s an \u201cattack\u201d on their \u201cfreedom.\u201d Even more devastating, you\u2019ll find out that your own leaders, at the state and federal level, will absolutely screw up their response to the coming pandemic. It was like your dad believed\u2014people aren\u2019t always nice or caring. He was right, to a point: people can be ignorant, corrupt, uncaring, and downright cruel. But still, you\u2019ll see many more people who care about what\u2019s happening and will do what they can for others, like making masks, social distancing, make adjustments in how they work, shop, and eat, and otherwise make things safer for all of us. Hey, I know that you\u2019re a reader, so while you\u2019re indoors, why don\u2019t you read up more on this new disease? Read up on what it does. Read about what precautions people really need to take. Read about the nature of it. Read about the history of pandemics and how people handled them then. And read about things that aren\u2019t related to the new disease. Reread some of your old books! Plus, if you want to really make a change, you should volunteer for virtual phone banks and call up voters to encourage them to vote. This is a presidential election year, so this is your chance to make a difference. Plus, I know you\u2019ve done this before, so continue with your belief in being part of the solution instead of being part of the problem. Why don\u2019t you also use the downtime you\u2019re about to enter to just think and contemplate? Yeah, I know\u2014you already do that. But you\u2019re about to do even more of it. You\u2019ll order and read a couple of books written by a wise Quoran. Because of her words, you\u2019ll learn things about yourself and life that you never thought of before; some of it will be uplifting and reassuring and some will be uncomfortable. In the process, you\u2019ll have time to think about who you really are and what you really want. Seriously, this will be a great time to ensconce yourself in quiet and hear your own voice rather than the voices of people who have thought they know you and therefore, tried to tell you how to live according to their standards. This time, you can listen to yourself. But still, it\u2019s not going to be all peaches and cream. In addition to what I\u2019ve just said about people politicizing the pandemic, you\u2019ll have feelings about staying in, ranging from feeling safe to just wanting to get out. Hey, that\u2019s okay, Veronica. It\u2019s normal to feel that way, You\u2019re only human. Look, this pandemic won\u2019t be easy on anybody. Lots of adjustments and changes will have to be made, and mistakes will be made. And, sadly, people will die\u2014thousands of them. It will be a very trying time, indeed. So do your part to stay safe. Protect yourself and others. Hang in there. You can\u2019t predict what\u2019ll happen\u2014no one can\u2014but you can do things now. Take it day by day, and hopefully, we\u2019ll get through this. Take care! \u2014Veronica from July 2020 ",

            "answer_text": "Hey you! Just wanted to let you know that it\u2019s okay to see the bright side. It\u2019s okay to count it as a blessing. You\u2019re about to go through the most insane ride of your life - and that\u2019s kind of saying something after last year. You\u2019ll be fine, and you\u2019ll be able to see the small miracles and big ones too. You\u2019re going to spend most of the spring and summer wondering if you have a brain tumor or another disease - you don\u2019t, just so you know - and you\u2019re going to get a diagnosis for health issues that have plagued you since you were a teenager. You\u2019ll gain a new appreciation for your husband as you navigate a pandemic together. You\u2019ll feel like such a team as you hunt for groceries and make meal plans and stretch resources in the early days when grocery stores are emptying. You\u2019ll watch the Lord provide for you financially; you\u2019ll see so many answers to prayer; you\u2019ll find so many positives that you will have to actually fake complaining in sympathy with those who are troubled. You\u2019ll see the good God does even through things intended for evil. You\u2019ll become comfortable, confident, and dedicated in a classy range of masks\u2026 and you\u2019ll feel isolated, not by staying home or wearing a mask in the library, but by the ridicule you\u2019d get through it \u201cif people knew you drank the liberal kool-aid\u201d. God will give you a stack of memories a mile high, so many that you\u2019ll fill a whole journal. You\u2019ll stop and smell the roses, literally, as you finally get to that gardening. You\u2019ll finally be able to manage the clutter and finish eliminating. You\u2019ll sleep more and eat more and watch God make your body heal. And you\u2019ll lose friends. You\u2019ll cry when the contractor fixing your sink mentions some of the difficult outcomes of a pandemic, because someone out there understands the tension and the drama you\u2019re going through. You\u2019ll know over and over that you\u2019re doing the right thing, and God controls your path and your outcome\u2026 oh, and the re-connections and friendships and bonds you\u2019ll form will make up for the loss. You\u2019ll see things happen that seem horrible at the time, but end up being \u201cmeant to be\u201d and answers to prayer. So dust off your waterproof mascara, lay a towel on your husband\u2019s shoulder for all the crying he\u2019s going to hold you up through, and print that blessing journal you\u2019ll create a few months in\u2026 because you\u2019re not going to be able to write fast enough as the Lord grows you, your children, your marriage, and your home. Oh, and by the way? Don\u2019t worry; all the things your gut tells you, science will say later. You\u2019re not insane. Stay home, mask up, and don\u2019t worry\u2026 you\u2019ll be able to find hand sanitizer, and toilet paper. God is good, all the time. ",
