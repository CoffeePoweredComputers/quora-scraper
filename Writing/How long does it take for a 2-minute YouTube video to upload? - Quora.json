            "answer_text": "YouTube doesn\u2019t mandate a particular bitrate for uploads, so the file could be any number of bits, and it doesn\u2019t mandate any particular upload speed either. So, it\u2019s impossible to say precisely, but we can look at two extreme scenarios to get a range: Let\u2019s consider someone uploading via Internet II backbone at 100 Gbps and they are uploading 2 minutes of 360p video encoded at 1 Mbps. That\u2019s 120 megabits / 100 gigabits per second: that\u2019d Be about 0.0012 seconds to upload. Now, let\u2019s consider someone uploading by 1200 baud modem dial up a 4K UHD v\u00eddeo encoded at 45 Mbps. That would be 5.4 gigabits / 1200 bits per second. That would take 3.75 billion seconds, or about 119 years. So, it takes between 0.0012 seconds and 119 years to upload a 2 minute YouTube video, depending on the video bitrate and speed of your Internet connection. ",

The faster internet speed the faster uploading process, and the smaller video file size the faster uploading process too. for example, a 2-min long 4K video may several GB, a 2-min long 1080P video may few or several hundreds MB. obviously, the large video file will take much more longer time. usually I upload 2-min long 1080p video on YouTube with our fast internet, just several mins.
