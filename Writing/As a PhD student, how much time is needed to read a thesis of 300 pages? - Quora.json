            "answer_text": "Assuming that I was fairly proficient on the subject matter Kristina Ku\u010danda's guesstimate of 3 days sounds pretty accurate.  My advisor went through my 8 chapter thesis of 200 pages at a rate of 2 chapters/day with grammatical revisions. Which means, that he actually read and upstood the subject matter. A 300 page thesis is roughly the length of 4-8 research articles + supplemental information. Furthermore, it is likely to be well written and revised if you're reading a completed thesis and not a draft. Given that I would routinely go through ~3-5 papers a day, going through a 300 page thesis with great detail in a few days sounds reasonably possible if I was forced to do so.  Currently as a peer reviewer, 100 pages a day sounds like a realistic pace (in my field). ",

Especially given that the first couple of chapters of a thesis are going to be introductory and you'll probably know all that stuff anyway or could get it from somewhere else more easily. If I wanted to read and get the gist of the proofs in a thesis, maybe a couple of days. A week if I had to translate it from French first (this happens to me more than you'd think). If I just wanted to skim through the theorems, then maybe an hour. If I really wanted to understand it in depth, then it could take between a week and a couple of months, depending on how good my background in that area is. ",

One of them is the subject matter - I\u2019m sure I can read a history paper in a lot less time than I could read a math paper of the same length (and that assumes that the math paper is in the same area as my own doctoral thesis). I know that I read mathematics far more slowly than I read English language text - in order to understand a statement you have to be able to read formulae and equations almost character by character. And you\u2019ll often find yourself having to digress by reading other papers in order to understand a technique or theorem that the author of the paper you\u2019re reading used. While I can easily read a three hundred page novel in a couple of days I can\u2019t say the same about a mathematics text. ",

Do you think you'll understand anything by just reading it? Then maybe you rather have to study it. I feel that right now instead of 'reading' it, start to understand what he is talking about. Read the abstract then look at the literature review see what he's talking about then look at how he set up the chapter and start reading papers from literature review. Of course, my wording here as 'reading' rather contributes to studying those papers. If you think, you are capable of understanding the thesis, now you can start. However, you can't just read a thesis. This is a waste of time. Take notes, prepare yourself a reminder document that you can go back and see what you have read. If you do a great job, you'll be able to understand within a week.My advice? Don't read the whole thesis. I'm sure there are parts you can use, and parts that are complete trash for you. Save your time. Time is important. Good luck! ",
