            "answer_text": "To approach a Top 10 US publisher (the Big 5 + 3 independents + 2 non-fiction presses), you will pretty much need a literary agent. (There are a few open submission times, but I can\u2019t remember the last time I heard about a deal coming about this way). There are lots of good threads on how to get a literary agent here, but one thing I would caution, before querying them, is to not just have finished writing a manuscript. You want that ms to have gone through at least a few drafts steered by your own revision process, which should include putting it away in a cyber drawer for a time, coming back to it, then doing this again (and again). You want it to be copy edited for smooth, typo-free copy. And you want some independent readers to have given you honest, thoughtful, critical feedback\u2014the more the better\u2014and then, after a period of time to consider it all, to have gone back to the ms and incorporated everything you decided would make the book better. You can ask for independent reads from friends and family, as long as they will be HONEST, and you can also find book clubs and ask if they\u2019ll tear into\u2014and tear apart\u2014your ms, perhaps with a few boxes of doughnuts or bottles of wine for enticement and thanks for the great service they\u2019ll be giving you. Yes, of letting you do yet more work\u2026but also having the consequently best chance of success once you do start querying agents. Finally, you can join a writers group and trade reads\u2014either IRL or online\u2014although proceed with caution because sometimes writers read a ms as a writer and not as a reader, which can be both a good and a bad thing. Once you have readers telling you they stayed up all night reading your ms\u2026congratulations! You are now ready to find the right agents and start sending out targeted queries. Good luck! ",

What happens if both of \u2019em say \u201cWe love it!\u201d and you have to say \u201cUh, well, someone else wants to buy it, too?\u201d You can end up pissing off both publishers and losing out with both of them AND get your name informally listed as a PITA. Send it to one publisher at a time, get a clear acceptance or rejection, and then and only then move on to the next publisher if necessary. Multiple submissions should only be done by an agent at their discretion because they know how to do it. ",
