            "answer_text": "The \u201c10,000 hours\u201d idea stems from a literal translation of a Chinese saying. In Chinese, they say \u201c10,000\u201d to mean \u201ca lot.\u201d It\u2019s a metaphor. So everyone should just stop chasing this 10,000 hour number. Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 Hour Rule is Proven Bunk \u201cDoes Gladwell admit there are masters of certain skills that do not need 10,000 hours?\u201d But, back to Gladwell, his understanding of the rule is based on cognitively demanding fields. So, yes. In this article, Gladwell acknowledges that 10,000 hours is the average. So, the Chinese were right: we\u2019re talking about a lot of hours. If you\u2019re looking for an approximate order of magnitude, sure, let\u2019s go with 10,000 (4 to be precise), but to think that expertise requires close to 10,000 hours? Hogwash. This may or may not be relevant to you: If you want to be good at something, practice every day, evaluate your results carefully, embrace incremental gains, don\u2019t take your failures personally, and have an idea where you want to go. Focus inside your practice; don\u2019t focus outside at some arbitrary number of hours spent practising. ",
