            "answer_text": "For the most part, authors were paid by the piece, not the word. There\u2019s a persistent myth that Dickens, for example, wrote a lot because he was paid by the word or line. He was, rather, paid by installment as his novels were typically published serially, chapter by chapter, so either way he got paid more for writing more, but he\u2019d get more for writing more chapters rather than longer ones. That said, the 19th century, particularly the later part of the century, saw the rise of popular publishing and therefore a demand for authors to fill the space, and systems of paying authors by the word, which persist to this day in periodicals, began to appear along with modern royalty payments for longer works.
