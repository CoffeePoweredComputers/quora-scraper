            "answer_text": "One hundred pages makes the work something called a Novella. It is longer than the longest short story but under the 150-pages that begins to take-on the actual status regarded as Novel. Yes - you can write a 100-page novel. First off, have a story in mind. Second, research the topic so that you can reflect the accepted reality of the topic ( or choose to go opposite to it, for effect). Third, novellas and shorter novels are quite often character driven and so you really need to design your characters, right down to their very names. Names mean specific things, and the entire world has a collective consciousness that will know a character, immediately, from the name itself. The great thing about novellas is that often you can serialize it just because your characters hit the mark one hundred percent, and like real people, will have a thousand stories that could be attributed to that person. Write the 100-page simply. Usually this is accomplished using the Three Act, and Epilogue structure. Act One introduces the primary character(s) and the main crisis point within the story. Act Two follows one or two of the primary players in their attempt to find a resolution to that established crisis point. Act Three is the resolution to the main crisis point, weaving into the resolution the several minor crisis that move the story forward. The Epilogue will tie-together everything into some solution that was being sought by the primary character(s). All of this can be accomplished within about ten chapters, allowing for the story to take-on the form of a novel. If you design your entire story properly and cover all the details, you will not only be able to be specific for each chapter but make them such that when you are finally writing the story you will know exactly what you will set down on each page of the book. If you can get to this state then you have created your own formula and crank out novellas quickly. It is not unusual with finding your own formula that you could write a 100-page novella every week. If you develop this work into a serial with some running thread, then it would be possible to stitch together a full sized, 500 to 600-page novel (or longer) which has to do with the same characters. The whole idea is to design all the details of the story and the writing will be easier. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe in you! I say go for it. However, whether or not the novel will be marketable is a whole different subject. If your primary/native language is English, and you intend to write the novel in English, I\u2019m somewhat concerned by your imprecise use of language. Successful authors write exactly what they intend to convey. It\u2019s hard work to be precise, but necessary. One of your goals should be mastery over words like \u2018can\u2019 vs. \u2018should\u2019 vs. whatever you actually meant by your question. The exact meaning of the question you wrote will be interpreted by most people to mean the same as \u2018am I capable of writing a 100 page novel?\u2019 The best person to answer that question is you. Various people on Quora would be happy to give you advice about how to set goals, make a plan or outline, etc. But since you didn\u2019t ask \u2018how can I write a 100 page novel?\u2019 the question comes off as ambiguous. Anyway, in standard format (letter-sized document pages, 1\u2033 margins, double-spaced in a 12 pt \u2018traditional\u2019 font like Courier or Times New Roman, you\u2019ll average, depending on your writing style, about 250 words a page. TNR is a bit tighter than Courier so that will affect things too. If that\u2019s the format that you use, then your word count will land right around 25,000 words. That\u2019s too short to be considered a novel, though in certain markets (YA, literary and romance come to mind) you can sell it as a novella rather than a novel, and you\u2019ll find readers who like that length of story. Other markets, like fantasy, would consider that barely beyond a short story length. Readers of longer-length genres would be unhappy even if you marketed it as a novella, and would feel less deceived about the content if you marketed it as a short story. If you sell it to a publisher, you won\u2019t have to concern yourself with how to market it, but you\u2019re going to run into some word count issues when you try to sell it. 25K is too short to be sold as a novel in today\u2019s market in just about any genre except maybe middle grade (consult someone who writes middle grade fiction for more info) and waaay too long for most magazines that buy fiction. If the work is really outstanding, it might become the keystone piece in an anthology. If you\u2019re single-spacing your work but still work in a \u2018normal\u2019 12pt font, you\u2019ll hit about 50K which is less problematical for YA and romance. YA and romance readers will probably consider that at the bottom end (in terms of length) of story length for their genre and won\u2019t complain too much if it\u2019s sold as a novel. A traditional publisher might pick it up if it\u2019s really great, and if it needs a little filling out the editor will help you with that. I think it\u2019s a great idea to try to write a novel, regardless of your page or word count goals. If you want a lot of support and a fun atmosphere, you should think about participating in Nanowrimo. Every November thousands of writers get together to write a 50K (minimum) novel. They have word count meters, stickers, a large, active forum full of people ready and willing to give you writing advice, and it\u2019s totally free. If you donate, the money goes to great causes related to access to books and education opportunities around the world. Happy writing! ",

            "answer_text": "Novel length is talked about in number of words, not number of pages. The general rule is the standard page contains 250 words, so you\u2019re talking about 25,000 words which puts your story in the novella category as seen by the publishing world. From: How Long Should Your Story Be? \u201cMicro-Fiction or short shorts (up to 100 words): This very abbreviated story is often difficult to write, and even harder to write well, but the markets for micro fiction are becoming increasingly popular in recent times. 6 word micro-story: \"For Sale: Baby shoes. Never Worn.\" - Attributed to Ernest Hemingway Flash Fiction (100 - 1,000 words): This is the type of short-short story you would expect to find in a glossy magazine, often used to fill one page of quick romance (or quick humor, in men's mags) Very popular, still not easy to write, and not easy to sell. Short Story (1,000 - 7,500 words): The 'regular' short story, usually found in periodicals or anthology collections. Most 'genre' zines will features works at this length. Novellette (7,500 - 20,000 words): Often a novellette-length work is difficult to sell to a publisher. It is considered too long for most publishers to insert comfortably into a magazine, yet too short for a novel. Generally, authors will piece together three or four novellette-length works into a compilation novel. Novella (20,000 - 50,000 words): Although most print publishers will balk at printing a novel this short, this is almost perfect for the electronic publishing market length. The online audience doesn't always have the time or the patience to sit through a 100,000 word novel. Alternatively, this is an acceptable length for a short work of non-fiction. Novel (50,000 -110,000 words): Most print publishers prefer a minimum word count of around 70,000 words for a first novel, and some even hesitate for any work shorter than 80,000. Yet any piece of fiction climbing over the 110,000 word mark also tends to give editors some pause. They need to be sure they can produce a product that won't over-extend their budget, but still be enticing enough to readers to be saleable. Imagine paying good money for a book less than a quarter-inch thick? Epics and Sequels (Over 110,000 words): If your story extends too far over the 110,000 mark, perhaps consider where you could either condense the story to only include relevant details, or lengthen it to span out into a sequel, or perhaps even a trilogy. (Unless, of course, you're Stephen King - then it doesn't matter what length your manuscript is - a publisher is a little more lenient with an established author who has a well-established readership.)\u201d ",

It contains something like 17500 to 40000 words. You can write whatever you want on the face of this charming earth, yet if you do write a 100 page manuscript label it novella, it sounds sexier yet distinctive than the regular term novel.

I would'nt say it was perfecit actually it was pretty it was childish. But i remember spending my entire day locked up in my room writing pages after pages. It was the only thing i thought about. I never did my homework never studied for my exams it was always the story inside my head. But you know what i could'nt even write more than one page after that. Yeah i write poems sometimes but that\u2019s just 15- 20 lines. Life happened after that. I keep asking myself if i'm really that good. I write one paragraph and think that its rubbish. I keep telling myself i'm gonna write some other day when i get really good at this or after i start earning some money. But when will i get really good without ever trying? If a 12 year can do that why cant us. Yes i had a lot more time back then but the thing is if you really want something you can find time for it. You dont have to start by writing 100 page, you can start by writing half page a day then increase it to one then two according to your schedule. Thats what i'm doing now :-) writing answers on quora, writing for all the contests i can manage, writing book reviews, small essays pushing myself.. I want to find that old determined girl i lost somewhere while i was busy living. ",

Heck, even my little brother can if I force him to write one page per day. There is a huge difference between 100 pages of worthless content and 100 pages of entertaining composition. Just like those essays you write to your teachers. Are you writing to BS and fill up the page limits or are you writing to articulate your creativity and imagination? The less pages you need to proficiently explain your plot development, character and world building, the greater of a writer you are. Personally, I think that is what separates from an amateur writer to a genius novelist. ",

Most anyone can write 100 pages about something, but, whether it is worth reading is the trick. Why do you want to write? What do you have to say that might interest people? Do you know how to develop a story? Have you done the work necessary to write a novella that will, you hope, sell? What is your purpose here? What motivates you? Do you want to write for pleasure or to sell your work? ",

It\u2019s dependent on font, margins, double-spaced or single space, all that. Font fraud abounds. Word count is what matters. Single-spacing in TNR 8 yields around 750 words per page. Double-spacing in New Courier 12, around 220. So if you\u2019re talking about the first format, yes, you\u2019d have around 75,000 words, a nice novel length in most genres. Not so in the second format \u2014 you\u2019d have more of a novella. ",

So, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to make a 100 page, 50,000 word document. Forget page count and focus on word count for a novel. If you want to write a book that is exactly 100 pages, write a novella or short story collection. Be wary, though. Those don\u2019t get a lot of readers. ",
