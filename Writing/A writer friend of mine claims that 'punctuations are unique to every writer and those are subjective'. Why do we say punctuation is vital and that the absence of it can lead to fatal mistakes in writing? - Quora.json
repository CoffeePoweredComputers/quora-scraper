            "answer_text": "Dick Hartzell's discussion is very much to the point. To round off the discussion, however, I would add the following observations: In some instances, punctuation marks are not expendable and are unquestionably objective (as Priyanka Das's illustrations graphically demonstrate). In other situations, they are subjective (to varying degrees), and different writers will choose to punctuate the same sentence differently\u2014and not just with regard to putting in a comma or leaving it out, but also in terms of which punctuation mark to use. Dick Hartzell's answer focused on optional commas. However, other punctuation marks are also subject to the whims and fancies of the individual writer, and not just, as I said before, in the matter of deciding whether to put them in or leave them out, but in regard to the choice of the most appropriate punctuation mark to use in a given situation. The Semicolon: The semicolon has fallen out of favour in recent times and most contemporary writers shy away from using it. However, some writers still do\u2014and the choice, in this case, is between the semicolon and the full stop (or \"period\" in American English).  Here is an example: Some of the campers set off for the mountains to the north; the others headed for the lake to the southwest.Some of the campers set off for the mountains to the north. The others headed for the lake to the southwest.The writer who chooses to use the semicolon sees the two \"facts\" about the two sets of campers as part of single idea and therefore as worthy of being part of the same sentence. The writer who chooses to use the full stop sees the two \"facts\" as separate and therefore as deserving to be placed in separate sentences. Some writers may not even be aware of the distinction and may simply use the full stop, thinking that it is their only option. It is in this sense that punctuation is subjective. The Exclamation Mark: This is another punctuation mark that has fallen out of favour with many contemporary writers. This is largely because style guides and books on writing and English usage in recent times have discouraged its use. However, by the canons of traditional grammar, all exclamatory sentences must end in an exclamation mark, partly as a way of indicating that the sentence is not declarative and partly because exclamatory sentences typically do not have a finite verb and are not constructed on the usual subject + verb model. Whether a given writer chooses to follow traditional usage or the advice of contemporary writing gurus is a subjective matter. Here are some examples:  If only I could find the right word! (traditional)If only I could find the right word. (contemporary) What a fool I was to think I could change her mind! (traditional)What a fool I was to think I could change her mind. (contemporary) How stupid of me! (traditional)How stupid of me. (contemporary)Dashes vs. Parentheses vs. Commas: When incidental information is added to a sentence, it can be set off from the main sentence using either dashes or parentheses or commas. Commas are the least obtrusive and the least interruptive of the flow of the sentence. Dashes are the most obtrusive and the most interruptive. Parentheses fall somewhere in between. Commas whisper: \"You need to be aware of this information.\" Parentheses say: \"Here's something interesting\u2014take it or leave it.\" Dashes shout: \"Pay attention to me!\" As you can see, the choice of which type of punctuation to use in setting off incidental information very much depends on how the writer feels about intruding upon the reader's thoughts and what weight the writer gives to the incidental information. This is, indeed, a subjective matter. Here is an example: Roger, the only one of our athletes to make it to the finals, ended up winning the gold medal.Roger (the only one of our athletes to make it to the finals) ended up winning the gold medal.Roger\u2014the only one of our athletes to make it to the finals\u2014ended up winning the gold medal.Notice the difference in the subjective effect on the reader as he or she reads these three sentences. It is also in this sense that punctuation is subjective. That is to say, it is subjective not only from the writer's point of view, but also from that of the reader. I could go on, but I hope I have illustrated adequately the subjective nature of punctuation both in terms of the writer's choices and the subjective effect that the writer's subjective choices has on the reader.

            "answer_text": "Wolf Hall, by Hilary Mantel, had such strange punctuation that I couldn't finish it.I found it to be unreadable. Thankfully the BBC made it into a mini-series and I can watch it on TV. Here is an example of a fatal mistake in writing.If you leave out the comma in the sentence, \"Let's eat grandma\", it's assumed that you are talking to a friend and suggesting that you eat your Grandma, perhaps with a little salt and pepper and a kosher dill pickle on the side, If you put in a comma so that it reads, \"Let's eat, Grandma\",  you are asking your Grandma to have lunch with you.  Make sure that in either case you get your kosher dill pickle.   If you ever want to read a good book that addresses this, read Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation: Lynne Truss. She's very readable but makes the same point of how punctuation can change the whole meaning of a sentence. Eats, Shoots and Leaves implies that someone had a meal, shoot the chef and left. Eats Shoots & Leaves describes the diet of a panda bear. Finally, to make one more point, I must add one of my favorites. A woman, without her man, is nothing.A woman: without her, man is nothing. ",

Some of it is subjective; for example, I could have chosen to put a period after subjective in this paragraph, without changing the meaning. I could have chosen not to put a comma after paragraph. However, much of punctuation is NOT subjective. There has been a recent trend in modern \"literature\" to screw around with punctuation, presumably to be \"edgy.\" I find this trend abhorrent. I can't read novels with bizarre or missing punctuation; it drives me batty. The one novel I've finished that used this conceit (Cormac McCarthy's The Road, which I read only because I was required to for class) is my absolute least favorite novel ever. It's truly dreadful.  Even some punctuation that is often regarded as subjective is, in my opinion, clearly  objective. For example, the oxford comma, which is clearly correct:  With the oxford comma:  We invited the rhinoceri, Washington, and Lincoln.   Without the oxford comma:   We invited the rhinoceri, Washington and Lincoln.    ",

That first comma is probably the most expendable of the three: Nonetheless it is true that, especially with respect to commas, it's possible to go comma lean or comma rich.

I suppose I could consider these comma preferences \u201csubjective.\u201d Unlike the compelling examples provided by Ms. Das, whether my example sentence contains three commas, two, one, or zero doesn't materially affect its meaning. A comma-lean partisan might argue that going commaless streamlines the sentence and makes it flow faster.

I'm reading Stephen King and notice he uses a lot of italics to emphasise key words; making the reader infer extra meaning. Punctuation is always a choice regarding expression.  For example, some writers might substitute the exclamation mark ! with WORDS in caps. Some, more than others, might favour semi-colons; long sentences sometimes feature these. Older writers may prefer \"double quotation\" marks while younger writers prefer 'single' - neither matter, just be consistent. In all cases, whatever you use, aim to be understood. Remember, punctuation marks must follow convention. Failure to adhere to rules would be failure to communicate well. Otherwise, use loads of commas, or not, throw in an exclamation mark or two, experiment with font size, use ellipsis ... it's up to you. ",

So, do you have some  freedom in how you punctuate a sentence:  even so.  You have to choose  words that convey the meaning!Consider the subtle and not-so-subtle differences in meaning between [1], [2], and [3] above.  It's not just about comma placement! The differences between [1] and [2] are mostly a matter of style. [3], though... [3] is a paragraph quite different from [1] and [2].  The punctuation of [3] changes what \"choose\" means, and what it applies to; it changes what \"so\" means, and what it applies to; it creates some confusion about the writer's intent in discussing both puntuation and words, turning the sentence about punctuation into a kind of aside, rather than the main point -- a fatal mistake in writing. To paraphrase my high-school civics teacher: in writing a sentence (with respect to punctuation) you have liberty, but not freedom.  Liberty means you may act creatively, but within a set of rules.  Freedom means you can do whatever you like. ",
