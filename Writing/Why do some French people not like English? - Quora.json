            "answer_text": "The same as Julia Sudrias, our education system is not well designed for foreign languages and cultures.I understood english not too badly after high school but I was not able to communicate properly plus, as a lot of french people, I was a bit afraid to speak another language.In university, where we need it the most for job and internship chances, my level dropped because the teaching was not here to make you progress, but just to make you keep in mind what you already knew. It took me a lot of series and movies in English with french subtitle, then english subtitle, then no subtitle at all to reach an acceptable level of understanding and get my ears used to this language. And I met my girlfriend from Luxembourg, a very open country, who convinced me to do Couchsurfing when we settled together. Best way to progress when you can\u2019t leave the country. She makes me realize how a big part of France is not really open to other cultures. I don\u2019t know a lot of French who travel, do Couchsurfing, or are really interested on how life or society works in other countries. We don\u2019t have the habit to think outside our borders and, since I\u2019m french, it never strikes me before. So yes, that\u2019s not really a surprise that we are so late on this topic when we compare to other country, but I think we\u2019ll catch up with the next generation :) ",

            "answer_text": "A\u00efe ! A\u00efe ! A\u00efe ! That question it is kind of \u201ctaboo\u201d in France. For many years, not being fluent in English wasn\u2019t a real issue. For instance, look at all our former Presidents (from Sarkozy to Hollande), they were always ashaming us when they used to publicly speak in the language of Shakespeare.  My parents, born after World War II, didn\u2019t learn English at school. German was the most chosen language during that time. Even in what we call in France, the \u201cgrandes \u00e9coles\u201d, English wasn\u2019t really considered as an important skill to acquire. And even today, some cantankerous teachers in those \u201cprestigious\u201d schools resist to deliver their lessons in English. Last week, I heard a profesor from Polytechnique telling that he intended to defend francophonie by not giving courses in English\u2026 However, my generation, mostly raised by the Internet, understood the necessity to be fluent. Emmanuel Macron is, for instance, much better than all its predecessors in English. And I think that all our political and economic leaders, in a not-too-distant future, will not be as shameful as Fran\u00e7ois Hollande when it comes to deliver a speech in English ;) Hope so ! ",
