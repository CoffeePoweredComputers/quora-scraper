            "answer_text": "Yes, Pinyin is easier to learn and use. No, I don\u2019t think characters should be phased out, and Robert Matthews has given a number of good reasons. However, I do want to articulate this one, perhaps unpopular viewpoint: The number of homophones in Chinese is not, to me, a very strong argument against phasing out characters. The reason is that people speak Chinese every day and understand each other perfectly well without any characters to distinguish those homophones. So if you can understand it when it is spoken, you can understand it in Pinyin. Yes, we can craft stories (\u77f3\u5ba4\u8bd7\u58eb\u2026) that are incomprehensible from their phonetic transcriptions. But if that is the case, then it would also be incomprehensible if you read it aloud. Ditching the characters would not impede anyone\u2019s ability to clearly communicate their thoughts, because if you can say them clearly then you can also write them clearly in Pinyin. If it\u2019s unclear from the Pinyin, then there\u2019s clearly a better way to say it.  What people are really getting at with the homophone argument, I think, is that the characters allow for intricate wordplay and artful poetry that would be more difficult with phonetic spelling\u2014and we shouldn\u2019t dismiss the value of such things. I would just stress that the argument for keeping the characters is really a cultural one: Chinese writing is integral to Chinese culture, and to dispense with it would irreversibly change Chinese calligraphy, poetry and art, just to name a few. Compared to those, the occasional ambiguous homophone is a drop in the bucket. ",

Source: CC--(status unclear) Herjia Huanleh Jyishyang Ruyih, from http://capl .washjeff.edu 2547]  Yes, romanization was/is easier for illiterate peasants in the 1930s, modern 1st graders and foreigners beginning to learn Chinese, but forcing all Chinese to only use Hanyu Pinyin would create deep cultural wounds. Romanization is a useful tool for two groups of people: (1) Chinese and foreigners who want to input characters on their computer / tablet / smartphone or who want to look up the pronunciation and meaning of unfamiliar characters. (2) Foreigners who don\u2019t know any Chinese but need to identify people, places and things associated with China and Chinese culture (news reports, official documents, encyclopedia entries etc.) If all Chinese were forced to use pinyin only, there would be several undesirable consequences. I can think of a few off the top of my head, but I\u2019m sure fellow Quorans can come up with more: (1) A loss of cultural unity: dialect areas would adopt their own local, incompatible forms of romanization. Phonetic drift would make old spellings progressively harder to interpret. (2) Many forms of art would disappear: no more calligraphic scrolls or spring couplets (on doors, for example) (3) Classical literature and poetry would only be available in anemic translations (4) Because graphic riddles (involving the decomposition of characters) would no longer be possible, Chinese people would lose a unique form of mental gymnastics. (5) Large numbers of people with different-looking but phonetically similar names would lose their individuality, causing inconvenience and confusion. And so on ... Imposing a Pinyin-only orthography would result in a watered-down version of Chinese culture. Making life easier for foreigners with minimal Chinese skills would have unacceptable consequences for the vast majority of Chinese people.
