            "answer_text": "In every country there are agencies that work with writers.  I don\u2019t know where you live, but that would be the most productive approach. Find a film/literary agent and submit your work to them, then  with their assistance submit to producers. (directors you would reach through their agents). You can also try, as others have suggested, to write a query letter to the head of development, agents, or directors, and on extremely rare occasions that does get someone\u2019s attention. In addition, there are a few internet based services that have had some success getting new writers work purchased and even made.  The two best known are INKTIP,  and THE BLACK LIST Where filmmakers & writers meet. Both cost money to post material or to communicate with producers.  You can also go to pitch festivals.  People come from all over the world to meet and pitch to producers, agents, managers at The Great American PitchFest - ScriptFest. And then there are a few open source markets like Amazon Studios where anyone can submit material and if Amazon loves it, they will make it. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends who they are. If they\u2019re well known you can try to reach them directly but you\u2019ll probably be writing to their agent, manager or lawyer who will want to know who you are and what you\u2019ve done. That\u2019s their job, to sort through inquires to their client and make sure her or his time is not being wasted. If they\u2019re not well known do some deep digging and see how you can track them down and write them a short, email telling them why you are writing and attaching a one page summary of your script which you should have registered at Writers Guild of America which you can do online from anywhere in the world for small fee.
