            "answer_text": "It depends how badly you want to get it out there. You could employ a Ghost Writer. I\u2019ve never ghost written personally, but I believe it works like this: you sit with the writer and tell them your story verbally, or I guess you could record it. Then they write the book for you. You\u2019ll often find celebrities do this, with the main credit going to them (to sell the book) and a much smaller credit to the writer - E.G. \u201cwith xxx xxx\u201d . I have no clue how much this would cost. ",

You may not be sure about writing a story, poem, or a book, but all that can be learned. Just sit down and do it. Write about anything \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter what. There are plenty of writing prompts online. Use them. ",
