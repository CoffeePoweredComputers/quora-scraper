            "answer_text": "I'm a confessed sequelholic.  I love sequels.  I love the idea of sequels.  I love the idea of possibly ever writing a sequel to one of my favorite movies (And lived out that dream SOMEWHAT with my Rambo V pitch and spec script I had in the hands of the powers that be, to no avail in the end sadly).   Unfortunately, most sequels are bad.  Only a handful live up to or exceed their originals.   So with that said, here's some of my dream list...    This should have been a huge franchise.  The action, the humor, the cast, etc.  Sadly, the film was made by James Cameron, and as most know, he only makes one film every few or more years.  And a True Lies sequel without Cameron just wouldn't be worth it.     When in first debuted, it was a modest hit and often mocked.  As time went by, it has grown in stature as one of the best action films out there.  A sequel was in play for a number of years and now a remake is being developed. What would the sequel be about?   Johnny Utah is working undercover for the LAPD now.  He's down and out, likely more interested in living life on the waves and still disgruntled over his experiences in the FBI, until one day they come calling.  Reports have surfaced that some bank robberies have been plaguing Colorado.  \"So what's that have to do with me?\" asks Utah.  Seemingly, the ex presidents are culprits.  \"The ex presidents?  You mean the bank robbers that have been dead for X years?\"  The FBI agent then throws down a surveillance picture... of Bodhi (Patrick Swayze), alive.  He survived the wave in Australia and is now rumored to be climbing the Rocky Mountains' most difficult cliffs.  They want Utah to find him.  And it turns out that Bodhi started robbing banks again with the same MO in order to draw Utah out so they can once again go face to face.   So instead of surfing, Utah must breach the hardcore thrill seeking rock climbing community.  If you remember, when Utah is in Bodhi's room, there's a picture of Bodhi doing a hardcore rock climb.  That's the sequel I wanted.   Sadly, Patrick Swayze is gone.      This is my one cheat.  I know there have been Predator sequels.  But what I wanted was a Predator with Arnold sequel to follow the original. What would the sequel be about?  Dutch (Arnold) is asked back into the jungle to act as government bait for more Predator encounters so the government can research their war tech.  When he balks, the powers that be reveal that they anticipated such a decision and have sent a protege of his (Perhaps setting that up early in the film) and placed him in hot territory as bait.  Dutch is sent back in to track his protege and his team, only to discover that they've been attacked already.  Each of the team were handpicked to draw the Predators in.  Most are dead.  Some have survived.  Leading Dutch to his protege and a fight for survival as multiple Predators appear to hunt down the one human they couldn't kill.  The ultimate trophy.     No real story to offer here.  I just thought that since Rambo had four films, Commando himself should have had his franchise as well.  He almost did actually, but the sequel script eventually turned into Die Hard.       I was, and maybe still am, obsessed with the original Red Dawn growing up.  I wanted to see the next chapter.  I always thought that maybe, just maybe, one of the brothers could have survived.  Even when I watch the film now, as they are sitting on the swing, older brother holding young brother, I'm watching the breath in the cold air, seeing if there was any hope that either survived.  Sadly, it looked like the younger brother (Charlie Sheen) took his last breath.  But Jed was still breathing.  I have no clue what the story would be, but I continue to think about that world they set up.  What happened?  How did the country end up?  It's an amazing film.  They remake is horrible for the most part.      What would the sequel be about?  Can you imagine?  Natalie Portman back as cold blooded Matilda?!  Enough said.  I'd write it today.  And I'd write the shit out of it.      To me, Stargate was a brilliant sci-fi film.  Conceptually, it was excellent and set up some great mythos to explore in further sequels.  I know of the many episodes of the television series and its spin-offs.  I don't really care for them that much.  I wanted more Kurt Russell.  I wanted more James Spader.  It ALMOST happened.  And more recently than you think.  They were going to still make direct sequel and basically ignore the TV series.   What would the sequel be about?  They'd go back and get Jackson because Colonel O'Neill has been gate jumping, searching for revenge for a fallen comrade at the hands of a much more deadly foe.  Jackson must track O'Neill's travels through various planets, leading to the realization that O'Neill is trying to stop an alien race from invading Earth.  Together they must outwit and fight the enemy, with some new found allies.      Another Emmerich property that should have had a sequel.  While the movie is somewhat dated by today's standards, it would be fascinating to see a rebuilding Earth come under fire again.   A sequel is actually being planned already by Emmerich.  Although according to him, Will Smith won't be in it because he's too big now.      They cliffhanger ending always engaged me further.  I have no clue what they story would have been, but it would have been cool to see a recovery team come to the outpost and shit hits the fan.  And then we'd see who had been the alien and who had been the last survivor.  Of course, the reveal would have MacReady (Kurt Russell) the apparent survivor until the last minute where he would turn.      Jack Burton returns!  This time we'd see Jack pulled into the real China, facing kung fu and God knows what else.  And that ending was a cliffhanger itself.  I just loved the character and the world that John Carpenter created.      Like Tron before it, which lead to the recent Tron: Legacy, this is one of those cult 80s gems that could easily get a direct sequel, upping the ante and the budget.   It's one of my favorite movies from my childhood.  I've seen it likely 100 times.  No joke.   What would the sequel be about?  Perhaps a present day gamer stumbles upon the old trailer park rest stop during some road trip.  Not many people live there anymore.  But the game console is still there.  Perhaps he needs a place to stay as his car is fixed?  Perhaps there's a room for rent?  Perhaps the game doesn't work at first, until one quiet night it's back on again, come to life on its own.  And he plays, leading to a visit from the stars.  You've been recruited Starfighter!  Could be both a direct sequel and a remake at the same time.  I'd write that one in a New York minute as well.        Sequel news has come and gone since the early 2000s.  Rirchard Donner is too old to direct it now, well into his 80s.  This is another childhood favorite.   What would the sequel be about?  The Goonies are all grown up.  They have kids of their own that are now the present day Goonies.  Perhaps Mikey, who now has kids, works in a museum.  He finds another map which brings out the kid in him.  When he tries to recruit his old friends for another adventure, they recant, until Mikey's son hears about the map and takes HIS friends (Mouth's kid, Data's kid, Chunk's kid, and maybe Brand's kid) on the adventure.  The adults then find out and have to catch up to them before they get hurt, leading them all on parallel journeys.  Part sequel, part reboot for a new generation.      There was almost a sequel.  And it sounded horrible.  Normally I'd say, \"Just let it be the one original\" but I've had this concept in my head for quite awhile.   What would the sequel be about?  Elliot is all grown up (Henry Thomas would return in the role).  He's now working for NASA or S.E.T.I. or working directly for Quora's own Robert Frost (LOL).  Basically, he is KEYS, from the first film (Played by Peter Coyote in the original).  Keys had told Elliott in the original that E.T. came to him too.  So that concept stuck in my head and I saw Elliott now in the Keys role.  He's been waiting for E.T. to return.  Perhaps his own marriage is in shambles, due to his overbearing work obsession, searching for Extraterrestrials.  Searching for the meaning of why they came when they did and why they haven't returned.  Until one night, he begins to receive signals, leading him on a cross country search for E.T. as perhaps the government, namely the military, tracks him.  It really could be made into a quality film by Spielberg.  With heart.  With thrills.       I don't have a story in mind at all.  Just love the character and the world.  Rumor has it that there is a top secret of sorts Disney project in development with Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit teaming up.  So who knows?    This is a no-brainer.  They made a Cars sequel and now a Monsters Inc. prequel.  They are doing Finding Dory, which is great.  But no Incredibles 2?  Come on Brad Bird.  I know you're busy, but...      So we have now two sequels to Before Sunrise.  I know that John Hughes has passed on, but damn if a The Breakfast Club reunion wouldn't have been grand!  Ten year reunion.  Twenty year reunion.  They come together late at night after busting into their old school.  And we learned what happened that Monday and what has happened since.      This was another one that always engaged me at the end.  Brad Pitt's Mills being driven off in the back of a police car after killing John Doe.  Somerset (Morgan Freeman) watches in dismay.  Sad.   What would the sequel be about? That image gave me a sequel concept where a few years have passed.  Somerset is living alone, retired.  A gets a call.  \"Bill?\"  Somerset knows the voice.  It's Mills.  But it can't be him.  He's been locked away in some insane hospital, having had the ultimate breakdown after (No Spoiler).  Click. Somerset is haunted by the call until the phone rings again.  \"Mills?\"  It's the police.  More seven sin murders have begun.  Perhaps a copy cat, which is why they are calling Somerset back.   He's brought in as a consultant for the investigation. More seven sins kills, but different.  A new angle.  And he discovers that Mills has escaped from the hospital.  He's the lead suspect.  Somerset must hunt him down but soon discovers that Mills isn't the culprit.  In the hospital, he had been visited by a John Doe wannabe, obsessed with the original killings.  Mills escaped because he knew this young man was going to start the killings all over again.  Again, I'd write this in a New York minute.  Dream on Ken;)    This film should have been a franchise, especially now that superheroes are so huge.  It'd be nice to see a more grounded take on them, as M. Night Shyamalan did with the original.  He wanted to make the sequel but sadly his ego got in the way and studios stopped asking him back.  The original was just a moderate hit at best, but it's never too late to bring Willis and Jackson to the screen again. ",

            "answer_text": "Most big movies get sequels. If there's more money to be made then studios push for sequels, particularly lately. As I look at the films I picked below, most of them made little money or actually lost money. Several are from a different era when sequels were not as common. I have no idea if there is an audience for these movies, but they sure would make interesting sequels. Heavy Metal (1981)  Here's my first pick and I'm already cheating. They actually had a sequel to \"Heavy Metal\", but it was a love note from Heavy Metal Magazine owner Kevin Eastman to model/wife Julie Strain, and it was terrible. If I was married to Julie Strain I would have done the same thing, but as a fan of the movie I deserve better. The things that made \"Heavy Metal\" so unique was the soundtrack, the various styles of animation, the humor, the different stories and the weird adult tone that ran throughout. Please give me that sequel and I'll be happy! Lately, filmmaker Robert Rodriquez has announced that he's going to make a sequel, and I think he's the one guy who understands the source material and can bring it home correctly. So, I may get my wish. SDCC: Robert Rodriguez Takes Heavy Metal - ComingSoon.net Blade Runner (1982)  If I could trade in all of my picks to get one sequel made, \"Blade Runner\" would be my choice. Director Ridley Scott and star Harrison Ford are not getting any younger and ideally I would want them both involved. The world of \"Blade Runner\" is just as relevant now, maybe more, as we are knocking on the door of cloning, nanotechnology, bionics and all the other elements of transhumanism. There's plenty left to say about replicants and I'd like to see Scott play in the world he created one more time. The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (1984)  \"Buckaroo Banzai\" defines the movie \"ahead of its time.\" Dimensional travel, science nerdiness, meta-humor, aliens, action and music were all a part of this fun film. There's some sort of legal hell that's keeping the sequel from getting made. They have literally spent the last three decades teasing us with a sequel and they are still talking about it. After 27 years, Buckaroo director's still not giving up on a sequel The first film even named the sequel \"Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League.\" Let's make it happen. The Big Lebowski (1998)  The Coen Brothers are not known for making sequels, but this film definitely deserves it. No other movie in their filmography has such a dedicated fan base. The stars are ready for a sequel. I am too. Is 'The Big Lebowski 2' about to happen? Dredd (2012)  Whether it was the Stallone version of Judge Dredd or terrible advertising by the studio, \"Dredd\" did poorly at the box office. I'll admit that I didn't see it in the theater either. The thing is, \"Dredd\" was a tight action movie with very clever direction. It deserves a sequel. The studio is not interested in giving us another film, but there's a push to see it on Netflix as a series. That might actually be a better option. I'd like to see a sequel, but I'd take a series as a consolation prize. Why Judge Dredd should be a TV Show  Update: This answer was originally written in June of 2015. Since I wrote this answer I got my sequel to Blade Runner in 2017 and I loved that! You could also make the case that the Netflix series Love, Death and Robots was the Heavy Metal sequel I was looking for. ",
