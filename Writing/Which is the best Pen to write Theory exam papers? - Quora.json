            "answer_text": "This question made me chuckle and took me back to my school/college days! And compelled me to answer for the kick of it! I am a stationery freak! Love collecting any and all kinds of stationery (even when i travel abroad) whether i use them or not! And i love writing\u2026. and so, like most people on this forum, i would agree that you should NEVER use a NEW pen to write your exams. You have got to \u201cwarm up\u201d with them so they can write better. And never use an Ink Pen, fountain pen, fiber tip nor a Gel pen either. However, i would differ a bit on the latter. You can use Luxor\u2019s Pilot Pen. (See below)  The writing with this is pretty neat and it does not spill or blot like other gel or ink pens. But even with this, do ensure that you write with it for a at least 15 minutes continuously before taking it to the exam. Now\u2026for some brands. I would bet on Cello\u2019s Butterflow (hands down!!) for the smoothest writing on any paper.  Cello is a good brand and so is Parker (if you are comfortable with bulky pens). Do not try Staedtler or BIC or any Rollerball pens. They are a pain, do not write clearly and are ill-fitting in the fingers! Hope this helped! ",

Unlike other pen which are so heavy to even hold, your finger needs to adjust according to the size of the pen . My speed is really good because I use 3 rupees pen. And if you find sense in my explanation then go ahead experience it yourself . I assure you ,you won't be disappointed . ",
