            "answer_text": "Is this a grammatically correct sentence? Almost. It should be: Your small contribution can change the lives of many.  It\u2019s \u201clives\u201d, not \u201clife\u201d because by \u201cmany\u201d, you\u2019re referring to more than one person (plural) and therefore more than one life. There are a few other ways you could express that sentence. Some examples: 1. Your small contribution is not small to many others\u2019 lives. (Making a comparison - what is small to you is big to someone else) 2. Your small contribution can have a ripple effect on others\u2019 lives. (A ripple on a lake starts small but eventually covers the whole body of water) 3. Your small contribution can change many people\u2019s lives. Remember that you want to express something that touches people in an emotional and heartfelt way in this sentence. As such, the above examples are more effective. ",

            "answer_text": "Is this the correct sentence? \"Your small contribution can change the life of many\"? Normally it would be \u201cthe lives of many.\u201d In your original sentence, \u201cmany\u201d implies \u201cmany people.\u201d That is a plural. Many people will have many lives, also plural. Use of \u201clife\u201d instead of \u201clives\u201d might be acceptable, with a somewhat differwent meaning. \u201cLife\u201d would imply a very general idea of life experience, the same for everyone. \u201cLives\u201d would identify people\u2019s life experiences separately. People ordinarily do not share a singular life experience, except in a figurative sense. ",
