            "answer_text": "Well, Han Marashi, where are you \u201cadvertising\u201d? I don\u2019t see you on LinkedIn, for example, which is a business site. And it\u2019s where I\u2019ve gotten 95% of my clients in the last few years. I see you\u2019ve answered some queries here on Quora, but not recently. I also network online and in person, or to the degree that we can do anything in person right now (May 2020). I keep in touch with lots of people, not to secure clients, but to keep relationships strong. Using Zoom does help with that, thank goodness! What are your qualifications for such a position? Have you done any copyediting already? If so, were your clients happy with the results? If they were, have you asked for a recommendation or a referral? Are you accredited anywhere? Do you have a thorough knowledge of the language you\u2019re most fluent in? And I\u2019m unsure about the \u201csimple\u201d part; what does that mean, exactly? Short articles or blogs or something like that? Bottom line: Build relationships. Network. Offer value to others without selling. It can take time, but it\u2019s worth it! Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "You have to market yourself\u2014seek out the jobs. For example: paid Google and Facebook ads, Facebook page, blog, post blog content across social media, website (then you have to drive traffic to it), join group for writers and editors on Facebook and post a lot, cold call or cold email businesses if you want to do that kind of writing/editing, Fiverr and Upwork to create a portfolio and gather testimonials, family and friends and their referrals. Start working several avenues and things will start working out with persistence! All the best! ",
