Frame Your Story: there\u2019s no way you can give a good talk unless you have something  worth talking about. Conceptualizing and framing what you want to say is  the most vital part of preparation.Be authentic/vulnerableConvey one strong ideaTell a story that hasn\u2019t been told beforeTell and not sellAbsolutely and positively stick to the time limitA bit about presentation: Develop Stage Presence. Simply getting a person to keep his or her lower body motionless can dramatically improve stage presence. Perhaps the most important physical act onstage is making eye contact. There are three main ways to deliver a talk. You can read it directly  off a script or a teleprompter. You can develop a set of bullet points  that map out what you\u2019re going to say in each section rather than  scripting the whole thing word for word. Or you can memorize your talk,  which entails rehearsing it to the point where you internalize every  word\u2014verbatim.Practice makes perfect.Also read this article: 9 Public-Speaking Lessons From The World's Greatest TED Talks and How to Give a Killer Presentation ",

            "answer_text": "A tip I\u2019ve found very useful is to keep introduction brief and do the same for points you want to introduce in your speech: Write a 3 Minute Speech.  Also, it is important (if possible) to not repeat the points. Planning is important as well. According to How many words are in a 3-minute speech? 3-minute speech contains about 390 words, 130 words per minute. But it depends on how fast you talk. It will make more interesting if you will use a metaphor in your speech. And remember, that the \u201cwinning speech\u201d looks like you\u2019re interacting with audience and not just giving a formal speech.
