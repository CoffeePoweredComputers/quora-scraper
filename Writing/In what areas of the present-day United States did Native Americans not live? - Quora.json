It could be argued by some (but I disagree) that Alaska as well, because for some reason the U.S. Census Bureau classifies their indigenous populations as \u201dAlaska Native\u201d, with that same logic the pre-Columbian populations of modern day Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands wouldn\u2019t count. As for the Contiguous U.S.? I don\u2019t think we could ever be sure that the ancestors of modern day Native Americans didn\u2019t traverse every single centimeter square of that land, but they most likely did and so whenever the first peoples that migrated from Beringia down to the Contiguous U.S. (whichever route they took) they would eventually be everywhere as different groups trading and warring with each other before Europeans even knew about Greenland the first part of the Americas they would get to know.

E.g. prairie Indians would follow the buffalo herds wherever they wandered; eastern agricultural tribes would move every few years, as corn exhausted fresh forest soil, while hunting tribes usually had at least two homes, located for the deer and fishing seasons.
