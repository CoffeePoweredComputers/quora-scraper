            "answer_text": "Probably in this case, the Daemons of the Warp from Warhammer 40k.  A Space Marine makes a last stand against a tide of Daemons. Now for you to understand Daemons, you must first understand 40k. Alongside the material, physical universe, there is a dark immaterial realm of psychic thought called the Warp. It is a reflection of every single thought, emotion and feeling experienced by every living thing all at once. This is where daemons are born. Now to make a very complicated, very massive and very in depth universe comprehensible, here\u2019s the rundown. The Warp was once a quiet place where psychic energy coalesced and manifested as souls in the material world. When living things died, their souls returned to the warp and dissipated into new souls. For a while everything was good and then, as is the norm in Warhammer 40k, everything went to hell. I\u2019ll put it into the simplest terms possible. 60 million years before humanity evolved there was a war. A race of hyper evolved, psychic toad-men called the Old Ones fought a race of soulless androids called the Necrons. It was a war so devastating it scarred the universe and even after it faded to myth, was still aptly called the War in Heaven.  The Old Ones fought with vast psychic power, bio engineered slave races and relied on the power of the Warp to battle.  The Necrons, due to their metallic bodies, had no souls and were immune to psychic or Warp powers. Instead they fought with planet killing weaponry and advanced technology. Alongside them fought the C\u2019tan. The C\u2019tan were godlike beings who fed off of raw energy. They consumed stars, radiation, even the souls of living beings. So many beings died in this war that it permanently altered the Warp. The imbalance caused by the C\u2019tan\u2019s feeding of souls and the Old One\u2019s meddling twisted and corrupted the Warp. From this turmoil, hideous new beings emerged. The first Daemons.  Daemons were not living creatures that could exist in the material world, but rather nightmare creatures birthed from raw emotions. They could hold no physical bodies and could only exist in our world via our help. They were creatures of insanity, harbingers of Chaos and avatars of ruin. As for what happened to the Old Ones and the Necrons\u2026that\u2019s a story for another day. Daemons, though, perisisted nd now they are one of the most unrelenting and malevolent forces present in Warhammer 40k. Understanding them is a tad bit complex but I\u2019ll try to explain as best I can. First off Daemons, are immortal\u2026mostly. They can manifest and act in the real world and they can be killed, but only temporarily. Upon being killed they return to the Warp and can reform themselves. Beings of great psychic power CAN kill them permanently, but this is VERY hard (to date only one man/god has been able to do this consistently, as well as a few special weapons).They are literally born from emotions, especially negative emotions. Emotions, particularly strong ones like hatred and pain, are reflected in the Warp as an act of conception. Say someone is murdered very violently. There\u2019s a daemon born from the agony of the dying victim. Perhaps someone is raped. A daemon is born from the anguish of the assault. Even something as simple as scuffing your knee, that births a daemon. As such, Daemons are infinite and unrelenting in their attachment to living things.They come in infinite forms with infinite powers. Lacking physical bodies, Daemons can appear as whatever we think they can appear as. It\u2019s kind of like that Boggart from Harry Potter. Anything you\u2019re afraid of, a Daemon will appear as that, except ten times worse.They LOVE hurting us. Daemons are aspects of negative emotions and hate all living things. They take every opportunity to invade our world and cause general havoc and awfulness. There\u2019s no reasoning for this beyond \u201cdoing it for the laughs\u201d. Even when you die it\u2019s not the end. Your soul returns to the Warp and is immediately ripped a million ways apart by screaming daemon hordes.They tend to whisper to vulnerable souls and form cults that can act to bring daemons in the physical universe. Daemonic cults are vast and varied types of groups, from murder hungry hordes of mutants to hidden cults of pleasure and sadism.They also can come into the world in the worst way possible. Human sacrifice. A LOT of human sacrifice. Some Cults have butchered entire cities to call forth a Daemonic incursion. Daemons, as is their nature, are naturally drawn to other negative emotions and if enough people are in enough pain, they can cross out of the Warp just fine.Daemons love corrupting everything they can get their tendrils on. They can possess flesh, machines, even rocks! And you know what happens when a daemon possesses you? Well\u2026it\u2019s better not say. Instead I shall SHOW you. Chaos Spawn, what happens when men try to take power from Daemons. I haven\u2019t even covered half of what makes these things so horrible. The Chaos Gods. The Daemon Princes. The Primordial Truth and the myriad other horror the Warp has spawned. Instead I ask you indulge me and take some time to read the links I have enclosed below. You may just learn something interesting. Chaos Chaos Gods War in Heaven (Necron) ",

            "answer_text": "Where else, but the Discworld?  \u201cDemons are a species traditionally associated with the afterlife, but currently widespread on the disc. They can be considered gods but ones for vices not virtues. The difference is like that between a \"terrorist\" and a \"freedom fighter\". Mind you, on Discworld, most of what the gods get up to could well be called vice not virtue, but on the basis they're gods - and trigger-happy gods at that - who would like to point it out to them?\u201d Astfgl, lord of the Demons, king of hell figured out what was wrong. He realized why Hell didn\u2019t work. You see, Hell Traditionally consisted of physical torture. Constant, terrible torture. On souls. Which have no nerve endings. And thus, feel no pain. It was Pointless. Interesting maybe. Certainly never dull\u2026 But pointless. Instead, he turned hell into a bureaucracy. Oh yes, you still have to push that boulder up a hill and it\u2019ll never work, slipping away at the last second and rolling to the bottom\u2026 but between each attempt you will need to listen to a full recitation of the rules for appropriately lifting and moving heavy objects. All 27 volumes. With Addendums. And the citations. And the Glossary. No Bird will be coming to peck out your liver every day, oh no\u2026 Now it perches near your head and tells you in slow, excruciating detail all the particulars of it\u2019s Gal Bladder Surgery. Everything that led up to it, all the little side stories and chats with the wife and doctor and random advice from strangers, and all the time spent recovering. In horrible, slow, detail. Hell itself was redone to look more like a Hotel. Not a good one, more like a cheap one. The type that\u2019s totally off brand, with plain, beige wallpaper, and potted plastic plants. Astfgl redesigned hell so it wouldn\u2019t be tortuous and painful.. he redesigned it so it would be.. boring. Horrible, terrible, insufferable Boredom. Forever. ",
