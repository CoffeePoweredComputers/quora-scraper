            "answer_text": "In the legal writing style of a generation ago, one would write \"two (2).\"  As in, \"I have two (2) arms.\" But for what it's worth, there is a trend in modern legal writing to get out from under some of \"legalese\" traditions of yesteryear.  Modern legal writing favors clarity and conciseness to verbosity. In legal writing, I personally would not use \"two (2).\"  I would just use either \"2\" or \"two.\" In mathematical writing, I follow a different convention.  I spell a word out if I'm not referring to an integer or number per se, and I use numerals otherwise.  For example, I'd write:  \"There are two types of integers: odd and even.  The integer 2 is even.\"  An exception is that I try not to start a sentence with a numeral.  So I wouldn't write: \"2 is even.\"  Instead, I'd try to rephrase (e.g., by adding \"the integer...\" beforehand.) ",

            "answer_text": "From my point of view as a technical writer, neither is correct because this provides no clarity or confirmation at all. If they are the same and correct, you have only repeated yourself. If the same and incorrect, you just shit on the reader.If they are different, then either one or both are wrong and you cannot know which. There is not enough information to correct the error, just to reject the information which is confusing and does not help.I know how to fix it. Let's use roman numerals: \"two (2) (II)\". Then if you see \"two (3) (II)\" you can break the tie and figure the correct number is one plus one. But wait, what if you get \"two (3) (I)\"? Clearly we need another number representation. Let's use: \"two (2) (II) (##)\"? Excellent, now updating this information is a nightmare. ",
