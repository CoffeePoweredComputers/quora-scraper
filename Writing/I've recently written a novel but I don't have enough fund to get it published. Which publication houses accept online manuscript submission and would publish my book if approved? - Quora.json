            "answer_text": "There are basically four types of publishing options Large Publishers and Medium Publishers. These will NOT charge you to publish your book. They will fund the printing and publishing of the book. In return they will take a cut of your book sales. You have to have a very well written and very polished book to get a deal with them. Just search online for any list of large Publishers and apply to themeBook Stores that allow self publishing. These include - Amazon Kindle Store at kdp.amazon.com, Nook Publisher and Nook Press from Barnes & Noble, Kobo Writing Life, and Apple iBooks (itunes.apple.com). These allow you to upload an ebook format manuscript of your book and publish it in their ebook store. This is FREE. They will charge you a cut of book sales - usually 35% for books between $2.99 and $9.99 and 70% for books lower or higher than that. However, again, you want to make sure book is well edited and well written, or you will get negative reviews and it will sink the bookDigital Distributors that allow self publishing. These include Smashwords, Draft2Digital etc. These will allow you to upload your book to ONE distributor and make them available in lots of ebook stores. However, both are not supported by Amazon and now also Google Play Books Store (I think). This is FREE. They will take usually a 10% to 15% cut of your ebook price when sales happenVanity Publishers. These are the ONLY companies that charge you money to publish. Avoid these in general. Very few are worth the money they charge",

            "answer_text": "The way you\u2019re worded your question leads me to think (maybe wrongly) that your novel is probably a pretty good first effort, but likely isn\u2019t one that a publisher would accept. Stephen King wrote seven novels before he figured out how to write a good one. On a writing site like Scribophile, you can get feedback on your work from other writers, and find out what you\u2019re good at and what might need more work. ",
