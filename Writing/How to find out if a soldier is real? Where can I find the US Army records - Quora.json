            "answer_text": "Well there are two different questions here which will be discussed differently because they are two different cases. HOW TO FIND OUT IF A SOLDIER IS REAL. One of the most dishonorable thing you can do is lie about military service, yet many people are caught fabricating stories about their time in the Armed forces all the time which is a great offence, this is why this article is written for you to understand how you deal with anyone who seems to call himself a soldier from online. It can be difficult to corroborate this stories because the national military personnel record center might be slow in the processing times. So, if you request someone\u2019s details, it\u2019s not always helpful. Plus, this service requires the veteran\u2019s signature before they can release any information: another way you can use in finding the truth is to ask questions as much as possible. Equally as unfortunate, a lot of people become obsessed with emulating services members to the point that a faker can make an incredible convincing case. They always do much research and might be more than you do especially if you\u2019re not all that knowledgeable about the specific branch of the military claimed. So to find out if someone is lying about their military service or not, there are few tips that can help, by completing with which question to ask and how to neutralize the situation if a veteran becomes offended by you prying, getting the facts straight is important to protect the honor of who actually served. So this is why you need to make your underground checking which is the reason why charge back companies are founded { recovery companies } in which one of it I can really recommend and trust is therecoveryfirm. QUESTIONS TO ASK SPECIAL OPS MEMBERS OR SOMEONE WHO CLAIM TO BE A MILITARY. Someone claiming to have served in a special operations means they were a former Ranger, Delta force, Seal, a very great question you can ask will actually prove of they are lying about their status is, \u00b7 Ask for their class number: In training, they would have chanted their class number and over again, ask for the number if they can\u2019t remember, chances are they\u2019re phony. It is something that should be etched in their memory forever, just as you know your date of birth. \u00b7 Ask for their unit and location: Once you have their class number, unit and base location, you\u2019ll typically be able to easily look it up yourself , and you can see if everything correlates to assure that such units were actually stationed in a specific place at that time. If your military lover gets mad about this and really don\u2019t want to say anything about this , the first thing you need to get rid off your mind is the fear of losing him or the fear of losing the whole money you have given, because with him or without him you will get your fund recovered with the help of therecoveryfirm . com, However, it should be known that it\u2019s certainly a red flag if someone refuses to show papers or answer specific questions. In many cases, true Veterans will be happy to prove their service. It\u2019s an important duty to find out the truth about military service and one that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. By taking the time to ask thoughtful questions and do your research, you\u2019ll be honoring all the brave men and women who defend the United States every day as well as those who sacrificed so much for this country in the past How to know he is fake: This particular way of taking money from people through internet and lyin about their identity is called romance scam. This happen as a act of making you fall in love and get so attached to them to the stage that they know you are emotionally weak and wont have a choice than to stay, please do not make this huge mistake trying to figure the fact about this person on your won , either you try to report to the police once you discover something skeptical and if you haven\u2019t and still have the doubt , try to visit the recoveryfirm for good underground checking for you and also they will help you to get your refund with no cost and stress. DO NOT SEND MONEY! Be extremely suspicious if you are asked for money for transportation costs, communication fees or marriage processing and medical fees via Western Union. If you do start an Internet-based relationship with someone, check them out, research what they are telling you with someone who would know, such as a current or former service member. Be very suspicious if you never get to actually speak with the person on the phone or are told you cannot write or receive letters in the mail. Servicemen and women serving overseas will often have an APO or FPO mailing address. Internet or not, service members always appreciate a letter in the mail. Many of the negative claims made about the military and the supposed lack of support and services provided to troops overseas are far from reality - check the facts. Be very suspicious if you are asked to send money or ship property to a third party or company. Often times the company exists, but has no idea or is not a part of the scam. Be very suspicious if the person you are corresponding with wants you to mail anything to an African country. Be aware of common spelling, grammatical or language errors in the emails. Be very suspicious of someone you have never met and who pledges their love at warp speed. \u201cRED FLAGS\u201d Saying they are on a peace keeping mission, looking for an honest woman, parents deceased, wife deceased, child being cared for by nanny or other guardian, profess their love almost immediately, refer to you as \"my love,\" \"my darling\" or any other affectionate term almost immediately, telling you they cannot wait to be with you, telling you they cannot talk on the phone or via webcam due to security reasons, or telling you they are sending you something (money, jewelry) through a diplomat. Finally, they claim to be a U.S. Army Soldier; however, their English and grammar do not match that of someone born and raised in the United States. Here are answers to some of the most common types of scams: Soldiers and their loved ones are not charged money so that the Soldier can go on leave. No one is required to request leave on behalf of a Soldier. A general officer will not correspond with you on behalf of a Soldier planning to take leave. A general officer will not be a member of an internet dating site. Soldiers are not charged money or taxes to secure communications or leave. Soldiers do not need permission to get married. Deployed Soldiers do not find large sums of money and do not need your help to get that money out of the country. Soldiers have medical insurance for themselves and their immediate family members (spouse and/or children), which pays for their medical costs when treated at health care facilities worldwide - family and friends do not need to pay their medical expenses. Military aircraft are not used to transport Privately Owned Vehicles. Army financial offices are not used to help Soldiers buy or sell items of any kind. Soldiers deployed to combat zones do not need to solicit money from the public to feed or house their troops. Soldiers do not have to pay for early retirement. Where to go for help? As said, if you have any of this signs please try as much as possible to contact the police and tell them about everything, and basically contact therecoveryfirm . com for good support and more information. I believe this helps\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you talking about officially, like can you call a phone number or go to a website and look up a person to see if they are a soldier? (BTW soldier is a term to describe Army personnel only) No, there\u2019s no official way that\u2019s that easy to do to get that information. Military personnel files and information are not free to view by the general public, they have no rights to view that information. It\u2019s essentially classified. However, there\u2019s plenty of questions you can ask them to determine if they are telling the truth. For example as them to show you their CAC card (military ID). All military personnel have one and if they are in a uniform they should always have it on them. I keep mine in my wallet so I have mine with me at all times. On the topic of uniforms, you can tell a fake by the uniform most of the time just with a quick google search of \u201cArmy combat uniform standards\u201d or something like that and you can usually find pictures. The uniform code for the Army standard of wear is called AR 670\u20131. Of you do yourself a little research into units, uniform wear, different patches and service badges and ranks, you can usually use that to determine if someone is a fake. A great way to catch someone in a lie is asking about their MOS (military occupational specialty) which is the job they perform. Each job has an MOS code, for example in the Army for officers and enlisted personnel it\u2019s 2 numbers and a letter that correlate to their job. For example, Infantry in the Army is an 11 series MOS, an infantry officer is an 11A, an enlisted infantrymen is either an 11B which is straight up Infantry or 11C which is a mortarmen. Armor is 19 Series, Special Forces is 18 Series, Artillery is 13 Series, EOD is either an 89E for officers and 89D for enlisted and so on. You can find more details about it on the internet. The army also have warrant officers, they are technical specialists in a specific job like engineering or mechanical jobs, but the majority of warrant officers are pilots for Army helicopters. Again you can look into it on the internet for more detailed information. Warrant officers MOS codes are 3 numbers and a letter, for example a special forces warrant officer is a 180A. Another way to probe a suspected faker is to ask them about the basic training for the job they did and know where each job usually sends it\u2019s per for basic training and the AIT or advanced individual training in the specific job they do. Basic training is split in to 2 parts, the basic training cycle where it\u2019s the crash course to the Army where you learn generic stuff about the Army, things like ranks, drilling, shooting a rifle, basic things of that nature like correct uniform wear. The second cycle is the job specific phase, your AIT phase in most cases, this is where you learn to be an aircraft mechanic or truck driver or computer or signal Corp soldier. It\u2019s the job specific training. Now for some jobs like infantry, Cavalry/Armor, combat engineers and some others you do OSUT (one station unit training) this is where the basic training and job training is all smashed into one. With other jobs you usually do your entry training in the 2 cycle system and usually at 2 separate bases. With OSUT it\u2019s all one cycle and it\u2019s all done at one base with no break in between. Infantry and armor/Cavalry are all OSUT at Fort Benning near Columbus Georgia. Combat engineers is OSUT at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri or Fort Sill in Oklahoma I believe, don\u2019t quote me on it, I chose Infantry instead of my other choices, Cavalry Scout and Combat Engineer. Cavalry scout is also at fort Benning. The thing is, there\u2019s lots of simple, easy and quick research you can do that can help to determine if someone is lying or not. Knowing unit locations can help, if someone is wearing a 25th Infantry Division patch or says they are/were in the 25th ID, they are/were either stationed in Hawaii or Alaska. 101st Airborne in fort Campbell Kentucky, 82nd Airborne in Fort Bragg North Carolina, 1st Armored in Fort Bliss Texas, 1st Cavalry in Fort Hood Texas, 2nd Infantry Division headquarters and combat aviation brigade are in South Korea while the 2 ground combat brigades (Stryker Brigades) are in Fort Lewis in Washington and fall under administration of 7th Infantry Division, 3rd Infantry Division is in Fort Stewart Georgia, 4th Infantry Division is in Fort Carson Colorado, 10th Mountain Division is fort Drum New York with a brigade that used to be in Fort Polk Louisiana which now falls under the Army National Guards 36th Division as 3rd Brigade Combat Team 36th Infantry Division, there\u2019s also 6 separate Brigades or Regiments that don\u2019t fall under the Divisions, 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vincenza Italy, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment (Stryker) in Vilseck Germany, 3rd ACR in fort hood Texas, 11th ACR at Fort Irwin California, 1st Battalion 509th at Fort Polk La, and 1st Battalion 28th at Fort Benning Ga. its all about what you know and what they know when it comes to figuring out if they are for real or not. Most fakers don\u2019t take much time if any to do research before they put on a uniform ant talk about how they served. Most of the time you can spot them right away by the uniform, collar up, not fully dressed in a uniform, patches and medals all over the place, the American flag on the wrong side (always on the top right shoulder of an Army uniform), and so on. Just do some research and if they tell you a story that sounds crazy you can usually look it up. Almost all major battles and unit deployment are available on the internet for the current wars. Special Operations like green berets and rangers may be a little harder to back track a story as they don\u2019t usually have that information free to public but there\u2019s plenty of ways to figure out the real from the fake if you do some research for yourself.
