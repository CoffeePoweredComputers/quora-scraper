            "answer_text": "Myself, I wouldn\u2019t find it much of a struggle, Arnold. I\u2019ve read a lot of books before I\u2019ve seen the films, for example, and though some details may change, most of the major plot-points have to remain in order to carry the story. Hence, there are quite a few films for which I more or less knew the story and its likely major spoilers, but I enjoyed the films all the same. (Most of the time. You know, there\u2019s always that risk when a book is translated to film that it\u2019s not going to go well, lol\u2026) In terms of television shows, a biggie would be Game of Thrones. I\u2019d already read the first couple of books before the series began, so I was pretty sure I knew what some of the major events would be. That didn\u2019t diminish my enjoyment of the series, though. Or to give another example, The Sopranos. I came to it late, and in the process of catching up, someone gave away the final episode to me. I watched it anyway, all the way through - there were lots of other plot twists that I didn\u2019t know about, so there was still a lot of \u201cstory\u201d left to explore. And for what it\u2019s worth - I thought the ending sucked. I still think it sucks. If I\u2019d seen it through without having an awareness of where it was going, I\u2019d have thought the ending sucked. It\u2019s one of the worst finales of history. But I watched it through all the same. You don\u2019t have to \u201cget over\u201d it. You\u2019re not going to forget what you now know. But that doesn\u2019t mean watching the series through has been totally ruined. \u2026unless the ending sucks. ;-) Thanx for the A2A, Arnold! ",
