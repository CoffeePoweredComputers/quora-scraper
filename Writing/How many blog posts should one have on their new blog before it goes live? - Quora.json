Give your audience a taste of your content and at the same time, it will show you are commited to delivering on your part of creating good content that the audience wants. If you only had one blog post, what is there for the audience to chew on? When is the next one? Give them a reason to care about your content and keep their attention\u2026with more blog posts. It is not about length though. Longer blog posts do not equal better posts. Write more than what you go live with so you can have a regular cadence for your blog post releases (weekly/biweekly?). If you can\u2019t write 10 blog posts/articles, you should question why you are starting a blog. There should be plenty of things to unpack/write about for your audience. After a few years (yes, that\u2019s right\u2026 don\u2019t expect overnight success nor millions of views within a few months), you will find out what is more popular and what is less popular. Write for what you want want to talk about the blog topics too. ",
