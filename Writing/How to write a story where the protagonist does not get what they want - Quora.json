            "answer_text": "How do I write a story where the protagonist does not get what they want? A few tricks come to mind: Think of some people you\u2019ve known or simply heard about over your lifetime, and recall what these people wanted - and I mean, wanted badly - and didn\u2019t get. Not only didn\u2019t they get this person, job, house, result, sports position, answer to a question, and so on and on - but they have a definite reaction to not getting the \u201cwhatever,\u201d and part of the story is how they react, what they say, what they, how they redirect their desire, anything that will wind up your story in a satisfactory way, though not necessarily a happily-ever-after way.Keep in mind that a protagonist really doesn\u2019t always get what they want in the world of fiction or nonfiction. \u201cNot getting their way\u201d can easily be a theme in your story; you have conflict, and strife, success and failure, enlightenment, shocking realization, and so on. They\u2019re just people (unless they\u2019re not); therefore, anything can happen.Your protagonist can earn his/her keep by showing throughout the story the various outcomes from similar behavior, the pros and cons of anything, can display within the narrative many sides to his/her personality, emotional makeup, intelligence, etc., and that not all methods are successful to all people.Admit that your protagonist may not always be a sentient being; it may be an idea, a concept, a goal, a belief, anything one can\u2019t touch but creates deep feelings toward. Maybe like a campaign to save a 200-year-old tree; the tree isn\u2019t the protagonist - the movement to save the tree is that.I like to remember that the Universe isn\u2019t only made up of what Earthlings view as \u201clife\u201d, but of anything that stands as a whole to be challenged or accepted.Hope this helps. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the podcasts I follow puts this eloquently; there is what the character wants, and what the character needs. Surely you\u2019ve seen this movie. The hero is pursuing the seemingly unobtainable girl of his dreams, a haughty, pampered princess. He struggles to better himself and to become worthy of her notice, slowly achieving success and self-esteem \u2014 all the while with the support and encouragement of the tomboy he\u2019s known since childhood, the tomboy who\u2026 Oh, you figured out where this was going already. There are endless variations on this. A protagonist doesn\u2019t have to grow and change. But in many of the good stories, they do. They set out with a goal of petty revenge and end up leading a revolution. They seek out the man who killed their father and find out it wasn\u2019t him after all \u2014 but now he has help finding the real killer. Heck, Dorothy sings about wanting to leave home. And the moment she finds out about what the Ruby Slippers do, \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home!\u201d ",
