            "answer_text": "Depends on how important the essay is, the type of essay I am writing, how much I know about the topic, how much time I have and it also helps that I\u2019m pretty fast at it because I have experience. Let\u2019s look at these factors one by one: How important the essay is. This determines what a \u2018good enough\u2019 essay to submit means to you. Obviously, the more high-stakes it is, the higher the standard for \u2018good enough\u2019.How much you know about the topic. The more you know, the less time you need to do research. You know what and where the sources are (or most of them), and already have an idea of your argument in broad strokes.The type of essay. If you work on a short essay, you could do your research in a few hours. Write a thesis and it can span a much longer period\u2026How much time you have. \u201cWork expands so as to fill the time available for its completion\u201d, or my favourite corollary, \u201cIf you wait until the last minute, it only takes a minute to do\u201d. The less time you have to do something, the more efficient you will be, because you literally won\u2019t have time to waste procrastinating, triple-checking every sentence, and \u2018obsessing\u2019, as you say, over minor details.How much experience you have writing essays. The more you write, the better you get (both speed-wise and quality-wise) at all the steps that essay-writing entails: understanding the question, research, summarising your thoughts concisely and presenting them persuasively, proofreading\u2026So take these factors into consideration when you think about how much time you need to write your essays. But I\u2019d say don\u2019t worry too much about it. The more essays you write, and the more feedback you get on them, the better you\u2019ll be able to tell how much time and effort you should put in. ",
