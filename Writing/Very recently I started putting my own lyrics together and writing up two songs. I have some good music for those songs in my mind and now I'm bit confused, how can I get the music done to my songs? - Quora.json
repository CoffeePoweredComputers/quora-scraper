            "answer_text": "There are demo studios in almost every city that make part of their living by helping out folks like you. If you have at least a basic melody for your lyrics, and can hum or sing it and tap your foot in the rhythm you want, they will bring in session players, let you teach them your song, and flesh it out expertly. Something like this, where you only want \u201cdemo quality\u201d shouldn\u2019t cost more than about $300 a tune tops. Many of them offer package deals for an EP. Demo quality isn\u2019t suitable for release on iTunes or Spotify, nor will it get radio play, but it\u2019s the perfect calling card to get your music heard by agents, managers, distributors and producers, all in hopes of getting it picked up by someone. One of the coolest things that can happen is if a major artist hears your song, likes it, and releases it. You get paid up front, plus you get paid every time the song is performed or played on any medium. Granted, it\u2019s tough to find that opportunity, but without a demo you are guaranteed to never make it. If you join up with CD Baby (there are others like this, too) You can submit your stuff to producers, and more excitingly, music buyers who are constantly looking for good music to insert into films and TV productions, either as a theme song, a soundtrack, or \u201cincidental music\u201d (the music that might be playing in the background when someone walks into a busy club.) None of that will grant you hit status, but it\u2019s one of the better ways to get paid. I wish you well! ",
