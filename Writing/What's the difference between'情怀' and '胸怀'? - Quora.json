            "answer_text": "It's kind of hard to explain what they mean individually as these expressions hardly exist in English, but their difference is pretty obvious. Both are basically alternatives of the expression \u60c5\u611fgrammatically but are only suitable in certain circumstances. \u60c5\u6000roughly means feelings or temperament, usually only to describe literature or something grand or you would seem too dramatic. This is an example: \u675c\u752b\u7684\u8bd7\u5f80\u5f80\u8868\u8fbe\u5fe7\u56fd\u5fe7\u6c11\u7684\u60c5\u6000\u3002 The poems of Du Fu often convey feelings of concern for his country and its people. On the other hand, \u80f8\u6000 is usually used to describe feelings of ease, transcendence, forgiveness etc. Like how you would describe someone who is willing to accept adversity with ease or someone who has a broad mind and remains aloof. This term may be hard to understand and I find it hard to express in English as this may be exclusively a Chinese saying. Here is an example \u4ed6\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ed6\u4e0d\u754f\u632b\u6298\uff0c\u52c7\u5f80\u76f4\u524d\u7684\u80f8\u6000 His attitude displays his asset of perseverance and fearlessness of adversity. or \u4ed6\u5982\u5927\u6d77\uff0c\u6709\u7740\u535a\u5927\u7684\u80f8\u6000 Like the oceans, he possesses( a great ability to accept facts and remain aloof) The latter example may not make any sense to you but it is a common metaphor in China. If you still don't understand, it is perfectly normal. These are very abstract terms that many Chinese do not fully understand. ",

            "answer_text": "As a local Chinese, i think that \u60c5\u6000 means a special feeling(especially affection) you have toward something. In an informal occasion, you can say someone has a thing for ** to express \u67d0\u4eba\u6709**\u60c5\u6000\uff08\u67d0\u4eba\u6709\u5bf9**\u7684\u60c5\u6000\uff09\u3002 \u80f8\u6000 has two kinds of meanings \u2014 tolerance and ambition. Given that i am a local Chinese, it is inevitable for me to make some syntax errors. I will appreciate it if you point it out. ",
