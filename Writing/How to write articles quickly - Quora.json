            "answer_text": "7 Tips for Writing a Good Article Quickly In the age of the internet, article writers who can generate good content in a short time period are in increasingly high demand. However, writing articles or blogging under tight deadlines should not come at the expense of good writing. Here is a step-by-step guide full of great tips to help you write a good article in record time:  Keep a list of ideas handy. You never know when writer\u2019s block will hit. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep a list of ideas for potential news articles or personal stories that could be expanded into essays. Any time you have an idea, jot it down in a notebook or in a Word document on your computer. That way, when it\u2019s time to start writing, you\u2019ll already have a place to start.Eliminate distractions. A lot of people claim to work better while multitasking. Rarely is this actually the case, especially if the goal is to write an entire article in a short amount of time.Research efficiently. Research is important for any piece of writing, but it\u2019s also easy to fall into the trap of spending too much time researching and not enough time writing your first draft. If you\u2019re looking for facts or statistics to support your argument, try to be as specific as possible in your search terms. If you aren\u2019t finding the support you\u2019re looking for, the takeaway may be that you need to adjust your thesis or subject matter.Keep it simple. A reader\u2019s attention span is generally short, so one of the best things that you can do as a writer is to keep your article direct and concise. Having a maximum word count goal will help you not only help you complete your write-ups faster, but it will also result in a streamlined article that focuses on major points while eliminating fluff.Try writing in bullet points. Writing in bullet points can help you organize your thoughts and complete the article faster. Also, bullet point articles often drive higher traffic, since search engine algorithms tend to prioritize articles with bullet points and subheadings. Writing in bullet points is not only a time-saver, it can also increase the likelihood your article reaching your target audience.Edit after writing. One of the most common mistakes that writers make is trying to edit while they write. Resist this urge. Trying to edit while in the process of writing can slow you down, increasing the likelihood that you won\u2019t even make it past the intro. Good writers know that writing and editing are two distinct and separate processes.Set a timer. A great way to become a quicker and more efficient writer is to practice writing to a timer. Set a timer for 30 minutes and see how much you can get done. You\u2019ll be surprised how much you can produce during a half hour of focused, uninterrupted writing.",

            "answer_text": "HEY! Good morning.. I have a question about that. Are you a writer or do you want to be a writer? If so, don't rush to write a quick article. Because a writer has to write well as well as quickly. The former is ascension, while the latter is the foundation. To do both, you need to accumulate more: 1. Observe more. The article is the product of the objective things reflected in the author's head and head. It is only by careful observation that one finds in the mines of life the uncut jasper, and snatches among the mud the glittering treasure. 2. Read more. Extensive reading is a prerequisite for improving the level of composition. To write good articles, one must read more books. \"Reading break ten thousand volumes, write like a god.\" We emphasize not only to read more, but also to choose to read, but also to read, to understand the structure of the article, language characteristics, from which to master the composition set more profound, more changes. 3. Choose materials wisely Careful choice is the accelerator to improve the level of composition. The requirement of selecting a material is to want a novel, alleged novel, approve want to choose an average person to had not contacted namely, or be indifferent to the course of study solid contain table profound meaning. Once the author puts pen to paper, it produces thought-provoking material. Select material Angle to small, to see big. This kind of positive thinking, repeated deliberation of the selection and analysis of time, to improve the level of composition is very helpful. 4. Practice writing Frequent practice is the key to improve the level of composition. If you want to get into the door of composition and strive for continuous progress, more important is to practice more. As the proverb goes, \"One is better than ten.\" This explains the truth that real knowledge comes from the practice of composition. After we learn an article, understand the structure of the article method, make clear the article writing characteristics, we must learn to use this knowledge and methods to practice, to practice, make it into their own writing ability. Actually, we can practice writing after the first text we learn. But the segment practice is a good way to practice writing, the segment practice spent a short time, and to achieve the purpose of writing, 5. Revise frequently Repeated revision is the catalyst to improve the level of composition. Revision is an indispensable step of composition and an effective measure to improve the quality of the composition. Tolstoy 's War and Peace was revised seven times. Revision to do five looks: see whether the wording is smooth, see whether the theme is clear, see whether the structure is compact, see whether the language is beautiful. In short, \"The article is modified. Of course, if you just want to finish an article quickly, you can choose the article rewriter\uff0csuch as Spinnerchief i used to. It can quickly generate a unique article for you. It was a lifesaver for me at school when I had a deadline for writing essays. But if you are a long-term writer, I sincerely recommend that you do not use an essay rewriting machine. Because it doesn't improve your writing. Only their feet on the ground and practice lay a good foundation, your writing level, writing efficiency will naturally improve. THANKS. ",

            "answer_text": "The two keys to writing quickly are to have a clear process and a clear head. When aiming to write blog articles that require research, the key is to break the process down over time. Our minds process information in 5 different ways to write a blog article. The brain can\u2019t think four ways at once. So plan on a 5 step process, with breaks. Here are the steps. Create a concept or title from the purpose of your article.Do initial research by getting to know the subject well.Create an outline so you will have an organized presentation.Do detailed research so you have enough to write about.Write the post to a finished first draft.Some notes: If you are writing several posts on one general topic, you can do steps 1 and 2 for many blog posts at the same time. Then line up the titles and concepts, and, when it\u2019s time to write, create an outline for each one.The end of this process is a finished draft. It still needs review, line editing and proofreading before it is published.If you know too much about your subject and you care a lot, you may need a different first step. You may need to do a brain dump to get it all out of your head. Write as if for a personal journal, with no thought of outline or publication. You can write for personal expression or as a diatribe. The focus of this writing is to get through the feeling \u201cI have so much to say.\u201d Once you do that, go back, create outlines, and then extract content from your brain dump and revise it to finish the post.Raqib, thanks for the A2A. This process has worked for me on hundreds of articles and blog posts, and I\u2019ve taught it to hundreds of people, too. Enjoy the writing! ",

That article will become part of my research and will provide inspiration for the article I wish to write. Make no mistake about one thing, though. Do not copy or even paraphrase any article. That\u2019s plagiarism and it\u2019s wrong. What you do is use the article as inspiration so as to cut down on the thinking time that always comes before the actual writing because looking at how someone else did what you are thinking of doing will give you ideas for your own article that you might otherwise have spent a lot of time figuring out. And it will shorten the research and writing time because you\u2019ll more than likely have come up with a firm direction for your own article after reading someone else\u2019s take on the subject, which also cuts down on time. Then write your article. You will discover that it is completely different from the one you read for inspiration and it will be done fairly quickly. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming your context is blogging. The trouble with most people is they\u2019re taking to the writing in the general mould of an academic writing effort \u2014 instead of treating it as \u201ccopy creation.\u201d It would\u2019ve been easier for anyone to just sit next to me and watch how I go about racing through the copy-making process. Some of my followers on Quora have seen me produce a whacking big answer for a question \u201casked just now\u201d within a space of 15 or so minutes. If I had a \u2018process,\u2019 it would probably be describable as this:\u2014 When you have no time to do an outline The ideal situation is to have a written outline. Sometimes it\u2019s impossible \u2014 sometimes you\u2019re not in the mood too. Just settle for a mental outline. Put in placeholder \u201creminders\u201d for the running order of things for now:\u2014 [lede] [main issue: smokers don\u2019t know jack about what they\u2019re smoking] [profile of smokers worldwide] [profiling smokers in 6 countries] [the correct way to smoke] [the wrong way to smoke] [who gives a damn] [who doesn\u2019t give a damn] [what everybody\u2019s conclusions are] [to hell with their conclusions \u2014 here\u2019s my conclusion] Write a working headline first. Just shove in a quick headline that roughly indicates your general topic matter. Once you finish the writeup, return to the headline and rewrite it. If you can\u2019t think of one, just skip it. Write the middle parts first. During the writeup, your entire existence as a human being is to write the middle parts first. Just write the stuff according to your understanding or beliefs \u2014 no matter how right or wrong they are. Put in your self-invented stuff as placeholders for the time being \u2014 leave the amendments for later after researching. Use ALLCAPS for stuff that needs updating later. The population of the UK is XXX million with XXX% men and XXX% women as at [DATE] 2017. Male smokers are more in the habit of SMOKING IN ALL SITUATIONS and female smokers ONLY IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS. You don\u2019t have the flamin\u2019 time to get the right figures or details right now. You get the copy done up to completeness or near-completeness first. Then write the ending. Conclusions are optional. If you need one, put it in. Otherwise, take the nearest exit. People don\u2019t care to read \u201cessays.\u201d They prefer to read \u2018stories.\u2019 You don\u2019t have to believe me \u2014 but you\u2019ll find out the truth soon enough. Leave the wretched writeup alone. Stop writing and stop thinking about it \u2014 even if it\u2019s for just 30 minutes or an hour. Walk around the house. Kick the pets. Have a drink. Eat some junk food. Now think about how you\u2019re going to \u201cfix\u201d your copy with reasonably believable data. This is the part you start thinking about research. Do your \u2018research.\u2019 It\u2019s impossible to plan and work at the same time. It\u2019s impossible to research and write at the same time either. People who say it\u2019s possible is just \u2026 impossible people. Clean up the copy, add your elements, and finalise. Once you\u2019ve got all the \u201cfacts\u201d (including lies published elsewhere), then feed the crap into your writeup. Then shove in some pictures to separate out your various sections. Add in subheads to break up long copy. Put in links where needed. Regularise your spellings, stylistics and grammar (in that order). Now write the \u2018lede\u2019 (the intro) \u2014 and publish! Always write the intro last. That\u2019s because you now have an overall mental picture of the whole writeup. Now you can summarise the whole caboodle into 20\u201325 words that tug at the hearts and minds of your incredibly gullible readers. Use a fresh post to correct and update your post. Don\u2019t go back to correct your published post. Publish a fresh post with a link pointing back to the published post. In the old post, put in \u201cupdate lines\u201d (links) in the relevant places that point to your fresh update post. Example:\u2014 In the fresh post:\u2014 \u201cIn last Tuesday\u2019s post [embed the link], we have been reliably told by British Prime Minister Teresa \u201cBloody Difficult\u201d May that the UK in fact has 31 men and the rest are women \u2014 all 64,999,969 women.\u201d In the old post:\u2014 The population of the UK is 65 million with 49.99% men and 50.01% women as at 15 May 2017. (Update: It\u2019s actually 31 men and the rest all women [embed link to fresh post].) FINAL WORD If you\u2019ve got the cojones, just give yourself a fixed absolute maximum of 2 hours to do a writeup from start to finish. At the end of the 2 hours, just publish \u2014 for real \u2014 regardless of quality. A lot of famous bloggers with 10 or 20 years\u2019 experience do exactly that. It puts a cap to the effort and stop things from dragging on. Over time, your writing will just improve by force. Thanks for the A2A. ",

If I have to do that, I will immediately have in my mind the outline of what I have to write. Jot down points first. Material searching at that time is usually not done. Then I start with the open line and the first para. Then I have my closing sentence and the last para. I will have to fill in the main body as per my skeleton jotting. I have to do it in one sitting, or probably in three at the maximum. Second part revolves around writing the other paras, usually four to five more. I keep thinking about the material I have to sift from internet or some books that are available with me. Magazines can also offer help, if I have retained a few. Last and final sitting is the subject aligning and beautification. Editing is done along with word repetition avoidance. grammatical and composition parts are simultaneously worked upon. Before posting, a final reading is essential, despite editing is done. THAT HELPS REMOVE THE KINKS, ADD SMOOTHNESS AND RAISE THE IMPACT LEVEL. After a few articles, the quality is doubled. That is how I have experienced it. At the end, for prolific writing, one has to have off-line pieces written for future usage. These can be cut/pasted and edited to improve upon time and efficiency.

            "answer_text": "The answer is to make your articles shorter. To do this, research a subject and build an outline of all you're interested in on that subject. Make your blog entry talk about one point in your outline. Make your blog entry longer by including a photo and a video. Make sure you link to at least one high traffic source like a .gov webpage, especially for definitions. After doing all the research, write the long piece, an article covering all the points, but divide each segment into nifty blogs before you post. You can even write all the blogs, then schedule them for release, using, next up, and previously discussed cliff hangars that make people want to come back. Really, with blogging, people really are looking for traffic--that's why they keyword the photos, the title, the video, the definition, and subpoints with the same keyword. Example: Outline for my flower garden: Spring Color Back borderMid borderLeafy fillerFront borderArt objectAnimal friendlyYou do a garden design, or find one at a popular garden, you explain the plants each blog, you define the terms using a popular gardening sites, include your own pictures, link to a book used on Amazon or Goodreads or both, include a video about care for that plant. You then have a 3000+ word article that can be separated into 7+ blogs, you post them all after you write them on Sunday, after researching it on Saturday, schedule them a day apart, then go work on something useful for the rest of the week. There is really no reason to have a blog (other than ego) unless you have something to sell. The web servers are set up to list commercial sites higher because they generate more ad sales. Naked women always generate sales, if you want that kind of reputation. ",

Some writers can be both prolific and profound, but they are a select few. Some writers produce copious amounts of crap. As you continue to write, your area of expertise will deepen and possibly widen. You will need less time to research. As for the research you are doing now, create a filing system - physical, mental, cyber or a combination of these so when you need information, you don\u2019t repeat your research. your research is like a financial investment. At first, each deposit seems insignificant, but given time, you will find you have built up a solid nest egg. The research you do today may well serve you well tomorrow. ",
