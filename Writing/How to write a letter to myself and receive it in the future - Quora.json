            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve done this successfully. It\u2019s important that you put the letter somewhere where it won\u2019t accidentally get thrown away. I put mine in a treasured book, since we never throw books away in our family. There was the possibility that we might have donated the book or sold it to a used book store eventually, so I lucked out in that I picked the right book for this task. It would be safer to put it in a safety deposit box, or a fire safe. Be sure to date the outside for the time when you\u2019d like to open it. Date it far enough in advance that you\u2019ll have forgotten the contents entirely. I\u2019d make it for at least five years, if not ten or twenty. It\u2019s very possible that you\u2019ll forget all about it and miss the \u2018open by\u2019 date, which actually makes it even more fun to open. Do not put it in a file cabinet. There are things in my file cabinet that I\u2019ll probably never see again. Again, since you want to open it far enough in the future that you\u2019ll have forgotten all about it, you want to have it somewhere that you\u2019re likely to access regularly, but infrequently. Some other options include the bottom of your underwear and/or socks drawer, taped to the back of a favorite piece of art on the wall, or taped to the back of your yearly calendar. I put a special note to myself on the bottom of an old coffee table that was handed down to me by my mother, who got it from her aunt, who got it from a garage sale by her neighbors who had a bad house fire and needed some cash for replacements and repairs on their furniture and home. Whenever we move, I always get to read it again. Since you\u2019re thinking about fun things like this, I\u2019d like to suggest something else. When we remodeled our bathroom in our old house, I found a bunch of rusty razors behind the old medicine cabinet. Older medicine cabinets had a slot for disposing of old razors, which fell behind it and collected over the years. It wasn\u2019t a very nice discovery to make, and that gave me an idea. Before we put in the new medicine cabinet I wrote a little history about the house and time of the remodel, our names, and a small candle and a figurine of a meditating figure. No rusty razors for the next person who remodels! Also, when I retiled the bathroom enclosure, before I put up the backing for the tile I wrote a note on the wall about who helped me and the year and a cheerful message. It might be you who finds these sorts of things, or it might be someone else: a family member, someone who acquires your house or estate goods, etc. Don\u2019t let that hold you back. My favorite letters by my relatives divulge intimate details and feelings, not just the facts. Enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "We got you covered! If you ever fantasized about writing a letter to your future self, I\u2019m sure you most probably written a letter to yourself and placed it somewhere in your house. In your cabinet? Or drawer?
