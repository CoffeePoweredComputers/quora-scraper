If you\u2019re not an athlete or someone who has an exceptional circumstance, then it comes to crafting together a powerful personal statement. At the end of the day, whether you get accepted or not depends on crafting together a compelling personal statement that represents the personal qualities that ultimately define you. By demonstrating your personal qualities, leadership, contribution to your community, intellectual curiosity, passion, and deep level of introspection, you have a fighting shot at getting into one of the Ivy Leagues by packaging together a thought provoking, powerful application that best represents you. Please read my blog on what the Ivy Leagues are looking for: http://www.ivycollegeadmit.com/blog-posts/biggest-misconception http://www.ivycollegeadmit.com/blog-posts/personal-statement ",

(I\u2019m told that an Upper Second is roughly equivalent to a GPA of 3.3 - 3.7). I had a good reference explaining that I was a better student than my results would suggest. I submitted two pieces of work, one of which was considered sufficiently good to overcome the handicap of disappointing grades. I was offered places at a few other prestigious British universities. I mention that in case people think I was only accepted because I was on a special inside track. ",
