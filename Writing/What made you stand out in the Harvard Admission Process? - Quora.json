            "answer_text": "I have no idea. (Or perhaps one \u2014 see below \u2014, but that was not something which had to do with me.) Anyway, my academic credentials were solid across the board, but that should not have been remarkable for a school like Harvard. Straight A\u2019s (but from a school which was an unknown quantity to the admissions office \u2014 it was a respectable school, just not one which had ever sent students to Harvard, so no one in the admissions office could have known what kind of student got A\u2019s at this school or what A\u2019s at this school meant; and in any case, lots of applicants had straight A\u2019s from much better schools)Very good results on the SAT and the PSAT (I was a National Merit Finalist, but so were scores of others at Harvard); I also took a bunch of ACH\u2019s, also with good results; but everybody whom I got to know more closely at Harvard had great SAT etc. scores \u2014 it was no big deal, and certainly not something which made me stand outA string of \u201c5\u2019s\u201d on AP tests (across the academic spectrum, i.e. Chem., Phys., Calc.; Eng., Am. Hist.; Germ., Lat.; I was admitted as a Sophomore, and not that many people were, so perhaps the large number of and the breadth of the AP tests did make me stand out a bit)I had a solid background in two foreign languages (with the AP scores to back it up), but plenty of others in my class whom I got to know had more than one foreign languageI would like to think that I wrote a good essay, but obviously I cannot be an impartial judge thereI was very weak on extracurricular activities, so my application had very little to offer there (in my defense I am tone deaf, so anything musical was out of the question; and from earliest childhood I have been cursed with very poor eyesight and screwed-up depth perception which meant that if a sport involved catching, throwing, hitting, or kicking a ball with any accuracy, then I couldn\u2019t do it \u2014 and in the small town I grew up in, exotic sports such as diving did not exist; and when I went to a bigger school in a city for the last couple years, it really was too late for me to take up a sport like diving as I would have been competing against athletes who had been diving competitively for years). Frankly, the absence of any noteworthy extracurricular activities, when I look back on it, should have doomed my application. Everyone whom I got to know had a far, far better application than I had in that regard: there were chess-masters, national debate club finalists, world-class swimmers, state wrestling champions, star running backs, you name it. As for diversity: I am a male WASP. A heterosexual, cis, male WASP (though sexual orientation and cis/trans status was not the sort of thing that anyone asked about back then). The only thing which I can think of which might possibly have made me stand out was the report sent in by the alumnus who interviewed me. He was, of all things, the local rabbi in a city which did not have much of a Jewish population. I should here add that the school that I was going to was a conservative Christian school. Also, when I arrived at the synagogue for the interview, it was immediately apparent that I had gotten there at a very bad moment for the rabbi: it was clearly one of those days when absolutely everything which could go wrong, just had gone wrong (incl. a blocked-up toilet), and the rabbi had obviously been running around frantically trying to put everything back right, so frantically in fact, that he had completely forgotten about the stupid goy whom he was supposed to interview at such-and-such a time. When he saw me, a look of frantic horror crossed his face as he realized that here was one more thing that had just gone wrong and that he was going to have to deal with somehow. Well, anyway, Rabbi R. was a large man with a big, friendly face; and after recovering from his initial discomfiture, he welcomed me with a big smile and a warm handshake, and he had a secretary usher me into his study and get me something to drink, while he dealt with something more pressing (e.g. the plumber). Then, having done up his necktie properly again, he came in to his study, shut the door on everything that was going wrong outside, and we had the friendliest, most positive interview that you could imagine. He was absolutely focused on me and my record, and he asked good, pertinent questions which really were designed to elicit good answers \u2014 and he kept asking questions which made me think of things which I hadn\u2019t thought to mention in my actual application. His questions drew me on to mention a few things which might count as extracurricular activities (e.g. I had once worked for a program in which I tutored children from schools in underprivileged areas); and whenever I responded with something like that, he would remark, \u201cwell, I can certainly talk about that in my report\u201d or the like. At the end of the interview I felt as though under his questioning I had just metamorphosed into a much stronger candidate. He seemed to have a talent for putting a positive construction on things, and a will to do just that. If there was any one thing which made me stand out, any one thing which kept a lackluster application from going straight into the circular file, it was Rabbi R.\u2019s report on that interview which probably made me look a lot more attractive than my own application had. I\u2019m sure that as soon as I left, the poor guy had to get right back to frantically trying to fix all the things that were going haywire in his synagogue. I sincerely hope that God reserves a special place for him in Olam Ha-Ba. ",

In addition, this was before Harvard\u2019s very aggressive push into sweeping financial aid, which has caused the number of applicants to grow exponentially. So anything I can provide might not reflect what will help anybody gain admission today. Just for edification, I was not eligible for any financial aid (I might have been under the current rules), was not a legacy applicant, and do not identify with any ethnic/religious/etc. minority.

            "answer_text": "For my case, a number of things. I was a very strong science student at a top level liberal arts private school (Horace Mann School). Still, I kept most of my humanities grades in the A, A- range (I\u2019m pretty sure I had some B+s too though). As for science, I was done with AP Calc and Phys after sophomore year. I was already a two-time USAMO participant (top 150 math students in the nation back then). Junior year, fall semester, I took the hardest frosh phys class at Columbia and had a perfect score in all exams and assignments. I was also well on track to qualify for the USAMO again and was also doing well for the US Physics Team selection process (I ended up making camp that summer). I decided to skip senior year and apply to Harvard, MIT, and Princeton during junior year. Accepted to MIT and Harvard, rejected by Princeton (but wasn\u2019t gonna go anyway). Overall, the applicant class that year was really weak, and I was likely top 5, possibly better, in both math and physics for US students. Any other year, I\u2019d maybe be top 25 or so at best, so I was lucky. I\u2019m not sure if I would have been able to skip a grade and enter Harvard any other year. ",

But from experience here are the main three ways: Authenticity: You can do this by digging very deep and finding that profound story that really changed or augmented your life trajectoryMatch Your Strengths with Experience: Universities like Harvard want to see that your self-proclaimed strength or skill is backed by real experience and fact. So make sure to substantiate what you have done and showcase how you have made an impactFind Your Uniqueness: Harvard likes to have a VERY diverse class of students that don\u2019t just shine academically, but that will add value, unique value, to the incoming class. So find what your \u2018Brand\u2019 is, \u2018identity\u2019 your unique contribution and make sure that comes across in the application (note, it may not be just 1, unique attribute, but maybe what makes you you is a series of attributes that together make you unique!)If you have any further questions please email me at info@writetrackadmissions.com ",

He is an American born in Costa Rica. Another thing that they liked was he worked 20 hours a week, his senior year at a popular clothing retail store at the mall. That being said, he was also accepted to Yale, UPenn, Stanford, in total, 9 of 11 top schools, while wait listed on the other two. So, it's probably safe to say, he was a solid candidate. ",
