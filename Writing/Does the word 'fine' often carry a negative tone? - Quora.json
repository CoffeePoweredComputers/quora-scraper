            "answer_text": "Generally, the word fine does not often carry a negative tone. However, I think it is worth noting that what people say and what people actually think can be two different things. \"How was your meal?\"  \"Oh, it was just fine.\" It is possible I am really thinking:  it really sucked, I'm never coming back againmediocrepretty damned goodbelow averageabove averageSometimes, people just say fine because the word is inconsequential. \"How are you?\"  \"Fine.\"  \"Huh, what do you mean?  Why aren't you fantastic?\"   People will rarely ever challenge a response like, \"Fine.\"  As a result, people tend to throw the term around loosely, concealing what they really mean or think. I think the interpretation described in your example is likely accurate --  \"could have been better, but acceptable.\"  However, to put things into perspective, 'anything' could be better.  Rarely do experience the world in a 'perfect' way. ",

            "answer_text": "This may be more of a workplace question than a language question. In context of your job, your boss probably meant: this is good. Unfortunately, many supervisors are really tone-deaf -- and lazy -- when it comes to providing feedback to employees. For such managers, it's binary: fine versus not fine. The good news is that \"fine\" means you have nothing to worry about; your boss likes the work.  The bad news is that with such an incommunicative supervisor, it's hard to improve your work. And sadly, without positive feedback workers often worry and stress about some unknown thing they should be doing better. You can try asking, \"Do you see any way we might improve the project plan?\" This might spur your boss to give you the specifics you're seeking. ",

Notice that the plan is said merely to \"look fine.\" This should tell you that the speaker isn't especially thrilled about the plan, but isn't objecting to it either. \"Looks fine\" is a polite way of saying that something is passable. It is another way of saying: \"There's nothing wrong with it.\" This is not necessarily a negative judgment. But it isn't a ringing endorsement either. The word \"fine\" itself does not carry \"a negative tone.\" It can be said with sarcasm, in which case the speaker intends exactly the opposite of what the word means, but this would not be the case in the example you cite. When \"fine\" is used sarcastically, it is generally used by itself, as in \"Fine! Have it your way.\" ",

If you are unsure about the implication of the speaker's use of fine, follow up with, \"is there anything I can do to make it better?\" This will help both of you clarify. ",
