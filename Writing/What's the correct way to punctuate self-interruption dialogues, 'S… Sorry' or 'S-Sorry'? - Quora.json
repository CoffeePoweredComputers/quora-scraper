Ellipses generally indicate a trailing off of speech. It can be used for a drawn out phrase, or a mumbling away. \u201cWould you like to go\u2026 out with\u2026 me for\u2026 \u201d said the nervous boy to his crush. You could sometimes add more dots to make a longer pause: \u201cWell\u2026\u2026.. We have found something curious here!\u201d But don\u2019t overdo it! Also, a hyphen \u2014 or rather an em dash \u2014 indicates a sudden or abrupt disconnect or interruption in speech. Either the speaker immediately stops saying something to say another thing, or someone else interrupts the speaker. rather than a hyphen. \u201cIt happened on Tuesd\u2014no Wednesday.\u201d Of course, you could also just write it. \u201cSorry\u201d he stuttered, his apology at least sounding sincere.

Have you seen the size of that\u2026\u201d Colin stared in horror as the sinister creature emerged from the mist. For an interrupted sentence, I create an em dash, or double length hyphen. It can be fiddy to create a in MS word, necessitating the completion of the sentence with another letter and then backspacing (unless someone knows an easier way?). The example below is unconverted, but Word will change it when you type another letter immediately after. Thus: \u201cIt can't be true. Please tell me it--\u201d \u201cOf course it's true. Look at the evidence!\u201d Always follow the interrupt with an explanation, even if the character is interrupting themselves. \u201cYes, officer. We were at the beach--I mean, the marina, all night.\u201d Colin trembled with fear. He'd almost blown their alibi. ",
