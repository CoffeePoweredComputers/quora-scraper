She worked well but her other colleagues got irked due to her exit timing. Her boss did not have any problem with her timing but one day, a rumour spread that she comes early so as to steal data from the office and supplying to the competitor. Her boss called her and asked her the reason. She said that her father was at the last stage of cancer and undergoing the treatment at the hospital located near to their office. His chemo time is from 7 to 9 in the morning and 7 to 9 in the evening. To save her time, she used to come office early and leave early. But no one tried to look what was lying behind her life. Everyone sees what they have to see. ",
