            "answer_text": "It depends. Are you designing wireframes and lo-fi concepts? If you are, then sure, InDesign is fine. But, if you are trying to create hi-fi concepts, then no, InDesign lacks the control over graphics, filters, textures \u2026 that Photoshop has in its tools. It also has quite the overhead for just doing wireframes and such, but it does have really nice typographic controls. But, a really nice compromise between the two is Illustrator. Illustrator is actually a really good design program for conceptualizing websites. The contraints it has is actually a really good thing. It offers enough to get a good job done, but lacks all of the crazy crap that Photoshop has that can get you in trouble. I will now take this opportunity to recommend not to spend too much time building elaborate hi-fi concepts in graphics programs. Learn to design in the browser as soon as you can. In the long run, you will end up with a more efficient and effective process; that is, if you know how to code :) ",
