            "answer_text": "Most collections are pretty dark. But standouts off the top of my head are Silvia Plath's Ariel, Ted Hughes's Crow, and Anne Sexton's Transformations. For something a bit more contemporary, try The Man Suit and Scary, No Scary by Zachary Schomburg and Farrah Field's Rising. Or just go to the poetry section of any good indie book shop. I mean, the Spoon River Anthology, a true classic, is a collection of poems about dead people. Death is always a major theme in poetry, due to how it is the root of our greatest fears, confusion and sadness as humans; any halfway decent poet is gonna write about it. ",
