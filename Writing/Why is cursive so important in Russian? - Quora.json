            "answer_text": "it is important because we really use it. Why do we use it? because we are used to. But what do you really want to ask: how did the cursive become the main way of writing in Russia or is it really important to know the Russian cursive? If the first, I honestly don\u2019t know, I guess we have to go very deep to answer this question. If the second, so yes, it is very important to use the cursive because if you don\u2019t, your handwriting will be considered as childish, because in Russia only small kids write differently, not in cursive.
