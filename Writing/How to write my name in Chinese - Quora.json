(Korean: Ja Sul Lin ; Japanese: Ja Su Rin.) \u5609 \u7d20\u6797 \u5609 Ja (good) \u7d20 Su (White or light coloured) \u6797 Lin (forest) I think this is a nice name that matches you phonetically, is not too odd or grandiose a name and has good meanings and strokes. If you find the overpronounsiation of the S in Jasleen maybe just Ja Lin would be fine too: \u5609\u6797 Also, I\u2019m assuming Jasleen is the female name which means \u201cGood reputation\u201d so matching the meaning to Ja \u5609 is always a bonus in my eyes. A lot of comments below say \u601d (Su) meaning think is a good character if \u7d20 is too plain for you. You can also pick out any characters which are meaningful to you that match up phonetically.

According to the pronunciation, your name is commonly known as \u5948\u5609/\u5948\u683c\u513fin Chinese.But I think your name is best translated as \u3010\u5948\u5609\u3011or\u3010\u5948\u4f73\u3011My reasons are as follows\uff1a 1.\u3010\u5948\u3011\uff08n\u00e0i\uff09 If you have some knowledge of Chinese history, you may know that some modern Chinese characters correspond to ancient Chinese characters. For example\uff0cThe word \u3010\u5948\u3011 corresponds to the ancient word \u3010\u8010\u3011\uff0cThis word can be understood as \"patience\u201dand \u201cendurance\".It can also be interpreted as \"a strong willpower and a strong personality\".In Chinese culture, our nation has always praised this character.This is also the character that every Chinese hopes future generations will have.Morever\uff0cThe family name\u201c\u5948\" is rare in China.If you come to China to study or communicate, this can help you avoid some embarrassment of name repetition.Some names based on translation software or Internet trends will always appear common or strange, for example, many Chinese people's English names are jack or rose. Then\uff0clet's talk about how to choose your first name.I think \u3010\u5609\u3011or \u3010\u4f73\u3011is very good as your first name.And I will analyze their meanings in detail below, which can help you make better decisions 2.\u3010\u5609\u3011\uff08ji\u0101\uff09 This is a very complicated Chinese character in the eyes of foreigners.But despite its complexity, it is one of the most popular names in China.

If you choose \"\u5609\", it means that you are initially integrated into Chinese culture 3.\u3010\u4f73\u3011\uff08ji\u0101\uff09 The word \"\u4f73\" combines all good meanings. Firstly\uff0cThe word \"\u4f73\" stands for a person's beautiful appearance. \uff08\u59f1\u4fee\u6ec2\u6d69\uff0c \u4e3d\u4ee5\u4f73\u53ea\u2014\u300a\u695a\u8f9e\u00b7\u5927\u62db\u300b\uff09\uff08A slender, well-built woman is the most beautiful\u2014\u300aSongs of the South \u300b Secondly\uff0c\uff08\u9e7f\u95e8\u6709\u4f73\u58eb\uff0c\u535a\u89c8\u65e0\u4e0d\u8bc6\u3002\u2014\u300a\u5bc4\u5468\u5b89\u5b7a\u8336\u300b\uff08\u201c\u4f73\u58eb\u201drepresents a man of great learning\uff09 Besides\uff0c\"\u4f73\" represents for good human character in China.\uff08\u5170\u6709\u79c0\u516e\u83ca\u6709\u82b3\uff0c\u6000\u4f73\u4eba\u516e\u4e0d\u80fd\u5fd8\u2014\u300a\u79cb\u98ce\u8f9e\u300b\uff09\uff08\u201c\u4f73\u4eba\u201drepresents a man of talent and good character\uff09 From what has been discussed above\uff0cI think \"\u5948\u5609\" or \"\u5948\u4f73\" is the most suitable Chinese names for you.If you don't like these two names, you can reply to me and I will give you other Suggestions.Thanks\uff01  ",

You can play around with the different characters that have the same pronunciation, find one you like, and stick with it. The more advanced way is you can play around with the tones. Using the different tones in Chinese, you can combine them to form the one that sounds just like your name or something similar enough to your name but sounds prettier. Once you\u2019ve done that, then you can go back to choosing the right characters for those tones. With the two names I\u2019ve provided, the former one is the one that sounds most like your name but the latter sounds prettier. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, there are many characters that are pronounced \u201cer\u201d so you can make it \u611b\u73e5\u7433 as well, or any other combination that you see fit. Hope this helps!

            "answer_text": "You mean you don\u2019t have a Chinese name and wish to create one. If that\u2019s the case you will have total freedom in choosing any Chinese name you like. Chinese name usually has meaning and choosing a name is not a random process. Sometimes you may have chosen a name with some profound meaning but the sound rhyme with something stupid or not nice, that\u2019s the worst outcome. It happens from time to time and not being a Chinese, you won\u2019t know until someone tells you with a grimace or an outright laugh. So it\u2019s better to let a knowledgeable Chinese (not me) do that for you. What I can do is to give you some basic guidelines. In general you want a name which sounds similar to your English name. On this route, there are two ways to go. The first is simple transliteration. That would work best for common names like David or John. The second method is to choose a name with good meaning but also has similar sound. This is more difficult and is an art rather than science. This is better done by Chinese with good background in Chinese language or literature. If you ask me, your last name can be \u53e4 (meaning ancient) or \u8c37 (meaning valley), the former is a common Chinese last name, and the latter is less common but still a lot of Chinese have that last name. There are many possibilities for your first name depending on whether you are a he or she. If you are a he, it may be \u65b0\u745e (meaning new luck). If you are a she, it may be \u5fc3\u7acb (meaning a resolute heart). My suggestion only. Note for Chinese, the last name go first so it will be \u53e4\u65b0\u745e or \u53e4\u5fc3\u7acb. Actually on second thought, both names are quite gender neutral and can be used for either sex. ",

I had a teacher from Zhejiang province who pronounced his \u201cw\u201d sounds as \u201cv,\u201d and starting your Chinese name with a \u201cw\u201d would probably be the way most people would transliterate your name. Your name ends with a final consonant, and Mandarin has only two of them. Fortunately, one of them is \u201cn.\u201d If your name rhymes with \u201cmoon,\u201d then phonetically it would probably end up being translated as something that transliterates as \u201cWa-ru-en\u201d and sounds more-or-less like \u201cwah-roo-un.\u201d \u201cWatson\u201d is transliterated as \u6c83\u68eeW\u00f2 s\u0113n, so the first character of \u201cWa-ru-en\u201d might be \u6c83.

I would say it's like a new life\u2026 you get to choose a new name without having any attachment to your original name. Even many Japanese, Koreans and other Asian people have another name in Chinese, even though they have similarities in language but still they select a new. I Hope you can select a beautiful name!

If you want to translate it directly, other answers may be more helpful.If you want to get a traditional Chinese name, I will tell you how to name yourself and your friends. Your name sounds like \u827e\u4f26 so we can choose \u827e as your Chinese family name.This word means sailor, right?(I\u2019m not sure) We will search it in Chinese poems. I find these words: 1.\u77e5\u6d25 It\u2019s from an old poem in Song dynasty which is called \u6c34\u9f99\u541f. \u77e5 means you know something very well, \u6d25 means waters like sea or river. So the word meas you know every water and you are erudite. 2.\u884c\u821f It\u2019s from a famous Tang poem called \u6e21\u8346\u95e8\u9001\u522b and its writer is Li Bai, who is one of the greatest poets that ever lived in China. The sentence is \u4ecd\u601c\u6545\u4e61\u6c34\uff0c\u4e07\u91cc\u9001\u884c\u821f, Li Bai wrote it when he left his hometown to travel to another province. It means when you look at the water on the boat, it will remind your feelings of hometown. The river become alive and make a long-way farewell to you. You leave home but you will always miss it. Now you get two Chinese name to use, \u827e\u77e5\u6d25 and \u827e\u884c\u821f, they are natural and sounds beautiful to our Chinese. Don\u2019t forget me if you decide to use one of them. ",
