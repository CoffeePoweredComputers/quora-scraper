            "answer_text": "These are really different sentences. \u201cI am happy with you\u201d has one connotation focussed on \u201cyou\u201d and another connotation focussed on \u201cI\u201d . In the first instance, being happy with \u201cyou\u201d implies my happiness is increased because of you. The spoken sentence would even put emphasis on the word \u201cyou\u201d. If you use this sentence in a romantic setting, make sure the tone is correct for the moment, or it will sound like a judgement - next explained. In the second instance, \u201cI\u201d have made a decision and, as such, \u201cyou\u201d are the correct choice. Emphasis in \u201cI\u201d . It has an implied distance between the \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cI\u201d and is more judgmental. As in, \u201cyou\u201d have become a part of a comedy team and your sense of humor serves as a good foil for the other comedians and the result is riotously funny. Your boss then says, when you ask him if you are going to stay working with the team, \u201cI am happy with you.\u201d You can see that without the emphasis, this sentence should probably not be used in a romantic context!!! The other sentence says that I am happy \u201cfor you\u201d. This could be said in a quiet, I-just-got-rejected tone. In that case, you are supposedly happy for the person who is getting married to someone else. Not you. Or, you could be genuinely happy for someone else's good fortune! And your tone of voice would impart that!!! \u201cWoo hoo!! I'm so happy for you!!!\u201d Meaning: I am happy that something wonderful just happened to/for you and that makes me happy, too! ",

            "answer_text": "A hundred answers to this question already. Pretty amazing, isn't it? I also join this chorus to throw in my humble pie from different perspective in a lighter vein. \u2018I am happy with you' looks like a dialogue frequently used in the films at some stage towards the end of romantic engagements following a period of courtship extending from a few days to a few years. It's a prelude to the final,\u201dWill you marry me?\u201d Do the the people in real life express this sentence and live happily ever after? Your guess is as good as mine. It happens only in the utopian land of Shangri la. The happiness usually begins to wither away soon after the honeymoon is over before escalating into full scale warfare ending in the court of law. The couples that can learn to navigate through this tough terrain are lucky to trade the 'I am happy with you\u2018 phrase 'until death do us part' of course with lesser degree of intensity compared to premarital \u2018I am happy with you'. So much for \u2018I am happy with you'. \u2018I am happy for you' also expresses happiness of a different kind. The coach of a football team that has just beaten its archival expresses happiness to the team, 'I Iam happy for you for your excellent performance in this crucial game'. This happiness, like the one from its romantic \u2018counterpart I am happy with you', is also short lived. After a defeat at the next encounter, the expression transforms into, ' I'm extremely disappointed with your for poor formance'. Similarly, parents looking at the report card of his son or daughter may say \u2018I'm happy for you'. You know well what they would say if the report card from the the school didn't inspire happiness. ",
