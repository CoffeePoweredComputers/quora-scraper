            "answer_text": "Dear Mr./Ms. X, I am one of the biggest fans of yours/ your products. It has been n years that I am following your progress/ your work. At the moment, I have some interesting ideas about your products/ work to share. There are 3 main points. Firstly, \u2026. Secondly,\u2026 Thirdly,\u2026. If you have time, let connect with me via ABC to have further discussion. Have a nice day ahead! Best regards, Guoph Baruto  That is a sample letter. In fact, you can apply for several kinds of letter. The structure is as follows: Firstly, start with a short introduction about the relations between yourself and his/her work/ concern, then the purpose of your letter.Secondly, describe the key points from the expected purpose above. It is better to keep things short and sharp. The letter is just a trigger to reach out more.Thirdly, give an invitation to have a deeper conversation.Finally, end with a thank or nice words about him/her because it is a common action of skipping the letter of a stranger but he/she has spent time to care about your opinion.Hope you find my tip useful!

            "answer_text": "It depends on whether they've written or spoken to you already, and if so on what terms. If the person- as is increasingly the case- has already used your first name, then use that in reply. Always preface this with \u2018Dear' (Dear Richard). Otherwise, use their surname and title. Easy enough with a man- dear Mr Jones- but more difficult with a woman. \u2018Ms' has gained currency as a title which avoids the pitfall of implying a marital status, but some women object to it and prefer \u2018Miss' or \u2018Mrs'. Good luck with that one. If you've no idea of the sex of the person you're writing to, then the standby is \u2018Dear Sir/Madam'. Contrary to modern belief \u2018Madam' is a formal and respectful term. If you know the sex but not the name of the person you are writing to I can find no suitable alternative other than \u2018Dear Sir' or \u2018Dear Madam'. ",
