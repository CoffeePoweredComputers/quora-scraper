            "answer_text": "I certainly hope not, because books written for children are often more mature and more beautiful than books written for adults. Authors like Dr. Seuss, A. A. Milne, Lewis Carroll, Maurice Sendak, etc. were able to put just as much meaning in their short little children's books as great, renowned authors with long novels. Children's literature is just as much an experience for adults as it is for kids - perhaps even more so, because it keeps those same questions we asked as kids relevant. ",
