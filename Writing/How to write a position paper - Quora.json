            "answer_text": "How to Write a Position Paper The purpose of a position paper is to generate support on an issue. It describes a position on an issue and the rational for that position. The position paper is based on facts that provide a solid foundation for your argument. In the position paper you should: \u2022 Use evidence to support your position, such as statistical evidence or dates and events. \u2022 Validate your position with authoritative references or primary source quotations. \u2022 Examine the strengths and weaknesses of your position. \u2022 Evaluate possible solutions and suggest courses of action. Choose an issue where there is a clear division of opinion and which is arguable with facts and inductive reasoning. You may choose an issue on which you have already formed an opinion. However, in writing about this issue you must examine your opinion of the issue critically. Prior to writing your position paper, define and limit your issue carefully. Social issues are complex with multiple solutions. Narrow the topic of your position paper to something that is manageable. Research your issue thoroughly, consulting experts and obtaining primary documents. Consider feasibility, cost-effectiveness and political/social climate when evaluating possible solutions and courses of action. The following structure is typical of a position paper: \u2022 An introduction \u2022 Identification of the issue \u2022 Statement of the position \u2022 The body \u2022 Background information \u2022 Supporting evidence or facts \u2022 A discussion of both sides of the issue \u2022 A conclusion \u2022 Suggested courses of action \u2022 Possible solutions The introduction should clearly identify the issue and state the author\u2019s position. It should be written in a way that catches the reader\u2019s attention. The body of the position paper may contain several paragraphs. Each paragraph should present an idea or main concept that clarifies a portion of the position statement and is supported by evidence or facts. Evidence can be primary source quotations, statistical data, interviews with experts, and indisputable dates or events. Evidence should lead, through inductive reasoning, to the main concept or idea presented in the paragraph. The body may begin with some background information and should incorporate a discussion of both sides of the issue. The conclusion should summarize the main concepts and ideas and reinforce, without repeating, the introduction or body of the paper. It could include suggested courses of action and possible solutions. In case, you need some help you can contact Supreme essay service. Those guys are real professionals in what they do.
