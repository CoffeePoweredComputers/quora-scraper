            "answer_text": "Well, I actually had the opportunity to pitch my take to the powers that be and write a script that was considered for the fifth Rambo. Sadly, at the time, Sly was busy doing Expendables movies and didn\u2019t want to revisit the character. And this was even before he returned to the role of Rocky in Creed. Since Sly has said that he\u2019s done with the character after this fifth film, well, f*** it. Here\u2019s a rough draft of my pitch with a short synopsis of the script I wrote. My title was Rambo: Last Blood. And this was a few years before the upcoming film was titled that and even before the script for this upcoming film was conceived. While it\u2019s an obvious title, I like to think that maybe my pitch pushed them to roll with it (probably not). My pitch was a full franchise reboot, beginning with the final John J. Rambo installment of Rambo: Last Blood. If you read the below, you\u2019ll see that I introduce a new character named Gunnar. The next generation Rambo. The end of my Rambo: Last Blood would begin a franchise reboot with Gunnar as the Rambo archetype (no Son of Rambo or Rambo recasting). Note: Our goodQuora friend Sean Hood worked with Sly on a fifth Rambo before me (I can\u2019t remember the title). He made the introductions when it was evident that Sly wasn\u2019t rolling with the script they worked on together. So, here was my Rambo: Last Blood story/pitch. We introduce the new rebooted First Blood Franchise with the final installment of the Rambo franchise RAMBO: LAST BLOOD Rambo, living the quiet life on his family ranch, is recruited to train an elite Special Forces platoon for a top secret mission in the jungles of Mexico, only to discover that he's been framed as a domestic terrorist working with the Mexican cartels to assassinate the President of the United States. Rambo must use his skills to escape from a sadistic CIA interrogation camp and then, with the help of an ally that reminds Rambo of himself, hunt down the very men he trained as they follow through with a plot to shoot down Marine One and hold the president hostage for their own hidden agenda. The Rambo: Last Blood script introduces a new character named Gunnar. Gunnar is the Rambo for a new generation. Same type of warrior, different war. He and Rambo teamed together to take down the Valdez cartel, as well as the men who betrayed them both, and saved the President of the United States. Rambo, however, didn\u2019t survive. He gave his life for his country one last time and walked off into the jungles of Mexico, mortally wounded, never to be seen again. Gunnar, still haunted by losing his men in a Black Op a year before he and Rambo met, is now hitchhiking across the country on a personal mission to deliver the death letters to his fallen brothers\u2019 family, which were entrusted to him before that fateful night when they were ambushed. THE REBOOT No one can replace the iconic image of Sylvester Stallone as John J. Rambo, yet the world will want to see this franchise continue. A new chapter has begun. A new character has been introduced. The same skills. The same intensity. But a different time. A different war. We continue the franchise, free of the moniker of Rambo, who sacrificed his last breath for his country. The next film opens with the FIRST BLOOD moniker. Not a remake. Not a reboot. But a re-envisioning, with William Gunnar as our new hero as he stumbles upon a war he didn\u2019t want to fight but was forced to. GUNNAR They drew first blood, not me. The first installment of a new First Blood franchise would mirror the original Sylvester Stallone film in many ways. We open with Gunnar hitchhiking the highways of Washington state. He\u2019s on a personal mission to deliver the death letters of his fallen brothers to their families. He stumbles upon a small town within the mountains and encounters a self-entitled and somewhat sadistic sheriff who doesn\u2019t like outsiders. As in the original, Gunnar, likely suffering from PTSD as well, defies the sheriff\u2019s request that he move on, leading to his arrest and eventual escape. We\u2019d offer Gunnar his own story and different spins on the First Blood mythos. We could even introduce Gunnar\u2019s own mentor figure, mirroring the Colonel Trautman character. Sequels Any possible sequels could lead to further mirroring and homage to the Rambo films. A second First Blood feature (Could even be titled Gunnar: First Blood Part 2 for posterity sake) could show Gunnar being recruited to return to the Middle East, perhaps for a rescue mission to save American soldiers. Casting Archetypes in mind for the role of Gunnar could include Tom Hardy or Joel Edgerton. Both could play the reluctant warrior character very well. Those are just two actors that could breathe life into this role and make it their own. Closing This type of reboot and re-envisioning is something audiences could grasp, offering them a new hero with the same mythos of Rambo, introducing First Blood to a whole new generation. This would also allow Mr. Stallone to stay involved with the First Blood franchise as a producer and possible director. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> We\u2019ll see if the actual upcoming Rambo: Last Blood \u201cborrows\u201d any of my story elements. I\u2019m looking forward to that film though.  ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, I can\u2019t imagine how you could come up with a better way to cap the series than the ending of Rambo. I thought that really brought it around full circle for me. In order to bring it back around, I\u2019d probably bring it back to a story the mirrors the first movie, and draws further from the original First Blood novel by David Morell. I\u2019d pit him against a Gulf War veteran cop in reflection of Sheriff Teasle being a Korean War veteran he was in conflict with in the original. I\u2019d also try to draw more on the book\u2019s view of them as equal men who both make mistakes as a result of their different experiences, including the different ways their country viewed them on their return home. At that point, using something more like the novel\u2019s ending would bring an appropriate ending to the series. ",
