It does say on it: 80 percent of all written paragraphs, including this one, feature the word \"the.\" This word is the most commonly used word in the English language. So why doesn't \"the\" have its own symbol? So you can read the rest of the article and see what this guy is suggesting. ",

To save time in writing or typing? It\u2019s not a long word anyway. The English language is not like Chinese: we don\u2019t have symbols for words, except for, for example, & and $, and these are only used in informal text. ",
