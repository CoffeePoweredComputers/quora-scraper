            "answer_text": "Hi, It purely depends on how valuable your articles are or how much value you can produce. I have worked with different kinds of writers and - 1. some are very good at writing (at using words and creativity) but they don't have knowledge of the topic 2. some are very good at telling you things or explaining a topic but don't have good writing skills 3. there are also who can give very good articles and you will be amazed by the quality but they copy more than 80% content from 2 or 3 different sources online and then wrap up the work almost in no time. 4. there are people who are talented enough to write good articles but they don't want to spend too much time on research or data collection that is important in some cases (also for tech blogs). 5. then there are people who are really bad at article writing but manage somehow and working on very low prices. Startup blogs need them because all they want is quantity and not quality because of low budget. In the end, you should look at yourself and review honestly where you stand. Price per article or per word depends upon how much profit you are giving to your blog or your employer. If you are new, you need to know how good or how interesting or how useful or how informative your articles are in comparison of other available articles online. Start with low to average salary and earn better with experience in terms of total number of PUBLISHED articles over the time. Best Wishes ",

            "answer_text": "The price range is incredibly wide; anywhere from $3 to $300+ for an article of that length. The wide range in price is a function of the value perceived by the buyer.  Some buyers simply need content to fill their Private Network Blogs. It's purely for SEO purposes; their reputation isn't at stake and no one is going to read it anyway! These buyers pay cheap offshore labor at the extreme low end of the pay scale. Major industry publications that require extensively researched, well written and in-depth content occupy the high end of this range. Infographic: How to Calculate Your Freelance Hourly Rate provides great insight into determining how much your time is worth. Use this as a starting point in figuring out what you should charge. Since you don't know the client's budget, you run the risk of pricing yourself too high. But there's always lots of low-paying work available on those writing platforms. You can fill up an entire week working at $5 an hour, if you want! Seriously though, the buyer has a set price in mind, even if they haven't told you. The question is whether they can afford you. So determine your hourly rate, figure out how much time you're willing to spend and that's your price. ",
