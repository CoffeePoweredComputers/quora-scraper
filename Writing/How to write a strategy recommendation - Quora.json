            "answer_text": "A strategy recommendation is a proposed plan of action that must be presented to management before action is taken. It contains a specific goal, plan of action, and expected results. Since this task is often sensitive, you must spend enough time to ensure that it is thorough and accurate. Here are some of the steps involved when working on a strategy recommendation: Come up with an outline. Before creating the strategy recommendation, you need to develop a framework to help you arrange every aspect of the strategy coherently.Write a summary. Condense the \u2018gist\u2019 of the research into a few digestible sentences to give the reader a quick overview of the document. I would advise you to save this part last since you will have a better understanding of the plan.Describe the company. Talk about the history, accomplishments, and services offered by the company.Analyze the strategy. Focus on the main weak and strong points of your plan. Anticipate any possible questions regarding your chosen approach.Discuss the budget. The management will like to know how much it will cost to implement the strategy. Enumerate the expected expenses to the last penny.Review the document. The last thing you want is to submit a strategy recommendation full of errors to management. Crosscheck every point and make corrections where necessary.The next stage is to present the strategy recommendation to your boss. Try to master every point and prepare for possible questions. Keep the narration brief and straight to the point. ",
