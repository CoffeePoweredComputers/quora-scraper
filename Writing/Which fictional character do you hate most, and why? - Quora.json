            "answer_text": "It might be unfair of me to say this, but the character that I have the strongest negative reaction about is Peeta Mellark from the The Hunger Games. I just hate everything about him and his frosting-covered fingers. So much.  I know, he's really not such a bad guy. There's nothing objectively awful about him, and I don't think he's a villain. I know he's not evil--but oh how I hate him nonetheless. And perhaps I'm being mean or unfair, but before you think me heartless, let me explain... One of my many problems with Peeta is first his popularity. I mean, I know Umbridge and Joffery and Cruella are worse, but so does everyone else, so they don't bother me. But so many people like Peeta! So many girls love Peeta. So many people think he is perfect for Katniss (gag). I don't think he'd bother me as much if most people also had the same opinion as I did about him. My chief problem is the type of love that Peeta represents, and that pisses me off most about him. He's kind of this \"love at first sight\" type: saw Katniss singing as a kid, loved her quietly from afar. But how could he really love her when he didn't know her at all? (to me that's just so sad b/c it's not based on any sort of compatibility or trust or anything...) So many books and stories have had love like this, and to me, guys to think that if they just wait long enough, the girl will eventually like them. This bothers me 1) because it encourages stalker-types, 2) it's kind of pathetic, and 3) it's not realistic love at all, and 4) it undercuts a woman's authority/agency/empowerment because she says no thanks, guy says, however nicely, maybe I can make her change her mind! And girl eventually does...Now, I know real life is complicated, people change, change their mind, etc. But as a theme--especially in a book that is supposed to be about a strong woman--this really bothers me. I mean, she and Peeta don't know each other at all, and then the fact that she is motivated by how much she \"owes\" him is just twisted and unhealthy, and when you throw that on top of how much she and others seem to think Peeta is better than her, I just can't stomach it. My feelings on this are further complicated by the fact that most of what Katniss does for Peeta in the series is based on what she \"owes\" him because he's so \"good.\" And this rankles me all the further. 1) Peeta only gets his \"goodness\" or \"purity\" or whatever b/c he has Katniss around to do the soul-crushing dirty work of killing in the Games. So, that just pisses me off on principal. Also, I don't see Peeta as so good. I mean, he's willing to lie and manipulate to get ahead in the Capitol and Games...and maybe that saves him from killing, but it's a moral quagmire for sure. Katniss has a purer heart, in my opinion and I respect that she does what has to be done. I'm sad that the rules of her world are so horrible that she does have to kill, but there's a sort of integrity to that. But Peeta? I don't know. To me, because he does play into the Capitol's publicity-persona so well, he does \"dirty\" himself a bit. Again, not saying that he's evil or anything, and not saying that's not a sort of survival tactic in itself. But in the second book, Katniss and Haymitch start to view Peeta as this really good, sweet guy while Kantiss is inferior, and that's total BS in my point of view. This point my just be a derivative of how I understand love (or, you could argue, fail to). But I find Peeta pathetic and clingy. Like, it's great to love some one, it's great to do anything for them (up until a point), but to have self-respect, you have to have an identity outside of that love. Again, Peeta's version of love is dangerously close to what unhealthy and stalker-ish \"love\" can be. At one point, they talk about their nightmares, and he says, \"my nightmares are always about you being gone. When I wake up and you're here, I'm okay.\" That just makes me want to barf. Like, have some self respect! Again, I can't quite explain why that draws such a strong reaction from me, but it puts Peeta in a place where he seems to not be whole or able to function without Katniss, and Peeta needs to be able to do that, and he deserves to be able to. Peeta, to me, represents this whole \"I'd do anything for you\" and \"I'm nothing without you\" love. And that's not good. Not healthy. There's a loss of self in that love, a lack of respect, and it really bothers me. Then, there's this whole issue of consent. Peeta doesn't tell Katniss about his crush, which isn't bad in the small scheme - or at least, not malicious - but it does force her into playing up the romance. Peeta might not have known this, but since Katniss is touted as a \"strong female character\", this forced love theme really bothers me (again, seem my concerns about stalker guys). And then, Peeta again doesn't tell Katniss about his \"we're pregnant!\" plan in book two. More consent issues are drawn in for me, and again Katniss is forced into something. I mean, I guess technically Katniss was forced into the Games, so maybe I'm over thinking this whole thing, but since Peeta is supposed to be nice, this really bothers me. It calls the whole trust thing into question. And it totally takes away Katniss's agency and empowerment, in my opinion, because she's forced to go along. She also does so bc she feels she owes Peeta. Because he's so good. Because she kills the people for him. And then, he becomes that angry-abusive type in book 3...and yes, he's got a very valid excuse (the Capitol hijacked/brainwashed him), but literature loves to give excuse violent behavior, and I again worry how these narratives impact real life scenarios (kind of like my whole stalker issue from before). Again, I'm not blaming Peeta for this, but how I hate this narrative!!! (I should also add as a side note here that I've never read Twilight or 50 Shades of Gray, and I'd probably hate them more than Peeta if I'd read them, but I'm smart enough to stay away) So, Yuck yuck yuck. I just want to tell that little p\u00e2tissier to ponce off. And yes, I know Peeta's a sweetie pie, but god, I hate him and everything he represents. So so much. Edit - I can't believe I forgot this part!! - but we have the epilogue in Mockingjay where Katniss and Peeta have kids...The book literally says that it took her \"five...ten...fifteen\" years to agree \"because Peeta wanted them so badly.\" I know relationships are a give and take and that compromise is important, but what the hell? Those ellipses to me read like drudgery and doom. To me, they imply he went on and on about it. Katniss says no for fifteen years and I can't interpret this yes any other way than her finally having been broken down, worn down, guilted even, into agreeing to have kids. And I just can't forgive Peeta for it. I know he's damaged, I know he really wants kids, but I don't care. I see this as a fundamental lack of respect on his part towards Katniss's wants and wishes (a respect I profoundly see in Gale, and another factor that just feeds into my understand of Peeta as someone who doesn't really know or get Katniss - which again makes his love unsubstantial and inauthentic in my mind and not true). And pile on that the reason Katniss agrees because he wants them so...that just feeds into her entire character of always trying to do for others, always feeling she owes others, especially Peeta, and I just feel dirty. Katniss doesn't get better, she doesn't change, she doesn't heal, she just gets by. I mean, the final scene is of her kids playing in a graveyard and her basically saying \"It could be worse,\" which yeah, it could be, but that's a horrible (if believable) way for her to end. (And then there is Gale, who's just incredible in my opinion, so many people think he's awful! I can't handle it! I've written extensive posts to that matter, if any one is interested. But whatever you think about Gale, let's just remember this, when the books began, it was probably the worst day in Gale's life b/c he had a greater chance of getting reaped than anyone else, and he still showed up with a smile to be with Katniss, he made a joke, dreamed about a better future, and stoically met the horrible unfair reality that was forced on him. Then, when something even worse happened--Katniss went to the Games instead of him--he did nothing but support her. When the war started, Gale fought for everyone--not just his family, not just his district--and there is something damn respectable and heroic about that (Peeta only ever fought for Katniss, the little wuss). Then, at the end of it all, when Gale's lost so much and is absolutely devastated, what are his final words to Katniss, \"shoot straight.\" That essentially means, \"do well,\" and considering what he and Katniss have been through by that point, I think that speaks a lot to Gale's character as a human being. Then, on top of that, Gale's character ends up in Two--the place he helped destroyed. I also infer tons about this detail. He went back to rebuild what he helped break, he faced the mess he made and helped fix it. God, I just love him for that, and can only assume he probably would have helped fix Katniss too had they ended up together...but alas, she got stuck with ol' Peeta....) More Edit: Let's remember that Katniss, in Catching Fire, chooses Gale, \"Gale is mine, I am his, anything else is unthinkable.\" She chooses him right after he's whipped, and right when she decided to support the rebellion. When she finally has hope and heart for a better life. Katniss chooses Gale when she wants to live. Then she gets sucked back into the Games and goes with Peeta because she thinks she is going to die, because, pretty much, why not if I'll be dead soon. That is just so freaking heartbreaking. Katniss deserved so much more and so did Peeta. (Even though I still hate him! which is my whole point.) ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: You\u2019re gonna get mad. Fair warning. Also, I\u2019m a black guy IRL so if you downvote or collapse this answer then you\u2019re CLEARLY a racist because you\u2019re suppressing a minority\u2019s right to freedom of speech.  Currently, I hate this guy.  My reasons for hating him have nothing to do with the character itself, but instead, everything that surrounds him. PART ONE: This is the angry part. I absolutely, positively, unequivocally DESPISE the way people are using this film to push their racial and political agendas. You\u2019ve got black people giving the black power sign at screenings, saying that white people are racist if they see the film, and yet racist if they DON\u2019T see the film, white people refusing to see the film, NOT because they\u2019re racists, but because they don\u2019t want to be SEEN as racists.  This is a message from an IRL black man to BOTH sides: You\u2019re a bunch of dumbasses and you\u2019re embarrassing literally everyone with your antics. This is a fucking Marvel movie, not the 2nd Coming of Malcolm X or Martin Luther King Jr. in a cinematic format. And stop acting like this is the \u201cfirst black superhero movie ever\u201d, for fuck\u2019s sake. You had an entire TRILOGY of Blade films, plus Michael Jai White as Spawn, Shaq as \u201cSteel\u201d, Meteor Man, Blankman, etc. You have many black superheroes in both televised and cinematic forms, so watch them for what they are: FICTIONAL STORIES. NOT POLITICAL MOVEMENTS. Take your \u201cBlack power\u201d, your \u201cwhite guilt\u201d and every other idiotic thing you\u2019re doing and shove it up your collective asses. Oh, wait, your heads are already taking up that space. And for god\u2019s sake, stop giving the actors grief because they aren\u2019t dating black women. People can date whoever the fuck they want. Oh, but \u201cBlack people can\u2019t be racist\u201d, right? Piss off. Y\u2019know, I often speak of the problems I have with the black community, and I always get some sort of response from a \u201cconcerned\u201d black person about how \u201csad\u201d it is that I have such animosity towards my own people. But the thing is, every time I turn around, I simply have more and more reasons to be ashamed to be black. I\u2019m truly embarrassed and ashamed to be black. And the source of that shame does not come from any other race but my own.   PART 2: Damn it, I was looking forward to this! WHY DID YOU HAVE TO RUIN IT?! When I watched Captain America: Civil War, I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the movie. The reasons why the Sokovia Accords were drafted was idiotic (it wasn\u2019t the Avenger\u2019s fault that there was an alien invasion, and you bastards were going to NUKE NEW YORK, but you want to give the Hulk shit because some people got hit with rubble!? IT WAS AN ALIEN INVASION YOU DUMBASSES. Fuck off!), that scene where the woman was giving Tony grief because her son died was bullshit, Tony actually FALLING for that crap was bullshit, and the way they argued their respective stances on oversight Vs. no oversight were also bullshit. But there was one character in the film that I really liked, and that character was Black Panther. Despite my earlier rantings, I must admit that it made me feel good to see a black character in a film that wasn\u2019t constantly acting like \u201cAWWW HEYALLL NAWWWWWW\u201d. T\u2019Challa (Black Panther) was a very sophisticated, refined, and dignified character. Everything about the way he was introduced simply worked out wonderfully. Even in the pursuit of revenge, he didn\u2019t fly off the handle like Tony. He was very calm and calculating, just like a character named \u201cBlack Panther\u201d should be. And it was because of his cool attitude that he was able to discover the truth of the situation, and while he was willing to overlook Bucky\u2019s actions due to being mind-controlled, Tony was unable to do the same. He even SAVED the life of his father\u2019s murderer in the pursuit of true justice instead of blatant revenge (solidifying his role as a true king in my opinion). Tell me this: How many action movie characters can you name off the top of your head who make SAVING the bad guy look badass? I knew then that Black Panther would be my favorite character in the Marvel universe. Not because of the color of his skin, but because of his temperament, his grace under pressure, his honorable actions. I deeply wanted a Black Panther movie, and when I heard they were making one, it was the first time in a long time that I\u2019d gotten excited, not just for a Marvel film, but for ANY film (the last movie I remember actually getting excited to see was Ninja Assassin). Hell, this was the first time I was like \u201cCool, a respectable black superhero on the big screen\u201d. As much as I hate to admit it, I did find a certain kinship with the character that I may not have found with a character of a different race. But I never would have wanted to politicize it. I would have simply basked in the glow of a new favorite black character (right up there with John Stewart (the black green lantern) and Static Shock). But now I can\u2019t even have that because ignorant assholes ruined it.  And now I can\u2019t watch the film, knowing that it will forever be tainted by all this bullshit. Edit: I can only imagine what\u2019s going to happen now that Chadwick Boseman is dead, but I can\u2019t think it\u2019ll be anything good. ",
