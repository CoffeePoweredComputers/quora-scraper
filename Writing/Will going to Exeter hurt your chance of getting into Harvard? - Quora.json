            "answer_text": "Hurt? Depends Improve? Depends. I\u2019m a current senior at Phillips Exeter Academy and I\u2019m right in the middle of the frenzied college application time. It\u2019s stressful, but thankfully our College Counseling Office (CCO) gives us some inside information regarding statistics of all colleges, including the elite Ivies. Here are the numbers: Graduating Class Size: A little over 300, depends on the year. In the past 3 years, 250 students have applied to Harvard, 31 got in. In 2015, 12/69 students were accepted into the incoming freshman class at Harvard University. In 2016, that number was 8/81. In 2017, that number was 11/100. Overall, that\u2019s a 12.4% acceptance rate, MUCH higher than the national acceptance rate. But, that doesn\u2019t mean you have a twice as likely chance of getting in if you go to Exeter. Because the average student at Exeter is of a much higher academic caliber than your average public school student. Nearly every Exonian who applies to Harvard is one that would have been the top of their class back in public school. That\u2019s why it depends. There are pros and cons of both. In public school, you can stand out. You can be the valedictorian and student president. You can be the head of Model UN at your school. You have a chance to shine. But, your application might get looked over. Your school won\u2019t stand out because every high school has a valedictorian and you can bet most of them are applying to ivies. At Exeter, your school will stand out. Most top tier colleges, including Harvard, have special representatives that deal with boarding schools like Exeter, Andover and St. Paul\u2019s. If your application to college is a hidden gem, they\u2019ll definitely see it. You will not get looked over coming from Exeter. That\u2019s a guarantee. The problem is, many kids arrive at Exeter and realize that they\u2019re not the top of the class anymore. It\u2019s becomes very tough to get into Harvard when you\u2019re in the middle of the pack, even if you come from Exeter. But\u2026 if you\u2019re at the top of you\u2019re class at Exeter, it greatly improves your chances to get into to Harvard. Close to the top of the GPA slice of Exonians, the acceptance rate jumps up to 30\u201340%. (It\u2019s really hard to get a high GPA at Exeter.) Obviously this isn\u2019t just GPA, but if you\u2019re involved in clubs and community service, you\u2019re passionate about learning, and you have a stellar GPA, and you\u2019re at Exeter, you can almost guarantee yourself at spot at a top university. I say almost, because in reality, college is a lottery. No one, almost no one, is guaranteed a spot at Harvard, no matter how much they might deserve it. But, unless you\u2019re Malia Obama herself, being at the top of Exeter is one of surest ways you can snag one of those 2000 precious incoming freshman spots. So if you\u2019re confident you can do that, apply. Hope this helped. P.s. Each boarding school varies with which ivies like it the most. If you want Columbia, come to Exeter. Columbia loves Exonians. If you want Stanford, consider somewhere else. P.p.s If you apply, don\u2019t mention that your reason for choosing Exeter is Harvard. They won\u2019t accept you. ",
