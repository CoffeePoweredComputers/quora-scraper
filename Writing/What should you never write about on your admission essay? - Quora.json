            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. What follows is what I hope is an in-depth answer to your question. I first wrote it for my blog. Recently I have been involved with several discussions on sites like LinkedIn about whether some topics selected as answers for admission essays are better than others. The debate has been heated. Some say that a well-written essay, on any topic, will help. Others disagree. Given that admission to highly selective schools occupies a central place in many thousands of students\u2019 (and parents\u2019) minds right now, a simple answer would prove useful. Unfortunately, there is not enough that is simple about getting in to schools whose acceptance rates drop each year, some now safely into single digits. I am afraid my answer will not necessarily be one that leads to a one size fits all \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. Life, as we all know, is complicated and often contradictory. Let\u2019s start with the basic clich\u00e9: never talk about religion or politics to strangers at a dinner party or almost anywhere else. Is this good advice for those who wish to write an admission essay about a passion or something that is an intimate part of their culture or lives? Thought experiments: Read the following italicized passages as though they had been submitted to an admission office in response to a question about a world or culture that the student comes from. IWithout Zeus, the world would be, if not a chaotic void, then at least a place empty of men. His defeat of Chronos was more than heroic; it was life generating for all of us. And yet for those of us living today it is hard to imagine killing one\u2019s father in order to ascend to a throne in Olympus. To climb to the heights comes as and through a sacrifice. Today, Zeus still oversees my daily life. I make sure my offerings contain the ritual meats, make sure not to offend him in any way. I know that if I transgress his dictates a thunderbolt might strike me down at any time. On the other and, knowing Zeus and the other gods are there watching each of us as we move through our lives gives me great comfort. I know there are powers greater than me and that my fate is not my own. If you stopped reading at this point, what would your interpretation of the student be? Is this some kind of joke or is it an attempt to recreate the mind of someone in the past? Could she be serious? I believe, as William James says, that the belief in something greater than oneself gives us the strength and courage to carry on despite setbacks. When my father died suddenly I was sad, but then recognized that this was Zeus\u2019 way of testing me for my own strength and courage. I had to take on part time jobs to help pay the bills and had to help my mother move through her grief. But his loss was simply the inexplicable will of Zeus and I am not in a place to question this. My small place in the world is to serve him in ways that I believe will add to his glory and make me savor the time I have been given here to do all that I can to live a life that will gain Kleos (Greek word for glory). Given this added information how do you respond to these words? She cites a well-respected thinker and tells us why her belief has helped her come to terms with the loss of her father. Does this make you sympathetic with her? Or do you think she is misguided for believing in a false god? I see it as my calling in life to carry the word of Zeus to others and to make them see the light before they are struck down by his mighty power. I hope to become a leader at your school who will share the word with others in order to serve the god of all. Now that she has put forth her missionary zeal to convert others to her belief are you sympathetic? Do you think she would add diversity to an incoming class? What if her academics were exceptional? Should this essay help or hurt her admission? Now go back and reread the essay except for the word Zeus, substitute the appropriate deity and details about Jesus or Buddha or Mohammed (or others). If you are person of faith and you substitute your deity for hers would you be inclined to like what she says? If you are an atheist would you be inclined to judge this person negatively? II The four horsemen are right. Religion\u2019s killed more people than it\u2019s ever helped. Dawkins, Dennett, Harris and the late Hitchens demonstrate scientifically and through reasoned argument that they believe faith in a big guy in the sky is pernicious to each of us. The history of men has largely been told with blood spilled over religion. Evolutionary biologists now agree that the belief in religion comes from our efforts to gain territory and power over our tribal neighbors. This happened thousand of years ago and it still happens daily across the earth. If people stopped believing in myths and move toward humanistic approaches to life there would be much greater peace in the world and a lot less suffering, especially on the part of women, like me, who are forced to live under strictures of religious laws that make what I am writing here enough to get me stoned to death. How barbaric a people we are. How do you feel about this person\u2019s essay so far? If you are a person of faith do you think she is misguided? Do you think she is courageous for saying things that could get her killed? Would this make you want to fight for her admission since she seems to come from a place where she is subjugated and under threat? Ever since my father passed away, I\u2019ve had to pretend that his death was the result of god\u2019s great plan. Our economic woes and my mother\u2019s depression are all for the good of souls it seems. When I told my pastor that I thought religion was a form of mental enslavement and that women should not be subservient to men, he told me that in the old days people with views like mine would be stoned to death. How loving a god this must be to take away my father and to let me live as though under a death sentence? After having read these words are you sympathetic to the writer and what she has to live through? If she were writing from within a culture dominated by another religion (say, Islam) would this change how you feel about what she written? Are you sure? I want to come to your university so that I can begin my efforts to obtain my PhD in neuroscience. I plan to follow in the footsteps of the many scientists today who are discovering the way religious belief is a harmful leftover from the time when humans lived on the Savannah in Africa. I want to open the eyes of the world to false belief so that we stop killing each other over whether one book written millennia ago is more sacred than another written millennia ago. I hope to change the world with the fire and light of reason I will bring to the superstitious. Given her goal of obtaining a science degree should she be rewarded for this interest? Is her goal of defeating religious belief something that should be taken into consideration by an admission officer? Will she face difficulties on campus because of her beliefs and if so should this be taken into consideration? She has overcome much in her life, has an academic plan, but is also quite strong in views. If she had exceptional academic preparation would you offer her a space over someone who had chosen to write about a less controversial subject? *************************************************************************** If all this philosophical meandering seems too abstract to address the issue of essay topics in admission, then I apologize. I raise these points because I think what a student writes about and how, when it comes to culture, belief, and religion can help or hurt in ways that students may not be aware of. Here are a couple of things that might be of more pragmatic use to those contemplating writing an essay based upon religious beliefs: If you are a student and your beliefs are what centers your life, you may need to think twice about the way you share this in an admission essay. This is especially true if you believe the word of God supersedes US laws. For example, if you believe that abortion is wrong in all cases, no matter what, because life begins at conception, then you have just put your words before an audience, demographically at least, that believes you are wrong for thinking this way. Most people in admission, at least at schools that are not religiously affiliated, believe in a woman\u2019s right to choose. If you try to demonstrate, in a short essay, that God's word supersedes the laws of the land, you are not playing the odds in terms of having a sympathetic audience. While all of us like to think we are open to others, studies show again and again that we live within, as a new book title sums it up, Moral Tribes. We define ourselves by what we are and believe, but we also define ourselves against those whose beliefs conflict with our own. Is it possible that people reading applications can read virtually any topic without making some kind of ethical or moral judgment, positive or negative, consciously or unconsciously? Cognitive scientists, sociologists and lots of others who have published highly regarded studies don\u2019t think so. A slightly tougher questions then: should admission application readers make moral judgments? If your answer is no, then does this apply to ideas only or to actions too? Should a student who has been suspended for violating school rules be looked at differently than other applicants? I think most would say yes. But what about if the student has joined protests for or against an issue that is a core belief of a reader? If, for example, a student has formed a group at school that says that gay marriage should be defeated, would this hurt a student\u2019s chances of being admitted? Should it? What if the student had been arrested for protesting a political or religious view she found pernicious? What if this student lived in the US? What about Turkey or China? Can breaking the law sometimes be admirable? If the answer is yes, would the people who arrested her for a crime agree? If you applaud someone for violating the law in defense of their beliefs should this action be judged according to personal beliefs of the reader, the laws of the US, or something else? I am in no position to enter the minds of the thousands of readers busily staying up way too late going through applications right now. But I can say, based on empirical experience and on data, that people respond more positively to people who write about topics we agree with. They are, after all, a part of our moral tribe. And this extends into teaching too. Are all approaches to Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet equally valid or are some so off the mark that the ideas are simply wrong even if well-stated? The questions I\u2019ve raised here do not have simple answers. That\u2019s the point of this entry. But I think it is worth stating that writing on certain topics when the odds favor that the reader will not, initially, be sympathetic, may not be the best approach. After all, has anyone ever changed a core belief you have held in 600 words? If so, please send the essay to me. These words are rare indeed. But they do happen. In fact, sometimes people change with only a phrase. Anyone who has read Augustine\u2019s 'Confessions' knows that two words \"Tolle, lege; tolle, lege,\" (pick up and read, pick up and read) sung by some children changed his life and the lives of untold millions who were influenced by his conversion. After all this, it might seem contradictory to end with what I am going to say here. As I said at the beginning, life is not without its contradictions. Any topic can be written about well or poorly. Great writing transcends topic. It is an issue of craft and not simply ideology. Knowing how to structure sentences, use vivid words and active verbs and supportive examples or data are all basics that work. On the other hand, readers of essays are not blank slates. Steven Pinker at Harvard has written a great book about this. We are wired in ways so that what we hear and see is not \u2018reality\u2019 but a small part of all that is said and done in any given millisecond. We respond to certain stimuli because that is what our wiring and previous experiences have structured us to do. It is not Pavlovian behaviorism, but we are limited to ways of seeing the world that are finite and shaded, some might say, through a glass darkly. If Pinker and others are right about this, then writers need to think quite a bit about audience before picking a topic. Finding common ground, whatever that is, will help students communicate in ways that will be rewarded. But I can\u2019t quite end without one more dialectical twist. There are still people who think that they should be honest about their beliefs rather than worry about gaming the system to ensure an advantage in life or in an admission decision. People like these want to dare to share ideas they care about, and say to themselves, \"the hell with what happens\" in terms of getting in to a certain school or a certain job. For these brave souls, there are some readers who, even if the ideology seems suspect, a great and spirited defense of a controversial belief will nevertheless still convince that particular reader that it is best to admit her. She will be great in a class because she is willing to defend her beliefs in ways that cannot be easily dismissed. And this may happen on a dorm floor or a debate society or a million other places during four years. History is full of heroes who have fought for their beliefs and won. And history is full of martyrs whose lives or opportunities have been lost because they did the same. And then there is Prometheus. He risked all to give fire, what metaphorically might be called the spirit of imagination, to man. He changed the world because of his daring. But he himself suffered the consequences. Such was the fate Zeus decreed. ",

            "answer_text": "Robert Charles Lee\u2019s answer is absolutely incorrect for a personal statement. It is good advice for a statement of purpose, but the two are not the same. The University of California school system has been kind enough to carefully define the difference and what they want in each: What should I include to anesthesiology personal statement? Parke Muth gives examples of two Essays on the \u201cThou Shalt Not\u201d list. He is absolutely right. No one wants to be dragged down into someone else\u2019s angst. Here\u2019s an example from my own life: When I was eighteen, I injured my hand at work. My father was in the hospital with a heart attack, and I had dropped out of school to get a job, to help my mother support my six brothers and sisters. I was working in a yarn manufacturing plant, and got my hand caught in a shredder. I spent most of the next year at home, suffering various surgeries, physical therapy, and boredom. I could easily write 500 words about this, or 5000. Do you want to hear in vivid detail what your hand looks like after it\u2019s been through a shredder? Shall I describe the sound of nerves and tendon snapping? The terror of being told that they might have to amputate three fingers, the two years of nightmares that followed? No one wants to hear that. I don\u2019t want to hear it. The short summary above is sufficient to tell an enormous amount about my family and my role in it, our socioeconomic status, and my physical injury. Mr. Muth\u2019s second example is what I call \u201cMy Most Unforgettable Character:\u201d \u201cMary is homeless. She carries her possessions in two shopping bags, which she never lets out of her sight. She wasn\u2019t always homeless. Once she had a husband, three children, and a suburban home. What happened? .... And that\u2019s why I want to work with the homeless.\u201d Why this is bad: This is often a really interesting statement -- about \t Mary. If the school is looking primarily for a writing sample, this will do; if it wants to learn more about the applicant, it won\u2019t. The third suggestion in his answer, quoting from Harvard\u2019s interest in having students devoted to their community, is apt. The standard \u201cclean hands\u201d volunteer work taken on by most high school students is pro forma, and rarely special enough or entertaining enough to merit an essay. When I\u2019m advising high school students about choosing extracurricular activities and community service, I try to direct them towards activities that are not \u201csoup kitchen\u201d volunteerism. If you\u2019re going to write about a volunteer activity, it has to be special for some reason. As I was thinking about this, I suddenly remembered an actual event from sometime when I was between 15 and 20 years old. It was snowing, a very wet, heavy snow for Philadelphia, and perhaps 6 inches had accumulated overnight. For reasons that I can\u2019t specifically remember, my brother and I had been awake all night. (This was not an extraordinary occurrence, since he and my mother both worked in restaurants and didn\u2019t get home until 3 o\u2019clock in the morning.) For some reason, David and I decided to go out when it stopped snowing and start shoveling and cleaning off the car before the footfalls of rush-hour pedestrians made the task much harder. We finished shoveling in front of our house; then we decided it would be nice to do the same job for the elderly woman who lived next door. And after that there was the neighborhood butcher who had been so generous in throwing a little extra into whatever poor thing we were buying.\u2026 And then\u2026 And then\u2026 And then we had circled the whole block! Why did we do it? At some point we had become tired, blistered, and cold. But we thought of it as some great combination of a practical joke and practical magic, the kind of thing that is meant by that trite bumper sticker from 20 years ago that said, \u201ccommit random acts of kindness.\u201d Then we went to sleep; I don\u2019t know if we ever even heard how other people felt when, trudging out their front door with snow shovel in hand, they found that the snow shovel fairy had visited them in the night! Someone must have said something, because I do remember discussing it a day or two later. But it\u2019s a great example of who I am. I don\u2019t join groups; I don\u2019t pledge monthly donations. I perform random acts of kindness that constitute practical magic. Now look at the difference in both the work done and the essay that you can get out of it! I can promise you that that essay would stand out in a lot of admissions officers\u2019 minds! In fact, I think I have to pop over to Facebook and remind my brother of what we did that year. \u2026 Okay, having given my brother a pleasant memory to wake up to, I can get back to work. Cynthia Ward Hemminger\u2019s link to a list of 10 don\u2019ts is generally accurate, but a bit too, uh, general. Don\u2019t write about do-gooder events, unless they\u2019re of the time you shoveled the snow for the whole block. The two pieces of advice I\u2019ve seen that I disagree with are: don\u2019t talk about something controversialdon\u2019t talk about arrests, addictions, etc.While it\u2019s true that you shouldn\u2019t talk about your devotion to the One True Faith, or the time you picketed the abortion clinic, there are extreme things that you can talk about if they turned into a significant learning experience. For instance, I have a story that I share from time to time about how not being racist moved from a good idea to a heartfelt goal. Christmas Eve at our house was always open house from dusk \u2018till dawn. At some point there was a knock on the door, and I opened it to a very large, very black man whom I\u2019d never seen before. I didn\u2019t do anything \u201cracist;\u201d I just asked whether I could help him. But something in my face and my body language said something more. Fortunately, my mother had turned to see who was at the door, and recognized her coworker, saving me from further embarrassment. But in that ten seconds, I saw his face fall, and I promised myself that I would never do anything to make a person feel like that again. That\u2019s why my door is always unlocked, and I always shout, \u201ccome on in!\u201d before I even see who it is. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s controversial, but the significance of the learning experience outweighs the potential danger of the topic, and says something that some people might find profound. As to arrests, addictions, and abuse, they should never be the focal point of a personal statement, although they should be addressed if the school requires it in any of its questions. They can be part of a personal statement when they involve a story about your life, an evolution of some sort, or an epiphany. For instance, I was arrested for the first time in my life about two years ago. One of my neighbors received an iPad for her birthday, and couldn\u2019t figure out how to set it up. I was definitely the \u201cgo to\u201d person in the apartment complex for these technical activities, and she dropped it off at my house on her way to work. After the usual two hours of trying various things and calling service lines, I managed to get to a screen that said, \u201cTHIS iPAD HAS BEEN LOST. PLEASE CALL\u2026\u201d I called the number. I explained who I was, how I happened to be in possession of the iPad, and I would be happy to meet with the person the next day. I thought we could meet for lunch, she could show me the receipt, and I\u2019d give her back the iPad; this would also give me time to explain to the woman who thought she owned it what was going on. To my great shock, the police showed up at my door two hours later and arrested me! I was photographed and fingerprinted! I was humiliated. And I was willing to go to jail rather than let a working woman who was the mother of four children, the youngest of whom she was still nursing, be hauled off to what would be for her a much more terrifying experience than it would be for me. The case was eventually dismissed, although it took four months. The self-righteous Loretta on the white horse still wants to challenge the state of North Carolina for making a crime to be in possession of a stolen item with no element of intent necessary (a legal no-no), not to mention how something that says it was lost can be construed as stolen. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an interesting story in there somewhere. [I do lead a very unusual life; every single thing I\u2019ve ever written on Quora that I say I\u2019ve done or had done to me is essentially true.] I give these examples to say that the generalities of thou shalt not are pretty appropriate; but as Arlo Guthrie proved with \u201cAlice\u2019s Restaurant,\u201d you can find an interesting story in some of the oddest places. And when it comes to personal statements, the interesting story is the most important part. When someone is reading thousands of essays a year, something that\u2019s refreshingly different without being emotionally painful can make an enormous difference. And all the rules about what to write about have exceptions. But make sure that the exception is in the values and lessons it shows, not in the shockingly unique fact that it happened to you. ",
