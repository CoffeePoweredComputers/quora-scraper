            "answer_text": "It depends on the writer, the type of projects they take, and the amount of time they have to focus on the work. Dabblers or those who take low-paying work might make no more than a couple hundred a month. Those who write for a living typically gross between $2,000 and $8,000 per month. Remember, you don't get to keep everything you gross. A third or more will go out the door in taxes, and you'll also need to pay for business tools like a laptop and Internet at a minimum. It's possible to make a good income as a freelance writer, but you need the necessary skills to land gigs that pay well. A penny a word won't cut it. ",
