            "answer_text": "The success of a children\u2019s book depends on many factors. If you want to see books that have been successful peruse the winners of the annual Caldecott and Newbery Award winners. Caldecott winners are picture books. Newbery winners are not picture books and basically for grades though 8th grade though can be enjoyed by older readers and adults as well. I\u2019m just going to talk about what makes a great picture book. Picture books are made to be read aloud. So here are some factors to consider: readability-do the words match the picture and do the words flowart work-does the art appeal to the reader and does it match the text; don\u2019t have the text say Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall and not show itsolid conclusion-a good picture book has a proper resolution and does not leave the reader unsatisfiedIf we were discussing this face to face I might have a lot more to say, but I\u2019m going to leave it at what I have written. I expect you will receive a lot of good answers to this question. ",
