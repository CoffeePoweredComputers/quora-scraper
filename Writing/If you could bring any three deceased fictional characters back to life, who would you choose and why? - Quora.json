            "answer_text": "Great question! If I could bring any three fictional characters back to life, they would probably be (spoilers, duh): Fred Weasley from Harry Potter. To this day, his death may be the saddest fictional death I\u2019ve ever read or watched. Not only was he an amazing character, but his death separated him from his twin. That\u2019s just wrong. Twins\u2014especially those as close as they were\u2014should never be parted. So I would definitely bring Fred back so that he could be reunited with his brother.Either Sybil or Matthew from Downton Abbey. I debated as to which one (or both), I would like to bring back, but I couldn\u2019t decide. Although I was absolutely devastated by Matthew\u2019s death, I really enjoyed Mary\u2019s character arc after his death. I think his death pushed her to be stronger and claim her place in a new world, but it also hardened her and made her cruel\u2014which I also enjoyed seeing play out. I also really like Henry Talbot and thought he was very good for Mary, so I wouldn\u2019t want to cut him out of the picture. Sybil\u2019s death, on the other hand, just felt senseless. She had so much left to do with her life, and then she just died. And Tom never really recovered from that. All the women that he liked after Sybil were, frankly, terrible for him. So, I would probably bring back Sybil because she was absolutely lovely and Tom needs her.Either Agent Michelle Vega from The Mentalist or Gavroche from Les Miserables. Again, I couldn\u2019t decide which one I would rather bring back. Both deaths were extremely sad and felt basically pointless (Vega more than Gavroche). And Gavroche was a child which makes his death even sadder. However, in the context that his death occurs in, while it\u2019s sad, it can be seen as fitting. Vega\u2019s death just felt unnecessary. So I would probably bring her back.This was actually a lot harder to answer than I thought it would be. While a lot of character deaths I\u2019ve read or watched have been sad, they usually felt fitting. The deaths were depressing but satisfactory. And the deaths often contributed to the character arcs of other important characters, which was also very satisfactorily done most of the time. So, finding characters that I wanted to bring back, that wouldn\u2019t affect other character\u2019s arcs, was pretty hard. And, knowing me, I\u2019ll probably think of 10 better ones just after I finish this answer lol. ",

            "answer_text": "So many beloved characters are lost in fiction. We feel their deaths intimately. It\u2019s painful. You\u2019ve grown attached to a character, shared in their hopes and dreams only to watch the light fade from their eyes. Character deaths are grounding. They remind us of the harsh reality. People pass and life goes on. There are many characters we\u2019d rather deny the deaths of. If we\u2019d written the story, we would never have killed that character. But (when written well) character deaths serve a purpose. If a character were to be brought back to life, it could have major consequences on the story. The universe might try to right this error by killing off someone else in their place. The character may be so traumatised that they go insane. Take Boromir, for instance.  Ah, beautiful Sean Bean. He was a fan-favourite in Lord of the Rings and not without good reason. The Gondorians were a great people. Boromir sought to protect the white city, which lay right on the outer skirts of Mordor. He could not bear for such a long-lasting and proud civilisation to fall. He thought the Ring could solve their problems. In the right hands, it could turn the tide of war. He was tempted on several occasions, and tried to seize the Ring from Frodo. Then, when it was all too late, he realised his mistake. He\u2019d grown to love and care for the hobbits. He saw his father\u2019s power hunger in himself and it terrified him. He was remorseful. At the sight of Merry and Pippin overwhelmed by the Uruk-Hai, he leapt into battle to protect them. He fought on as arrow after arrow impaled him. He redeemed himself, but still lost the halflings.  Boromir\u2019s death was a pivotal point in Lord of the Rings. Frodo running away and his death was what brought about the breaking of the Fellowship. If he had survived, he might\u2019ve rescued Merry and Pippin. But in doing so, they\u2019d never have met Treebeard. The siege of Isengard would not have taken place. Denethor wouldn\u2019t have gone quite so mad as to burn himself alive. Faramir\u2019s encounter with Sam and Frodo may have had a different outcome, knowing his brother was alive. Gondor might\u2019ve gone to battle earlier with Boromir leading the charge. Being resurrected by the power of this Quora question, Boromir might\u2019ve felt that he deserved to die anyway, and things would get very dark very quickly. Without Boromir\u2019s death, it would\u2019ve been a significantly different story. All actions have consequences, folks. ",
