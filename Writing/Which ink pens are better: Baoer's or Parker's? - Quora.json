            "answer_text": "I have been using Parker pens for the last seven years. They write very well and their build quality is excellent(except the Parker Beta, which I found downright horrible). Over the years though I feel that the quality of Parker pens has come down. They are still good but there are other brands you can go for in the sub 1000 rupee range. I\u2019ve personally tried only the Baoer Eight Horse Fountain pen which cost me about Rs.200. It writes decently but I prefer to use my Parker Frontier over it. ",
