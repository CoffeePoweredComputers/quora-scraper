            "answer_text": "You should if you want to.  I think Iran should switch to the Avestan or the Latin script, the Arabic alphabet only has 3 vowels, while the Persian language has 6. As you can see the Arabic alphabet is pretty inconvenient for writing Persian vowels. Also each letter in Arabic has 4 forms: intial, medial, final, and isolate. So switching the alphabet would make it easier for both Persians and non-Persians to learn to read and write. I think it should be taught in schools so kids can grow up writing their language in this new alphabet. Besides Persians are not Arabs, why would they use their alphabet? Also, did you know that Persian is an Indo-European language? That means that Indians and Europeans can learn the language faster than Arabs ever will. But people don\u2019t because they think Persian is similar to Arabic, which is far from true. Some Persians might say that they will lose history by switching alphabets, this is far from true. Consider that Old Persian was written in Cuneiform, but no-one is complaining that history has been lost because people don\u2019t learn Cuneiform. Besides if they can read Avestan, they will recover some of their lost history, before the Arabs came to Persia. Wouldn\u2019t that be great? Persian people, you have to choose if you want to switch your alphabet or not, it\u2019s your decision. I think you should do it, because you are not Arabs. Peace. ",

Even if there are people who learn it, I doubt that they are large in numbers. If you want to learn the Avestan script, by all means go for it if interests you in any way - and if you have time, it might be an interesting thing to do. But if you want to learn it because you heard that some Iranians are learning it and you think that Persian might switch to the script one day, then no, it would be pointless. ",

I\u2019ve been trying to learn Avestan for the past 3 years and it has just recently become successful. It takes a long time and real dedication to be able to master it.
