            "answer_text": "My tip would be:* open Microsoft Word,* put two full alphabet line, from \u0410 to \u042f, then from \u0430 to \u044f, one under another. Choose a simple sans-serif font like Arial.* then select it, make one line \"italic\" and note how different the script became.Now the tip: actual modern cursive shorthand will not be differing much from that \"italic\" version. Yes, the Propis' which is \"official\" cursive script they teach in schools, would look a bit different, but in real life adults who write a lot and have to be quick, often produce handwriting closer to that \"italic\" which you will see.The Propis', for example, usually recommends that you connect one letter to the previous one. In real script, that hardly is done for more than a few letters. Or not done at all. Just like in \"Italic\" version of font. So ensure you can read text in \"Italic\" script. Then it will be much easier for you to understand a real Russian handwriting. ",

            "answer_text": "Learning how to write cursive Russian is probably one of the best options to familiarise yourself with it. To start learn the letters and practice them on this handwriting worksheet and continue by practising writing words and phrases. Don\u2019t worry if your cursive style is not 100% similar to the one which is suggested! Russians learn to write cursive very early and with time each person writes differently and understanding what is written can be more or less difficult depending on the case. To feel comfortable with cursive, it is important to spend some time reading different writing styles. Good news is, when you obtain an extensive Russian vocabulary, your brain will fill in the hard to make out letters at first glance to give you the most probable word. Good luck! ",
