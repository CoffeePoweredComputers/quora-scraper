            "answer_text": "If the assignment specifies that you must write about a hard challenge you overcame, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll have to do. Here\u2019s the trick: you\u2019re probably under-thinking what constitutes a \u201chard challenge.\u201d Not everybody has pushed the limits by attempting to climb Kilimanjaro. Not everybody has overcome the aftermath of a near-fatal accident, or has had to struggle with a debilitating illness. The challenge you overcame might be something simpler. The real criterion is the nature of the difficulty you overcame, why it was problematic for YOU, and how you overcame it. Need an example? Okay. This one is from my own past. When I was a kid, I was pushed ahead in school. I went directly from grade 3 to grade 5 on the basis of some ridiculous standardized tests that suggested I was smart and could actually think (clearly, the school authorities knew nothing about me\u2026.). Doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal, right? Wrong. I hit high school at age 11. I hit university at 16. I did okay academically, but the whole thing became a personal and social nightmare for me, and it lasted for years. It was NOT fun. Eventually, I found my own way past it all and pulled my life together, but that\u2019s another story. My point is that I overcame something that was a hard challenge FOR ME. Everybody faces such personal challenges, even if nobody else notices. Time to start sifting back through your memories to find a time when you thought you had to carry the weight of the world, even if you later found out you were wrong\u2026. I hope this helps. ",
