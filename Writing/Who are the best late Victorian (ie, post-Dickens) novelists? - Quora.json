            "answer_text": "The problem I find with novelists of this era, like Dickens, is that they are too humanistic in their outlook. The exception who puts more spiritual input into her work is George Elliot. I have to mention Conan Doyle who in addition to Holmes also wrote stunningly descriptive historical novels, as well as Jules Verne who wrote not so much science fiction but adventure stories with scientific and technological input, together with HG Wells who did write science fantasy as well as personalised social novels.
