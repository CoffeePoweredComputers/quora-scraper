There is a school of thought that it started in the US, in a lab that was subsequently shut down\u2026 Did the US Military Games Delegation Spread COVID-19 in Wuhan? | Orinoco Tribune CDC Inspection Findings Reveal More about Fort Detrick Research Suspension As Gabriel Bell says in his excellent answer \u201cxenophobia and racism\u201d are the tools. Trump has been using them as well, but a little more carefully, as he is very dependant on China at this moment in time. The fight will start once it all calms down. UK media spin doctors are very efficient, and the smoke screen that they are billowing around the governements incompetence, and the phrase \u201cprotect the economy first, some pensioners might die\u201d will actually do more damage than good. One of the reasons that it is a bad idea to hassle the Chinese over this, is that they are in a far better position than we are, the whole of Asia is coming out of this quicker than we are because of their discipline and their respect of their populations. Yes, it could be \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d, but which one? It is a coincidence that there were military games in Wuhan, which is the epicentre of the current outbreak. It is also a coincidence that the Fort Derrick laboratory had to shut down amid rumours of leaks. So both sides have a similar story. It\u2019s the blame game. Bearing in mind that we can no longer trust our incompetent governements, and since a long time you can\u2019t trust the media, who can we trust? Echoes from the past, The Asians, and the Germans are dealing with this with better results than all the rest of the planet. Why? Because they are disciplined and serious. They also have the most powerful economies on the planet, next to the US. The racial hatred and the whitewashing that both leaders, Trump and Boris, are doing at this moment in time is uniquely to save their own respective arses. Trump just blasts into people and will use the power of their legal systems to beat down the opposition and Boris will use the spin doctors of the essentially state owned press. Because that\u2019s how the world works. You don\u2019t like it? Nothing you can do about it, move along, nothing more to see. We\u2019ll be lucky if this doesn\u2019t finish in a war. ",

            "answer_text": " It's a rumour that just won't die. When asked whether the COVID-19 virus was genetically engineered in a lab, scientists have already said \"no\" rather firmly, but the matter of the new coronavirus' origin is unlikely to be put to rest so easily.Discussions around this subject have become even more pertinent since US government intelligence officials are reportedly investigating the potential source of the pandemic, focussing on theories that it may have originated in a laboratory, despite all evidence pointing to SARS-CoV-2 not being human-made. \"All evidence so far points to the fact the COVID-19 virus is naturally derived and not man-made,\" explains immunologist Nigel McMillan from the Menzies Health Institute Queensland.\"If you were going to design it in a lab the sequence changes make no sense as all previous evidence would tell you it would make the virus worse. No system exists in the lab to make some of the changes found.\" Back in late March, we covered a study published in Nature Medicine, in which the researchers investigated the genomic data of SARS-CoV-2 - particularly the receptor-binding domain (RBD) sections of the virus - to try and discover how it mutated into the virulent and deadly version we're currently struggling to contain.As a by-product of their research, they were able to determine that SARS-CoV-2 was not genetically manipulated. \"By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that SARS-CoV-2 originated through natural processes,\" one of the researchers, Scripps Research immunologist Kristian Andersen, said at the time.\"Two features of the virus, the mutations in the RBD portion of the spike protein and its distinct backbone, rules out laboratory manipulation as a potential origin for SARS-CoV-2.\" Although it is clear the virus was not created in the lab, there have been ongoing concerns it may have 'escaped' a research facility, with most of the speculation - understandably - focussed on the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). However, it remains just speculation. The Washington Post recently reported that US embassy officials had safety concerns about the lab back in 2018, and the institute did keep a closely related bat virus - but even that's far from a smoking gun. \"The closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2 is a bat virus named RaTG13, which was kept at the WIV. There is some unfounded speculation that this virus was the origin of SARS-CoV-2,\" explains University of Sydney evolutionary virologist, Edward Holmes. \"However, RaTG13 was sampled from a different province of China (Yunnan) to where COVID-19 first appeared and the level of genome sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is equivalent to an average of 50 years (and at least 20 years) of evolutionary change.\" Now, it is important to note that viruses can mutate naturally anywhere - in animal hosts, in humans, or even in laboratory cell cultures. Unfortunately, it's difficult to determine where and how the new coronavirus acquired its mutations, although most researchers think the process involved an animal host.Additionally, researchers are still investigating if the necessary mutations for causing the new disease occurred before or after SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans. The institute at the centre of the controversy has repeatedly denied accusations of being the source of the pandemic. Back in March, head of bat coronavirus research at WIV, Shi Zhengli, explained that when she first received samples from early COVID-19 patients, she immediately did a thorough investigation at her department, finding no match between the viruses her lab had been working on, and COVID-19 patients. \"That really took a load off my mind,\" she told Scientific American. \"I had not slept a wink for days.\"What experts do agree on is that a pandemic like this is no surprise. Scientists have been warning governments for years that a new disease was on the horizon, and that many countries were woefully under-prepared. For example, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, told the incoming US government administration in January 2017 about the inevitability of a \"surprise outbreak\", urging them to make preparations. \"We've been aware for some time that another coronavirus, like SARS and MERS before it, could cause a pandemic, and so in many ways, the emergence of a new coronavirus with pandemic potential is not a surprise,\" explains La Trobe University epidemiologist Hassan Vally.\"We have to be careful to not aid those irresponsibly using this global crisis for political point-scoring by giving any oxygen to these and other rumours.\" ",
