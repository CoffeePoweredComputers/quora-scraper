So in writing (fiction) you would write in the first person : \u201cas I left the house, I saw the evidence of the early morning rain, in the drops on the handrail as I walked down the front steps\u201dSecond would be \u201cyou hear birds and the sound of a car driven by someone in a hurry, you have to dodge quickly as you cross the road\u201d.Third: \u201cSarah saw the bus coming around the corner as she hurried down the street and she knew that she would miss it by a few minutes\u201d I just described one morning journey to work from the three different viewpoints.

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t worry about second person. It isn\u2019t really relevant in storytelling form. You may get the odd hint of it, but for the most part, stories are either written in first or third person. First person: I walked over to the bench and grabbed my coffee cup. Third person: He walked over to the bench and grabbed his coffee cup. Second person snippet (maintaining first person POV): I walked over to the bench and grabbed my coffee cup. You know how it is: we humans need our caffeine fix. The second person POV is the part where I say \u2018you know how it is\u2019 \u2014 second person is used to bring the reader in on the story and speak directly to them. Hope that\u2019s all helpful.

How do you justify to yourself, a whole afternoon; squandered, in a meadow, under an ancient oak. Are you proud of the time you have lost in such a trivial manner. Do you not weep for the time lost?
