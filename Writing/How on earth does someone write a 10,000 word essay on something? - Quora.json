            "answer_text": "10,000 words is about 40 pages. That is too long for something that is actually just an \u201cessay\u201d (ie your own thoughts and ideas on a subject. If it\u2019s a research paper on a topic you are an expert in, it could be a master\u2019s thesis or senior thesis as the culmination of an undergrad course of study. If a professor at the undergrad level is just casually handing out an assignment to write 10,000 words, without careful guidelines, it is an invitation to padding or outright plagiarism. It would take most people a couple of months to write a thoughtful and intelligent 40 page paper. I just looked at a paper I wrote as an undergrad\u2014it was a \u201cDirected Readings\u201d course, meaning that for a whole summer, this is all I worked on. I went to the Boston Public Library to find sources. My Works Cited page has 22 items, all of them books, and I had read substantial parts of most of them. It is 41 pages long, plus 4 pages of notes and 2 pages of bibliography. Writing it was the entire 3-credit course. I wrote it up by hand and then typed it on a manual typewriter on \u201ccorresable paper.\u201d (The year was 1972.) It would be a little easier today, but it is still a very large project. My topic was the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins. I learned a lot! But I would not call it \u201can essay.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "By doing one, typed, polished page per day. Each page has about 350 words. That would let you produce a 10,000 word essay in 28.5 days, if you write one page every single day. Frankly, that\u2019s not so bad as it sounds.. As an English major, I\u2019d typically produce three or four papers of that length every semester when you added up all my senior-level undergraduate and graduate-level courses thirty years ago. I\u2019d also add it\u2019s harder to write something short, polished, and concise of 10 solid pages than it is to write something bloated of 28 or 30 pages. In your comment to the question, you say that can\u2019t imagine having to write more than a hundred words on a topic. However, in that same comment to your question, you wrote a total of 59 words. I bet you produced that 59 word question in less than ten minutes. If you wrote for an hour and a half, that would be about 600 words (or two pages). That\u2019s already a few percent of the way toward a 10,000 word-essay. ",

Yet, you can finish it with devotion and by utilizing the correct system. Your issue with such a huge undertaking is likely the absence of time and scholastic assets\u2026\u2026 ",
