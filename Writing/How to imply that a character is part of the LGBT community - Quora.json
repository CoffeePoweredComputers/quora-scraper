            "answer_text": "Stop using the term gay community first of all. Second have the character notice people of the same gender. Or simply overtly think one is cute. What's the point of implication? Sometimes that seems a little closety. The fact that you're asking this question here means that you probably don't know someone to ask personally and maybe shouldn't be writing about it without some personal experience. We have suffered through enough disinformation without having more added no matter how good your intentions are. I'm not saying don't write it I'm saying get to know something before you put it out there. ",

If it doesn't suit your story for them to have a partner don't mention their sexuality at all. JK Rowling said Dumbledore (sp?) was gay after the books finished. You can leave it up to the reader. Don't use cheap and tacky devices that relate to stereotypes. ",
