Shot back Fired back Ejaculated (a perfectly good word for saying something quickly, but there are those readers who may not know it.) As for the popular injunction to avoid adverbs, I would suggest that you not take it literally. When you see that you have used an adverb, first remove it and ask yourself if the meaning changes for the worse. If not, leave it out. If so, as you have done here, scout for a single word that accomplishes your intended meaning. Instead of saying \u201cI ran quickly\u201d say \u201cI raced.\u201d You\u2019ll watch as your writing becomes exciting. ",
