            "answer_text": "Yes! I started doing it in\u2026 sixth grade, I believe??? I lost the one I wrote in sixth grade, actually\u2026. So, when I opened it, I read through it and made another one for the next year explaining what was going on then, what I liked, etc. Around the end of 7th grade (May, June, July 2019), we were looking at a lot of houses, because my parents really wanted to move. Eventually, in early September, we did! And it\u2019s really funny, because the letter I opened in November said something like, Oh, and are you living in Paola now? Because we\u2019re looking at houses a lot\u2026 Something like that. It was my past self knew the future! So I have another letter in my drawer that says \u201cDon\u2019t open until November 2\u201d, give or take a few days - I don\u2019t remember the exact date. In approximately around four or five months, I\u2019ll open it and make another one for 2021. It\u2019s really fun to do, actually, to see how you\u2019ve changed. For example, read your last year letter and you think, \u201cWow, I actually liked that movie then??!!\u201d or \u201cHow could I have done that?!\u201d I highly recommend trying it! ",
