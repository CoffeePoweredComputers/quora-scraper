The correct one would be \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u201d is grammatically correct but it cannot be used interchangeably with the first sentence. It cannot be used interchangeably since the first sentence is present and continuing. -\u201dDo not\u201d The second one is in the past. -\u201cDid not\u201d ",

For example ; I don't like swimming (I seriously don't ) anyway \u2026 this sentence tells us that even at this present moment I do not enjoy swimmingI don't know \u2026 this tells us that there is this particular thing that I am still ain't aware of ..A \u2018don't\u2019 is used as a negative question tag too when the helping verb is missing For example; You like him,don't you?You hate lying,don't you ?Knew is a past form of know. I hope it helps ! God bless ! ",

If you are talking about present situation , then you should say \u201cI don't know\u201d. If it is about past , then it is \u201cI didn't know\u201d You have to use 1st form of verb with don't and didn't. :-) ",

To do that, you chance \u201cdo not\u201d (do not=don\u2019t) to \u201cdid not\u201d, or \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d. The word \u201cknow\u201d does not need to be changed. So, you end up with \u201cI did not know.\u201d ",
