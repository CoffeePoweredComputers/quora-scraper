            "answer_text": "Some do, some don\u2019t. Some \u201callow\u201d it as long as no one uses existing characters. Some say \u201canything goes.\u201d Some hate it, and send their agents or even a lawyer to shut it down whenever it appers. You should be aware that technically you have no right to create fanfiction, and legally a creator has every right to shut you down. That said, I personally am in favor of it, but I will never, ever read it, because of the debacle Marion Zimmer Bradley got into with a writer of fanfiction who did something she liked with one of her existing characters. As was usual for Marion and Darkover fanfiction, she told the author she liked the idea, and was going to use it in her next novel and give her credit for the idea in the acknowledgements, as she had done several times before with other writers. The crazed fanfiction author, who by that point had gotten an agent who should have known better (you cannot copyright, trademark, or plagiarize an \u201cidea\u201d), then demanded full co-writer credit and half the money. Marion abandoned the book rather than deal with a lunatic, which caused all sorts of problems with the publisher, who was expecting that book and had put things into production already. Frankly, Marion was nicer than I would have been. My solution has been to allow fanfiction under Creative Commons, but refuse to read it. That\u2019s the solution for many others who allow it. ",

            "answer_text": "Some do and others don\u2019t. I learned this at a Kaffeklatch with Frances Hardinge at Eastercon in 2019, where she was asked where she stood in terms of fan fic. She, by the way, is strongly in favour of it. She also mentioned that many others are not. Those who do support it, see it as both a way of getting more publicity for their work (because readers of fan fiction might go out to buy the original source material having read it) and/or seeing it as validation - in a sort of \u2018you aren\u2019t really famous unless someone is shipping your characters on a fan fiction forum\u2019 way. Those who don\u2019t see it as copyright violation and some of those will pursue it legally (though so long as the copyrighted IP is not being used to make profit I believe there is little point in that and the risk of negative publicity is high*). Note, even those who support and encourage fan fic will very likely take legal action if someone tried to sell said fan fiction, or at least their publisher will. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery but not if you are trying to make money from it. Note that EL James\u2019s Twilight fan fic had to be changed dramatically before it could be published. I\u2019m not a follower of fan fiction sites (barely have time to write my own original works never mind trying to write using other IPs) but I have heard there are resources on those that list which authors support fan fic and which don\u2019t. it is worth checking out these lists before making a start on any fan fic if you want to avoid annoying the original author and getting a lawyer letter. *A friend of mine once ran a LRP based on the Conan novels - basically a fantasy LRP game set in a world of barbarians and thieves called Hyborean Tales. He got a lawyer letter from the Robert E Howard estate in the US - essentially a cease and desist or pay portion of profits demand. He replied with evidence of the non profit making aspect of his endeavour and they never followed it up. They obviously realised it would cost them more to pursue this than they would gain. ",

While I do not encourage fanfiction (and I do not read it) on the whole, I do not deny that it has had value for many writers, who later became accredited in various IP\u2019s we know and love today, such as Star Trek (franchise). As a writer/author, I would not allow fan creations of my works, unless such works were made specifically for fans to do something with. For example, if I wrote a book in a specific universe, released all of the lore I made for it, in another book, and specifically said that people were free to use the material, as long as they maintain credit to me in their disclaimer, and made clear it was a fan work. Another example in my case would be, if I decided to release one of my IP\u2019s into the creative commons. I don\u2019t think many authors have done that, but I could definitely see the benefits of doing so, given the right situation. As you might guess: I would never read such fan works myself. ",
