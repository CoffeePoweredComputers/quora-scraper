            "answer_text": "I never bothered to properly acclimate myself to formal typing practices (ie fingers positioned on home row) with QWERTY. So my typing ended up being a more chaotic hunt and peck with an evolved sot of \u2018macro burst\u2019 combinations- particular sequences of letters I found myself typing often I could bang out with lightning speed. As such, familiar content (scripts, programs, writing on familiar things) would be easier and quicker to type out. When I learned the Dvorak layout, I made an attempt to learn more formal typing practices. I wouldn\u2019t say I did so to 100%. And as I maintained a fluency with QWERTY, I\u2019ve sort of merged the two approaches. My hands are more consistently positioned; I don\u2019t have to look at the keyboard when I\u2019m on a productive tear, and yet there are still some \u2018macro bursts\u2019 when I encounter familiar sequences of symbols to type. It certainly works for me, and while I would never consider myself any sort of world class speed typer, I can out-type and out-produce so many I find myself in the company of, so it certainly works well enough for me to accomplish all I need to do and not have my typing speed or accuracy be any sort of productive liability for me.
