            "answer_text": "To answer this question I've checked the official website of the French postal services \"La Poste\". I could never guess how confusing it can be since La Poste isn't clear at all. Here you'll find below a picture extracted form the guidelines, which in my humble opinion are very similar to the way I address my letters inside France to a French destination, or from abroad to an address in France. (source : Page on www.laposte.fr ). I've never had problem so far, although it was only from another European country or from Canada.   The address has to fit on 6 lines maximum, and 38 signs are authorized on each line, all the text should be aligned on the left. I guess that for letters sent from outside France, the country name FRANCE in capitals has to be added as a 7th line just under the post code and locality name.The family name of the recipient should be in capitals.There is no comma between the building or house number and street name, and this number will always be before the street name.The post code has to be on 5 digits followed by the locality name. I hope that'll help. ",
