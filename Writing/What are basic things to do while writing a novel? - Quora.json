            "answer_text": "Basics\u2026well, Keep one thing in mind for sure that you're not supposed to tell or narrate a story to the readers. You have to make them feel, experience and live the story as it progresses, so that they leave wanting for more. When you describe some character of the novel, go in depths to be sure of each and every detail of what the character looks like,how he or she behaves in a particular situation,everything. From the tip of his/her hair to the the tip of the toe. Every minute detail. Draw a sketch if you want to. Have a storyline uncommon yet appealing and keep on making changes to the drafts until you're more than satisfied. And the last one of all, never listen to anyone's advice. Your story,you nail it, you rule. :) ",
