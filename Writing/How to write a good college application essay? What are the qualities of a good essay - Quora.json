Current college students: welcome to start your own group and help answer questions about your college! - One of the biggest mistakes that people make on their college applications is sounding overly generic. All too often, students answer the question \u201cWhy do you want to attend this school?\u201d with something generalized and clich\u00e9d about the \u201cliberal arts education\u201d or the \u201cworld-class professors\u201d or \u201cfascinating classes.\u201d And when students are asked to answer this same exact question for 12 different schools, they may find it very tempting to copy and paste their response. After all, aren\u2019t all colleges basically the same? However, it is important not to underestimate the importance of this question. Admissions officers go through hundreds of applications, and if you want yours to stand out from the crowd, then you have to think carefully about your answer. A generic response along the lines of \u201cI want to attend this university because of the opportunity to take liberal arts classes and develop as an individual\u201d will send your college admissions officer to sleep. More importantly, a clich\u00e9d response will signify to the college admissions officer that you aren\u2019t actually interested in their school. And colleges tend to not accept students who don\u2019t seem genuinely interested in them. Here are five ways to write a college application that isn\u2019t generic. 1) Reference the school colors, motto, mascots, or other symbols. For example, if the school\u2019s colors are blue and gold, you can talk about how you look forward to walking into your first day of anthropology class decked out in blue and gold. Or, if the school mascot is a lion, you could talk about how excited you are to attend a football game tailgate and cheer for the Lions. This is incredibly simple, but it can make a huge difference to your application. It would show the college admissions officer that you\u2019ve done your research, and you\u2019re genuinely excited about attending this particular school. 2) Talk about specific extracurricular activities, student organizations, and clubs that you\u2019re interested in participating in. It is important to make these as school-specific as possible. For example, instead of saying \u201cI\u2019m excited to join the school newspaper because I like to write,\u201d try saying something like \u201cI\u2019m excited to join The Harvard Crimson, because of its long and florid history, as well as its penchant for publishing controversial opinion pieces, such as \u2018When We Let Hate on Campus.\u2019\u201d Remember\u200a\u2014\u200acolleges want to admit people who will become active members of the campus community. Research all of the extracurricular offerings, think about which ones you would actually be interested in joining, and write about them with as much detail as possible. 3) Talk about specific classes, professors, and academic experiences that you\u2019re interested in. Many college course offerings can be found online with a little research. This way, instead of writing \u201cI\u2019m interested in studying biology,\u201d you could write \u201cI\u2019m interested in pursuing a degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology, and I\u2019m particularly excited to take the class \u2018The Brain: Development Plasticity and Decline\u2019 with Professor Sam Kunes.\u201d Even better, you could go on a college visit, which often comes with the opportunity to attend classes and even speak with professors. If you had that opportunity, this would be a great time to reference back to specific conversations you had with professors or specific classes you attended. This would show that you take initiative and that you\u2019re academically curious. 4) Reference back to conversations you had with current students at the college. A lot of information about each college can be found online\u200a\u2014\u200ainformation about extracurricular activities, academic offerings, symbols and colors and mottos. But some things cannot be found online. In order to really learn more about the college, it\u2019s important to talk to current students at the college. If you visit the college, you often get the opportunity to speak to current students and learn more about the aspects of the school that are less tangible\u200a\u2014\u200afor example, the social scene, the sense of community, the school spirit. You can write about those experiences in your college application. For example, you could say something like \u201cI\u2019m particularly attracted to this school because of the tight-knit sense of community and collaboration that many current students point to as the highlight of their experience.\u201d 5) Try to imagine yourself at this school. Close your eyes and really think about the kinds of things you would do every day. Maybe you will be relaxing in the lawn on a sunny day. Maybe you will be poring over ancient texts in one of the many beautiful libraries. Maybe you will be rowing down the nearby river with the intramural team. Maybe you will be making friends in the dining hall, tossing ideas for startups over mozzarella sticks. Maybe you will be a research assistant for a professor. Maybe you will be running a Model Congress conference in Hong Kong. Get creative, and write about how you see yourself spending a day at that specific college. ",

            "answer_text": "Below are the best tips for writing a good college admission essay 1. Be concise. Even though the Common Application main essay has only a suggested minimum of 250 words, and no upper limit, every admissions officer has a big stack to read every day; he or she expects to spend only a couple of minutes on the essay. If you go over 700 words, you are straining their patience, which no one should want to do. 2. Be honest. Don't embellish your achievements, titles, and offices. It's just fine to be the copy editor of the newspaper or the treasurer of the Green Club, instead of the president. Not everyone has to be the star at everything. You will feel better if you don't strain to inflate yourself. 3. Be an individual. In writing the essay, ask yourself, \"How can I distinguish myself from those thousands of others applying to College X whom I don't know\u2014and even the ones I do know?\" It's not in your activities or interests. If you're going straight from high school to college, you're just a teenager, doing teenage things. It is your mind and how it works that are distinctive. How do you think? Sure, that's hard to explain, but that's the key to the whole exercise. 4. Be coherent. Obviously, you don't want to babble, but I mean write about just one subject at a time. Don't try to cover everything in an essay. Doing so can make you sound busy, but at the same time, scattered and superficial. The whole application is a series of snapshots of what you do. It is inevitably incomplete. The colleges expect this. Go along with them. 5. Be accurate. I don't mean just use spell check (that goes without saying). Attend to the other mechanics of good writing, including conventional punctuation in the use of commas, semi-colons, etc. If you are writing about Dickens, don't say he wrote Wuthering Heights. If you write about Nietzsche, spell his name right. Read more.. ",
