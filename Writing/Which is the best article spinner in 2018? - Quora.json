What exactly IS Article Spinning? As Wikipedia notes: \u201cArticle spinning is a specific writing technique used in search engine optimization (SEO) and in other applications. Website authors may use article spinning on their own sites to reduce the similarity ratio of rather redundant pages or pages with thin content. Content spinning works by rewriting existing articles, or parts of articles, and replacing specific words, phrases, sentences, or even entire paragraphs with any number of alternate versions to provide a slightly different variation with each spin. This process can be completely automated or written manually as many times as needed. Many article marketers believe that article spinning helps avoid the feared penalties in the search engine results pages (SERPs) for using duplicate content. Most uses of spun content were considered spamdexing (a black hat SEO practice) years ago, but it is now admitted as a fair way to lower the similarity ratio, hence the near duplicate or duplicate content, on large catalogs of more or less similar items. Originally, most spun content was produced through automated methods, resulting in articles which were hard or impossible to read. However, as article spinning techniques are refined and used in a more sophisticated way, they result in providing readable articles that human beings may have trouble distinguishing from original content.\u201d Spin Rewriter delivers an entirely new level of language understanding Spin Rewriter's got a huge \u2014 and growing \u2014 table of synonyms, but unlike most spinners, it goes much further than that; It looks at the whole article - It doesn't just look up words \u2014 it analyzes them to understand their exact meaning.
