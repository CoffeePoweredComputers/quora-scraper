No excuses. If you really want it, you gotta be willing to put in the effort. If the effort proves too much, then you didn't want it enough. Don't follow your dreams\u2026lead them! Not all your books are gonna get published, just write them for the sake of writing. Write answers here on Quora, start a journal, get familiar with a pencil, (or a keyboard,) if you don't practice and get comfortable with your own way of writing, you'll end up feeling unhappy with your work. It will sound stiff, uncomfortable and forced, like the dramatic scripts I wrote when I was 8. I'm not gonna lie\u2026writing is hard. I gave up so many times because I didn't think I was good enough, even famous authors still doubt themselves, but writing is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful, and noble arts in the world. Sharing the gift of storytelling with just a few people is such an incredible thing to be able to do. Don\u2019t give up. Also, it's very useful to learn new skills when it comes to writing, so don't be shy about taking courses and workshops to help you write. Websites like Open University offer free courses on pretty much anything. I'm doing a course there about creative writing right now which is very cool. (I'm learning to improve my character development.) :) Just keep writing. All the time. Doesn't matter if it sucks\u2026you can't learn a new language without speaking it first, which means sounding like a fool for a while, but it's worth it. ;) (Edit: Wow! I made it to the digest! Yay!) ",

            "answer_text": "I was once at a keynote given by an author who said that the only difference between someone who is a writer and someone who is not a writer is that the person who is a writer, writes! So here\u2019s what you have to do to \u201cbecome a writer:\u201d WRITE Pick up a pen or a pencil and a piece of paper. Open up a google doc. Get out a stone tablet, or the notes app on your phone and literally just write things. But what do I write about? Most likely, if you want to be a writer, you have some ideas. But a basic principle is that you should write what you know. Sometimes, that\u2019s the most interesting. For creative writing, working seemingly mundane parts of your life into your writing makes it more realistic, but also more interesting for people with different experiences. Margaret Peterson Haddix, author of Among The Hidden grew up on a farm in an area that was being developed around her, so that\u2019s where she set the book. What she didn\u2019t realize was how interesting that would be for other people to read. For her, it was just life. For me, and other readers, it was interesting to read about the struggles of that setting (the neighbors complained about the smell of the pigs, the kids didn\u2019t have a forest to play in, etc.) If creative writing isn\u2019t your thing, writing what you know is still the way to go. Write a book about your favorite science, or about an interesting philosophy concept or whatever else you know a lot about. But literally the second you start writing something, you are a writer. ",
