            "answer_text": "Disguise it as a tax demand. Only joking - their accountants deal with that. To generalise and oversimplify only a little, the more famous a person is, the more people they employ to keep up the 'insulation' between themselves and the various levels of admirers/ stalkers/ begging letters/ well-wishers/ the needy mob. It really is down to persistence and luck: birthday cards are always in with a better chance. If an envelope looks obviously birthday-ish and it arrives two or three days before the right day its got a fair chance of being seen. How to get some sort of reply is much harder question - but if you are an admirer/well-wisher rather than a stalker you won't ask about that. ",
