            "answer_text": "No, actually that is biologically normal. Your body is able to carry a child to term and birth and is now pushing you to do it. You are mature enough to keep it alive and because you can, it is now an option for you to choose. The problem is, the world isn\u2019t set up for it. So 200 years ago, you had kids young like 15, but the world was set up for it. They got married young, divorce was not an option, so even if they didn\u2019t like each other anymore the marriage continued, the man worked, and the woman still had a place to live and food. Now, not so much. Bills are EXPENSIVE! Even assuming you met the love of your life and had a kid together and the kid was awesome and your partner was awesome and you lived happily ever after and never broke up, your life will still be harder than people who were able to \u2018delay gratification\u2019 and have kids later. Life is hard enough! Don\u2019t make it harder. If you don\u2019t finish highschool, your job opportunities get really limited. Even with a high school diploma, further education is needed for the good-paying jobs. You may think \u2018my partner will support me\u2019 Your partner (if the same age as you) won\u2019t be able to go to college or university to get a better job to support you because they will have to work to pay for bills that are due NOW. And studying is harder with a baby distracting and crying and pooping and even distracting by wanting hugs and giggling and playing. The only way past that is by mooching off someone else like your parents or his parents, and that is not fair. They might have plans for their lives that don\u2019t involve having a kid in their house crying at 3am waking them up. Even IF they let you stay they will probably not want to watch the baby all the time, and might be frustrated that their lives have been forced to go in a direction they didn\u2019t want due to someone else\u2019s decision. Childcare is EXPENSIVE Like, if you work minimum wage, eats 50 percent of what you make in a day. Now you are working for half the money an average minimum wage person gets. And that is assuming things go well. There are \u2018highschool sweetheart\u2019 stories about the people that meet young and are now on their 50th anniversary and everyone goes \u2018awwww\u2019 But they are paid attention to because they are the exception. Having a kid is like throwing a grenade in a relationship. When you are older, you\u2019ve already suffered grenades. A partner you thought you were going to be with forever dumps you. Someone you love dies. You get really sick at least once and feel like you might die from it. The world continues to turn and you realize that you can handle what life throws at you, because you have to. Because the other option is suicide, and that is a shitty, shitty option. So you learn to cope because you have to. With babies, you don\u2019t have to. It is really easy when things get hard to say \u2018f**k it, I\u2019m out\u2019. But then you dump the load on someone else to carry. It is easy - especially for a male partner - to decide to leave because it is too hard to have a kid around all the time, and easier to have them on weekends only instead. If they decide to see the kid at all. And child support is not much money, if you are even given any. And if you say \u2018f**k it, I\u2019m out\u2019 then kid is now another relative\u2019s problem, or stuck in foster care where they will feel abandoned and might be abused. And if you carry it alone, carrying it alone is awful. Single mothers are brave but have the problem of balancing between making enough money to keep the kid alive and cared for and having enough hours at home to actually see the kid occasionally. If you wait to have a kid until you\u2019re done highschool AND finished college or university (choosing a course with an actual job at the end), that\u2019s an awesome time. You and partner have steady jobs so two people with medium incomes are there to support baby instead of one person with smaller income supporting three people. You have friends having kids at the same time so you can hang out with them and let your kids play together while you hang out. You can afford to do stuff with your kid like swimming \u2018baby and me\u2019 classes and meet more moms at the same age as you doing the same thing as you. You can take turns with friends watching both kids so you can drop your kids at their houses one day and clean, get groceries, have a bubble bath, take a nap, and be happy to see your kid again instead of having no money, holding a crying baby, waiting for their dad to come back from work and watch them for awhile so you don\u2019t go insane because you watched them the last 16 hours and are TIRED because baby thought it would just cry randomly instead of sleep (babies do this). Please, please wait. Having a baby is great, but it is way more fun to have kids AND money AND a committed partner AND a bedbug-free, non-shitty place to raise them AND happy grandparents that really want to spend time with their grandkids AND a good job that you don\u2019t hate going to. You can have it all. It sucks to wait for something so awesome, but it\u2019s worth it. Look up \u2018delayed gratification experiments on children\u2019 in Google. I wish you the best! ",

            "answer_text": "The thing that is happening with your brain is immaturity. You also need to be educated to what it means to be a parent. Never mind that being pregnant and having a baby (labor) are no cake walk. Ask yourself a question, why do I want a baby? Better yet, find an adult you feel comfortable talking to without judgment and tell her the reasons why you want a baby at such an early age. Being a parent is a HUGE responsibility not to be entered in lightly - at any age. Being a teenage mother has serious adverse consequences for you, the baby, and the entire family. Babies are not dolls. They are demanding and helpless human beings that need your attention 24/7. They require sacrifice. That means you put their needs above your own. Your parents are not going to raise your baby - you are. That means you will have to miss out on the fun of being a teenager. You will miss college because you have to get a minimum wage job to support your child. Even if you decide you can\u2019t keep your baby and will give him up for adoption, your life will forever be marred by your decision to get pregnant at 14/15. You are likely to get a lot of good answers to your question. But I\u2019ll leave you with this. Get educated about what it takes to care for an infant and be a parent. If you love babies, get a job as a babysitter. While this won\u2019t be a complete picture of what is like to care for a baby 24\u20137, perhaps it will satisfy your need to nurture someone. There will be a time in your life when you will be mature enough to assume the responsibilities of being a parent. I assure you now is not that time. If this desire of yours is an attempt to escape loneliness or the difficulties of being a teenager, getting pregnant is not the solution. I hope you talk to someone about this and get to the bottom of it. Explore the subject and you\u2019ll be enriched by what you learn. ",
