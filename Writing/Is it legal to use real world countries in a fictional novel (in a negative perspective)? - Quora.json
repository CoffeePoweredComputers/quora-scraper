            "answer_text": "In the United States? Yes. Because the First Amendment means you can do anything you want in fiction. Nothing is illegal in itself. Libel and defamation are civil torts, not crimes, meaning you can be sued for damages, but even there, the people you libel need to be able to prove you\u2019re lying and that you know it. For \u201cpublic figures\u201d (which are not clearly defined under the law, unfortunately) they not only need to prove you\u2019re lying, they need to show it\u2019s deliberate malice on your part. And then there are plagiarism and copyright infringement and trademark violation, but they aren\u2019t relevant here. Anyway, a country has no standing to sue for defamation. You can say anything you want. You may seriously piss people off, but you won\u2019t be breaking any laws. In the U.S. In other countries the laws are often very different; in the UK you can run afoul of several laws on defamation, heresy, hate speech, etc. ",
