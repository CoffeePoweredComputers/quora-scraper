            "answer_text": "You end at the beginning. Huh? Before you start writing your story, you must have a clear view of how the book will end. Why? Because that is where the main character must wind up. If your main character doesn't have a clue as to what's going on, neither will your reader. Now, make sure you have a hook. What's that? A hook is simply a sentence or two placed in the first few pages of a novel or the first page of a short story that points directly to the last chapter. It is what motivates the main character to move ahead. Examples of hooks: \u201cGosh,Bob, this looks like a treasure map!\u201d \u201cYour mission, Mr. Bond, is to\u2026\u201d \u201cUnless we can get $5000 by next Friday, Mommy's gonna lose the house.\u201d ",

There are definite conclusions, even though nothing external has changed: There sat the two grown-up persons; grown-up, and yet children; children at least in heart; and it was summer-time; summer, glorious summer! Gee-\u2026. I could tell that one was a doozy. There are also conclusions which try to wrap everything up. He loved Big Brother. Gertrude and Ronald were wed. Their happiness was complete. Need we say more? Yes, only this. The Earl was killed in the hunting-field a few days after. The Countess was struck by lightning. The two children fell down a well. Thus the happiness of Gertrude and Ronald was complete. ",
