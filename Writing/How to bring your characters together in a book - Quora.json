            "answer_text": "Well, what are they going to be doing together _after_ they all meet? Can the inciting incident involve a geographic location where they all might be? For instance - a shooting at a bar. They don\u2019t all have to be patrons at the bar. One could be in the bar. Another could be walking his dog and hear the shots, and arrive in time to help with first aid. Another could be a cop, or an EMT, called to the scene. Etc. Or an earthquake could strike the city they live in. Or a tornado. Or a war. Or what have you. Is it possible that one or more of them have a shared background? Or instance, one is a schoolteacher\u2026 who happens to teach biology - or kindergarten - or run the afterschool 4H club - and had her friend the chicken farmer bring in some eggs about ready to hatch, for the class to observe. Maybe one applies for a job at the office where the other one works. Or is recommended for a promotion onto somebody\u2019s team. Or to a project (business) or task force (law enforcement) or study (academia, laboratory science, could also be business) being set up to look into [something]. Characters, plot, and background all need to work together for what you\u2019re creating. If you have half a dozen wonderfully fleshed-out characters\u2026 Who ordinarily wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with each other\u2026 And you have no plot point that would force them together\u2026 Then you have half a dozen wonderfully fleshed-out characters who are useless to you. You either need different characters, or you need to work on your plot and/or their backgrounds to give them a reason to come together. It\u2019s as simple - and as difficult - as that. But for the love of Cthulu, please do not have a crew of intrepid adventurers meet at the Red Dragon Inn in the Happy Halfling Village. In fact, if the setting is even vaguely D&D-like\u2026 Don\u2019t have a bunch of random strangers meet in an inn or a tavern, period. Not unless there\u2019s a really, really, really good reason. And even then, think twice about it. Unless you\u2019re writing a D&D parody, in which case go for it. ",

            "answer_text": "That one\u2019s easy, really. Your plot generally requires it. And if it doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s your plot-problem. Meeting If you want several characters together who don\u2019t have anything in common, create something plot-wise that forces them to meet. Chances are you already have that part ready in your plot, you just need them to move over towards that particular spot at the same time. A serial murderer? A detective might find clues that they\u2019re all ex-members of a group whose defunct members are being killed off left and right. They don\u2019t have to know each other, they just have one thing in common - they used to be part of the same group at different times. Inviting them all to the bureau means they meet. A thriller? These people are - by various circumstances - getting to a spot where they meet. One may get a call from a friend to drop by. And while driving there, he sees something curious and checks it out. Another one waits at the bus stop and sees the same flash of light. Curiosity killed the cat and it\u2019s still a 20 minute wait, so why not? A third one actually works in said building, so whenever you hear a loud bang when everyone\u2019s supposed to be gone, you go investigate. And all of a sudden you have three people meeting up in front of a building. Plot When it comes to a story, your plot generally has ways of connecting people together. They don\u2019t even need to meet each other altogether. Just two people connecting does the trick. Then you let person A meet someone else and person B meets another person. All of a sudden you have four connected people who don\u2019t know all of the other characters and that will eventually get them all together when your plot calls for it. Having a similar goal (i.e. finding a treasure, finding the culprit, fleeing a killer, breaking into school for retrieving their items that were taken from them, seeking shelter from a meteor storm, attending a party) means they will eventually meet up by calculated coincidence. It\u2019s all up to your plot to create these parts. I hope that helped! ",
