I suggest that you start with a general search for \u201cbusiness plan examples\u201d and \u201cbusiness plan templates.\u201d Throughout your search you will find information that will allow you to make your search queries more specific. Eventually you can drill down to finding examples and templates for business plans specifically in your business area. In a couple of hours of searching, you should have enough information to begin putting together your own business plan. Yes, there will be a need for customisation. But this actually removes the need to write the entire plan from nothing. Iteration is truly the new invention. You don't have to come up with this from scratch. ",
