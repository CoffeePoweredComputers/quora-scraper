            "answer_text": "Research: Research the industry, the company, the job. How big is the pie (the industry), what slice of the pie does this company own (market share)? What is this company desperately trying to grow? How does this job help them achieve their growth? How critical is this job for the company? For the industry? What are the items that is negotiable within the job? Salary, benefits, vacation, office vs cubicle, personal chef...what? If you don't understand what is negotiable, you cannot negotiate well.Identify Leverage: If this is a high demand job and is critical to the future of this company - you have more leverage. If it is a job that has plenty of candidates and needed, but not important to the company - you have less leverage and the company has more. At this point, is there a way you can create leverage? A way to show them that you bring a unique set of skills relative to other candidates that allows you to add significantly move value?Use leverage - be tactful but not naive: If you have a high demand job, a competitive offer from another company can work to your advantage. I was called by a \"headhunter\" is definitely a leverage squeezing tactic. You don\u2019t want to come across as someone so focused on advancement that you have no loyalty. But, you don\u2019t want to be so naive that you think that the company is completely loyal to you either. If you don\u2019t fight for yourself no one will. But if you only fight for yourself, then you are probably not a good leader.Use anchoring to your advantage: It doesn't matter who gives the first number. In fact, you are better giving it than they do. How? Check out the salary range of the job. Then, look at the top paying people. So if the salary range for your job, experience level and competence is $70,000-$90,000, it is worth mentioning that you have a friend who makes $90,000. Anchor them to the higher number. Drop it off tactfully and hesitantly, but get it in the conversation. The higher the number you mention, the more you mentally tie them to that number.Know when to stop negotiating: If the range is $70K-$90K and you got the a salary of $100,000 offer with all the benefits, don't push for more negotiation on salary! Leave salary alone. In fact, your sole focus at that point should be to refocus on future. What is the next promotion? What kind of skills and mentors will you need to get there? Ask for mentors, ask for reviews based on those skills sets.Be a gracious winner or loser: Negotiations is a poker table. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But you often come back to the table so don't pound on the table and tick the players off. Say \"I look forward to starting\" or \"not at this time\". be composed. No one likes a hothead.",

            "answer_text": "Talk to people who have held a similar position in the past. They'll be more likely to divulge salary info since it's not currently relevant to them, and then you can use this to get an idea of where you stand. Also check for a baseline salary range on payscale.com and glassdoor.com for jobs similar or the same as yours. This is also dependent to some degree on location as well, but it will give you a starting point for pay range. Armed with this, I think you're within your bounds to ask to discuss how they arrived at their compensation amount. The hiring manager is likely to be willing to discuss this to some extent with you (worst they can say is no). Then, if the amount is below average based on your research (talking to other people who have worked that position, glassdoor, payscale, etc.), you can discuss whether your performance was at or above average and negotiate for a commensurate salary based on your research. Finally, if you get the feeling that the employer can't or won't negotiate the starting salary up, you should discuss other options such as extended vacation time, insurance, employer match on 401K, and other benefits. In addition, be sure to indicate you are looking to increase your salary and work with the hiring manager to get specific criteria for what it would take to receive a raise, and possibly even what kind of a raise or promotion could be expected. By specific, I mean if in X months you have achieved X, Y, and Z, then you will have a followup where you will discuss an increase in compensation/promotion. All of this should reflect positively on you, showing that you take your work serious and are willing to work hard to move up. If the reaction you get to this is one of denying you future opportunities or refusing to discuss options of enticing you to work there that work for both of you in the long-run, the company probably isn't going to provide you with many opportunities elsewhere either, and it's time to start looking elsewhere rather than end up in a position where limited upward mobility.
