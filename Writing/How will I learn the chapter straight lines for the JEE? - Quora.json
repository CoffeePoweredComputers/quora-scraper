            "answer_text": "Staright Line is one of the most easiest chapter for JEE. I think you don't need to panic about this chapter. This chapter is all about formulaes and some easy concepts. Most of the students finds this chapter as their Strong Point. Believe me you can also learn it on your own by using some standard JEE Book for theory like Cengage, Amit M Agrawal. If you feel boredom when you study some new things on your own then I will suggest that you should watch the Unacademy Jee Lectures by Sameer Chincholikar Sir which are available for free on Youtube. He will teach you this chapter very easily and interestingly to JEE Advanced Level. Straight Line Chapter is very scoring and every JEE aspirant should do this chapter. Also this is the most basic chapter of Coordinate Geometry and if an aspirant don't do this chapter then he/she will struggle in Coordinate Geometry. For your kind information Coordinate Geometry is the most scoring portion of Maths in Jee. Hope It Helps \ud83d\ude42 ",

If you are a coaching student.. Be on track... And solve booklets.. But things which follow as now conics is going on are : Get your basics cleared by class notes or use SL Loney for Co ordinate...Practice much question of various variety to know what type of questions are asked.Do make a formula sheet fit every Co ordinate chapter and it is must, it will help you a lot..
