            "answer_text": "If you\u2019ve always dreamed of being the next Hemingway or Vonnegut (or even Grisham), or perhaps if you just want to write better essays for school or posts for your blog \u2026 you need to sharpen those writing skills. Becoming the best writer you can be isn\u2019t easy, I won\u2019t lie to you. It takes hard work. But it\u2019s worth the effort. And if it seems like an insurmountable task, there are some concrete things you can do today that will get you on the road to improvement. Personally, I\u2019ve been a fiction, newspaper, magazine and blog writer for 17 years now, writing for a variety of publications \u2026 and I\u2019m still trying to improve. Every writer can get better, and no writer is perfect. I think I\u2019ve grown tremendously as a writer over the last couple of decades, but it has been a painful journey. Let me share some of what I\u2019ve learned. No matter what level of writer you are, there should be a suggestion or twelve here that will help. 1. Read great writers. This may sound obvious, but it has to be said. This is the place to start. If you don\u2019t read great writing, you won\u2019t know how to do it. Everyone starts by learning from the masters, by emulating them, and then through them, you find your own voice. Read a lot. As much as possible. Pay close attention to style and mechanics in addition to content. 2. Write a lot. Try to write every day, or multiple times a day if possible. The more you write, the better you\u2019ll get. Writing is a skill, and like any other skill, you have to practice it to get better. Write stuff for yourself, write for a blog, write for other publications. Write just to write, and have a blast doing it. It gets easier after awhile if you practice a lot. 3. Write down ideas, all the time. Keep a little notebook handy (Nabokov carried around index cards) and write down ideas for stories or articles or novels or characters. Write down snippets of conversation that you hear. Write down plot twists and visual details and fragments of song lyrics or poems that move you. Having these ideas written down helps, because they can inspire you or actually go directly into your writing. I like to keep a list of post ideas for my blog, and I continually add to it. 4. Create a writing ritual. Find a certain time of day when you can write without interruptions, and make it a routine. For me, mornings work best, but others might find lunch or evenings or midnight hours the best. Whatever works for you, make it a must-do thing every single day. Write for at least 30 minutes, but an hour is even better. If you\u2019re a full-time writer, you\u2019ll need to write for several hours a day, as I do. But don\u2019t worry! It helps you get better. 5. Just write. If you\u2019ve got blank paper or a blank screen staring at you, it can be intimidating. You might be tempted to go check your email or get a snack. Well, don\u2019t even think about it, mister. Just start writing. Start typing away \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter what you write \u2014 and get the fingers moving. Once you get going, you get in the flow of things, and it gets easier. I like to start out by typing things like my name or a headline or something easy like that, and then the juices start flowing and stuff just pours out of me. But the key is to just get going. 6. Eliminate distractions. Writing does not work well with multi-tasking or background noise. It\u2019s best done in quiet, or with some mellow music playing. Do your writing with a minimal writer like WriteRoom or DarkRoom or Writer, and do it in full-screen. Turn off email or IM notifications, turn off the phone and your cell phone, turn off the TV, and clear off your desk \u2026 you can stuff everything in a drawer for now until you have time to sort everything out later \u2026 but don\u2019t get into sorting mode now, because it\u2019s writing time! Clear away distractions so you can work without interruption. 7. Plan, then write. This may sound contradictory to the above \u201cjust write\u201d tip, but it\u2019s not really. I find it useful to do my planning or pre-writing thinking before I sit down to write. I\u2019ll think about it during my daily run, or walk around for a bit to brainstorm, then write things down and do an outline if necessary. Then, when I\u2019m ready, I can sit down and just crank out the text. The thinking\u2019s already been done. For a great method for planning out a novel, see the Snowflake Method. 8. Experiment. Just because you want to emulate the great writers doesn\u2019t mean you have to be exactly like them. Try out new things. Steal bits from other people. Experiment with your style, your voice, your mechanics, your themes. Try out new words. Invent new words. Experimentalize everything. And see what works, and toss out what doesn\u2019t. 9. Revise. If you really crank out the text, and experiment, and just let things flow, you\u2019ll need to go back over it. Yes, that means you. Many writers hate revising, because it seems like so much work when they\u2019ve already done the writing. But if you want to be a good writer, you need to learn to revise. Because revision is where good writing really is. It separates the mediocre from the great. Go back over everything, looking not only for grammar and spelling mistakes, but for unnecessary words and awkward structures and confusing sentences. Aim for clarity, for strength, for freshness. 10. Be concise. This is best done during the revision process, but you need to edit every sentence and paragraph and remove everything but the essential. A short sentence is preferred over a longer one, and a clear word is preferred over two in jargonese. Compact is powerful. 11. Use powerful sentences. Aim for shorter sentences with strong verbs. Of course, not every sentence should be the same \u2014 you need variation \u2014 but try to create sentences with oomph. You might find this easier to do in the revision stage, as it might not be something you\u2019re thinking about when you\u2019re pumping out that first draft. 12. Get feedback. You can\u2019t get better in a vacuum. Get someone to read over your stuff \u2014 preferably a good writer or editor. Someone who reads a lot, and can give you honest and intelligent feedback. And then listen. Really try to understand the criticism and accept it and use it to improve. Instead of being hurt, thank your editor for helping you get better. 13. Put yourself out there. At some point, you\u2019ll need to let others read your writing. Not just the person who you\u2019re allowing to read it, but the general public. You\u2019ll need to publish your book or short story or poem, or write for a publication. If you\u2019re already doing a blog, that\u2019s good, but if no one reads it, then you need to find a bigger blog and try to submit a guest post. Putting your writing out in the public can be nerve-wracking, but it is a crucial (if painful) part of every writer\u2019s growth. Just do it. 14. Learn to be conversational. Many people write too stiffly. I find that it\u2019s so much better to write like you talk (without all the umms and uhhs). People relate to it better. It\u2019s not an easy task at first, but it\u2019s something to strive for. And that brings up another point \u2014 it\u2019s better to break the rules of grammar in order to sound conversational (as I did in the last sentence) than to sound stilted just so you can follow the proper rules. But don\u2019t break the rules of grammar without good reason \u2014 know that you\u2019re doing it, and why. 15. Start and end strong. The most important parts of your writing are the beginning and end. Especially the beginning. If you don\u2019t hook your reader in the beginning, they won\u2019t read the rest of your writing. So when you\u2019ve written your first draft, spend some extra time crafting a good beginning. Get them interested and wanting to know more. And when you\u2019re done with that, write a good ending \u2026 that will leave them wanting more of your writing. ",

            "answer_text": "There are 2 ways to improve your writing: ReadWrite It\u2019s not glamorous. It\u2019s not exciting. But it\u2019s the truth. Nobody puts it better than horror master Stephen King: If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There\u2019s no shortcut to becoming a good writer. But the good news is, you will improve as you practice your craft. Here\u2019s some tips for making the most of your practice time: Read A Lot Read many books. Set a goal for how much you will read and then stick to it. Maybe you read for an hour a day. Many writers read for 2 hours a day or more. You probably already spend time watching TV everyday. Consider cutting into that time to improve your craft instead.Read a variety of books. Don\u2019t just stick with your usual genre (if you have one). Read biographies, historical fiction, YA, sci-fi, drama, old classics, new hits that might be forgotten in a few years- anything and everything.Read with purpose. As you read, analyze what you\u2019re reading. Ask the book big questions, such as \u201cYou popular novel. Why does everyone love you?\u201d and then try to answer them. If it\u2019s a terrible book, still ask it questions. \u201cWhat could improve your prose, plot and dialog?\u201dWrite A Lot Write everyday. Set aside time to write on a regular basis. Whether it\u2019s a certain number of minutes, or a number of words, set a target and make it every day. It doesn\u2019t have to be good. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything you\u2019ll ever let be seen by any other living being on the face of the earth. Just write something.Write like the masters. Pick a book you love. Any book. Then copy the entire thing, preferably by hand. There is no better way to absorb the style, fluidity, grammar, punctuation and overall thoughts of your favorite authors.Follow writing prompts. A fantastic way to practice writing and jumpstart your creativity is to find a place doing writing prompts, such as a Tumblr blog or Writer\u2019s Digest\u2019s series, or Reddit\u2019s entire sub-reddit dedicated to it.There\u2019s a thousand ways you can practice reading and writing. It takes time, yes. It can be frustrating, yes! But you can and will improve if you put in the work. Good luck! ",
