Dear Mr. Jonas Smith, I have been following your cause for years. I especially like what your team accomplished in Philadelphia last April 2017. It struck me that together we can produce a win-win situation here in Atlanta. I would like to become part of your team to organize a rally for your cause. Atlanta is the new battleground, and no one has given any thought on how your team can effectively provide X to the people of Atlanta. Please consider providing your services in Atlanta. I have extensive experience in building organizations that produce results. I have included a copy of my resume outlining my commitment and dedication to your cause. I realize that you are a very busy individual. Can I call you on Tuesday (6/6) at 2:00 pm ET? Looking forward to talking with you and becoming a part of Team Smith. Sincerely, Tom Jonas Best of luck to you! ",

If you're writing to a specific individual, such as the manager, president, etc. place his or her name, then title (John Smith, President), above the address at the top of the letter (below the letterhead, which could be your name and address). The salutation comes next: Dear Mr. Jones: (colon, not a comma or semi-colon). If you don't have a specific name write: To Whom It May Concern or Dear Sir (or Madame):TYPE the letter on 8-1/2 x 11 stationery.Sign the letter \"Yours truly\" or \"Sincerely yours. (That's called the\" complimentary closing.\")Make sure your name, phone number(s) and email address are included, either at the top of the letter or at the bottom. Make it as easy as possible for them to respond. A well-written letter is usually more effective than a phone call and will make you seem intelligent and serious. ",
