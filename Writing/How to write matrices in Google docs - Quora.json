            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. Google Docs doesn\u2019t handle matrices as well as Word does. If you\u2019ve done it in Word you know that you can create square or rectangular matrices by choosing from the Matrix section of the Equation tab.  It it\u2019s a one row matrix, the solution by J Cheng is excellent. But if it\u2019s not, you can try playing with a table and getting rid of the borders. Or you can use one of the online equation editors like Online LaTeX Equation Editor.  Click on one of the matrix icons and an input box will pop up asking you to enter the number of rows and columns. Then you just enter each element between the & symbols that appear in the code box and your matrix will be built for you. Then you can drag and drop the image into Google Docs. It\u2019s not that elegant because you won\u2019t be able to edit it from Google Docs but it might help you. ",
