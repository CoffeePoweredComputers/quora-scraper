            "answer_text": "Hi Rohit, I am not sure what kind of product, business, or event you are intending to get sponsorship for. But there are broadly two ways of getting sponsorship for any product or venture. Either you grow in a way that brands start noticing you, in which case, they themselves would approach you to offer sponsorship opportunities. Or, you approach them with a proposition wherein you can provide them visibility and unparalleled reach. For instance, if you own a website, you need to have a decent amount of traffic to attract brands for sponsorship. Similarly, if you are targeting sponsorship for an event, the brand looks for its target audience and numbers before even considering your request or proposal. In a nutshell, you need to fulfill their basic requirement, that is audience, traffic, and prospective clients through your platform to expect any kind of sponsorship. Hope that helps! ",
