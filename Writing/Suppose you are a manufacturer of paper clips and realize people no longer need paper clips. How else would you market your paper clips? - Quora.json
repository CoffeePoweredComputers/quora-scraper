            "answer_text": "Product managers seek to understand what problems their customers have, and should spend most of their time understanding that. Customers don't want paperclips, they want a way for the pages to stay together, in the same way that consumers don't want a drill, they want holes in the wall (or wood, or whatever). Too many product managers focus too much on understanding the product, not the problem it solves. And that leads them to try to force fit a product into something, anything else in the same domain. But it's backwards -- if a top product manager was on the case they'd have noticed the shift in customers towards solutions like staples that avoided some of the drawbacks of paper clips. They'd already have written some requirements and started working with engineering on stapler (or other paper fixing) prototypes. At the same time, they might have spent some time asking other product managers in other domains if paperclips might solve a problem. This is very hard to do well, because it means jumping domains -- most companies just don't have access to customers from other domains to learn from. Applying a tool from industry A to industry B is a well-trodden path for innovation -- but it is usually performed by people in Industry B, who are on the look-out for a new solution and who understand the new domain really well. They're in a position to understand how it could work because of that. So it's unlikely that the manufacturer of paper clips will find the new usage. But it does happen very occasionally: it's how 3M ended up with the PostIt Note, when their non-permanent glue (a failure in one domain) ended up as a really useful thing in a different domain. A bit like winning the lottery. ",

            "answer_text": "A paper clip is just a long extended strip of thin metal. We need to think of ways people have been using them already. - People use them for decoration. They hook them together and make chains, or twist them into interesting shapes. We can go for the \u201cmake whatever you want\u201d direction, kind of like Lego. We can hold a \u201cmake something with paperclips\u201d contest to get people interested in this direction. - People use them to reach hard to reach places. - People use them sometimes to repair glasses or other objects. Let say your glasses is broken. You could probably \u201cMacGyver\u201d it with rubber bands and a few paper clips it in place. We can target toward the \u201crepair anything with this\u201d route. Again, we can do a contest to see what kind of things you can fix with a paperclip to market this. - We can also see if we can market it toward collectors or little kids (who tend to like collecting things, like coins or stamps). We can print patterns on them and set them into different tiers of rarity. We can then encourage people to try to collect them all. This can be combined with the \u201cmake whatever you want\u201d idea above. Because the paperclip is kind of a very small thing that isn\u2019t made up of different components, it\u2019s hard to think of a lot of ideas for it. However, the ideas above should get us started. Particularly the first idea and the last idea. If done well, there could be a lot of interesting options. Would you like me to go into more detail on any of the above? ",
