            "answer_text": "This really depends on the situation.  If you have an idea of what you want to do and know that the professor in question is most qualified to help you, then go ahead and make contact.  Most professors are more than willing to answer your questions, and perhaps tell you what you should do to prepare for the research.  Is there, for instance, some course that he or she thinks that you should take before starting your work?  I'm always happy to hear from incoming students.  It's far better to hear from an enthusiastic first-year student and get to know them early, rather than having the student show up on your doorstep at the last minute.   So many times, a good project is based on the prep work, so it's never too early.  And, you will be constantly refining your area of interest as you go along (it's part of the process!), so it's nice for us to see a student through that experience. ",
