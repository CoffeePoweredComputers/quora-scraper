List the objectives of your study. Explain the methodology you have adopted in your study. Discuss the major findings of your study in the results section. Last but not the least, mention the limitations of your study and scope for further research. How to publish: Talk to your professor. Get a listing of reputed journals in your area. Select the journal you want to publish your paper in. Study their submission guidelines and make necessary corrections and adjustments. Submit your paper and wait patiently for its review. Based on the reviews received, make final modifications and re-submit. It will take time and it definitely isn\u2019t easy but you can do it. Good luck! :) ",
