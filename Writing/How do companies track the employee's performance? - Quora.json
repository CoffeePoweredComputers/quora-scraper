            "answer_text": "It is not to easy to track the employee performance. There are the steps one have to follow- The steps which many of the companies follow are- Define the value for every position \u2013 Creating a valuation strategy for each position allows you to better evaluate performance. This can be a simple, linear formula for certain position, for examples, sale positions, where you directly tie performance to revenue.Establish realistic, measurable objectives \u2013 Using your sales department as an example, you can tie sales calls objectives directly to revenue by calculating average conversion ratios and thereby create measurable outcomes. For example, let\u2019s say you are targeting weekly revenue of $10,000 for an individual sales person.Use measurement tools \u2013 Now that you have set your measureable objectives, you will need to monitor and evaluate the results. Using the example of the sales team above, it is simple to create a \u201ccall sheet\u201d that can be examined at the end of each week or month to determine whether the primary objectives are being met for sales calls (which translate into revenue).Enroll everyone on your team in the program \u2013 Every company has a few employees, managers or even C-Level executives who feel that their performance cannot be accurately measured. Nothing could be further from the truth!Connect employee performance to company goals \u2013 Once you have established your systems and employee metrics, double-check that these systems also align with your overall company goals. If your company culture is more focused on the customer experience, the metric may be more focused on the quality of interaction with the customer, as opposed to the quantity of customer services calls fielded.Also now a days it is more important to use performance management software tools as they help a lot. The software tools play a major role in the organisation. 15 Best Performance Management System 2019 | Reviews of Top Software ",

            "answer_text": "Companies set goals. Along with goals, they set targets for their employees to achieve. The target has to be achieved within a specific date, say in a month or 3 months from the date of goal setting. The expectations from that goal are written, what is the measure of achievement and how it will be tracked. From here companies take two approaches: Traditional Review approach: They will do their half-yearly or annual reviews. The reviews are with self, manager appraisal.More frequent reviews: Quarterly/ Monthly. This is an approach where people talk about performance on a regular basis. Do course correction of their goals, and help people to achieve more, before its too late.The later is becoming a trend and companies are adopting the same. They are looking for feedback on the go, attaching the feedback, +ve , -ve inputs. Coaching of people is important, to make them realize the importance of update, track and improve the way of Employee Performance. We speak to a lot of companies, and they want to shift from their Annual approach to the more modern efforts of track the employee's performance, like Deloitte, Adobe. They find it daunting at first, to do the same manually, but with GroSum the transition is smooth. Lets speak soon, if we want to understand your Performance Management needs. Performance Management is not HR work any more, its a business management tool.   ",
