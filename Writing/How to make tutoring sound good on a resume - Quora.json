College Tutor Resume Example & Guide | ZipJobTutor Resume Example & Template for 2020 | ZipJobWhen you tutor someone, you\u2019re not simply helping them with a subject. You have to figure out what they know, what they don\u2019t know, and then you have to develop a strategy to close that knowledge gap. So, when you describe tutoring experiences, make sure that you discuss all of the steps you took to tutor your students. The best way to detail your tutoring experience is to use a reverse-chronological format for your resume.  Be sure to use an active voice when writing your bullet points. Meaning, avoid saying something like, \u201cHelped students pass SAT exams.\u201d Instead say, \u201cEvaluated student knowledge to develop learning path geared towards SAT exam success resulting in 25% improved scores.\u201d There are also some specific skills you can add to a \u201cCore Competencies\u201d section of your resume.  I want to thank you for helping to advance the knowledge of your students. It\u2019s a very noble role. Good luck with your job search. ",

            "answer_text": "FYI, I\u2019ve done tutoring, coaching, mentoring, and teaching. The key is providing details about what specifically you\u2019re doing. So there are different kinds of tutoring. For example, you might only tutor in a certain subject. Or you might tutor in multiple ones. And some will tutor just a single individual or one person at a time. Others will tutor in groups of the same age or multiple ages. So if you want to improve things, provide more details as to the kinds of tutoring you do or have done. Details such as age(s), subject(s), learning environments, and results. ",
