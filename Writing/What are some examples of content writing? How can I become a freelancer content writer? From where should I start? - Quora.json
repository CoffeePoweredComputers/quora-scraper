            "answer_text": "Do you have a blog? Are you a writer? If you are a capable, professional writer already, but don\u2019t have a blog, then start by creating a blog and learning what content creation is about. If you are not a professional writer (someone who writes daily and is paid for his or her writing.) If you are not a publishing (online or in print media) writer, then learn the ropes and get your career moving. Examples of content writing are all over the internet. I have been a pro writer for 35+ years and blogging daily for 11 years at Ennyman's Territory Creating content pre-existed social media, though. I spearheaded the unfolding of the AMSOIL website, leading its development from when it had 4 pages till it had 7000 pages of content. I similarly initiated their AMSOIL Blog when blogging kicked in circe 2007. Check out what other companies are doing and you will learn what \u201ccontent creation\u201d is all about. Just as novelists read the Masters (Tolstoy, Hemingway, Fitzgerald) to learn how to write great literature, you will want to read a lot of blog writing to see what content creation is about. And never stop striving to be a better writer. Writing is one of those things that any child can do, yet over a period of two lifetimes you will still not have mastered it. Life (especially the writing life) is for learning. Good luck. ",
