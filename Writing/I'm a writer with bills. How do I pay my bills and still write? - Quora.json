            "answer_text": "I run a business with my husband, have my own publishing imprint, write at least four novels a year, and am raising four kids with no outside paid help. And I know I\u2019m not the only one. So this question is very relevant. I can\u2019t quit working on our business (and I can\u2019t quit being a mom!), so my husband and I have decided that from 8:00 PM on, I get to write. No one disturbs me. Period. And if we have a late family dinner or activity that goes beyond this time, even if we get home at 10 PM, I still go out and write for at least an hour or two. There\u2019s a myth that you need a lot of time to write a book. Not true! Think about how long it takes to write 250 words (about a page). Five minutes? Ten? Say you can do 5 pages an hour. In one month, you\u2019ll have 150 pages. In two months, a decent-sized novel. And that\u2019s only one hour a day! Do you watch one TV show a day? Instead, write. There\u2019s your hour. Or write during your lunch hour. Or before work. Dictate on your commute. Where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. Something that really boosts my word count is doing sprints. Set the timer for ten minutes and just write. I usually do about 500 words. These ten-minutes sprints add up fast. I wish you luck. I, too, wish I could write full time. But in the mean time, there are ways to make it work. ",

            "answer_text": "As I once heard from another professional: \"Nothing motivates a writer like an empty bank account.\" Your writing can be part of the solution to your problem, but an honest accounting of your budget and living expenses should also take place. Ask yourself these questions:  1. How much will I have to pay to keep current on my debts and cover my living expenses, both expected and emergency? 2. How much money can I make by writing? 3. How many pieces will I need to write each (day/month/year) in order to meet this goal? 4. When and on what schedule will I be paid, and will this line up with when my debts are due? Time is a very important part of writing, it's true -- but so is being able to eat. As a freelancer (if you're planning to do that), it's worthwhile to build up a dependable group of clients in your 'spare' time while still doing another job. When the demand for your freelance skills increases to the point that it is meeting or exceeding your current job, you may be able to further evaluate your choices and the reality of writing for a living.  I did it in reverse fashion (started out writing pretty much without any other means of support). Although I built up a dependable and lovely base of returning clients, it took going through some uncomfortably lean years and having to \"hustle\" every step of the way. Promoting yourself shamelessly, saying 'yes' to a lot of possible jobs, and seeking out new clients the way bears track down a berry patch may or may not be essential freelancing life skills. ",
