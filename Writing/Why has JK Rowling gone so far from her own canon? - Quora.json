            "answer_text": "I personally do not think it really has much to do with JKR \u201cnot caring about her own stories\u201d or \u201cjust milking her own franchise\u201d. I actually do think that this is a story that she wants to tell. I mean, I remember reading the bits from Rita Skeeter\u2019s book about Dumbledore in the Deathly Hallows and saying \u201cBoy, I\u2019d love to read the whole book\u201d. I\u2019m pretty sure a lot of people did, just like everyone kept asking JKR to write a Marauder\u2019s book, or a book on the Hogwarts founder. All of those are still valid options for her as well. And to be honest, she isn\u2019t the first writer to go back to her own universe to get more stories out of it, either. There is no point criticizing her for just that. The problem, and I think we should have seen this coming a long time ago, is that she isn\u2019t the kind of writer who is suited for this \u201cworld expansion\u201d kind of writing. At the heart of it all, Harry Potter novels were probably mystery novels. Yes, they follow the Hero\u2019s Journey format. But I feel like that the mystery and suspense aspect of them were the best part. Although, she also builds characters, and relationships very well. Another thing she does well is give messages of equality and other social values, that she believes in. What was missing was the kind of coherence that would be present in a hard fantasy. The little slip-ups that do not really make sense. The lack of delving into \u201chow magic works\u201d. For example, everything that dealt with wandlore in the Deathly Hallows, they were more plot elements that were there to carry the story, to build towards that finish, rather than continuation of magical theory we have seen before. All these do lead towards that same conclusion, that she is better at writing mystery, with added social commentary and tales of friendship and love, than she is at writing a great High Fantasy which greatly maintains canon. This idea is bolstered further when she writes great mystery books that do not need to be veiled as magical fantasy (the Cormoran Strike novels). That is why, when she is writing Fantastic Beasts, or even before during the Cursed Child, she has not adhered to the history that she had created before. Neither does everything follow the rules of the established world. Thus the not unexpected departure from canon. PS: I also think that much of the flack that JKR is getting from the fandom for the Fantastic Beasts films should be pointed towards David Yates, who has been making the Potter films since Order of the Phoenix, and in my opinion never did a \u201cgreat\u201d job of bringing the books onto the large screen.

            "answer_text": "(long story short) JKR is in pro forma mode. Consider the statement \u201cPotter fans waited three years between the releases of the fourth and fifth books.\u201d I\u2019d say that JKR\u2019s enthusiasm for her series began to wane (or evanesce) at that point. There was plenty of \u201cgood stuff\u201d in books five and six but book seven marched along \u201cpro forma.\u201d Books five through seven had increasing intervals of \u201cHarry looked. He didn\u2019t see anything. Harry searched. He didn\u2019t find anything. Harry listened. He didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d The most blantant of these intervals is when Harry doesn\u2019t get any mail from his friends over the Summer and then they spend a lot of time cleaning Grimmaud Place. Another boring interval is the so-called Wizard camping trip. \u201cOK. Let\u2019s search all of the U.K. starting at the Outer Hebrides! (they find nothing)\u201d So we can see that JKR\u2019s wheels are slowing but she makes it (pro forma) to the end of her marathon. Then there is a nine or ten year ellipsis (commonly written \u2026) before she restarts with Fantastic Beasts. The trouble here is that JKR decided to make these (five!) movies prequels to the main HP opus. If JKR had left Grindelwald out of the mix and left Dumbledore out of the mix, then you\u2019d have a stand alone series of films. And now we discover that JKR seems to be writing the scripts in some sort of isolation booth. With a second or third pair of expert eyes invovled, surely the idea of a \u201csecret brother\u201d would have been scotched as cheap day-time TV drama. The term pro forma (Latin for \"as a matter of form\" or \"for the sake of form\") is most often used to describe a practice or document that is provided as a courtesy or satisfies minimum requirements, conforms to a norm or doctrine, tends to be performed perfunctorily or is considered a formality. scotched: decisively put an end to. \"a spokesman has scotched the rumors\" synonyms: put an end to, put a stop to, nip in the bud, put the lid on; ruin, wreck, destroy, smash, shatter, demolish, frustrate, thwart; informal put paid to, put the kibosh on, scupper, scuttle \"the bad weather scotched our plans for a rematch\" evanesce:to pass away or fade from sight like mist or smoke; disappear slowly ",
