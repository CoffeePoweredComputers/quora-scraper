            "answer_text": "Although I am not much qualified for this, but still, let me share my experience. When I started writing, I was appreciated by a couple of people around me. I wrote stuff, and mind you I even got appreciation from once who\u2019d been really rude to me at times. This was when I thought, \u201cDude, you are a writer. That\u2019s your passion.\u201d But you know, soon all the appreciation dried up. I went through a really low phase. I made a blog which had 1 follower, and yeah that was me. Forget criticism, I felt ignored. It was then that I realized, \u201cIf you\u2019re even gonna do anything worthwhile, you\u2019re bound to face difficulties, you\u2019re bound to face adversities. EVEN IF YOU\u2019RE FOLLOWING YOU\u2019RE PASSION, YOU\u2019LL FACE PROBLEMS. And on the face of adversities, you really need a reason to continue, you need discipline to slog further.\u201d We think that once we find our passion, our life would become very easy. But guess what, No it won\u2019t. We\u2019ll still have to face problems, sometimes even bigger. I told myself, \u201cDude, you say you\u2019re a writer. Well then, write something so inspirational that pumps you up and makes you create crazy content.\u201d And I discovered that I can write motivational stuff too. I can relate to you, but man, you already have a full-fledged novel with you! See, you\u2019ve something to look at and be proud of yourself. You\u2019re bound to go through low phases, but that\u2019s where you\u2019re actually tested. That\u2019s where you realize if you can really continue the fight. You enjoyed writing right? Just keep writing. Soon you\u2019ll start enjoying it again. Write on a paper. Write messy things. Write totally unrelated stuff. Try something out of your niche for a while. Write your feeling. Write snippets, or maybe write something to motivate yourself. Just write for a bit longer time. You\u2019ve asked this question. It makes me conclude that you still want to write. So give writing a chance. Force yourself to write at least 500\u20131000 words everyday. And if you really wanna write, you\u2019ll start enjoying it again. The only advice I can give you is that though motivation is important, but consistency and discipline are more important. Become consistent. Become Disciplined, and just write. .
