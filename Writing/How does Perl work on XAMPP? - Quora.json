            "answer_text": "XAMPP is a user-friendly installer for your Web- and DB-server on a Windows host. The \"A\" means [A]pache Web-server, which leads directly into the main problem: there is, to my knowledge, no usable mod_perl binary for Apache 2.4.x, unfortunately. But you can, of course, use the (included) Perl interpreter in CGI mode, you put your Perl script into the /cgi-bin/ directory and write a shebang in the first line of your script: #!/XAMPP/perl/bin/perl.exe\u00a0# (Make sure this path corresponds to your Perl location!)\u00a0\u00a0# your script here:\u00a0But with mod_perl, you can make use of Perl in a Web-server environment in a very powerful way, this is (after 2011/Apache 2.4.x) only possible with Linux-like operating systems.  With mod_perl you have direct access on any aspect of the HTTP request through the Apache-API, Perl stays resident in the HTTP-server process. You can play with that by installing a Linux in a virtual machine, running on Windows. Bottom line: in Windows, you can use Perl in CGI-mode, but not from within Apache through mod_perl. Stackoverflow covers this question too. ",

You need to write \"#!c:\\Perl64\\bin\\perl\" perl script shebang line for run perl script. Add handler on httpd.conf file for run perl cgi script/application. AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl  Please set that thing. Hope you are getting answer to your query. Thanks, Ashish ",
