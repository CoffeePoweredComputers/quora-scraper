            "answer_text": "There have been quite a few \u201chow to\u201d questions about writing lately. The fact is that writing is a craft like sculpting or painting or composing music. A lot of would-be writers, in fact, have no talent at all. A lot of those people even get published. Now that people can self-publish on Amazon, there is a veritable tsunami of schlock available to the public. Most people\u2014 because of the quality of public education\u2014 have absolutely no IDEA what makes good writing and what makes bad writing. As to having a \u201cfast-paced\u201d novel: Well, you would have to start with a fast-paced plot and very sound skills in constructing that which supports any plot, fast-paced or otherwise. The first thing a good writer must learn is how to master good sentences structure. What kind of sentence structure conveys what kind of message the writer is aiming for.. The next thing is to master fundamental grammar. I know you\u2019re saying, \u201cBut good writers sometimes use bad grammar!\u201d Right. But you must KNOW the rules before you BREAK the rules in a way that makes sense. Good writers must have good vocabularies. MUST. Nobody with an 8-year- old\u2019s vocabulary can communicate well. Whatever your politics, compare the communication skills of Barak Obama, who sounds like a Supreme Court Justice with those of Donald Trump, who sounds like an 8 year old thug. Good writing simply must be written with a clean and elegant vocabulary. There is no substitute. However, there is also nothing worse than someone using a vocabulary which they themselves would never use in conversation. What they sound like is a pompous ass. Which brings me to the last of the very basic foundation of good writing: FIND YOUR VOICE. This may be THE most difficult thing for a beginning writer to do. \u201cVoice\u201d is the way YOU say things. It is the style of your writing which, when someone reads it who knows you, they will say, \u201cthat sounds EXACTLY like something so-and-so would say!\u201d Then, if you\u2019ve done all those things and you\u2019ve constructed a tight plot line, you might have written something tolerable.. What every would-be writer really needs to do is to get in a good writing class where you are ASSIGNED topics, then the entire class reads and criticizes your work. It is painful, but you will learn more from this than any other method of instruction in writing. When I was in graduate school, I had an acquaintance who claimed he loved to write SO much that he\u2019s put shelf paper in his typewriter and write nonstop till he\u2019d written up the whole roll. Yeah. But do you think anyone ever actually read that crap??? ",

            "answer_text": "You didn\u2019t ask anything about a well written or \u2018good\u201d novel. You just said fast paced, so here goes. Don\u2019t you dare make your reader think much.Quickly spell out the plot.Go with short sentences. short paragraphs, and short chapters. Don\u2019t get wordy. Avoid compound sentences.Use action words and the smallest, most impactful, words with few modifiers.Minimize description.Don\u2019t get caught up with complicated plots or ideas.Stay out of character\u2019s heads. And if you must, keep it simple.Use mostly short dialogue, with simple tags only when need with little action, thought or description in tagsAbsolute minimum of back story.Lots of action described simply.Avoid grey. Keep everything (as far as good/evil, right//wrong goes) Any issues are black and white.For me; I like to vary the speed of my stories and novels; some parts quick and exciting, while others slow and intense, or slow and thoughtful. While I try to keep back story to only what is needed, some is needed. I like to give it out in pieces here and there, so I don\u2019t bore my readers and bring the pace to a stand still. If you have a little peace, it makes the action that much more intense and dramatic. I don\u2019t want my readers to race through my stories or novels. I want them to enjoy it and take more away from it than just a rush. ",
