            "answer_text": "Getting a content writing job without any experience isn\u2019t that tough, if you spend considerable time on building your portfolio. So, what is a portfolio? It can be anything, even your Quora answers, if it well-researched and written carefully. You can start publishing your blogs on Medium. All these should be extremely compact and authentic. It should be as per your industry guidelines and standards. Ensure that you create a proper portfolio if you want to build your career around content writing. The next step would be to start taking up freelance gigs. It can be through your reference or on LinkedIn or on Upwork. Do it with utmost sincerity. Try approaching content writing agencies for regular projects. If you are looking for a full-time job, all these experiences would help. Keep reading, keep researching and keep writing. ",

            "answer_text": "I will start by telling exactly what I did in my initial days. I started to write good quality content on platforms like Quora. Not only did it help me showcase my writing abilities but also I got something better in return, feedback yes most valuable feedback from the vast community which is priceless. Slowly my confidence improved with time and the more I wrote people started messaging me. I got few offers to write blogs and content for few websites. I also got an offer to complete a book as a ghost writer. All these leads were generated solely through Quora. I also keep updated with the trend and also learnt how to capture readers attention through my innovative writing abilities. I applied for content writer roles for ads placed on Facebook. That was my other way to generate leads. Lastly I just need to say keep writing, its hard in the beginning and later it just goes on easily! Its like learning to ride a bike or learning to swim. Looks hard at the beginning and becomes effortless once you get a hold of it.  Image source: Google -SK ",

And I don't know who told you that you won't get a job if you don't have any experience in such. If writing is your passion, keep writing more stuffs and about everything you love. And if your motto is only to get a job in Content writing, still you need to work on writing because you can not sit in Maths exam without preparing for it. Similarly, you can't get a job in Content writing without knowing about writing. So trust me you can get a job in content writing without having prior experience in this field. You may get less salary in starting but once your knowledge will be known to everyone. You could not be stopped. Thanks! ",
