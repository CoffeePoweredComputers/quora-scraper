            "answer_text": "The best way to have \u2018well thought out\u2019 characters, is to recognise that your characters are your story. How your main characters react to each specific event will depend on their personal characteristics, family/friendship pressures, ambitions, desires, dreams, and cultural pressures. You give each character a different set of characteristics, loud, shy, etc etc. You also give different characters specific \u2018issues\u2019 or \u2018character flaws,\u2019 for which you invent a history to explain. These can be issues they are to overcome during the course of the story/subplot, or things that drive the rest of their personality. Creating a story where the characters are organically connected to the plot, which is organically driven by your character\u2019s personalities and character traits, is one of the hardest challenges for any novelist . Get a piece of paper, turn it sideways. You are going to write three sentences: This story is about\u2026..The character\u2019s personalities and character traits are prevented this from happening by\u2026..The character\u2019s learn to overcome these issues by doing\u2026..Those three sentences are the premise of your character driven story - you may need to take some time thinking about them. By linking your character\u2019s personalities and character traits directly to the story at this highest level, you ensure they are organically connected to the plot. Hope this helps, Nick ",

            "answer_text": "One of the most helpful hints I can offer is to \u2018interview your characters\u2019 to know them well enough that they present well to the reader. This is basically like talking to imaginary friends, but lets face it our characters are. And it\u2019s our job to get to know them so well that they jump off the page and stick in the readers\u2019 minds and hearts. So get a pad of paper and pen and write out details about your character that you\u2019ve already imagined. Then dig deeper. If your main character is a military man who has recently been injured, is going home for the first time in years, and is your main lead - flesh him out by ",
