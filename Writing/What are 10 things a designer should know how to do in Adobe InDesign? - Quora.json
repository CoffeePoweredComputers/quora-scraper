            "answer_text": "In no particular order: 1) Master pagesUse them, know them, love them. You'll use these all the time if you ever work in magazine or newspaper publishing, but should really use them any time you have a document with 2 or more grids. 2) Object, Paragraph, & Character StylesFew things are more frustrating than going through a document another designer put together and realizing there are no paragraph styles. I know it can be tedious, but the fact that designers think they can get away with not knowing this is mind boggling. Seriously, it saves SO much time in the long run. If another designer gives me a document without paragraph styles, I'll reject it and give it back to them until they've established and applied styles to every line in the doc. 3) Nested StylesSame as above. A little more understandable, but still essential to know. It will make your life so much easier. 4) Know how to apply space after paragraphs No hitting double return, that shit drives me nuts! 5) Modify baseline gridAnd know how to align text to it. You'll have to do this all the time in newspaper, magazine, and book layout. 6) Connect text boxes to auto scroll all type throughout the documentSeriously, not doing it is both frustrating and lazy. 7) Establish and export color palettes, paragraph styles, and character stylesIf you ever need to use the same styles in another document, this will help you immensely (technically, you don't export paragraph styles per se, but know how to load them from another document). 8) AlignmentText, objects, everything in your document should be aligned to the design so that if I zoom in 4,000% (and I will), I don't see boxes randomly overlapping. If I see that when I'm interviewing a designer, it's an automatic fail and they won't get a second interview. If you're too lazy to fix the small details, what else are you too lazy to do? 9) Packaging documentsThis is the ONLY way to give a file to another designer. 10) Use separations preview to find and get rid of extraneous colors. Not well known, but will save you a hell of a time when you're limited to a certain number of colors. Extra credit if you know how to use GREP Styles, Tabs, & make a Table of Contents using styles. There are more, but learn all of these and save yourself a ton of headaches later. Warning: learning these will have the unintended side effect of making you judge other designers for not knowing them and leave you with a subconscious (but accurate) sense of superiority. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree, Richard covered it very well. But I would add one and modify one. 9) Package Documents & Preflight If you are creating PDF\u2019s and sending them to a printer Preflight is a must. You can create profiles that are catered to each printer you use. This will ensure the files you send out will move through their Preflight and production without issues. A lot of the time this part of a Graphic Designers responsibilities is overlooked. I get PDF\u2019s from big advertising agencies and large companies all the time that fail my preflight because they have elements in them that use RGB or that are low resolution. 11) Data Merge Being able to auto-generate multiple pages based on merging data from a CSV file can add a lot of power to InDesign.
