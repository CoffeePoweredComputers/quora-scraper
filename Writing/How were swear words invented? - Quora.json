            "answer_text": "Let me start this by making it clear here that, I am not an authority in this field but just want to share my personal opinion about the inventions of curse words or generally bad things. That being said, I stand to be reproofed or corrected by anyone who feels or perceives this in a more appropriate answers. At first, counting back to the procreation of man from the biblical account (Adam and Eve\u2019s creation in the garden of Eden), let us not take this too religious, it is a one piece of most famous story that could be referred to at this instance but let our personal opinion about the account remain individuals and private, before we ruin the essence of this follow ups. From the story, Adam and Eve almost gambled into most of the activities they knew in their lifetime by a game of chance. That means trial by error, trace back to some of the things you try to attempt on your own without any formal or informal procedure or guide. You will only realize the final outcome is never known until it shows up. From that moment of your final observation and inference, an idea or knowledge has been born and could be relatively passed to generations to come. So many things we address as taboo today were actually regarded as normal at some point of existence but experience over the time may in one way or the other proven to the people that it is not the way to go. At this point where the people have resolved that a known pattern or action(s) of live is no longer viable for the people, it will become forbidden. As time progresses, the hatred for such will grow out of hand. The Curse Words Invention In most cases, those curse words were coined from the abominable stories, as they refer to offenders with phrases, words, names, from any of the abolished instances. For instance, I grew up to hear my grandmother always refers to anyone she suspect to have too much love for meat or fish as Ojumah. In my dialect (Ukwuani) Ojumah is just a name. In around 1930s, Ojumah was the Oga among his age group. He is in charge of sharing anything apportioned to his age group. In one of the instances, someone brought a chicken for sacrifice to the gods of the land, and he was to prepare it a yam porridge and serve every members in that gathering. According to the customs, there are some specific parts reserved for some specific people, (the head for the eldest man as the leader, the liver is reserved for the chief priest, etc). Ojumah prepared and served the meal as expected except that one of the chicken\u2019s lap was missing, so when they inquired from him about the missing chicken lap, he said it has probably melted in the porridge, they requested for the bones as evidence of melting in the pot, but he equally admitted that even the bone got melted. The question was why should the liver and other parts survive the same heat that melted a bone of just one lap? It wasn\u2019t just about calling him a thief or a liar but his name became a kind of mockery to anyone perceived to be deceptive. Over the time people hate the name and regards it as a curse. Another instance is Juda Iscariot following his betrayal of Jesus Christ, the Christians believes his name is more of a curse than a blessing and refrain from using it for good intent. Sodom and Gomorrah is another recorded instance following the biblical account, these days it is no longer used to refer to a physical location as city but the presence of evil act in a community. Why you will not be able to trace the clear origin of most cursed words is that they are either made popular and adopted for its use before it finds its way into the English dictionary, simply put the last existing use is what you may find as the origination of the word. The burning furnace was originally invented to burn enemies or offenders before it was adopted for purification of mineral resources such as gold, crude oil, etc. The same goes for the wheel of a car (originally Wheel of death) and many other inventions, you can google \u201cMachine of Death\u201d a documentary by BBC. In summary our society continue to evolve, so do our acts, our experiences, and our words and their impacts. I hope this is helpful. ",
