            "answer_text": "First off, stop thinking of it as a career in creative writing. Your major options are a career in writing, or a career in teaching. I suppose editing would be a third possibility. You do not need to study \u201ccreative writing\u201d for any of those. If you intend to teach creative writing, it\u2019s probably useful, but otherwise it\u2019s completely unnecessary. I know dozens of professional writers, and none of them have degrees in creative writing. Most, including myself, never even took a course in creative writing. We do not think of what we do as creative writing, we just think of it as writing, even though yes, it\u2019s creative. \u201cCreative writing\u201d is something students do for a cheap grade. To develop a writing career, you need to narrow it down to a specific sort of writing initially. (You can branch out again once you\u2019re established.) Do you want to write novels, essays, short stories? Which sort? For essays and nonfiction, you aim at journalism. For short stories, well, you can\u2019t make a living writing short stories, so you get a teaching job in literature and write short stories on the side. For novels, you just write a novel on your own and sell it to a respectable publisher, then build from there. ",
