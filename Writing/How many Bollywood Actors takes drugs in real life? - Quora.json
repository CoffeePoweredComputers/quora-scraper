            "answer_text": "Here are list of some Bollywood celebrities took drugs\u2026 Prateik Babbar  Prateik Babbar successfully came out of the rehab all clean and sober in 2017. In a conversation with a leading daily, he confessed that he started doing drugs at the age of 13. He spoke about how what started as experiments with marijuana and hashish, developed into an addiction to cocaine and acid. The Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na actor said, \"My first real drug was a disturbed childhood. Constantly faced with an internal dilemma, the voices in my head debating where I belong and who I am, drugs came disguised as a glitzy escape. As the years went by, I got acquainted with the narcotic underbelly, which led me to my first run-in with drugs at the age of 13.\" \"Getting out of bed was almost impossible; nausea greeted me each morning, my body ached and I oscillated between hot and cold every few minutes. At that point, I didn\u2019t even have a drug of choice, I took whatever I could lay my hands on.\" Pooja Bhatt  In an interview with a leading daily, Pooja Bhatt opened up about her alcohol addiction and how she overcame it. She spoke about how after being in love with her bottle for over decades, it was a text message from her dad Mahesh Bhatt, which made her rethink her lifestyle choices. Pooja said, \"Alcohol is comforting, it colours your evening. It\u2019s a socially accepted narcotic even at business lunches and in the boardroom. Also, living in a fast-paced city, being in a high-stress profession, it becomes a reason to celebrate and cope with failure. Your film is a hit, you bathe in champagne, it flops, a single malt lessens the pain. I was 45 and if I wanted to give myself 10 years of living, I had to quit now before I drank myself to the grave. I had to reclaim the sharper, brighter me which had got watered down.\" Last December, she pulled the plug on alcohol and has been sober ever since. Fardeen Khan  In 2001, Fardeen Khan was arrested by Mumbai police for possession of cocaine. The case closed in 2012 when he was granted bail. In an interview with a leading daily, Fardeen talked about his battle with addiction, \"Any mind-altering substance whether it's narcotics or alcohol or prescription pills, creates a lethal dependency. Before you know it you're sucked into a downward spiral. The idea of any addiction is very damaging. People have all kinds of weird addiction, even shopping. My only addiction (now) is the love of my family. They're my life-supporting system. Please educate yourself vis-a-vis the consequences of whatever you are experimenting with. Addiction is not cool.\" Manisha Koirala  Manisha, who battled ovarian cancer and emerged victoriously has had a tough life. Manisha also wrote a book called, Healed: How Cancer Gave Me a New Life that talks about her battle with cancer. At some point in her career, the actress was addicted to alcohol. Talking about her addiction and how she overcame it, the Sanju actress said, \"In life, be it relationships or alcohol, we need to be the master of the situation and not the victim. My friends and family drink, my father drinks sometimes, so there\u2019s no taboo as such. But you need to know your limits so that you don\u2019t flip and start going on a downhill journey. It could happen because of anything- some people get into it due to pressure while others hit the bottle because of a heartbreak. It\u2019s high emotion and drama-packed life. Creative people are more emotionally charged so I am a super sensitive person. But the reason I\u2019ve written about it is that it goes out there and also it\u2019s a sort of closure for me- that this happened with me, the chapter has ended and now we move on.\" Yo Yo Honey Singh  The rap star Yo Yo Honey Singh became a sensation for his songs that spoke about consuming alcohol, partying all night and whatnot. Looks like he was writing about his own lifestyle. He experienced a downfall in his career due to his addiction to drugs. Talking about his battle, the Blue Eyes singer said, \"This is the first time I am talking about it as I want my fans to know what happened to me. Nobody knows about this, and I wanted to tell the world myself, not through a spokesperson. The last 18 months were the darkest phase of my life, and I wasn't in a state to talk to anyone. I know there were rumours that I was in rehab (for drug overdose), but I was in my Noida house throughout. The truth is I was suffering from bipolar disorder. It went on for 18 months, during which I changed four doctors, the medication wasn't working on me and crazy things were happening,' he said, pausing, but determined to reveal more. 'I must confess that I was bipolar and an alcoholic, which aggravated the condition.\" Sanjay Dutt  Sanjay Dutt was probably one of the first celebrities to admit to his addiction to drugs. In 1982, the Kaante actor was arrested for the possession of drugs. Post that episode, he was sent to rehab by father Sunil Dutt. The actor in an interview with a media portal said, \"My journey with substance abuse has been about 12 years. There are no drugs in the world that I have not done. When my father took me to America (for rehab), they gave me a list (of drugs) and I ticked every drug on it because I had taken all of them. The doctor told my dad, 'What kind of food do you eat in India? Going by the drugs he did, he should be dead by now! I didn't leave drugs because of my family. I left because I wanted to be out of it. I didn't want that life. When you start the rehabilitation process, one part is physical - your body breaks down and you feel cold. But the most difficult part comes later, when your mind says, 'Ab toh tu theek ho gaya hai, ek baar maar lete hain'. That's when you have to use your willpower\u2026(see more) ",
