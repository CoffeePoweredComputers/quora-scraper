            "answer_text": "If I'm writing both hands together, it only works if I'm writing the same text or my left hand is mirroring my right.  I do not have the ability to write different characters together at the same time ~ it's probably a skill that requires training, and perhaps its natural in some people.  But I'm not like that.  Still I'm considered ambidextrous by most people, or mixed handed if you wanted to be picky about it, because I can write with either hand at ease.  But my preferred hand is right. But I have on occasion write with my left because my right hand was occupied or the pen was nearer to my left so its more convinient to  write on the left than to deliberately use my right.I'm predominantly a leftie in racket-type sports, though I was taught to bat on the right.  As I did not train both hands there is a preference to adopt the more skilful hand, but I can switch for the fun of it, but less skillful, though it doesnt feel weird to hold it in the wrong hand.  I'm both-legged in soccer though.   I eat more often on my left, particularly chopsticks (coz I eat and write at the same time often) though I can use the chopsticks with my right if my left is occupied.  For knives I'm predominantly right.  And same goes with most cutting tools.  Musical instruments I'm a rightie, and thats one skill I cant flip.  Its too much work to train.Other tasks, they get swopped around  I have no idea how long it'd take for me to write different script together with both hands coz I'd never train myself for it but its not a given skill of an ambidextrous.

            "answer_text": "I can't speak to how difficult this must be to learn, but I can cite one useful advantage to having some trade-off between your hands.I write and eat with my left hand, and also use a computer mouse left handed. But beyond that I do most things right-handed, including using a calculator and the numeric/function keys to the right on most keyboards. I find this to be a big advantage in working on a computer, since I can use my right hand to either calculate using the keypad or navigate using the various navigation keys, all the while my left hand is either using the mouse or writing. And, of course, when actually typing on the keyboard both hands come into play. So, although I guess I'm not truly ambidextrous, my own mixed lot of using left vs. right has made me a lot more efficient in working on my computer than a lot of folks I know. Though, sadly, no such skill ever extended to throwing a ball with either hand. ",
