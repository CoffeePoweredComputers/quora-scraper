            "answer_text": "1. Writing daily destroys Imposter Syndrome. Knowledge on a topic isn\u2019t enough. In order for that knowledge to mean anything you have to implement it. Even bad implementation is better than none because it allows you to itterate and improve. The only difference between an \u201caspiring writer\u201d and a writer is that a writer writes. So it\u2019s clear that writing daily is a good way for a writer to improve, but even if you aren\u2019t a writer, writing daily can help you improve your craft. No matter what you want to be known for, writing well will help you to be seen as an expert. If you can clearly articulate the details of your artistry you will be ahead of the masses who cannot. The ability to recount the stories of the success your clients find through you will help future clients be confident in hiring you. Clear written explanations of your process are the foundation of instruction that can become classes and courses. Writing a little every day will help you to be confident in your knowledge. This confidence will destroy imposter syndrome. 2. Writing daily doesn\u2019t have to be time-consuming. I\u2019m not suggesting that you compose an epic every morning. Simply set aside 15 minutes to put a few words down. Don\u2019t pressure yourself to publish those words, especially at first. Some days what you write won\u2019t be worth much, but if you keep at it, some days you will strike gold. Quantity is more important that quality here. The key is showing up and then showing up again. Build the habit. Writing each day at the same time each day will let inspiration know when and where to show up. By the way, this section is 100 words long. Keep this in mind as you read the next section: it doesn\u2019t take much to write 100 words. 3. Writing daily provides the raw materials for greatness. The goal is quantity over quality, but that quantity doesn\u2019t have to come all at once. If you only write 100 words in a sitting but you write every day for a month you will have 3,000 words that you wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. 3,000 words that you can turn into an eBook, a few course lessons, a blog mini-series\u2026 you name it! Words are the building blocks for so many things., \u201cIt all starts with writing!\u201d Want to do a speech? Write.Want to sell products? Write.Want to record a song? Write.Want to compose a book? Write.Want to produce a feature film? Write.Want to make a great podcast? Write.Want to teach an online course? Write.Want to shoot a compelling video? Write.100 words a day is more than most people write but I\u2019d wager that with 15 minutes set aside you won\u2019t be able to stop at 100! Imagine how many words you could write by the end of the year if you simply showed up a little every day. What could you create? A book? A course? A year\u2019s worth of blog posts? ",

            "answer_text": "Write whatever comes into your mind.  Now you\u2019re probably thinking Duh! But what if nothing comes to mind? Well something I do when I get writers block or just don\u2019t know what to write in general is start writing random words such as: PurpleTwoCupEyeAlphaTreeCatOnce I start writing random words more come to mind and thoughts start coming to my head. I can write them down. So what if I\u2019ve been listing random words and it doesn\u2019t work? This is where creativity comes in. Let me take the random words above and try to write a story using those words: A barrista with purple hair served us our two cups. I ordered a latte and my friend ordered a tea. I said thank you as we made eye contact for a second. Subconsciously I smiled. Outside we walked to the park and saw a dog and a cat fighting. I got worried as the dog was much larger and more alpha acting than the cat. The cat got scared and ran up the tree and got stuck. And like that I have written a small story. As you may have noticed I didn\u2019t use the words in the order I had listed. That\u2019s okay. I had gotten a story across. Writing small bits like that everyday can exercise your muscles and improve your writing skills. Even though you may write everyday, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to publish it. You can even delete or throw away the draft when your done! Though I would suggest you keep it as a reference or something to read sometime in the future. Now if you\u2019re referring to writing on Quora, there is some extra advise I can add. From myself and what other Quorans have told me: If you want to get more views/followers/upvotes, I suggest looking through: What are the most followed questions on Quora? because those are the ones that more people will see.People are more likely to read your answer if you have an interesting preview and picture. Basically clickbait but make sure it actually fits with what you are writing about. Otherwise people aren\u2019t going to understand.People will like answers that don\u2019t have pictures, but if you can\u2019t supply pictures make sure your writing is very good.Short answers and long answers can be equally as good, it all depends on the quality.If the algorithm has (as Sarah Madden likes to say) Quorona virus, check your feed to see what\u2019s trending. If you see a certain question is going viral (assuming you hadn\u2019t already answered it of course) answer it!Be unique and different in your writing! Be sarcastic and witty! Be relatable! Having a bunch of writers who have the same writing style is boring.Once you build up followers start making a brand for yourself! Do you want to be known for advice? Do you want to be known as a duck? Maybe adding lyrics to your answers? Something that pertains only to you.Consistency! Consistency! Consistency! I can say that forever and I can hear that forever. The more answers you write the more likely more people will see it. Use the \u201cAnswer Later\u201d option like it\u2019s gold!It is expected to take a long time to reach 100 followers. From what I hear, that is the hardest milestone. It goes uphill from there.Set goals for yourself:100 followers, then 500, then 1k, 2k, 3k ect.100k views, 500k views, 1 million views ect.You can make smaller goals for yourself like 100 then 200. Setting goals can get you more motivated to write. Or even work on drafts.Make sure it\u2019s grammatically correct! I know it can\u2019t be \u201cperfect\u201d but there will be people who will suggest edits. It is up to you if you want to accept them or not.There is no such thing as \u201cThe Perfect Answer\u201d, enough said about that.Sean Kernan might request your answer. That is more common than you think actually. He is searching for new writers or unpopular writers who have excellent answers to feature in his: Gold Medal Answers. Do not let this opportunity go to waste.I can guarantee you will get haters who will: Comment rude things, downvote, and report your answer. Most likely you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. In the event that your answer gets collapsed, edit a couple of words and get it appealed saying you edited it. Just appealing it without editing it has a less likely chance of getting appealed than an answer that got edited.Refrain from big blocks of text whenever possible. It\u2019s easier to read when it\u2019s broken up than staring at a block for five minutes.There will be creeps messaging you. Your best bet is only answer people who state a reason for messaging you. If you do answer to all messages be careful. Do not give away any personal information. Do not be afraid to block and report.It doesn\u2019t hurt to invite your friends to Quora :) It\u2019s always nice to have a fresh point of viewWriting on Quora IS NOT A COMPETITION! Just because you think someone is doing better than you doesn\u2019t mean you have to get upset over it. Your time will come if you work hard enough for it.The last piece of advice than I can give you is: when writing an answer, try your best to stay neutral. If you pick a side of a situation you will get a plethora of comments defending the other side. Then people will comment on their comments defending their side. Then it\u2019s a whole mess.If you have any extra advice, I will be more than happy to edit it in and give you credit for it. If you have any questions in which this answer didn\u2019t include, feel free to ask! ",
