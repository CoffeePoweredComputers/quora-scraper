            "answer_text": "'The Road Not Taken' by Robert Frost tells us the power of our choice and to stick to what you believe in rather than following the crowd. Even though your chosen path may be a bit risky, but the end result is always good. Making your own choice gives you the liberty you need although the path may be risky and filled with doubts. Here is the Piece: Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day!Yet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.                                                                   -Robert Frost ",

ONLY A PERSON WHO RISKS IS FREEby Author Unknown To laugh is to risk appearing the fool.To weep is to risk appearing sentimental.To reach for another is to risk involvement.To expose your ideas, your dreams,before a crowd is to risk their loss.To love is to risk not being loved in return.To live is to risk dying.To believe is to risk despair.To try is to risk failure.But risks must be taken, because thegreatest hazard in life is to risk nothing.The people who risk nothing, do nothing,have nothing, are nothing.They may avoid suffering and sorrow,but they cannot learn, feel, change,grow, love, live.Chained by their attitudes they are slaves;they have forfeited their freedom.Only a person who risks is free.
