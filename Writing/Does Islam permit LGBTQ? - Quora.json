            "answer_text": "Good God, these people and their dumb responses to this question\u2026. In Islam, God says that being Gay is haram, only if you act on those feelings. Like you go out and have a boyfriend as a man and a girlfriend as a woman etc. There is no punishment, like stoning or throwing gay people off of buildings, in Islam. I do not believe that being gay is a choice. I think that people are born gay. If they want to identify as gay and Muslim, good luck to them. That\u2019s between God and that person. No one has the right to say or do anything about it, except God. ",
