            "answer_text": "Definitely not! This can be a strategic decision. The additional information section of the Common App allows students to share information that is crucial for understanding the context of their application. Admissions officers at most top schools read your application holistically and try to understand your accomplishments and perspective on the world in light of your experiences. There are certainly circumstances when it is appropriate and necessary to use the additional information section of the Common App, but there are many scenarios when filling it out might actually harm your chances of admission. Use the additional information section to: Elaborate on a spectacular activity: If the 150 character description of the Common App activities list cannot fully communicate your impact in a unique pursuit, it might be worth expanding upon a particular project, describing the founding mission an unusual activity, or emphasizing how a club has changed your life. However, many schools ask a supplemental essay question about your most meaningful extracurricular. If you are already writing another essay about the importance of an activity, it is not worth repeating yourself in the additional information section. Only use the additional information section in this way if it is your only opportunity to convey the significance of an extracurricular.Emphasize published efforts: Has your research or article been published? Are you included in the byline of a book? Attaching a hyperlink, research abstract, or a short paragraph describing your contribution would be appropriate!Describe extenuating circumstances: If you have experienced a life event that has had a profound impact on your life, this is the place to mention it. Keep in mind that commonplace or trivial circumstances will show you to have a lack of perspective. There are applicants describing life-threatening illnesses, homelessness, and child abuse. In describing difficult circumstances, you should not make excuses, but simply explain the context of your application. Try to quantify the impact your circumstances had on you and state the facts clearly.Explain school system differences: Admissions officers already receive a profile on your school that explains the academic calendar, the classes that are offered, and basic socioeconomic statistics. However, if your school is truly alternative in some way, it might be good to personally explain how this context has impacted you. Have you taken a lot of college courses because your high school offers so few AP courses? Or perhaps your school offers many APs but restricts the number you can take. If this had a significant impact on your learning experience, you might discuss it in the additional information section.Do not use the additional information section to: Stuff in more than 10 activities: Don\u2019t treat this as extra space to spit out more of your resume! Admissions officers appreciate when students are concise and do not waste their time. Strategize your Common App activities list to include as much information as you possibly can! The additional information section is not blank space for you to fill up just for the sake of it.Wrap up your personal statement: There is nothing worse than writing \u201c[to be continued in additional information]\u201d at the end of your personal statement. Admissions officers will roll their eyes, and have a negative impression of you. Follow the Common App directions!Over share photos: You should never submit pictures of you doing an extracurricular! Your mom can post this on her Facebook, but it is not appropriate for the Common App. While it can be appropriate to submit ZeeMee links to art portfolios, you should never include anything that\u2019s best suited to your grandma\u2019s picture frames.Blather about random information: This is not your diary or livestream. Only use this section for necessary context!Before writing in the additional information, be sure to ask yourself: \u201cWhat does this add to my application that isn\u2019t already here?\u201d For more about additional information on the Common App, read this blog!

            "answer_text": "This is a section offered to explain any problems in your file. It's not the same as an optional essay.  If it were, you'd be absolutely right.  I always tell my students \"the definition of optional is \"only if you want to get in.\" Often a student wants to explain a weak grade or semester, an arrest for underage drinking, a disability that might need accommodation.  A lack of extracurricular activities may be offset by family responsibilities, whether it's working to help support the family, or taking care of the house while your parents are working.   If you have  any of these types of situations, this is your chance to explain them.  If not, it's fine to leave the section blank. But your diligence in asking is a very good sign.  Best of luck! ",
