            "answer_text": "I often chat with technical writers on Facebook, and recently I\u2019ve realized that some of them are still using MS Word. It\u2019s quite a shock! I think that nowadays no one uses MS Word because it is uncomfortable for the working process and it doesn\u2019t have all those necessary features for creating great documentation. That\u2019s why I want to share with you a list of the most popular technical writing tools. It\u2019s based on the G2 Crowd score that\u2019s formed by customer satisfaction. MadCap FlareClickHelpHelp & ManualDr. ExplainHelpNDocAdobe RoboHelpI use ClickHelp and I think it\u2019s the best tool. Its interface is more understandable and user-friendly than Flare\u2019s, for example. ClickHelp uses HTML as a topic source format and gives you an opportunity to host your documentation on their server (as well as export to all popular formats and host somewhere else). It provides various single-sourcing features for content reuse and also allows working on multiple documentation projects in a single tool. Finally, it has nice workflow features for the entire team to collaborate on topic review, and they\u2019ve recently introduced a number of useful reports, some of them are not present in Flare. It\u2019s a powerful tool for me with 200+ features, although I don\u2019t use all of them but I know that ClickHelp can meet all of my demands if necessary. ",
