            "answer_text": "To install Wordpress, you  1. download the Wordpress files from Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS2. Create a mysql database on your server/hosting account3. then you upload the files via ftp to your server/hosting account4. You update the Wordpress config file and then run the install script5. You're done. This would install Wordpress on your server but you wouldn't have any design yet except the default one. So to design and setup your site is another story and can take time when you have never done it before. To decide what's better, do it yourself or hire somebody, it would be best you decide how much time you got at hand and how valuable it is. If time is not an issue here, you can try to learn it yourself. You will probably get stuck somewhere at times but its definitely one of the more user friendly CMS systems out there. How much do you know about the technical side? Have you ever uploaded a site to a hosting account or created a mysql database?  If not, even for that there are solutions on most cheap hosting accounts these days to install Wordpress automatically for you (look for a feature called \"Fantastico\"). It literally installs Wordpress on a server in one click. Sam Deacon posted some good tutorials on how you can install Wordpress yourself. Still, it will take time to do especially if you have never done it before. So paying somebody 500 USD to do it for you might be cheaper for you in the end if you save yourself the hassle and any technical issues that might occur. Now all of this does not include picking a theme and customizing it for your needs. This all sounds easy but in the end can take you weeks to get it right. No matter how easy it is to install Wordpress there will always be a large part of people for whom it is much quicker, easier and cheaper to hire somebody to do it for them. We have been helping people with Wordpress since a long time at WordPress CMS Website Development and we even do it for people who are perfectly capable of doing it themselves as they much prefer to save themselves the time it takes to setup, design and manage a WP site.
