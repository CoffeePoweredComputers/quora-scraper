            "answer_text": "You need to start with understanding what you are trying to achieve from your signature. There are generally two camps. People in a sales or marketing role where the volume of external emails is very high and you often want people to take specific action.People in operations roles whose primary use of email is for internal communication with a low volume of external emails.For camp 1, given the volume of emails you are sending, you should be leveraging your email signature to gain an additional edge in getting people to take the action that you desire. Details, like including your photo in your signature, will lift your email engagement. For people in the second camp, you can keep it simpler. It's best to always include all of your communication channels.
