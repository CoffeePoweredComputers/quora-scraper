            "answer_text": "Grammatically speaking, HE GOES HOME ON A BUS is not wrong But then, if you want to mean that he uses a bus as a means of transport to reach home, it is better to say HE GOES HOME by BUS. This construction HE GOES HOME ON A BUS suggests that he travels by sitting on the roof top of the bus - something which one would do, say, if one is desparate to take a particular bus and that all the seats of that bus already gets filled up / reserved by the time he arrives to take it !! So,, just look at the need of the context and decide on the appropriate preposition !!! ",
