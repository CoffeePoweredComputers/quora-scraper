            "answer_text": "How do I reset my Gmail password when I don't remember my recovery information? Sad fact: You CAN\u2019T. Unsurprisingly, Google has very solid account security. Among the finest in the world, in fact. If you have lost or forgotten your Google/Gmail password, or if your account was hacked, you have exactly one way to get back into that account. The automated process that starts here: https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery That\u2019s IT. Really! I\u2019ve answered variations on this other times and places, and added a lot of other detail. But it all adds up to the same thing. If you have a G Suite account thru a business or school, you can call your Administrator. If you own a G Suite hosted domain (cheaper and easier than you think, and worth doing) or if you are an Admin on a domain, then you can call tech support at Google, directly. They\u2019re available 24/7, and trust me, they are good. But with a free Gmail account, if you get locked out, you absolutely cannot contact a human being at Google about it. You can\u2019t call, text, email, snail mail, carrier pigeon or pony express them. Sorry. No.  UPDATE, 10/17/2018. There is a new product, Google One. It offers additional account storage - and tech support, for gmail addresses, including live phone support. Which of course made me VERY curious if this could be used to unlock accounts. So being as I already pay for additional storage and was therefore automatically enrolled in Google One, I filled in the little form, and had them call me. And the answer is\u2026 NO. The tech support folks you can reach with the Google One service do indeed work for Google. But they do not (and cannot!) offer any assistance for locked out accounts, other than to walk you thru the automated process. If that process fails to get you in - you lost the account.  Side issue: The reason there are so many collapsed answers here is because there are a ton of scammers out there who want you to call them, and they work hard to get their links into Quora answers. They will also use every trick there is to convince you they are somehow affiliated with or sanctioned by Google. They aren\u2019t. They can only use the same automated process I linked above - and charge you good money for doing something you can do yourself. Again, there is only one way to recover a free Gmail/Google account. https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery If you can\u2019t get in using that process, you lost the account. Forever.  So the best advice I can give you is to carefully go thru the Security Checkup process on your Google Account page, here: https://myaccount.google.com You can set up a recovery phone number and email address. I STRONGLY suggest you use both, and make the recovery email address one that belongs to a close family member or trustworthy friend. NOT one of your own, that you may forget or lose! Also set up 2-Step Verification, using every possible safety option, including printing your recovery codes and stashing them in several places. Used properly, 2 Step can and will prevent your account getting hacked. ",
