            "answer_text": "Good question. Hieroglyphs were usually a monumental script, being used in temples and tombs. Through this, hieroglyphs simply stopped being used, together with the temples, when the Ancient Egyptian religion died out around 400 CE. The Ancient Egyptians used a plethora of other scripts alongside hieroglyphs, that originally evolved from them: these are Cursive hieroglyphs (in use c. 2400 BCE \u2013200 CE)Hieratic (in use c. 3000 BCE \u2013210 CE)Abnormal hieratic (in use c. 750 BCE \u2013550 CE (exclusively in Upper/southern Egypt))Demotic (in use c. 640 BCE \u2013452 CE)They were used for different things at different times, but have that in common that they were used on perishable materials, most often papyrus. When Christianity came to Egypt around 60 CE; the newly converted Egyptian Christians wanted to translate the Bible into the Egyptian language. The reason for their development of the Coptic alphabet (in use c. 100 CE \u2013c. 1100 CE [letters were taken from Greek and a few from demotic to compensate for the lack of some Greek equivalents]), can perhaps be attributed to them not wanting to write the Bible with a script that included symbols for Pagan gods.  Example of Cursive Hieroglyphs, with normal Hieroglyphs on the right (source: Allen, Middle Egyptian, 2nd edition, 2010)  Example of Hieratic, with normal Hieroglyphs at the bottom (source: Allen, Middle Egyptian, 2nd edition, 2010)  An example of Demotic (source: Allen, Middle Egyptian, 2nd edition, 2010)  An example of Coptic (source: Allen, Middle Egyptian, 2nd edition, 2010) ",

            "answer_text": "The Greecks Invated Egypt and than the Romans. After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C., Ptolemy I declared himself pharaoh of Egypt. Originally from Macedonia \u2014 what is now Greece \u2014 Ptolemy\u2019s rise to power marked the beginning of the Hellenistic period in Egypt. For the next 300 years, the Ptolemaic dynasty ruled that country, with Alexandria becoming a center of Greek culture. The era ended with the Roman conquest in 30 B.C and the death of Cleopatra. During the Ptolemaic period many Greeks, as well as people from the eastern Mediterranean, migrated to Egypt. Cleopatra was the last Pharoe and that was it. Since than Egypt started to detached itself from it's ancient historical heritage.  The rich lands of Egypt became the property of Rome after the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BCE, which spelled the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty that had ruled Egypt since the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE. After the murder of Gaius Julius Caesar in 44 BCE, the Roman Republic was left in turmoil. Fearing for her life and throne, the young queen joined forces with the Roman commander Mark Antony, but their resounding defeat at the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE brought the adopted son and heir apparent of Caesar, Gaius Julius Octavius, to the Egyptians whent a shores. Desperate, Cleopatra chose suicide rather than face the humiliation of capture. According to one historian, she was simply on the wrong side of a power struggle The Coptic Period 395 \u2013 642 CE Christianity came to Egypt early in the form of the evangelist Mark. Having been repressed under Roman rule for so long the Egyptians responded well to a religion that promised paradise in the hereafter. The Egyptian Christians, called Copts, maintained many ancient forms of worship and mixed pagan traditions of ancient Egypt, including music and incense, with the new Christian religion. Even today, the spoken language used in the Coptic Church is effectively ancient Egyptian. Once the Christian religion took over in the 4th century and the Coptic Egyptians patriarchy was the leading religion. The Egyptian by that time were a complete mixed cosmopolitan nation. However, since the Arab Invated Egypt in the 7th century, Egypt simply went down the drain from being centrally influenced as they used to be. From the Islamic conquest to 1250 The period of Egyptian history between the advent of Islam and Egypt\u2019s entrance into the modern period opens and closes with foreign conquests: the Arab invasion led by \u02bfAmr ibn al-\u02bf\u0100\u1e63 in AD 639\u2013642 and the Napoleonic expedition of 1798 mark the beginning and end of the era. Within the context of Egyptian internal history alone, this era was one in which Egypt cast off the heritage of the past to embrace a new language and a new religion\u2014in other words, a new culture. While it is true that the past was by no means immediately and completely abandoned and that many aspects of Egyptian life, especially rural life, continued virtually unchanged, it is nevertheless clear that the civilization of Islamic Egypt diverged sharply from that of the previous Greco-Roman period and was transformed under the impact of Western occupation. The subsequent history of Egypt is therefore largely a study of the processes by which Egyptian Islamic civilization evolved, particularly the processes of Arabization and Islamization. ",
