            "answer_text": "She was a junior and had a boyfriend oof. She was in my Spanish class. Latina too. Even though she didn\u2019t know any Spanish, I still liked her for her thick ass, big *you-know-whats*, and\u2026. I don\u2019t know- other things, but I can\u2019t think right now. Despite looking the way she did, I assumed she had no boyfriend. This was because I thought I knew that she was a Freshman. I mean, thin about it. I\u2019ve never seen her before, I thought I recognized her from middle school, I knew for sure she wasn\u2019t in my grade (I know everyone in my grade), and she was good friends with this other Freshman girl (one I had a crush on before, but that doesn\u2019t matter here). Her name was Anastasia (legit real name cuz no one gonna go looking her up, hopefully). The story goes\u2026.. The first day I saw her in Spanish class, I was thinking, \u201cOh, shiii! Damn.\u201d Then I somehow knew she knew no Spanish. I knew she was Latina because her name was pronounced Ah-nn-ah. Now, I remembered something a friend said to me about my sixth grade crush and why she dated a seventh grader: \u201cThe girls just like older guys. That simple.\u201d From a friend because I never learned anything from my dad. Unless you count how to fix cars, phones, computers, and a bunch of other things to do with technology (he\u2019s an engineer), oh, and math, which I hate. I never learned anything from him about puberty is what I mean. I got information from my friends, porn, or gym class. When he tried to give me the talk once, I just sat there, and he could see I was uncomfortable, as was he, and that I knew everything. Back to the story. I\u2019m good at Spanish. I taught myself some last year, but I had to take Spanish I because I never took any Spanish in school, only French. I offered help to the whole class, as a \u201ctrap\u201d for her. None of the students, not even her, have asked me for help yet. Don\u2019t worry, as finals come, they\u2019ll crawl to me. I don\u2019t have a crush on her anymore, but here\u2019s what happened: Class Color Day for the pep-rally: We all wore our class colors for the pep-rally. I wore white because I was a Sophomore. All the Freshman wear yellow. Juniors- red; Seniors- blue. So\u2026. We all here at school. Spanish class, first class of the day. All yellow and white in the class. Anna comes in wearing red, so I tease her, saying, \u201cWrong color, Anna! Where\u2019s your yellow?\u201d Anna: Yellow is an ugly color. I thought she was being a rebel. Which I would have liked, but I still went on to say, \u201cBut you\u2019re a Freshman.\u201d Anna: I\u2019m a Junior! Wow, to think. I teased her to start conversation, and said she was a Freshman to keep up the conversation. Then it all abruptly stopped because I assumed. Oh, another thing my dad taught me. Assume= Ass u+me. So, I spent the next couple weeks sending her her own homecoming pictures with the Freshmen, saying, :This is why I thought you were a Freshman lmao\u201d That didn\u2019t turn me off though. One other night, I\u2019m friends\u2019 house. I do karate and jujitsu with them, and we go over there almost every Friday night after class. One of them, the boy (go figure), Naveen, just plays Call of Duty because he only talks to me at karate, apparently. My sister and I go up to hang out with Nisa, the girl. We just talk about whatever because board games bore us. We tried. We tried playing truth or dare; that didn\u2019t last long because we couldn\u2019t think of not-dirty-things for dares without annoying the parents with our clean dares. Nisa and I decided to call random people on our phones cuz why not. I told Nisa who she could call because there\u2019s not much people in my contacts; I don\u2019t have many friends. I didn\u2019t want to call anyone on Nisa\u2019s phone because, like, all her friends are younger than me, SHE\u2019S younger than me, two years younger. If I had to guess, she just wanted to call people on my phone because they\u2019re older than her, and she\u2019d enjoy talking to someone else who\u2019s older. She calls up Anna because I think she\u2019d be fine with it. She was with someone because a guy picked up. Nisa asked who it was. He answered her boyfriend. Nisa hung up. That\u2019s what turned me off. I don\u2019t have a crush on her anymore. I also told her that, regardless of what was said, I supposedly \u201cDidn\u2019t like her like that, and never did.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "My crush really hurt me by leading me on which then brought me to finding the most amazing person I now call my girlfriend and hopefully to be fianc\u00e8. I was hella crushing on a girl in school so I asked her to \u201cProm\u201d. She said \u201cYeah\u201d and I thought a love was blooming. But she didn't feel the same, or she did but wasn't into monogamy. Point is, she was a very illusive on the tongue, a lover of white lies and had more strings on people than a puppeteer on his puppets. I was smitten and got dragged along for months until I had had enough. By that stage I had been reunited with old friends who she knew. One of these old friends was a incredibly funny and charming girl I had known from crawling and chewing on my toes years. Her name was katelyn. Someone I would walk to and from school with and a plethora of inside jokes with yet never had any feelings in anyway more than friends for. So I called of the debs partnership and cut ties which was very hard but was best. And my friend convinced me to ask Katelyn! Here how it went. \u201cKatelyn (2nd name), would you do me the honor of going to Debs(Prom) with me?\u201d she replied. \u201cI would be honored\u201d So she accepted! That was at the start of summer break, the next 4 months were spent growing closer and falling in love before I asked her out finally. She said \u201cNoooooo\u201d jokingly and then said I could call her mine. Since then we've moved in with each other, traveled the world, fallen in love and planned a future. Yeah I guess that's a plot twist if not, well sorry and have a good day! ",
