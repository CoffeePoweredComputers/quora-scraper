            "answer_text": "1 Sigmund Freud, The Interpretation of Dreams (1900) ( personal favorite ).  plenty of entertaining stories mixed in with Freud\u2019s philosophical analyses. He relates his own and the dreams of others in considerable details, showing how he proceeds through what we now know as free association to understanding their meaning to the dreamer. Once you read even a few pages, you\u2019ll see why, unlike the myth, you can\u2019t just plug a dream into a formula and expect to come out with its meaning.  2. Charles M. Duhigg, The Power of Habit (2012)  After reviewing this book when it first was published, I felt that despite having taught the psychology of learning for my entire career, I was able to grasp the field in an entirely new way from this great book. Sure, everyone in psychology, from the intro psych student to the most highly-regarded researcher knows about classical conditioning. We\u2019ve all learned of its role in cuing our most desirable, but often most undesirable, actions, addictions, and thoughts. But it\u2019s not always easy to see how these behavioral principles apply to our everyday behaviors.   3. Karen Horney, The Neurotic Personality of Our Time (1937)  So, when you saw this title, did you think \u201cof our time\u201d must surely be now? Though published in 1937, obviously neurotic personalities have always existed and most likely will continue to exist well into the future. It\u2019s quite likely that because she was translating her theory into pop terms that she (or her publisher) advised her to add the \u201cof our time\u201d to give it a self-help twist. 4. Oliver Burkeman, The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can\u2019t Stand Positive Thinking(2012)  Apart from agreeing with Burkeman\u2019s basic thesis, I also found myself contemplating, in the years since reading it, the benefits of mental cleansing that he describes as the path to gaining greater underlying appreciation of life. Burkeman went on a journey that I most likely will never have the chance to do in which he entered a meditation retreat for where, detached from the outer world, he and his fellow journeyers explored their own inner lives. You can follow Burkeman, as did I, through this experience and perhaps you\u2019ll emerge with a new awareness of how a bit of realistic pessimism might be a good thing after all.  5. Carl Gustav Jung, Man and His Symbols (1964)  Jung\u2019s take on psychology definitely veered toward the spiritual. Although the theory became the basis for one of the most widely use (and abused) tests (see Adam Grant\u2019sand my blog posts on the topic), it was Jung\u2019s insights into our cultural icons, or what he called \u201carchetypes\u201d that may have been his greatest contribution. This book is appropriately illustrated with images so that the reader can understand Jung\u2019s analysis of their symbolic meaning.  Another interesting feature of this book, for me, was his exploration of the notion of \u201csynchronicity.\u201d  6. Gina Perry, Behind the Shock Machine, 2013  The classic Milgram experiments are as a staple in the social psych section of virtually every intro psych course in the world. Instructors and students alike are appalled at the apparent cruelty that average people are ready and able to impose on their fellow humans. I came across Perry\u2019s book when it was still available only in Australia, and was delighted that the author was able to get a copy for me to review. 7. Matthew Hutson, The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking, 2012  By taking readers through the ins and outs of cognitive science, Hutson also provides basic lessons in the experimental method. The book also provides an A-B-C primer for the student of skepticism.  You\u2019ll undoubtedly recognize your own irrational beliefs among the 7 while at the same time gaining the tools to identify and target ones that Hutson may have as yet left undiscovered. 8. Susan R. Barry, Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist\u2019s Journey into Seeing in Three DImensions, 2009  Scientists who write about their own experiences present readers with unique opportunities to understand a phenomenon. Susan Barry, a neuroscientist at Mount Holyoke College (and Psych Today blogger), provides such a perspective to our understanding of depth perception. Every intro psych, if not high school biology, student knows that we need slightly disparate images to reach the two retinas of our eyes in order to see the world in perfect 3-D. Perry had an unusual condition that caused her to be stereoblind from early infancy, meaning that she could not see the world with the depth afforded to the rest of us.  Her successful treatment was written up by Oliver Sacks in 2004 as the case of \u201cStereo Sue,\u201d drawing public attention for the first time to her condition. ",

            "answer_text": " Joker is a psychopathic criminal mastermind whereas Batman has a sense of justice and is determined to fight against evil to protect Gotham city. Though they are fictional characters from the very famous American comic books, their characters are no less relatable to the people we see around us. We all have tremendous capability to do evil as well as good. However, nor all of us are evil neither good! So what is it that determines human behaviour? Have you ever thought why you do things in a particular way, what influences decisions made by you, why you end up buying a specific product out of so many products in the market and most importantly why you are the way you are! Answer to these questions lies in the study of psychology that helps to determine the underlying aspects of human behaviour. If you are interested in understanding human behaviour and psychology behind it, the following books may help you in your big mission. 1.  Sheena Iyengar is a famous psychologist well-known for her famous jam experiment. This book focuses on how human beings make choices and how those choices are affected by external factors. 2.  Dan Ariely is a cognitive science professor at Duke University. In this book, Ariely has emphasized on how seemingly meaningless changes can greatly influence our behaviour even without our realization. 3.  This book provides an insightful examination of how and why we self-justify everything we do and the danger of this tendency to self-justify. 4.  This is yet another book by Dan Ariely. In this book, he uses several experiments to investigate the nature of dishonesty. It examines why and when cheating occurs. Whether it\u2019s useful and how it can be discouraged. 5.  Joseph Annibali is a chief psychiatrist at Amen Clinics, Washington, D.C. In this book, he has explored the root causes of a busy brain and body. Eventually, you will learn strategies for calming your busy brain and managing your mind. 6.  In this book, you will learn how to decipher body language, break down others fears, values, beliefs and attitudes, and understand the driving force behind peoples\u2019 actions. ",
