            "answer_text": "At the risk of offending a million Bollywood fans, I want to say Sholay.  Sholay has been a complete film, an iconic film that has ruled hearts of film goers for 4 decades now. I have lost track of the number of times I have watched the movie, suffice to say that I can recall almost all the dialogues in the movie. Sure, there have been avoidable errors, mostly related to continuity, but hey who is counting those? Anyway. Coming to the scene that ruined the movie. This is the one  Thakur has finally got Gabbar at his mercy, he is about to kill him off when the police come into the scene. Then there is this twaddle about \u2018rule of law\u2019 and in total contrast to what has been happening so far, Thakur walks away. The nauseating bit starts at 3:36 in this clip. It ruins the movie. Whenever I watch the movie, I walk away at this point. Cannot bear it. Why did this happen? It happened because India was (is?) a nanny State and governments have long felt that they need to control what Indians consume. The censor Board refused to allow the original end, where the villain is killed, and made the Director change the scene. [1] You can watch the original ending here  Would this not have been truly brilliant? Footnotes[1] Watch Sholay's deleted climax in which Thakur kills Gabbar",
