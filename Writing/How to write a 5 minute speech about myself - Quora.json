            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Illustrate Whatever you want to tell the audience, don't tell it literally, give instances / examples that prove it. For example if you want to share with the audience that you are an extremey patient person, don't tell them \"I'm a very patient\". Tell them an instance when you displayed this extreme patience: \"I often wait for my friends for 2 hours without getting annoyed at all\". Stories Facts tell stories sell. Use stories to get the audience members' interest and to make your points memorable. Whether you are talking about your years growing up, job, school, parents, family, hobbies, self, share in the form of a story. Think of all the memorable lessons / messages that you have learned from others, aren't they all in the form of stories in your head? Relevance Know your audience members and find out a little on their background. Are they in a particular industry? Do they share the same common interests? What do they want or need to know? Given any opportunity to do a sharing / speech / training, I always make it a point to share something with the audience that will benefit them. It can still be about them knowing you but more importantly what lesson / experience can you share with them to add value to their lives? If you're speaking to a group of IT developers whom you intend to be a part of, there's no need to talk about your pet. There's no relevance and not enough time in a short 5-min speech. You can talk about video games, about your past projects, some skilled programming friend you know, the future of IT, etc. Plus, you can talk about what you have learned from those experiences, perhaps they could learn about it from your speech as well. Length A 5-minute speech is extremely short. You can consider this format that I usuall use for up to 7-minute speech. Introduction - 40 seconds to 1 min Body - 3 points (stories) of around 1 min each. Perhaps 1 about you, 1 about your family, and 1 about your job (or aspiration). Conclusion - 1 minute On average, we speak 2-3 words per second. So for 5 minutes, 300 seconds, you have a maximum of 900 words for your script. Humour You must include some humour in your speech, at least 1 laughter point for the audience. Humour engages and entertains the audience. When they are entertained, they would like you that little bit more. Once they like you, they would remember you. If they remember you, they remember the message. Isn't that what we all strive for? Work the audience Get the audience to participate at least once in your speech, especially at the start. Ask them a simple question that they have to answer. Or at least ask them a rhetorical question that gets them thinking. It's preferable to get them answer \"Yes\" to whatever question you're asking. Positivity works in your favour. You could also get the audience to say some keywords after you. Funny or catchy phrase maybe. \u201cI eat to live, not live to eat\u201d. Write for the ear, not the eyes While preparing the script, read out your every sentence. Make sure they sound alright when verbally spoken. For example, we would write nevertheless, however, etc. In real conversations, we just use 'but'. Also, write and speak in shorter sentences and simple words. Unlike reading, audience members can't go back to your previous sentence or point if they miss something.  All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "5 min is easy. Break it into parts. Make it relatable. A lesson learned. Here\u2019s the parts: -Family lineage Start w your parents and, if their story is interesting, even add your grandparents. Everyone likes to hear about one\u2019s lineage, particularly if yours involves your people coming here - a success story, hardships overcome, etc. A special relative story (everyone loves a special mom or dad story) while you were growing up is usually a winner. Or funny family stories that involved you or at least impacted you. You have to be in, or related to, these background stories. -Wife / Husband and Kids Who doesn\u2019t like to hear tributes to a spouse or what wonderful kids you have (although, be careful hyping the kids too much; people can become competitive RE their own). Emphasis is on love and togetherness. Your inspirations. -Finally, yourself!! Ok now you\u2019ve set the stage: you\u2019ve won the audience over w a funny grandma or dad story, with how much your spouse means to you and you\u2019ve given a shout out to your kids. \u2026 3 minutes has passed by now. Now it\u2019s time for \u201c\u201cyou.\u201d First, EVERYONE has to have at least one interesting thing about themselves. And you only need 2 min to do this now. Be humble, humorous, and self effacing but confident in telling them at least one interesting thing about yourself. And a lesson learned you can share that the audience will relate to. Write out bullet points to practice each of the above parts beforehand but DO NOT read them at speech time. This type of speech comes from the heart - w eye contact - not from a page or an index card. Piece of cake!! Good luck. ",

At least half the other people writing five-minute speeches about themselves will start with when and where they were born, what their families are like and perhaps where they went to school. Don\u2019t start that way. Start by saying, \u201cThere are three things that you need to know about me: I always notice the weather; I never notice how people are dressed; and I\u2019m always ready to meet someone for coffee.\u201d Or: Tell people what you enjoy most in a typical day and what you enjoy least. Or: Explain how and why you behave differently from all your brothers and sisters. An approach like that (like just one of those, to be clear) will help you organize something that everyone will enjoy and remember. In a five-minute speech, you can work in the necessary minimum details about your hometown, education and professional background after about three minutes and 30 seconds, but you can mention all those things without stressing them unduly. Don\u2019t start with being born. ",

Something glib, perhaps, not holding back on how he shines from above all others, not recognizing the sun as competition. But certainly this five minute limit is a paltry amount of time for him to talk about himself, he may debate and bitch about that. ",

Map that incident out into a rough outline - first sentence (must catch the audience attention) - the body will give the body of the incident (how many paragraphs etc.) - the ending (make it short and crisp). Humour is always helpful, but don\u2019t attempt it if you\u2019re not sure that you\u2019re being funny. Avoid over-used words such as \u2018very\u2019 or \u2018really\u2019 and avoid colloquialisms and slang speech, unless it is being used for special effect. Good luck! ",
