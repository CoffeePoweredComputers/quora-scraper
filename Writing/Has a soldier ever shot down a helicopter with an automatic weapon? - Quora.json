            "answer_text": "Yes. It was a tactic used in the Vietnam war. Enemy forces would simply all fire straight up without attempting to aim, when a US helicopter was flying overhead. It was not a highly effective tactic, but occasionally they would hit something important. It had the advantage that they would not need to leave whatever cover or concealment they were enjoying at the moment. ",

Shot down may not be as accurate a term as causing damage sufficiently to prevent further flight, requiring an unplanned and/or not fully controlled landing. In the case of crew served automatic weapons such as .51 cal. or larger, there were helicopters shot down in the classic sense. ",
