            "answer_text": "There are many different methods authors employ but in regards to fiction the most common structure that most people use is 1- Have an idea for the story theme (revenge, adventure, drama, tragedy ect) 2- Decide where the story will be set and the genre (sci-fi, real world, fantasy ect) 3- Create a protagonist and decide on their strengths and flaws as a person (a perfect all good character is incredibly boring to read about) 4- Create an antagonist and decide their strengths and flaws but ideally they should be difficult for your protagonist to overcome. 5- Create your supporting characters, ideally with strengths and flaws that can benefit or hinder your protagonist or antagonist 6- Decide where/how your story will start and where/how it will end 7-Decide how the story gets from the starting point to the finishing point 8- Decide on your character arcs, will they succeed in their goal? Will they fail? Will they change as a person along the way? How do they change? This is perhaps the single most important part of a story and shows your characters humanity and ability to be related to. 9- Think about each chapter, what will it add to the story? 10- write the story, once finished let it sit for a while then go back and revise it. Then begins the long and painful editing process. If an author ever tells you that they just sit down and the words flow out of them, they are lying, books take time and thought and most importantly preparation. Hope this is helpful. ",
