            "answer_text": "Fasting is usually done by adults. But what about those over weighted teens who want to lose weight? This video will show you if fasting is safe for teenagers.  If you\u2019re new to fasting Fasting TV has a free audio book on Intermittent fasting for health and weight loss. While the whole idea of fasting is interesting some places really do make it more complicated than it needs to be. This audio book gives you a complete guide to follow taking it back to basics and is all about the results. For those who are more visual learners, this should answer the question. ^ Prefer to read? what\u2019s up beautiful people great comment from yesterday\u2019s video is fasting okay for teens ondrea\u2019s who\u2019s 20 wants to know no don\u2019t raise your twenty so doesn\u2019t really matter if it\u2019s okay for teens for yourself but he\u2019s fasting okay for teens and the truth is it all comes down to human physiology now there\u2019s so much nutritional mumbo jumbo and really a lot of the time it\u2019s the blind leading the blind and even people that present themselves as health experts are obviously unhealthy and hormonal II dysregulated themselves and guys it comes down to our physiology it\u2019s not one person\u2019s opinion versus another person\u2019s opinion there\u2019s certain diet and health experts that I like and I appreciate what they have to say and there\u2019s other diet and health experts that I believe are lying and nefarious and they have you know dogmas and ideologies behind the advice that they give or maybe they\u2019re just wrong but what\u2019s really important is what does your body actually do what is the truth and if you\u2019re a team and you are fasting guess what fasting does it physiologically it cranks down your fat storage hormone and it cranks up your growth hormone so if you\u2019re a teen whether you\u2019re a boy or a girl and you want to turn down your fat storage hormone and turn up your growth hormone that\u2019s something like you know my daughter is only sixteen and a half months old but she already fasts thirteen or fourteen hours a day and that\u2019s only going to get longer and guys it\u2019s just the hormones your basic human physiology says when you avoid spiking your fat storage hormone insulin when you avoid doing things that release insulin for an extended period of time that\u2019s when your growth hormone finally gets to start pumping so if you are teen and you want to grow big and strong and lean and athletic then do some fast thing and it doesn\u2019t have to be all day you can start with you start accruing the benefits of fasting at 14 hours and that is easy think about how easy that is you know we sit down as a family we have dinner at 6 o\u2019clock we eat a nice dinner we talk about our days we really connect from 6 p. m. to 7 p. m: 7 p. m. we have five hours till midnight you get up and you don\u2019t eat anything until 9: 00 in the morning right there that\u2019s a 14 hour fast that is the entry level to fasting and what else should we do avoid all snacks so we shouldn\u2019t open like intermittent fasting just boggles my mind because yeah you start accruing some benefits every day from making that fast longer but you don\u2019t want to open up a feeding window where it\u2019s at all you don\u2019t want to die fasted for 16 hours and then I spent the next eight hours eating what you want to do is break at the beginning break that feast into partial feasts so fast for 14 hours yeah break your fast have a partial feast go a little bit longer maybe another partial feast and then finish with that dinner again at 6 o\u2019clock at night 6 to 7 sitting down with the family connecting being there face to face looking people that you love and care about in the eyes and genuinely being interested in their day and yeah if you\u2019re a teenager you\u2019re still going to high school one guys sorry you lost the feed there for a second I lost the feed Randall called all sorts of shenanigans with our home deal right now and we got Maddox like just clawing me to death because she\u2019s a beast anyways please smash the thumbs up right now and go check out my facebook I\u2019m gonna be on that later today so please smash the thumbs up if you\u2019re a teen absolutely you should do fasting you should fast for at least 14 hours every day you should feast it\u2019s all the things that I talk about an effortless eight to opt our hormones you know crank down your fat storage hormone crank up your lean body hormone crank up your fat breakdown hormone and you\u2019re gonna crank up your sex hormones so I think is a team guy like you\u2019re probably already pumping a ton of testosterone but maybe we can pump a little bit more and we can definitely pump more growth hormone so that we maximize our high potential so your genetics for me be like oh yeah you could probably be five nine but if you do the right things for your hormones maybe you\u2019ll be six one I don\u2019t know it\u2019s possible I\u2019m six foot three and a half and my brother is five foot nine so same parents both of them and I think he did some different things in middle school and high school and I did some other different things I slept more I did more of you know even if that stage of my life was still more health conscious than he was and you know long term I appreciate being six three and he\u2019s probably bummed that he\u2019s five nine and he has a brother that\u2019s six three now if you\u2019re shorter it\u2019s not a problem I\u2019m just saying optimize our hormones and live every day as healthfully as possible well maybe on every day maybe sometimes we party but I love you guys please smash the thumbs up I\u2019ll be back tomorrow oh and I\u2019ll be on Facebook later today peace..

            "answer_text": "The question isn\u2019t can you fast. The question is \u201cShould you fast?\u201d At 14 you should not fast. Your body and your mind are still developing and need nutrition to continue developing normally. If you are significantly overweight, go on a diet and increase your activity level. If you are not, why, on earth, would you want to fast. Fasting is an extreme measure. The key to losing weight, if that is your goal, is to reduce not only the quantity of food you consume but also change the type of food you eat to be more nutritional with fewer empty calories. I am neither a dietitian nor a medical doctor. You could do a few thing that will help. First, join a gym and go regularly. If all you do is run on the treadmill for an hour every day, you will be in better shape. If you can\u2019t afford to join a gym, start walking a mile or more every day. Second, start counting your calories. Make sure you know how many calories are in such things as a hamburger. It is a lot more than you think. Third, find out the nutritional value of what you are eating. More fiber, less sugar and carbs, less fat. Not zero, just less. Fourth, do not adopt any crazy diet. You cannot sustain that crazy diet forever and when you quit it, you will gain almost all the weight back. Fifth, journal your food. I recommend MyFitnesspal.com. Once you\u2019ve started it will be easy but it will be shocking when you start. This web site has a journal and will also keep track of your exercise and the calories you burn. It has healthy recipes and wonderful exercise suggestions. No, do not fast. Find some other more healthy way to accomplish what you want. I have assumed you want to lose weight. ",

            "answer_text": "Just my 2 cents (anecdotal). If I were you I\u2019d wait until you stop growing and then you can stop, take a good look at yourself and, as truthfully as you can, evaluate whether you really need to go on a fast or whether your current diet is meeting your dietary needs. Rough rule of thumb is around 20 years old plus or minus 2 years. At 14 you shouldn\u2019t risk depriving yourself of nutrition if you\u2019re already eating like you should. Later you can discuss a plan with your primary care physician or a dietician or nutrition advisor and make that part of your life style which should include your diet, exercise, sleep, and mental health (avoiding causes of too much stress). Keep in mind that as you become older (after 20) you\u2019ll have to adjust for decrease in metabolism which (another rule of thumb) is about 1 % a year decrease after 20. So at 25 you won\u2019t notice much difference but at 40 you might notice that if you don\u2019t adjust with more exercise or less food you\u2019ll begin to accumulate more weight. Exercise is important not so much to lose weight but for your body to function at its best. One thing you might not ever read is that it is important for you to be active (walk, move around, not be sedentary) because you lymph system doesn\u2019t have much of a pump other than for you to be moving around. If you don\u2019t move around then everything becomes more stagnant and that leads to future eventual health problems. You have to be active and it should be as much of a part of your life as brushing your teeth and personal hygiene like bathing. There are many ways so you just have to find a few that are agreeable to you. ",

Your body is still developing, your brain is still developing and changing. Hormones are still in flux. There are so many things going on inside your body right now, the last thing you want to do is stop feeding your body. You want to not mess anything up? Don\u2019t fast. Don\u2019t diet!

The best thing you can do is follow the advice in my link above - begin to adopt healthy life practices, follow them until they become habits! This will be far more than weight, this will be life-long health. When you hit 20 and you think you still need to lose weight, then think about intermittent fasting. ",
