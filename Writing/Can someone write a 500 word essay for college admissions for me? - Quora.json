            "answer_text": "\u201cFor you?\u201d Well, no. Someone writing an essay that you put your name to won\u2019t benefit you at all. You are asking on Quora. That suggests that you are hoping someone will write the essay for free, maybe as an answer to this question. What kind of quality do you think you will get? And if you don\u2019t feel able to write the essay on your own, do you have the skills to evaluate the quality of any essay you receive? Or maybe you are expecting someone will do it for a fee. That will cost you money, and you will be dealing with someone who, by definition, is dishonest. How likely is it that you will come out ahead in such a deal? But let\u2019s suppose that you do get into college with a ghostwritten essay. What do you do now? You will be expected to turn in more essays, possibly more than one a week. And each one will need to be at least as good as your application essay, and reflect what you have learned in the class. This question implies that you are not up to doing that, and you may fail those classes. Can you afford to pay a ghostwriter for each one? Can you count on not getting caught? Can you afford to get kicked out of college? A quick anecdote. One student in a college class I taught attended class about half the time, didn\u2019t turn in a lot of the homework assignments, and left the final exam more than half blank. After I gave him an F for the class, he e-mailed me to ask if I could change it to a C. He said if I didn\u2019t, he would be out $6,000. (I didn\u2019t. That was his problem, not mine.) If you can\u2019t write your own essay, you are not ready for college. ",

They tend to be shady, and there's no guarantee they won't sell \u201cyour\" essay to fifty other applicants at the same college. But they do exist. Before you spend money for something that might get you blackballed, however, consider: If you can't even write a 500 word admissions essay, how on Earth are you going to survive college? Do you plan to buy every essay you'll be assigned in every class? What do you plan to do on in-class exams that have an essay component? What good will your degree be when you land that first job and can't do most of it because you never actually did your own work to learn how? College admissions staff expect you to write like you're at the end of high school. They want to see how you express yourself when something you desperately want is on the line. The only person who can tell them is you. ",

Further, your dishonesty in asking the question indicates that your value system is badly out of whack. Consider also that if you can\u2019t write a coherent 500-word essay, you will not succeed in college. As a result, you will waste your time and money only to wash out of college with nothing gained. I suggest you check community colleges for writing courses, take one, and then write your own essay. ",
