            "answer_text": "a. Be controlled in your feedback. Do not exaggerate facts and go over the top , which may come off as pretentious and affectatious. Example : You have done a good job at bagging this customer's business, the one we both visited couple of weeks back. They are happy with you as well, and would like to continue working with us. Let's see where this takes us. I am certainly happy seeing this customer on board. Compare this with the below. Example: What would I have done without you. I think your presence in that meeting,with that giant customer couple of weeks back was electric. They are ecstatic about the whole thing, and would love to deal with you. I'm not going to let anyone else interfere between you and this customer, since they have made a mention of being very happy with you. You have scaled new heights for our department by bringing this customer on board. b. Be impartial with your feedback. If there are improvement areas that the colleague needs to work on , but he is still, overall, doing a great job, be honest with the limitations that he needs to focus on. Example : Your colleague may be great at speaking to customers, but lousy at sending professional emails. Tell him the truth. Don't paint a rosy-eyed picture and tell him things that only make him feel good. Certainly, good and bad co-exist in most cases. Perfection is a deception. ",
