            "answer_text": "At terminal velocity it is not realistic at all. Average terminal speed is around 120 mph. If someone was to try to hang on during deployment with just arms and legs they would be ripped away from the person with the canopy. Now, if you were to hang on to someone right out the door and they deployed immediately that is a different story. People do that regularly for what is called a Mr. Bill jump. Again though, it wouldn't happen 999 times out of a 1000 if both jumpers were at terminal velocity. The forces would be to great. Imagine trying to hang on to a car at 120 mph and having it slam on the breaks. Doubt you would be able to hang on and not get ripped away. ",

            "answer_text": "Relative speed in skydiving is everything when it comes to flying to grips in a skydiving formation. We have all kinds of tools to help us do that. Some people wear weights to make them fall a bit faster, others wear bulky sleeves or bigger suits to help \u201cfloat\u201d a bit. The action you described above however would be quite difficult to compensate for and would probably have been done in CGI. We have done stunts though where a wing suiter hooked up with someone under a very small parachute. ",
