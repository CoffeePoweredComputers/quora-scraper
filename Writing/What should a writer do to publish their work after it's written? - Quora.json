            "answer_text": "Hi there, First thing\u2019s first: revise and edit. Seek constructive criticism and revise and edit again. Repeat as many times as is necessary until you feel you cannot go any further with this process without the help of a professional. Once you have reached this stage, thoroughly proofread your manuscript for grammatical and punctuation errors. Then decide if: You want to go the traditional publishing route which means finding an agent to represent you and sell your manuscript to a publisher.You want to self-publish your book which means learning how to format your manuscript, create a book cover (or buy one), blurb and online marketing.If route 1: Create an account on Query Tracker where you can make a list of potential agents who might be interested in your work. Then research them \u2014 find out what kind of books are on their list and decide if yours would fit in with their list. You can\u2019t know for sure, but you can hazard a guess \u2014 even a quick look at the type of book covers on their book list can tell you if your book is similar in genre or tone. (i.e. if they have a lot of floral, regency looking covers and you write dark, psychological suspense, it\u2019s likely they are not going to be pitching for your work). Also, use your own bookshelf as a resource \u2014 which authors do you like the most and/or have some common ground with your own manuscript? Look in the acknowledgements pages for names of agents and other contacts.Go further by looking up your favourite potential agents online and see what they\u2019ve been saying about their authors, their tastes, even any personal interests they might talk about in their online life. Does anything resonate with your own interests or with any of the themes in your book? If so, add them to your shortlist.Create a killer submissions package with a query letter that will get them hooked on the potential of your product, a synopsis that has them wetting themselves with excitement while presenting yourself as someone who is a viable longterm colleague to work with.Go along to writing festivals and events and get networking. Get in front of agents and publishing professionals and get your face known. Even if they are not personally interested in your project, they might know someone who could be.Join Twitter for networking and publishing opportunities. This is where the industry pros hang out, so be a pro and don\u2019t treat it like Facebook. On Facebook, join groups that will help you get somewhere with your writing, not shoot you down.If route 2: Learn the aforementioned skills in book formatting and marketing.Hire a good editor for a developmental edit to help you identify any weak areas in character or plot development, or help with pacing and shaping issues, etc., and also with line edits. Then hire a proofreader to give it a final go-over (possibly the same person, but not necessarily. Probably better if it is someone new to the work, TBH.)Get yourself an author website where you can showcase your work or at least a Facebook author page. (Yes, Amazon is the biggest market for ebooks, so it\u2019s up to you whether you want to place your future entirely in their hands or not, but you can just create a page with them and then publish everything through their platform.)Get blogging \u2014 not just on your own website but on other people\u2019s too. This is where you can place links to your online sales outlets and to your work.Write short stories and get them published in magazines and literary journals. Again, this is where you have an opportunity to provide links to your work. If people like your short pieces, they will likely want to read more of your material.Start on your next novel and get that published \u2014 it\u2019s a well-known fact that self-published series sell better than lone novels and that the first book usually seeds the market and tends to be offered for free (but that\u2019s one strategy you\u2019ll have to learn about with marketing). If you don\u2019t have another project in the pipeline, now\u2019s the time to think about if your current novel can be split into two or three parts and drip-fed to your readership.And in both cases, be patient. Sometimes, things happen quickly for some authors but mostly it takes a lot of time. Enjoy the journey because in this game no one actually knows where the destination is! :D ",

            "answer_text": "Are you looking for a traditional publishing contract? If so, you need to look for reputable agents in your area, know how to write a query and/or submission letter and spend a lot of time waiting for any response. Oh, and make sure your book is completely finished, and professionally edited. If you are wanting to self-publish, then the situation is slightly different. Open a KDP account on Amazon.Get your work edited (really important).Source a cover for your work.Write a blurb for it.Upload the finished work to Amazon - you are now published.If you want to make sales from your written work, then you need to market it. Social media is your best friend when it comes to marketing as there are many groups, forums and pages devoted to potential readers in your genre. However, because it is social media, make sure you are a friend to people such as other authors as opposed to bombarding everyone with \u201cbuy my book\u201d messages. Good luck, and thank you for your A2A. ",
