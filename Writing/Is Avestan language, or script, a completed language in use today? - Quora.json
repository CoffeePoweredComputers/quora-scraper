            "answer_text": "Both Avestan languages (as there were two) are currently extinct; Old Avestan was spoken in the second millennium BCE, while Young Avestan was spoken in the first millennium BCE. The only reason we even know of them is through old Zoroastrian scriptures (hence \u2018Avestan\u2019; the scriptures were called \u2018Avesta\u2019). As such, they are not in use today. I\u2019m a bit confused at the phrase \u2018a completed language\u2019. Languages are changing continually; they are neither \u2018unfinished\u2019 nor \u2018complete\u2019. English, Russian, Chinese or Inuktitut from the 18th century were not less or more \u2018complete\u2019 that their current versions. ",
