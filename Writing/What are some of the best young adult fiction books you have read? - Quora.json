            "answer_text": "This is not the entire list of books I\u2019ve read, but here is some that I think really interested me when I first saw it, and demonstrates a great YA fiction book after reading it. The Darkest Minds Series Author: Alexandra Bracken The Series include: The Darkest Minds (#1), Never Fade (#2), and In The Afterlight (#3) It starts off with the protagonist named Ruby where she witnesses the death of many of her classmates by a disease called \u201cIAAN\u201d- Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration. This is was when she was 10 years old. The children affected by this disease (this includes her) gets sent to rehabilitation camps like \u201cThurmond\u201d where guards named the PSI Forces runs the camps. The children appearently develops special abilities and gets classified by different colors; orange for telepathic powers and red for the power to manipulate fire. Altogether there is orange, red, yellow, blue and green. Ruby is classified by orange, but that is a problem since the orange, yellow and red are treated differently from the blue and green negatively. Ruby maniplulates a doctor so that they classify her as a green instead. Skip through more events, a doctor named Cate sneaks a letter to Ruby that explains how her live can be saved. Ruby escapes Thurmond, and meets up with Cate and her partner Rob at a gas station. Ruby explores the place, until she stumbles across a little girl. She decides to follow her, which leads her to a black van that follows a group of people affected by IAAN. They are: Liam, the oldest and blue, Chubs, his friend and a green, and last but not least, the young girl from before named Suzume, a yellow. Pretty much they go on a journey to survive and escape the PSI forces, and the story really develops book by book. I didn\u2019t mention this, but Ruby was 16/17 year old when she escaped. The part where she was 10 and witnessed the death of her classmates was the prolouge. This is one of my personal favorites because the way the character bonds/their personalties is just crafted amazingly. That compliments the story development and the hardships everyone must grow through. Here, take a look at the first sentence of the series: \u201cGRACE SOMERFIELD WAS THE FIRST TO DIE\u201d. Doesn\u2019t that slightly interests you? The Fifth Wave Series Author: Rick Yancey Series Include: The Fith Wave (#1), The Infinite Sea (#2), and The Last Star (#3) I don\u2019t have the time writing a summary of the series, so I will just take one off the internet. \u201cThe 5th Wave, written by Rick Yancy, is a dystopic novel that takes the genre to a new level. In the novel, aliens invade the earth, bringing death and destruction in five well defined waves. During the first wave, an EMP destroys all electronics on earth. In the second wave, a massive bar is dropped from space that causes total destruction on every coastline in the world. The third wave occurs when a modified Ebola virus wipes out more than seven billion people. Then, in the fourth wave it is discovered that some humans are hosts to the alien forms. The fifth wave is just beginning as teenagers Cassie and Ben make their way separately through a world they no longer understand. Cassie is alone. She thinks she might be the last human left on Earth. Cassie is a survivor of an alien invasion that has come in four waves. Cassie's mother died from the Ebola virus in the second wave. During the fourth wave, her father was killed by soldiers. Ironically, before the soldiers gunned down her father, she had believed that they would save her family. Cassie now lives alone in the woods. She has a promise she must keep. Cassie promised her little brother Sammy that she would come for him at the military base where the soldiers took him after their father's death. However, as Cassie makes her way to the military base, she is shot in the leg by an alien hosts she refers to as Silencers. Cassie becomes sick as the snows begin to fall and nearly dies. Cassie is rescued by a young farm boy, Evan. However, Cassie soon comes to suspect Evan is a Silencer, perhaps even the Silencer who shot her. Ben Parish is living in a refugee camp when he becomes ill with the Ebola virus. Just as Ben believes he is going to die, the camp is raided by soldiers. Ben is taken to a military camp where he is given medications that cure him of the illness. However, Ben is so depressed that he failed to save his sister\u2019s life that he is slow to recover. Vosch, the camp's commander, comes to see Ben and gives him a reason to continue the fight. Ben joins a squad and trains to be a soldier. He wants to go out and kill the aliens who destroyed his family. As he trains, Ben meets a five year old boy who is scared of everything. The little boy is convinced that his sister is coming to save him. As Ben\u2019s training ends and he is sent on his first mission, Cassie and Evan set out to save Sammy from the military base. One of Ben\u2019s soldiers, a girl called Ringer, convinces him that the soldiers at the base, including Vosch, have been lying to them. When Ben and Ringer discover a sniper who was shooting at them is really their drill sergeant, Ben believes her. Ben tries to convince the other soldiers and only succeeds when one of them accidentally kills himself with a drill sergeant's device. However, Ben refuses to leave Sammy behind at the base and insists on going back. Cassie sneaks onto the base and manages to make her way to a bunker where Sammy is being held. As she attempts to escape with him, they run into Ben. Ben agrees to join them even though he is weary of trusting anyone. On their way to safety, they run into Vosch. Vosch threatens to kill Sammy, but Evan has gotten onto the base and sabotage Vosch\u2019s systems. Evan helps Cassie, Ben, and Sammy escape, but stays behind to destroy the base. With the help of Ben\u2019s squad, Cassie, Ben, and Sammy survive\u201d (Bookrags). This is seriously one of the best/famous YA novels to be created. Every character is so unique, the plot, though somewhat overused (a disease that affects the human race, and a group of people must survive from it), that is overlooked by the book itself. What\u2019s even better than that? The common YA love triange isn\u2019t as prominent/horrible as other YA love triangles! Really, every YA book romance is sloppy and poorly written, at least for the ones I\u2019ve read, but Rick does a fantastic job at focusing on the story more than the romance. Though, there is still romance, it isn\u2019t cringey and actually enjoyable to read. Guess what, that isn\u2019t even the best part. The way the story is narratived is distinct from any other book I\u2019ve personally read. It isn\u2019t just the protagonist being (assuming it is first person perspective) all depressed at every situation and not having a personality, but there is comedy thrown in the narrative. So, while (spoilers for the middle-end of the first book. Actually, it isn\u2019t really a spolier at all, but heads up) a person is getting tortured and injected with steroid-like properties to act like \u201cThe Others\u201d, there is always comedy thrown at some part of the story, and while that seems like it would ruin the mood and scene of the event, it really doesn\u2019t. Heres a good \u2018ol quote from my favorite character, Ringer: \u201cI didn't just foster the delusions. I lived them. Even after the world crashed, I clung to them. But after he died, I told myself no more. No more brave fronts or false hopes or pretending everything's okay when nothing is. I thought I was being tough by pretending, calling it being optimistic, brave, keeping my head up or whatever bullshit seemed to fit the moment. That's not tough. That's the very definition of soft.\u201d The Razorland Trilogy Author: Ann Aguirre Trilogy includes: Enclave (#1), Outpost (#2), Horde (#3), and combing soon to be published in 2017, Vanguard (#4) There is also sub-books in the trilogy, but I won\u2019t include them. It is actually interestnig to read and helps clarify some parts in the plot. I guess the trilogy will become a series instead, but for now, I will leave it be. Very brief summary, but named Girl 15, Deuce lives underground known as the Enclave after a war and plauge from New York. By age 15, she is classified as a huntress and is paired with a hunter named Fade. They set off into the dangers of the daylight due to benig banished from the Enclave, and must survive from the unfamiliar lands of the world, and these monsters called Freaks. This is my least favorite trilogy/series from the other YA series I\u2019ve listed (only by a hair), but the sole reason why I chose this, is because this is how I got into YA novels. Actually, there is some really great things about this trilogy. Starting with the sub-books, they are really, and I mean really, fascinating to read. I can\u2019t point out why exactly, but it just is. It is also beneficial to read because stated before, it helps clarifies some events and background of the stories. Characters are alike, yet unique in their own ways, partially due to the fact that they all live in the same apocalyptic world in the same atmosphere with very similar companions, but I don\u2019t mind it. It fits into this dark world where everyone struggles to live another day. Here\u2019s another thing: I love apocalyptic, dystopian YA novels. Particularly, this trilogy combines all of those genres into one. Sadly, there is that YA love triangle, except that it is quite easy to see who will choose who as their loving companion. How sweet. I will include honorable mentions. Some YA novels include: A Court of Thorns and Roses Series The reason I didn\u2019t include this is because I am still in the process of reading the first book. It is actually another great YA novel, probably one of the best, but I can\u2019t give final thoughts yets. The Naturals Series I haven\u2019t read Bad Blood, the fourth installment of the series, so I will just talk about the other books. The story is captivating and different than some YA novels. It includes mystery and crime, so that\u2019s cool. The problem is, each book is kind of a drag to read. What I mean by that? They all are written all so similar, I feel like i\u2019m just reading three different mystery cases. It doesn\u2019t sound too bad, but what I am getting here is three books with a slightly underdeveloped plot. Nothing is being developed! Maybe it is because I haven\u2019t read the foruth one yet, but it is what it is. I sound harsh, so I will say that overall, each mystery/crime scene is written so very well. Also, the characters are so unique with unique backgrounds, the series isn\u2019t bad at all. In fact, this HM is the best one out of the others, and i\u2019m very excited to read Bad Blood. Who knows, I may update this post and take this out from the honorable mention. Angelfall Series Once again, this is one of those books that I feel like I am being too harsh and that the story is made extremely well, but here it goes. Great plot. Decent character/ character development. Amazing narrative. Sounds great? It really is. Except, there is this one thing about the book that just fails to really \u201cwow\u201d me. That is, the undeniably painful romance. It was kind of hard to read the book at some points because of the romance. It is so sloppy, so \u201cunrealistic\u201d, it just ruins the story. Especially at the end, where (spoilers ahead) after that great war and the protagonist with her love partner wins, they start\u2026 making out. It was actually the last sentence that just killed the moment. Reading that specific part (to contain the spolier) was actually the best part of the series! It\u2019s unforunate, I felt like this series had some spark, some potential. Notice how I didn\u2019t include books from Harry Potter and The Hunger Games, even books from John Green? Well, I haven\u2019t read any of those books. I know, it is sad, and I will probably get attacked by loyal fans that praise those books. I will read them some day, but not today. Or anytime soon. ",

            "answer_text": "After reading through all of the answers already given, and seeing many of my favorite books mentioned, I'd like to add another that has not been said but I think deserves to be. The Red Rising trilogy by Pierce Brown. I've heard it described several ways, including \u201cGame of Thrones in space\u201d or \u201cDivergent and Hunger Games meets Enders Game\u201d but while it shares ideas with these, it really is it's own beast. It begins on Mars, deep beneath the surface, far into our future. Society has fractured into factions based on color, with the mighty Golds ruling over all the others. Darrow, a lowly Red, toils daily in the dangerous mines harvesting the Helium3 needed to terraform the surface of the planet. Then one day his world is shattered, and he comes to find that his entire life has been a lie. In order to free his people, he must become the very thing he hates most. He must become a Gold, and break the chains of the Society. What I love about this series: The plot is complex, as are each of the characters and the world in which they live. Brown has done a superb job of creating a futuristic dystopian world where the color you are born with defines you \u2014 literally. Each color and their place within society is clearly set up throughout the series. Darrow, the main character, is fantastic. He is sarcastic and witty, and even early on it is clear he has a good heart. But he also makes mistakes, he is not perfect by any means, and without his friends he likely would've died about 1000 times over the course of the trilogy. And he learns from those mistakes, he grows, and he rejects the labels that society places on him. Nearly all of the characters in the series are just as developed as Darrow, but we see the world through his eyes. It is because of him we learn to love the others. Its a series that has lots of depth, and is great for teens and adults. As a 24 year old who loves to read YA literature, this series stands out to me among the rest. It was unpredictable, it was genuine, and it was thrilling. And that is why I recommend it to anyone, young or old, who enjoys fantasy/sci-fi novels. ",
