            "answer_text": "There are lots of great resources out there for new writers who are looking to publish. One of my favorites and oft-visited is Poets & Writers Magazine. Their classifieds list not only journals and magazines that are accepting submissions, but also contests, retreats, and manuscript calls for Chapbooks and full-length books. I would also recommend getting involved with one of the many online writing communities. Some of my favorites are Writer\u2019s Relief, The Write Life, and the Write Practice. Each of them publishes regular articles about writing of all sorts and are followed by amateurs to professionals. The Write Practice has an especially active following. Specifically, I would recommend that you read!!!!! publish!!!!! and submit!!!!! Read!! - because you have to know what a particular periodical publishes. You wouldn\u2019t send free-verse with adult themes to Highlights magazine. It\u2019ll get tossed before it\u2019s been read. To make sure that your work aligns with the overall tone of the publication, you have to be familiar with it. Publish!!!!! - because you can\u2019t guarantee that your work will be picked up. So take some of the pieces of your choosing and toss them up on your blog or share them with friends on Facebook or platforms. Not only does this get your work out there, but it provides an avenue for feedback. Friends and family can be some of your biggest advocates and cheerleaders, as well as some of your most compassionate critics. They are on your side, they want you to succeed, so they\u2019re unlikely to lie to you about what works for them and what doesn\u2019t. Submit!!!!!! - because you are good enough. If you\u2019ve finished more than zero poems, you\u2019re good enough. If you\u2019ve written a whole short story, you\u2019re good enough. If you\u2019ve finished a full-length novel or screenplay or theatrical play, you\u2019re good enough! Never think that your work isn\u2019t worthy of publication. That said, don\u2019t submit your first draft either. Put it through the ringer. Get beta readers and let them give you feedback. Your first draft is never your best, so revise, rewrite, and edit. (Plus, that\u2019s the best part! More time to play with language, rhythm, and rhyme - if that\u2019s your style.) Best of luck!! ",

If your poem is right up there, don\u2019t waste time, send the same to the publishing Editors on line. It they feel the same about it, as your thought. You\u2019ll see it getting published mostly with the supplementary editions on Mondays\u2019 or Saturday, Sundays\u2019. And don\u2019t make it a one time affair, keep writing, with every page, you become someone novel till such time as you\u2019re known to the world by your full name. Wishes. ",

Their additional content is in the form of editorials, letters from readers, cartoons, etc\u2026 However, many papers will occasionally publish poetry or even short stories. These items often appear seasonally. A paper may, for instance, publish poems by famous authors to celebrate holidays such as Christmas. In some cases, readers may be invited to make submissions. Additionally, many papers will occasionally feature work submitted by readers. One example is the \u201cKids \u201cCorner\u201d offered by many newspapers. Find out whether your local newspaper welcomes such submissions. If so, contact the newspaper and/or the editor concerning your interest. In the event that they aren\u2019t interested, don\u2019t worry. Check out other local publications, entertainment magazines, etc\u2026 that showcase local writers with less emphasis on pure news. ",
