            "answer_text": "What is a bad attitude? Is it your perception or does this person disrespect others? If they do then you need them to consider their values and what in their upbringing caused this. It could be a performance based identity that their parents enforced to get their child to work hard. They wanted their child to be successful but lost sight of the bigger picture. Something in the parents upbringing lead to this. The problem could be many things of course. I just mentioned one. You are not qualified to take someone through this process yourself. I would start by sending them on a Dale Carnegie course and see what happens over the next few months. Then I suggest an Ancient Paths course. That teaches you what 'normal' is and how to get there. We go through life believing that everything we were told as kids was normal. It seldom is. We need to get unstuck so the real ME can come out. ",

            "answer_text": "I once was a successful employee with a bad attitude. I think the best way my boss could have handled me at the time was to talk to me alone personally. Without the neer for scolding, she could have discussed objectively how my attitude was affecting some parts of my job and the people around me. And maybe with a little show of sincerity on her part that she truly wants to see me improve. You see, the thing is maybe they were not aware of the problem. Because for them, meeting the targets was enough. Disclaimer: I wasn\u2019t that toxic as an employee. It\u2019s just that in hindsight, I realized my attitude was not that good and I could have managed things differently. I would have appreciated it if my superior have informed me of the the issues.
