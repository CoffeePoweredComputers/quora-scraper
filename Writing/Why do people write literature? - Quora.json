            "answer_text": "First, here is the definition of literature: \u201cwritings in which expression and form, in connection with ideas of permanent and universal interest, are characteristic or essential features, as poetry, novels, history, biography, and essays\u201d (from dictionary.com). So \u201cliterature\u201d is any body of writing. In order to answer your question, it would be helpful to know if you were inquiring about literature as a whole or some subset, such as a poem or novel. I would say there are as many reasons to write as there are writers. Those who write essays, I imagine, want to give their opinions on different subjects that matter to them. Those who write biographies want to demonize, lionize, or maybe just humanize, people who interest them. Some who write history want to get to the truth of what happened in different world situations, while others want to impose their ideas on why something happened. Those who write poetry want to express their observations about the world, especially their experiences in the world as they see them. Poetry, more than most other forms, also includes emotional reactions, and writers can use their experiences to connect with others with similar experiences. Novel writers imagine stories that interest them and write their stories in order to entertain others. And then there are the more pragmatic reasons for writing. Some people want to be famous, touring the country and doing the talk show circuits. Others want to get rich. Some just want to make a living. And then some people write to entertain themselves, because it\u2019s their passion. I write novels. So far I\u2019ve written one children\u2019s book and one Regency romance. The children\u2019s book is about some of the pets I\u2019ve known and loved over the years. I wrote it for my grandchildren. I wrote the Regency romance after reading a lot of really bad romance novels, and one day I said, \u201cI can write a book better than that.\u201d And that\u2019s what I did. And I also write answers to questions on Quora if I feel I have the knowledge to make a reasoned explanation for someone\u2019s honest question. In this instance, I hope I have helped answer *your* question. ",

            "answer_text": "Asking that question is similar to asking why people think - they just do. Humans are innate story-tellers, and they have been for thousands of years. Before the act of physically recording information was invented, humans told stories orally through memorable songs and poems. I think it comes down to psychology more than anything else; and there are different reasons for different people. Some people have so many ideas floating around their heads that converting those ideas into a manuscript is a form of release, and is very therapeutic. Some people write out their desires and fantasises, so in some way they can live out, through their characters, what they want in reality. And some people, usually the best writers, are a combination of the former two, as well as writing literature to spread social and political messages - to impart something to the reader. Literature is more powerful than people realise, I think. It\u2019s a celebration, an exploration, of human psychology and the strength and durability of us as a species. Literature, in many ways, governs people. ",
