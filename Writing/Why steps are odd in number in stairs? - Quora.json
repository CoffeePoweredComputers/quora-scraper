So if the top of the stair was an even number they would be on their left foot. But their brain is used to telling the right foot to go first. So an odd staircase puts them back on the right foot.... First step is PROFIT Second step is LOSS  3rd step is PROFIT 4th step is LOSS  5th step is PROFIT 6th step is LOSS   7th step is PROFIT 8th step is LOSS 9th step is PROFIT 10th step is LOSS  11th step is PROFIT 12th step is LOSS  and so on .......... at the last  13th step (odd number )is PROFIT  so that the profit will enter to our home .loss will stay in the steps itself ....

            "answer_text": "Do note that the number of steps when designed are usually due to function, height and space available. It may be circumstance that you counted many stairs ending on odd numbers. But why is it usually odd numbers?. Or why is 13 steps considered Bad Luck? Here is one reason. This is due to superstitious beliefs. In Chinese Feng Shui, Stairs having Odd Numbers is considered Good Luck, \u201cEven\u201d numbers could mean disaster and bad luck. Just to share, We also have a Belief that says each step count corresponds to Gold, Silver and Death starting from the first step is Gold and the final step should also end on Gold or Silver cause the step ending on Death would mean uhm. Death. ",
