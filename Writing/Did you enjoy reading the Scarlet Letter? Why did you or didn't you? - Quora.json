            "answer_text": "I enjoyed it, but not the first time I read it. My first contact with The Scarlet Letter was in junior high school. I would have been about 13 or 14 years old. I was unable to understand it, mainly because of the language and grammatical structures Hawthorne used. Since then, I\u2019ve read it twice more, and enjoyed it immensely. I had acquired a lot more reading experience, and being older helped me better understand the issues Hawthorne was writing about. The Scarlet Letter described the struggles of an individual against a repressive religious society, and the types of damage such a strict regulation of human nature can cause. I enjoyed the description of what life must have been like in such a society, and was glad I had the freedom to question the religious doctrines that were handed down to me, rather than be forced to confess a belief that I dared not investigate.
