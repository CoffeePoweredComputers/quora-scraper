Even as I write, I am aware I am making a mistake; but carry on , so that the flow is uninterrupted. In my first revision, I catch most of those, but still some remain.In my final submission, the usual mistakes are:Hard-to-spot punctuation errors like double spacing after a period etc.Stylistic issues particularly to do with the specific (sometimes unwritten) style guidelines of the publisher.\u2018Mistakes\u2019 that I don't accept as mistakes, but are settled only after a long debate with my editor.Anachronisms that creep into the manuscript.",

            "answer_text": "I think yes they also make mistakes which are grammatically incorrect. But over a period of time writers tend to improve a lot and they would be in a position to consciously avoid common mistakes they commits usually while writing. Generally after finishing your work sometimes proof readers goes through the written matter diligently and spot the mistakes and corrects it before publishing. But proficient or well known writers are known for thier skills in writing , creating wonderful stories or thought provoking ideas which makes them well known. But mistakes happen which gets corrected after repeated reading by proof readers or by one self. ",

Sometimes we read what we've written and do dog-head-tilt, and think \"wow, whatever I was on, it must have been good stuff.\" As both Donna and Al said, that's why we're writers, and writers are not editors and proofreaders, because while I try to check myself as I go, I'm almost guaranteed to make mistakes here and there. If I don't catch them -- despite my best efforts -- someone else will. ",
