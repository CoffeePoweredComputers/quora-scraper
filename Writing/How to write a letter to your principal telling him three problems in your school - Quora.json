            "answer_text": "To The Headmaster, Greenhouse School Mao, Manipur. Subject: A constructive observation of the inefficiency of the school and remedial measures. Dear Sir, With due respect, the undersigned would like to put forth some of my observations and opinions to your esteemed office under your kind consideration. TransportationUniformsFeesTeacherAs a student who has spent almost a decade in this school, I am indebted to the college for what I've become and owns a big share of responsibility especially in moments like this when the administration and whole functioning of the school are quickly degrading. Firstly addressing the issue of transportation, our school is at least 4Km away from the students' residences. In this era we can expect no parents making their children walk such distance on foot. And there are no proper means that could be availed for their daily schooling. To this I suggest the administration under your leadership, work towards extending the hostels and building new hostels, making it a totally residential one. If not purchase a bus for the school. The bust can be plied with monthly fees and the investment of 15 lakhs can hopefully be recovered in 10 years making it a win-win investment for both the school and the students. In this way the number of students decreased in the last few years can be retained. (And go on addressing the other issues respectfully, with genuine concern. What is needed in this type of letter is not criticism. Anybody can criticize but takes lots of Education and years of experience to give a useful tip. Don't address the problems as a stranger, who are you to interfere? Such a question can divert real intention. Be someone willing to share the failure and even more responsible in claiming a share towards a solution. Writing with such a clear perspective will avoid any kind of misunderstanding and this can be settled for good). Looking forward to working together in any capacities for the welfare of the school. Thank you for considering my opinions, in anticipation. Sincerely Yours, Name\u2014\u2014\u2014 School Captain Cl-Xl Science (A) ",

            "answer_text": "There are some different ways you could go about this - sharing problems could be difficult, as your principal could take it personally. This could then reflect on your status as a student or teacher, depending on your role at the school. If it is not a problem that is only about you, but applies to many students/employees, I would recommend the S.E.A. route. This stands for: Sandwich: Try to state good things before and after listing the problems. People like to hear what\u2019s going well, and easily get bogged down by too much criticism. Expository: State and describe the problems using I-language while avoiding sounding accusatory. Anonymous: To avoid getting negative personal feedback, sign the letter without your name. Here is a sample letter: Dear Mr./Mrs/Dr. Chris, My time as a student/teacher of Jethro High School has been full of memorable experiences, and I would like to let you know that I appreciate the things you have done for the school. One of my personal favorites is the complementary pet cockroaches that live in the lockers and cafeterias. Mine is named Jeff, and he has been particularly entertaining in his attempts to ask out Suzy, the cockroach two lockers down, about going to the trash bins with him after prom this year. (Sandwich - beginning with a positive memory.) Unfortunately, I have also noticed some things at school lately that concern me, and I was hoping you could help. This may not be true for all students, but the mice in the locker in the next hall have been bullying the cockroaches in the North Hall, even threatening them with violence. Many other students in my grade are facing similar issues. I know this is not the standard for behavior here at J.H.S., and you have experience in helping with these sorts of challenges. (Expository - listing issue without accusing the principal directly, and even suggesting ideas for change. You can continue to list your other problems similarly, each in their own paragraph.) I am truly grateful for the school\u2019s emphasis on education and coexisting with various species, as well as your dedication and service. Thank you for being a leader of action and considering these suggestions. (Sandwich - finishing off with saying more nice things.) Signed, A Concerned Student/Teacher (Anonymous - by not saying who is writing, you can avoid the principal taking anything up with you personally, if that could be uncomfortable.) On a more serious note, consult the police with serious problems such as drugs, improper student-teacher conduct, or threats of violence regarding fighting or life-threatening situations. If it is not urgent, call the non-emergency number for your local station. Hope this helps! ",
