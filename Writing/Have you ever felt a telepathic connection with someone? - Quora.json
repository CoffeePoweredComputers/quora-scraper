            "answer_text": "Yes, actually I have!! I have with my husband. He will tell you so too. I have an ability to read minds. I think I have to be in a very casual and open or receptive mentality first although sometimes maybe when I am anxious I can pick up stuff too because I heard him calling me once when we were apart and I was scared for him. But the one I 100% know was real happened while I was meditating and had been using my crystals a lot and taking ormus. I was just sitting there on our bed and he was doing his stuff when I heard him say as plainly as if he was talking to me out loud, \u201cMy Precious\u201d and yes this is real. I teasingly asked him why he randomly said that out of the blue!! It's not totally unheard of for him because he is Just That Way!! He sometimes says or does odd stuff randomly so I questioned him and he had an odd look on his face and was like, \u201choney I didn't say anything.\u201d Then I was like, you said, \u201cMy precious!\u201d He said he didn't say it but he had been thinking it. At first, I thought he was joking or messing with me which he does too sometimes but he was dead serious and he felt kinda odd that I had known what he was saying. I felt odd too so he wasn't alone. I was like, \u201cSo, I heard your thoughts?\u201d and he was like, \u201cyes you heard my thoughts!\u201d To this day, I can't believe it, but now I know, I know it's possible. And one good thing when you know you can do something, it means you can do it again. I also at one point, had a photographic memory and I could see clearly in my mind's eye. So, I can hear people's thoughts in a deep meditative state and I can see pictures in my head. It's kinda amazing how much we can do as people and how much more is possible. Never forget, if you could do it once, you can do it again! That's a Law. \ud83d\ude0f ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever felt a telepathic connection with someone? Yes. The first was with my mother. She was abusive, but there was some kind of bond in place, since one day as I lay dying from severe food poisoning, she suddenly got into her car and drove 50 miles and saved my life. The sociopath she\u2019d married me off to was ignoring me and our baby and without her intervention, I would have died of dehydration by evening and the baby would have followed me not long after. Then a few years later, divorced, I met the love of my life. And found that if I needed to speak to him urgently, all I had to do was to reach out with my mind and tap him on the left shoulder. My phone would ring within a minute. It drove him nuts, since he didn\u2019t believe in the paranormal at all and didn\u2019t want to either. I seem to have inherited the ability (which has been gone for many years now) from my mother, who shocked our whole town as a teen, when she became upset at a party and told her hosts that her Dad had had a bad car accident and was lying in a snowdrift dying. The police were sent after him and saved his life. ",

My most recent experience was last night, I had the sense of the thought of \u201cdrink water\u201d then I thought of her. So that was my girlfriend telling me to drink water. That process was confirmed this morning. I have also felt other peoples desires, heard their thoughts processing before they spoke them, spoke their own words before I even had time to hear or feel them and before they spoke them. I have smelled them even. Telepathy is a random occurence with me and it comes and goes but there is no consistent or singular way I reicieve it yet. ",

And rather than believe you science would also Deem you as crazy. It's easier to call you crazy than to try to prove the fact. ",
