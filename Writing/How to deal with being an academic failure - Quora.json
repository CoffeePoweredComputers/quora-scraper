            "answer_text": "Every night I felt like not seeing the morning ; I woke up to an early dawn.Each time I feared the transition of dusk into night ; I was soothed by the moonlight. Do you understand? There is always a way!  There will be times when you will find giving up as the only viable option but do you know what's the flaw in this?  If you are not finding any option to retrieve yourself then you are probably looking in the wrong direction.  You have written that you have failed all your life even though you worked hard towards your goals. Ask yourself these questions-Did you set those goals for yourself without anyone's influence? I know you worked hard. But did you put your heart and soul into your work? Even if you put your heart and soul into your work, were your efforts planned and channelized?2. You have mentioned that you didn't go to a grad school you aimed for. That's okay ! More than half of the population doesn't go to their desired institutions. And all of them are of course not tagged as academic failures. You know what makes a person a failure? When he cribs about his present situation and talks big of his abilities. The person should rather get accustomed to his present and work accordingly. Not everyone is a lucky hard-worker. So, better shape your luck intelligently.3. A ton of unfavorable events occurred in grad school with you. It's good that you saw these unfavorable situations during graduation. At least now you know that nothing worse than this can ever occur and even if it occurs, you will manage to stay strong.Failures are just lesson serving experiences in disguise.So, just come out of your gloomy room of academic failures and find some real and warm sunshine for yourself.4. Right now you are in probation. Okay, now that you are in a problem stop cursing yourself for that. Rather start working towards the solutions. Solutions are always there.Start now, work hard, work passionately and prove your worth.After you succeed nobody counts your number of failures. All that matters is success. After you get your degree nobody is gonna question you about your probation.5. You have faced all kinds of problems and stayed stong. Then, my dear friend, stay strong for one more time. You are aware that this is the last straw. So, better stay strong and rectify your mistakes. You just can't let go something you are passionate about.You might seek help from your close ones. They can comfort and encourage you.6. You have written that you are passionate about your work. Just remember one thing, there is nothing that can kill your passion. So, just keep working towards it.Perseverance always pays off. So, my dear friend, don't ask yourself the question ''why me?'' rather ask yourself what you can do to improve your present situation. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "I cannot write a complete answer, but one small bit of advice is to recast the statement about failure in a way that is more balanced about your accomplishments. Ask some friends you trust to help you look at the question without being judgmental. The key words in your question (statement) that needs to be evaluated for accuracy is \"failure\" and \"academic\" as a qualifier for failure. Just drop the word failure.Think of it as a cross country trip. You might not be there on time, and you might be detoured once or even twice, but you will get where you are going. Some students get through undergraduate work in 4 years, and other take 5 years. I had a friend who took 7 years. Others sail through in 4 and never get to grad school. Others go to work and then go back to grad school. Be flexible about your plan vs. the outcome. Accept that finishing something like an education later than planned is a very common occurrence and it is NOT a failure. Even probation is not the end. ask those who know what the solutions are. The university actually wants you to graduate.You have experienced more than many people ever will. Count yourself fortunate. I have seen students that were sure they were not going to graduate who actually did just fine. It is the strain of your recent efforts that is weighing you down and you need to get out from under that strain. You might need to stay and finish this year, but if you do not graduate, then perhaps take a short break that is longer than one summer, and break out of your long academic routine. I have seen students who failed to be accepted into grad school one year and then were accepted the next year. Yes, starting one year late is not the same as finishing one year late. But people do things like this all the time. Be flexible. Be resilient. Ask your professors and counselors something like this: \"What will it take for me to pull this off?\" Accept the fact that success may simply be one or two more semesters away. Ask for their help. Ask for tutoring from them, or anyone who can give it. You are not a failure. ",
