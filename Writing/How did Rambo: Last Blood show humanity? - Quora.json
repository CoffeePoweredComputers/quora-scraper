            "answer_text": "When John Rambo went out of his way to rescue a girl who wasn't even his daughter or relative, but still loved her as if she was. Standing up to her shithead of a dad, taking a beating from her captors yet still getting back up to try and rescue her when he recovered. When rescued, he tried everything to save her but failed, feeling like he lost everything. He then avenged her death by delivering some draconian justice to her abductors. To me, it got that feeling a parent would get when their child is taken from them. It accurately showed that bloodlust feeling one would have after experiencing or even just learning of something so evil and vile, that you feel as if brutal revenge is the only answer. That's the humanity of Rambo V. ",
