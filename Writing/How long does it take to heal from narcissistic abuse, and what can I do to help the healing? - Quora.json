            "answer_text": "Everyone is different, and every relationship varies- including the abuse. You also need to factor in if you had any history of abuse in your past, whether romantically or childhood. Personally, it\u2019s been 4 months since the breakup and I feel like I\u2019m still healing. You will get stronger each and every day, as long as you remain no-contact and work towards your healing. It brought up a lot of realizations for me, which was I had a pattern of being involved with abusive men and that I was raised by a narcissist father and a co-dependent mother who suffered a lot of abuse from him physically/emotionally/psychologically. Once you\u2019ve recognized your patterns and behaviors, do the research to educate yourself on NPD so you can learn how to protect yourself. Healing from narcissistic abuse is WAY different than healing from a normal breakup. A lot of well-meaning friends will give mundane advice such as \u201ctime will heal all wounds\u201d. Actually, the 1st therapist I saw also said this and it just infuriated me more. I knew there had to be something I could do to heal. That\u2019s when I came across this community, and reading about other survivors\u2019 experiences made me feel like I wasn\u2019t alone in the way I felt. That I wasn\u2019t \u201ccrazy\u201d. That it wasn\u2019t my fault. Therapy is a great resource, and after the 1st one I was committed to finding someone who specializes in personality disorders, narcissistic abuse, and childhood abuse. This will be an enlightening journey for you, and an opportunity for you to grow and heal. Lean on your friends and family for love and support. Go out and have fun. Learn to love yourself again through self-care and self-compassion. Learn to respect yourself, and never let others cross those boundaries. The boundaries are there to protect yourself. Start writing in your journal again. Meditate, and tune in with how you feel everyday. Give gratitude with what you have. Once you start to feel like yourself again, dive into old or new hobbies/interests. Immerse yourself into projects and get your creative juices flowing again. Over time you will have so much love for yourself, that you will wonder why did you let someone take that power away from you and because that pain was so real you will never forget it. You will not regret that decision to walk away. Trust the process, but you will have to put the work in. It will be difficult, but it will be victorious. ",

            "answer_text": "Healing from narcissistic abuse is a journey. It\u2019s a process. There is no way to sugar coat this. Healing from a narcissist is a long and difficult road. At some point or another, we all wish we could snap our fingers and just forget that it ever happened. But you and I both know it\u2019s not that easy. Here are three key actions you can take to help your recovery. Go No Contact To start you\u2019re healing, it\u2019s critical that you go no contact. If you cannot go no contact for practical reasons (you have a kid together, you have a business together etc.), you must severely limit contact, but understand it will take longer. Once you go no contact, especially if you\u2019ve gone no contact before and failed, this may be your biggest challenge. I really struggled to go \u2014 and stay \u2014 no contact with my narcissistic ex. It was definitely my biggest struggle. I had attempted no contact with my ex several times, and each time I \u2014 not him! \u2014 came back. The last time I instituted no contact, I found a way to do it so that he would not respond to me should I ever reach out again. It\u2019s been almost a year, and I haven\u2019t heard from him. Shift Focus Up until this point in your relationship, much of it has been centered around his behavior. Why did he treat me this way? Why did he do this to me? If you\u2019re finally at the point when you want to heal, you likely already rationally know and understand that the narcissistic abuse you suffered has little to do with you and that you could not have changed his behavior. But it really is time to focus on you. Because even though you can\u2019t change his behavior, you can change yours. And you must! For every question you\u2019ve asked about him, it\u2019s time to turn it around on yourself: Why did he do this to me? > Why did I allow him to do this to me? Why did he treat me this way? > Why did I allow him to treat me this way? These are questions you must understand about yourself. And I don\u2019t recommend rushing or glossing over these answers. Work on You To begin to answer these questions, you must understand yourself, your behaviors and where they come from. You will need to work to address these deficiencies within yourself. I know deficiencies is a hard word, but you must understand that your behavior helped get you into this relationship and kept you in this relationship too. If you do not address your behavior, you will end up in another relationship just like this one! Do you want to just get involved in a better narcissistic relationship next time \u2026 or \u2026 do you want to avoid a narcissistic relationship next time? Doing the work on yourself will help insure you don\u2019t repeat the past and you can move toward finding a healthy, loving relationship. You can do this work on your own, but you\u2019ll definitely speed up the process if you can do the work with a qualified, experienced therapist. Read as much as you can, find support from others on places like Quora, and get back out in the real world with your family and friends. Here is the full list of steps I took to recover from my narcissist. As I mentioned at the beginning, healing is a process. Some days will be harder than others, but if you keep working at it, you will see progress! Best of luck! ",
