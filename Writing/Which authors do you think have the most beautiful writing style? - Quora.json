            "answer_text": "I love Douglas Adams, not because of the lyricism, but because he makes the language do \"things\" that you could never imagine a language can do. Otherwise, I tried to read some Cormac McCarthy, and while I stopped because it was too dense for my state of mind at the time, the lyricism is amazing.Kerouac and perhaps other Beat Generation guys write prose that is sometimes raw, but amazingly poetic. Some South American writers (specially Gabriel Garcia Marques or Jorge Luis Borges), besides being great storytellers, write things that are also linguistically beautiful. I assume that not all of it is lost in the translation, though I'll admit I've never read an English translation of either of them. I don't suppose you speak Portuguese, but if you do check out Miguel Torga. I don't know how good are his translations, but one of the things that he does is use a very extensive (and difficult) vocabulary, specially from regional dialects. A lot of this is unfortunately difficult to translate to English, but I'm sure it is worth to read a translation, if it's good. Portuguese literature is in general very poetic (including the prose), be it because of the characteristics of the language or the characteristics of the people. I don't know any of the authors you mentioned, so if this is not exactly what you were looking for, sorry... :) ",
