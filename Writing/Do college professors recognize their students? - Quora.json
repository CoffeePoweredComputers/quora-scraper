            "answer_text": "As usual, I have an off-beat answer. My university teaches mostly one-to-one, using the Socratic method. Even then, I mostly do not recognize my students. You could send your friend in your place. I wouldnt have a clue. And I wouldnt care. I dont care who you are. If you want to learn, you are welcome. When teaching professionals in larger groups, I dont have a chance of recognising anyone. At least, I am forgiven for not caring to remember names in large groups. I never ask for introductions. I promise - Im not listening. And I wont care when its all done and over. Just as I dont expect anyone to recognize me. You can be 100% sure I wont be the guy who boosts \"do you know who I am?\" :p I might be covering up a weakness with a philosophy - but I am proud NOT to recognize students. I do NOT learn their names (unless we spend a whole year on a PPE courae or something, where I spend a ton of time with someone and cant avoid it). Indeed, I walk around the quad/lobby with a faint smile, for fear of offending someone who I am supposed to recognize. Why? I would like to assess people by their skill\u2026not by whether they have a really cool haircut. Or hey, that guy looks nerdy, he must be smart. I know its considered a nicety to learn people's names. And people speak in glowing terms of the teacher who learned all 65 students' names! I have no love in my heart for them (I mean other than I have for anyone else). It always seemed like a stunt to me. You must understand - I give no one respect as a right. Respect is something you must earn from me. And to know the name of something/someone is to respect it. Both good and evil. When you pass into me knowing your name, you have passed into a kind of mental inner sanctum. You have a place in my mind. And in my memory. If you are burned in my memory, you will stay there. Along with the names of people I might cite in academic study. Along with friends and loved one who are no longer present. So when I do not recognize you - I want you know that, if you take the time and effort, you will join a select group. You are not just one in 10,000 to \"that guy who remembers everyone.\" Indeed, when Khan Noone Singh comments \"I never forget a face\" - it did not make me believe in his super-humanity more. It made me think of him as a circus performer. Like the guy that can remember a phonebook, for fun. What fun is it\u2026if the phone-book memorizing guy remembers your name? ",

            "answer_text": "Thinking of people who\u2019ve lectured me over the years, the answer is generally yes. The size of the class seems to be the major factor here. Someone who taught me in a smallish class will have dealt with me on more of a one-to-one level, and is more likely to have some sort of impression of me and what I\u2019m like as a person - rather than just being another face in the lecture theatre. The three academics who lectured me the most can definitely recognise me. In one case, it\u2019s not surprising since he\u2019s now my PhD supervisor. Another one I suspect could, although she\u2019s been overseas for several years and may not remember what I look like, although we\u2019re still in touch electronically. The third one was even able to identify me in a crowded town square in Europe last year, when we had arranged to meet, which was a bit of a surprise as I was convinced I\u2019d see him first. Having gone back to the university I did my undergrad at to do my PhD, I can safely say I\u2019ve walked past one or two people who lectured me for a semester and who didn\u2019t recognise me at all. In the middle group is one of my German lecturers who I saw at one point. I recognised him, and he had that look of \u201cYou\u2019re familiar from somewhere\u201d, but there was no sense of \u201cLong time no see\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I never taught large lecture hall classes - so with class sizes anywhere from ten to forty students depending on the course, I usually got to know a lot of my students, and usually at least knew all the names and faces in a class by the end of a term. It\u2019s not hard. The students I got to know best, of course, were those who came to office hours. And there were often some in a class who I didn\u2019t have much contact with and who I might mix up with each other. (I once had two surfer dudes in the same class who didn\u2019t even know each other who I thought were twins - I never got them straight!) If I saw one of my students by chance out on campus somewhere or downtown, would I immediately know their names? Not always, but sometimes. And sometimes I\u2019d see a former student on campus or somewhere and just greet them by name, but not remember whether they had been in a class or if I met them somewhere else. And I\u2019ve recently become friends with a former student who I didn\u2019t remember having in a class (thirty years ago) - but he could recount things that I had said in that class! And once, when traveling in the middle of Wyoming someplace, some old guy come up to me and called me by name. He said he had taken my solid state physics class in 1975. I hadn\u2019t remembered him.

Some classes talk and participate. Some don\u2019t. Classes like people take on personalities. Last semester I had a class in which I got to know most of the students quite well. This semester I have a large class that trying to get them to discuss anything is like dental surgery in terms of forced extraction. You associate individuals with details about them that make them unique. Like anything else some students I get to know quite well and some are a name on a grade sheet. ",

At the University of Oregon, the literature survey for English majors had about 300 or 330 students in it. There\u2019s no way the professor is going to recognize all the students. So, in those cases, no. Small classes are a different matter. The first few class periods, I usually haven\u2019t learned all the students\u2019 faces and names, but in 2\u20133 weeks or so, I will have them. ",
