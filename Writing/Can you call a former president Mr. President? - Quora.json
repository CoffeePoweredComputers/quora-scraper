            "answer_text": "In the United States, as there is but a single person holding the Office of the President at a time, referring to former Presidents as \u201cMr. President\u201d is incorrect. Strictly speaking, you would address such former officeholders different things, depending on the situation. If addressing a letter to them, or introducing them to another person, the person is \u201cThe Honorable <firstname> <lastname>\u201d. When using a 3rd person reference, this is the correct form. It may be shortened by replacing the <firstname> with a Mr./Mrs./Ms. I.e when sending a letter to Bill Clinton, it should have \u201cThe Honorable William J Clinton\u201d on the outside. When introducing your partner to him, it should be \u201cThis is the Honorable Mr. Clinton\u201d.If talking directly to them, they should be named \u201cMr/Mrs/Ms <lastname>\u201d. In addition, this should also be used when referring to the person in any form of media or conversation when the person is not present. I.e. Bill Clinton should be referred to as \u201cMr. Clinton\u201d in current day news reports.They should be referred to as \u201cPresident <lastname>\u201d when talking about them in the historical timeframe during which they were President. I.e. \u201cPresident Clinton failed to reach an agreement with Speaker Gingrich\u201dIn extremely formal situations, it\u2019s entirely proper to refer to the former president as: \u201cThe Honorable Mr. William J Clinton, former President of the United States of America.\u201dFace to face, if you happen to be a buddy of the former President, well, calling them whatever you two want. \u201cBubba\u201d, \u201cBill\u201d, \u201cOld Rotten Scoundrel\u201d or whatever tickles the two of you\u2019s fancy.Many former Presidents are addressed as \u201cPresident <lastname>\u201d, but this it not correct, as there is only a single President at once, and that form of address is confusing. It\u2019s an informal convention to do so, however, and unless the CURRENT President is also part of the conversation (or present), it\u2019s generally let slide. ",

            "answer_text": "As with all things related to politeness and etiquette, there is no universally agreed upon answer on how to address a former president. In formal settings, we address the current president as Mr. President or Madame President[1]. John Adams wanted the president to go by the title of \u201cHis Highness, the President of the United States, and Protector of the Rights of the Same,\u201d but a congressman pointed out the Constitution's prohibition on title's of nobility, and they decided on the more reserved \"Mr. President.\"[2] There does not appear to be a solid consensus on what we should call former presidents. Some claim that the Constitution's prohibition against titles of nobility means we should not use \"Mr. President\" when addressing a former president[3][4]. Instead, we are supposed to use titles like \"Mr. Bush\" or \"Senator Obama.\" Others claim that former presidents hold the title after they leave office and therefore should be addressed as \"Mr. President.\"[5] This is based on the tradition of addressing a person by the highest office they held. This is further reinforced by the press and other forms of media using the title of \"Mr. President\" when addressing former presidents. As an average American, I do not think what we call a former president matters in the grand scheme of things. In everyday conversation, I do not worry about formal titles. When referring to former presidents, I use names like JFK, FDR, LBJ, Tricky Dick, Jimmy Carter, Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, Slick Willie, Bush Jr., Bush Lite, and Obama. We do not have kings and nobility in America, so I do not feel the need to worry about using formal titles. If I ever met Barack Obama (or any of the former presidents for that matter) in person, I would ask one of their aides what title they prefer. If I were not given any guidance, I would go with Mr. Obama as it is a safe and uncontroversial choice.

But of course you can refer to or address a current President Mr. \u201cWhatever\u201d as well. However protocol, tradition and respect for the office dictate the use of the honorific. With few exceptions once a title is earned, a person is permitted to continue to use it. Even Presidents refer to and address their predecessors this way. Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, George HW Bush, George W Bush and even Richard Nixon are still referred to as President Clinton, President Obama, President Bush, President Bush and even President Nixon. And they are, in Nixon's case were, addressed as Mr. President. ",
