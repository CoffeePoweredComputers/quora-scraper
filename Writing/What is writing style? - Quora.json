            "answer_text": "Some authors use simple sentences most of the time (Hemingway). Some authors use long, run-on, compound-complex sentences (D. Defoe). Some authors write in poetry, others in prose. All these types of writings are considered styles of writing. The same information may be handed over, but one person says, \u201cYes, do it\u201d while another says, \u201cIt is time for it to be done, so, yes, have it done now.\u201d If you can recognize a pattern of writing for the author, then that is his/her style (more or less).

            "answer_text": "A writing style is one person\u2019s voice or the way they convey information. For example, in speech, in response to someone saying \u201c\u201cThat shirt is blue,\u201d one person might say, \u201cYes, it is.\u201d While another person might say sarcastically, \u201cIt\u2019s blue, really? I didn\u2019t know that! It\u2019s not like I can see it or anything!\u201d Much like speech, different people have different ways of writing. For example, read a bit of Shakespeare\u2019s writing, then compare it to the writing of your favorite modern author. It has a different feel to it, right? That\u2019s because of the change in style.
