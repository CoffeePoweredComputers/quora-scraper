            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve done some research on this for my company and these are the top 5 reasons I found behind why emails get flagged as spam: 1. You have low engagement rates Spam filters can now actually detect how your recipients are engaging with your emails. If you historically have low open or bounce rates, your emails are much more likely to be flagged as spam. The more engaged your recipients are with the emails you\u2019re sending, the more likely you are to reach your recipient\u2019s inbox. A key tip for avoiding this is to avoid sending emails to the same addresses who are not opening or engaging with your emails after multiple times. You can use tools like Yesware to see if people are interacting with your email or even opening them at all. 2. You are not updating and cleaning your email lists Keeping your email lists clean plays a huge role in preventing your emails from going to spam. First and foremost, your email list should consist of legitimate addresses and valid opt-ins from the recipients. Remember to clean out your lists by deleting all inactive email addresses on a regular basis. If you\u2019re consistently sending emails to inactive accounts, this will significantly hurt your open rates. As discussed above, low open rates are a big indicator of spam. Go through your email lists on a monthly bases, clean them up, and delete all inactive addresses to avoid a bad reputation. Stay on top of your email metrics to ensure your email addresses are legitimate and active. 3. Your content is flagging spam (body of email and subject line) The content of your emails \u2013 both the body and subject line \u2013 can contain many flags that set off spam triggers. Spam filters are getting smarter by the day and monitor your messages for spam-like wording and formatting. Here are some behaviors you should avoid to ensure your email doesn\u2019t get flagged as spam: Avoid all caps in both the body of your text and your subject line. Email filters catch these easily.Avoid using multiple exclamation points. This looks very spam-like and just plain right unprofessional \u2013 for the sake of all of us, try to avoid this.Grammatical errors. The best way to avoid this \u2013 use tools that flag your mistakes and always proofread.Avoid using different colored text in your email.Personalize your emails - the harsh reality is 57% of email recipients consider a message spam if it isn\u2019t relevant to their needs. Personalize as much as possible. This also helps increases the likelihood of your recipient engaging and interacting with your message.4. You\u2019re using spam trigger words There are certain words and phrases that you should avoid using in emails and subject lines. Spam filters pick up on spam-like words, especially in your subject lines. Here are some spam trigger words we found that you should try to avoid using:  5. You have included an attachment Attachments alert filters of a possible virus. Avoid attaching files to your prospecting emails because spam filters are on the watch for these. Also, attachments negatively affect the load time of your email, which increases bounce rates. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 if the person is expecting to hear from you (someone who has you in their contacts) then by all means attachments are perfectly okay. But never send an email with an attachment to a new contact or in a cold email. The reason why spam filters flag attachments is because actual spam emails often contain destructive attachments. So spam filters automatically overreact when there is an attachment. If you want to attach a file or document in a cold email is to use a link \u2013 link to it with a CTA that directs the recipient to your website. Try using descriptive links as well. \u2014 I hope these help! ",
