            "answer_text": "As an editor at TextRanch.com, I often reassure my clients when a sentence is correct, and in this case \"two times\" is grammatically correct. It has the same meaning as the word \"twice\", but \"two times\" is generally considered less formal. You are most likely to hear \"two times\" in an everyday conversation between friends, or see it written in a casual email. \"Two times\" might also be used in situations where the writer or speaker wants to emphasize the actual number. Imagine that you are a landlord and your tenant is behind in his rent. Now compare the sentences below: I have contacted you two times about your overdue rent, but you have not returned my calls. I have contacted you twice about your overdue rent, but you have not returned my calls. The first example packs a little more punch than the second one. If you are the landlord and you want to sound tough, you would use \"two times\" rather than \"twice\". Incidentally, \"thrice\" is a word that carries the same meaning as \"three times\", but it is rarely used today. ",

Examples: \u201cShe was elected to parliament twice, serving two terms of three years each.\u201d or \u201cShe was twice elected to parliament, serving two terms of three years each.\u201d You could say: \u201cShe was elected to parliament two times, serving two terms of three years each.\u201d or \u201cShe was elected to parliament on two occasions, serving two terms of three years each.\u201d ",
