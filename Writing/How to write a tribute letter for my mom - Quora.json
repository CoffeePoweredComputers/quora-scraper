            "answer_text": "Betty, find a picture of your Mom. Take the time to study it. Remember it all, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Sometimes people have issues about how they grew up, their perceptions of life as pertaining to said experience. You can have laughter, tears, hindsight, acceptance. If your mother is still alive, tell her how you feel. She will appreciate it. If she is gone. Write it down, read it over, make corrections, add or delete. Just let everyone know this is your mother, that she was on this earth, and you appreciated her presence in your life. Whatever we are in this life is a reflection of our parents. We are, by our own existence, the true inheritance. We need to take all the negative and the positive and make it a gift to the world. Love will guide you, I promise. ",

            "answer_text": "First sorry for your loss. It\u2019s hard, very hard, to lose someone then have to walk through the realities of death. As to your question, start with basics, where was she born, raised etc. Then think about what made your mom special to you. Example: my grandmother was known for always saying something positive about people. My father said if she saw the town drunk she would say he has a nice smile\u2026. After you make such a list you should have enough to share her life story in a way that honors her. Remember it\u2019s your story about your mom so write it from your heart and don\u2019t take in much input from others. Small stories have big impact at funerals, so don\u2019t think it\u2019s about big life accomplishments etc. Tell the human story of your mothers life. Funeral services are for the living - the surviving family - not the one who pasted. Perhaps you could simply write a public letter to your mom and say all things you wanted to but never did. As for after the funeral, live the rest of your life as a tribute to her. All the good qualities she instilled in you continue to live out. In this way she\u2019s still with you. ",

            "answer_text": "Start with a memory. What\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of your mother? A specific event; a scent; a motion. How do feel about this memory? What stands out to you? Do you think your mother would be surprised that this is the memory you chose? This is a device I use often in my own writing. Start with something specific, and once you\u2019re done, the rest tends to flow. Let it flow. Edit later. And if you find yourself stuck, pick another memory. Ask your family, and your mother\u2019s close friends. Ask them for the things that cling closest to their hearts when they think about your mom. Ask them to explain. I bet you\u2019ll end up with more than you need in the end. ",
