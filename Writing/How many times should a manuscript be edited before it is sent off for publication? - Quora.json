            "answer_text": "Based on the question alone, meaning you haven\u2019t done it before, my answer is ALOT. Here\u2019s the breakdown from my first novel and you might not like it because there are no short cuts. All I can say is that it was invaluable to me in learning how to be better at this thing called storytelling. I had an alpha reader (a book birthing coach) Her only job was to read the chapters as they were being written. Some manner of editing was happening as the chapters were coming out, but not much. She helped me keep my momentum. When the Shitty First Draft was complete -120K words - I went through the whole thing by myself, not knowing what I was doing and spent a lot of time on parts that I was not satisfied with. Then I had about six beta readers. One of which found out that I had a bad habit of what is called \u2018double tapping\u2019 - where I was showing a thing and then telling it as well. This prompted another edit that took out about 10.000 words. After the beta readers were finished with it, I went through it again. At this point, I thought it was time to bring in my Editor. It really wasn\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t know any better. My editor went through two passes with me. We did it marathon-style in the course of about a month. It was grueling, mortifying, and probably one of the most educational experiences of my life. In those two passes, we trimmed off about 20K words and changed where the beginning of the story started. When finished, I sighed in relief. I really believed I was finished. Then she sent me an email (that I have kept to this day) going through an arm's length laundry list of things she wanted me to fix. She also instructed me to do these things and then put the manuscript away for six months. She also basically wanted me to decimate the last quarter of my book. I didn\u2019t believe her. I argued with her. So she decided to illustrate not only her belief in the story but just what it took to really tighten a manuscript down to make it sellable. She entered me into a writing contest that had professionals - both editors and agents - judging the first 5K words (basically the hook necessary to keep a reader wanting more). We did marathon edits on just this section - over and over and over and over. I submitted it and I was a finalist. When I had an agent read my synopsis of the plot she told me very frankly that the plot was not sellable. I persisted. I tried all that was within my power to tackle the laundry list provided to me and then I reluctantly put the book away for six months. There was a method to her madness. I could not see the forest for the trees. I needed time and distance from the book itself. I also needed all these hardwon lessons on craft to really sink in. I pulled the book out after six months and was horrified at what I found. And I went to the actual work of editing the book properly. Another 10K words came off, I tidied up the ending into something beautiful and then I was done. That was over a decade ago. I can still pull the book out to this day and not need to fix anything. It was absolutely positively the best it could be. The Agent was right. The plot was not elegant enough to sell. It was a \u2018kitchen sink\u2019 plot where I had thrown everything cool I could think of. I did get good at dialogue, action, tension, setups, red herrings, underpainting, and a whole litany of craft skills that I could not have gotten any other way. I have no regrets. The good news is I have never had to go through quite as rigorous a process again and over time have been far less of a burden on my editors. Everyone has to start somewhere and just listening to those who are further along the road from you is an excellent start. ",

            "answer_text": "A handful. Because it is subjective. The number of steps is easy to remember. Each of those may have several dangling from it too. Prewriting has all the prior materials, notes, and outline revisions. Pause for a while after each draft to clear mental predispositions. Read using different devices, font sizes, or colors to cut illusions. Version logs for online files may show much more since it is stop and go. There is no limit. Add the types of edits to a checklist, e.g. structure or style. Length may or may not be a factor. If running it by beta readers for critiques, truncate at some point. As an analogy, on this site, answer the same question from different perspectives or contexts. Titles changeGet some practice in reviewing, proofreading and copyediting. A few writers can mull it over enough before putting it down without error. Suggestions and recommendations for articles can run into the hundreds. Apps can do spell-checking and some grammar. Social media allows self-publishing. Public standards involve requests for comments. Translations need verification. Content marketing paces SEO. Self-help modifies some beliefs. Someday the author will no longer be possessed. ",
