            "answer_text": "Neither of those phrases is grammatically correct. What you\u2019re looking for is \u201cHope you recover soon\u201d, although that phrase is usually stated as \u201cHope you get well soon\u201d. For the details, the word \u201crecover\u201d is a verb, so you don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d it. You get a noun, not a verb. The word \u201crecovery\u201d is a noun, but it doesn\u2019t fit with the word \u201cget\u201d. Why? Honestly I\u2019m not sure. Someone with more knowledge of the English language than I have could probably say why in a flash. If you really need to know, put a comment on this answer and I\u2019ll try to look it up. \u201cSoonest\u201d is also wrong, but again I\u2019m not sure why. Probably because you\u2019re not making a direct comparison to something that is happening soon, but not the soonest. Again we can figure out the details if you need them, but my bet is you just want a native speaker\u2019s take on how to phrase this. ",

            "answer_text": "I am assuming you were mostly referring to the verb \u201crecover\u201d in this question. In that exact sentence, the correct form to use would be \u201cI hope you will get recovered soon\u201d. However, this is not the form you would use in standard English. You would generally say \u201cI hope you recover soon\u201d More common ways to phrase the sentiment are: \u201dI hope you get well soon\u201d / \u201cGet well soon!\u201d \u201dI wish you a fast recovery\u201d \u201dWishing you well\u201d \u201dTake good care\u201d ",
