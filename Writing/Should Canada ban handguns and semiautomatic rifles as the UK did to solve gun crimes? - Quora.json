            "answer_text": "There is little advantage to banning semi-automatic rifles in Canada because it is rare for rifles to be used in crime due to the size and profile of the weapon making it difficult to conceal in a way that is not suspicious. Furthermore, in remote communities, bears, mountain lions, wolves, and other animals may be very real threats. The UK does not have these dangers. There is enough reason to continue to allow licensed owners in Canada to purchase these rifles than to ban them. Handguns are a slightly different story. With the laws in Canada, handguns are only allowed to be used for target shooting at specific facilities. What this means is that the handgun must be at home locked up, with you at the range, or locked up while in transit between those two points. Having the handgun with you at any other point is already illegal, and thus legally owned handguns are rarely used in crimes that are not premeditated. Given the strictness of our licensing system here in Canada, it is a rare event. Much of Canada\u2019s gun crime issue stems from our proximity to the USA. The Canada-US border is far too long to be policed perfectly, and purchasing and transporting guns in the USA is far, far simpler than in Canada. What this means is that there are plenty of guns smuggled through the border. The other source of illegal guns in Canada are guns stolen from the house or vehicle of the owner. Banning guns can only reduce the incidence of those thefts, not stop the already illegal smuggling of guns. The UK does not have this issue as they are an island nation, making it far easier to spot and stop smuggling operations. Given the minimal expected effectiveness in stopping gun crime, I would not recommend a ban on handguns and semiautomatic rifles in Canada. Since guns of all kinds are already used in a minority of homicides in Canada, it is unlikely that a ban on certain guns will be capable of significantly reducing the total homicide rate either. Implementing stricter border controls would be a better use of resources than banning, buying, and trashing or recycling these guns. ",

            "answer_text": "They could try, but there\u2019s some glaring issues. Canada is not an island, has significantly more guns in legal possession than the UK (7 million in Canada vs 2 million in the UK), and definitely has the SMALL issue of the fact that they share a long, continuous border with a country that has more privately owned guns than people (conservative estimates of 330\u2013350 million guns in the US, of which at least a third are solely handguns), and produce more of them by the millions annually. Unless they greatly ramp up their law enforcement presence, especially in controlling illicit arms smuggling, and are able to impose relatively harsh punishments to deter arms from being smuggled in from abroad, it could be argued that current regulations regarding legal ownership of handguns and semi-automatic rifles in Canada on a Restricted License, which is stricter and tougher to obtain than an Un-Restricted License, strikes a decent balance at maintaining their nations interest in limiting guns being used in crimes while not throwing the baby out with the bath water with regard to not providing any legal pathway for a private citizen to go through a bureaucratic process to own such a firearm.

The rate of gun violence is still low compared to the U.S. or even Canada, but the British Home Office reported that gun crime has actually increased in recent years, as has the rate of violent crime. Much of the increase in gun crime can be attributed to the growing gang problem in the U.K. The important thing to do before enacting a ban is to determine whether or not the ban will do any good. Will it lead to a reduction in gun crime or simply add more criminals? Unfortunately, it seems like every politician\u2019s answer to a mass shooting, even if they are as incredibly rare, as they are in Canada, is to call for new gun control laws simply because they want to look like they are doing something even though they have no idea of anything productive to do.

Banning them would only serve to disarm the law abiding people and do nothing at all to stop the criminals from shooting people. Handguns are tightly regulated in Canada and handguns in the hands of law abiding licensed gun owners are not a threat to anyone. Most modern hunting rifles and shotguns are semiautomatic and law abiding licensed gun owners almost never use their firearms to commit crimes. Know how many people have been illegally shot with AR-15s in Canada in the past 10 years? ZERO. NONE. NADA. NOT ONE. ",
