            "answer_text": "Clemmie, Great question. You\u2019ve made the decision to direct and that\u2019s the best decision any writer / director can make once they get the urge to produce their own work. First of all, get a group of people together (even on zoom or skype) do a script reading so that you can hear the words of the different characters, the story and the pacing. Listen to the feedback of your readers and even record the session and listen to the script. Make sure it is as good as it can be as it is the basis of your new 2\u20134 year journey.Read a couple of books on direction and working with actors and definitely begin to watch your favorite films without sound to begin to understand the economy of shots and editing. If you can, find a mentor, someone\u2019s who\u2019s work you respect and admire.As you are new I wouldn\u2019t send the work out to producers as the current situation with Covid has brought the Union and the industry to their knees which means any producers you send to will be looking for a way to make money off of you.Try to work with professionals, it is a down time and you\u2019re more than likely able to find cast and crew who will work just to work but be careful. Is your shoot going to be Union or Non-Union? The difference can be as great as an amazing initial experience or a nightmare that will haunt you for decades.Don\u2019t spend every penny! Equipment, cameras, lights, sound are cheap so spend where you must but don\u2019t spend anything where you don\u2019t have to. Even if you have a billion dollars in the bank, don\u2019t waste it on lunches, cars, hot actresses, lofty offices or any other BS that has nothing to do with you telling your story your way.For music use a service like Royalty-Free Music Licensing and Sound Effects For Video, Film and for B-roll and establishing shots, use Storyblocks or one of the many inexpensive services like it.Don\u2019t quit. You are going to make mistakes, people will fail you, actors may or may not be as good as you think they are, someone will forget to charge batteries and that perfect location you fought so hard for may be shut down or lost so be ready to adapt.Choose as few locations as you can but keep them interesting and always remember, people will forgive a few errors with image but they will never forgive bad sound.Good luck and remember no matter what you turn out, it will be your baby so treat it will love and respect from the beginning to end and get rid of anyone who doesn\u2019t support your vision 100%. That doesn\u2019t mean that you surround yourself with \u2018Yes\u2019 men and women it means that you allow for critique and disagreement about the art while maintaining that the quality of your art and never allow it to be compromised.Best of luck and continued success!

            "answer_text": "I'm assuming this is a feature screenplay and not a short. Apologies if I'm incorrect. You could try sending it to agents and/or producers (depending on the budget level) and if someone really likes it they may be willing to let you direct it. Maybe. Or write/direct a few short films. Start small with your family/friends and submit them to festivals. Build a good reputation and work your way up to bigger and bigger budgets until letting you direct a feature is a no brained. Or you could produce it yourself too. You can make a feature film for very little money using very little equipment \u2026 quality may suffer but it'll show what you can do for the next one. The fewer people involved, the more control you have \u2026 but it's a lot more work. The cheaper it is, the more likely you are to get to direct it. ",
