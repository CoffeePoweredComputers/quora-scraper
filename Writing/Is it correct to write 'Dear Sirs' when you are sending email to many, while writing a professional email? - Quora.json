            "answer_text": "Unless your data is not segmented properly, your letter will not even get opened to get to the failed address and salutation line. Good Copy on the outer envelope with a live stamp and a properly formatted address field from a recognized brand will get your letter opened. A \u201cDear Sirs,\u201d salutation, is both demeaning to women, as well as offensive as well ignorant of the direct mail conversation that you as the mailer are having with your customer, prospect or long term donor. It maybe be easier to suggest, \u201cDear Friend,\u201d if you don\u2019t know your prospect as a potential client. Using the plural \u201cSirs,\u201d is also wrong, as only one person is going to be reading your letter. If your data is poorly segmented and you have no name, then, most times, your letter and your marketing efforts and their costs, will end up in the trash anyway. If your data is current and up to date, you know ahead of time whether you are talking with a man or a woman and both your address field and Salutation will reflect that information. I hope that it helps your efforts. Jim Sullivan Optic Nerve Direct Marketing Optic Nerve Direct.com dmresults2@gmail.com ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is correct to write \u201cDear Sirs\u201d when you are sending email to many, while writing a professional email. The standard \u201cDear Sir\" used to be the standard. That's the most common non-specific salutation. If there's going to be more than one person reading a letter at any given time, use a plural salutation. If you ever needed to address a letter to two men at once, use \u201cDear Sirs.\u201d It matters how much you know beforehand before sending the letter in terms of \"Sirs.\" For example, if you\u2019re writing to the owners of a company and you know that the owners are James Mason and Joseph Carter, you would have no problem using Dear Sirs.Alternatively, however, you may just opt to use Dear Messrs. Mason and Carter, but this sounds a lot more formal.In general, we use \u201cDear Sir\u201d for male, \u201cDear Madam\u201d for female, and \u201cDear Sirs\u201d if one is not sure about the sex of the person the letter is being directed to or if one is writing to more than one person.
