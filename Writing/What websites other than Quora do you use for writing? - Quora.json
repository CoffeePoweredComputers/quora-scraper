            "answer_text": "I used to blog on Blogger, but stopped completely in 2013. I began in 2005, and I blogged consistently until 2010, then began tapering off after that until I completely lost interest. I\u2019ve been invited to blog on a Game of Thrones theory blog hosted by Wordpress, but right now that is all the online writing I do. I am on an academic site, but I have yet to do anything for them, and I do upload a lot of my powerpoints for work on Slide Share, but that is it. I\u2019ve thought about checking out Medium, but I haven\u2019t done so. All of my other writings is in journals. I do so much writing for work that I use online writing for relaxation which is why I stick to topics like A Song of Ice and Fire, Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, Star Wars and the occasional answer on education. I want my online writing to be fun and different from anything I do in my daily life. ",

On Quora I\u2019ve got a built-in readership, a mechanism for getting my content spread around (even if it\u2019s done mostly by algorithm these days), and the opportunity to engage in mostly civil, intelligent, and informed discourse with readers and other writers. I did originally have a blog on BlogSpot: that\u2019s where I originally wrote my StatSheet elections blog, and it\u2019s why the blog here is still titled \u201cStatSheet - The Quora Edition\u201d. Originally I envisioned the Quora blog being just reposts of the stuff I\u2019d been writing on BlogSpot, with some additional content specific to Quora answers or questions on the Quora Edition. I eventually shut down the BlogSpot because Quora offers all of those advantages I described in the first paragraph, and \u201cThe Quora Edition\u201d is now just vestigial. ",
