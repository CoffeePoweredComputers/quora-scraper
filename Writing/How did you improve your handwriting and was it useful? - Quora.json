            "answer_text": "I improved my handwriting in this way. Got inspiration from a friend . Her handwriting is beautiful. I wanted to model mine after hers.Got a fountian pen. Many assume this will automatically improve your handwriting. It helps\u2026but doesn't improve automatically.Set your mind to it. That's the most important part. You have to set your mind to it. You should not give up. It's not and overnight process. It takes a couple of weeks with steady determination.Write , write, write! There is no other way to improve than to keep on writing.Ease up your grip on the pen. That's why I use Fountain pens. They require no pressure. Mere guidance to form the words.Slow down you writing speed. The importance of this cannot be over emphasized. You have to slow down. A fountain pen forces you to slow down. It helps.Keep a separate book for practice. It can be a four line copy book or a dotpad or a bullet journal book. Keep one separately for your writing needs. It helps. It also helps to keep track of the size of your letters in relation to each other and also helps to track your progress in the legibility department.Happy writing friend. ",

            "answer_text": " Our handwriting has a more direct connection with our brain. Our brain memory can retain written matter longer and better. Improving our handwriting takes effort like any other worthy activity. My hand writing (above) is not the best in the world by any means or stretch of imagination. But, I'm certainly proud of the improvements I have made in my handwriting over the years.The basic principle for improving your handwriting is to write more and more and that is exactly what I did to make significant improvement in my handwriting.The biggest benefit of having nice handwriting is that there is nothing like reading your own handwriting expecially when it is legible and beautiful. The more beautiful your handwriting the more you enjoy reading it. The more you enjoy reading your handwriting, the more it encourages you to write more and more setting-off a virtuous cycle of learning new things in life. Now isn't that amazing!Bad handwriting is a sign of imperfect education - Mahatma Gandhi ",
