            "answer_text": "When you are special to someone,it means you have touched them deeply somehow(except family;They will love you however you are). So,they care for you a lot.They take notice & care about all the small things about you which otherwise be left unnoticed by other people.They love you unconditionally and put you on a pedestel in their world.They respect you and always be willing to stay with you,do anything and everything with you.They get to know you better than yourself and can just make out you had a bad day when they just see your face.Such kind of people are just wonderful Do not lose them. I\u2019d like to say make yourself special to someone and you yourself have a experience. Because it\u2019s a felling very hard to describe. ",
