            "answer_text": "Of course it depends on the person and why they wrote their autobiography. In college many eons ago I had a class in autobiography and read a half dozen over the course of a semester. The common thread was errors in facts that were easily verified (this was way before the internet was even a thing). Some of the factual \u2018mistakes\u2019 were embarrassing others seemed to be an interpretation based on that person\u2019s perspective. Autobiography is a way to document what a person did or wanted to do with their lives, for others it is a way to set the record straight as they see / remember it. For others it is an effort to re-invent themselves to be better remembered or promote themselves. Michelle Obama\u2019s autobiography \u201cBecoming\u201d was quite good. Nothing really jumped out at me in terms of factual error and I found her to be very introspective of herself and the demands society puts on women of color and famous women of color. I thought in reading it I gained some insight into experiences that I could not otherwise understand. I felt it was a good investment of my time to read and understand what she had to say. Trump\u2019s ghostwritten autobiographical \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d was a self promotion that did not really impress me when I read it years before he was the buffoon he is now. It was wildly exaggerated and ridiculously puffed up and clearly a self promotion. It was illuminating in the sense that it showed what a hollow, soulless liar he is, incapable of kindness or empathy. For those reasons alone I had no desire to ever vote for him for anything. Some of Nixon\u2019s writings about himself are insightful about his upbringing and hard times. It does explain a lot about his presidency and his paranoid nature that led to his downfall. That said, autobiography has to be taken with a lot of salt. Clearly the writer wants to establish a point of view, but it is not always a valid point of view. I would look to autobiography as a broad indicator of character - not necessarily a touchstone of facts. ",

            "answer_text": "Sorry Kevin you have asked a totally unanswerable question. If it is an autobiography then unless you want to hire a fact-checker, there is no way on earth a first person story of someone\u2019s life, written by that person can be totally verified. Unless their life is actually part of the public record. I mean I could tell you that I traveled with the Beatles on their first American tour. Or that I was in the kitchen on the night that Bobby Kennedy was assassinated. Or I traveled with a Hollywood actor when he ran for president and won. The last three are actually true\u2014but I\u2019m not sure you could verify that unless you went to extreme lengths. I could tell you that Winston Churchill called me when he became Prime Minister to ask me how to run the country in time of war. (Not true of course because I was just two at the time!) The silly point I am trying to make is that anyone writing an autobiography can angle the story to make themselves look great. Heroic. Dastardly or whatever. Movie stars writing autobiographies (as pointed out below by Russell) obviously want to paint a picture which portrays them in the best light possible. On the other hand sensational revelations sell books\u2014and particularly in the UK, the more outrageous the more a writer might get from newspapers to serialize their life story. I remember an old newspaper editor, back in the not easy to check the facts maam days, once told me, \u201cNever let the facts get in the way of a good story!\u201d ",
