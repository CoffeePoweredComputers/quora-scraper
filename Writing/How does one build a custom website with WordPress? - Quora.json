            "answer_text": "There are a lot of tools out there that you can use. I have tried a handful but I find that Themify works best for me. I use their Themify Ultra plugin. It allows me to build the skeleton of my websites from the frontend, then later go into the Css to make final changes to my websites if I have to. (I have 2/10 Css knowledge). But don\u2019t let that scare you, you can build a whole site without even going to the css. It is also responsive, and I have the total freedom of how everything looks on mobile, tablet and desktop. I have used it to build websites like this one, and this one. However it is a bit difficult to use at first, and I got a lot of online help from Hogan Chua here. But once you get the hang of it, you can go as crazy as your imaginations allows you. ",

            "answer_text": "If what you mean is design a custom website that doesn't look like a blog , then try creating the website itself as Wordpress pages and don't make the blog the home page. Themes like Headway are a great place to start as they allow a lot of customization without re-inventing the wheel. ",
