For the purposes of this sample I set the graphic and the text box below with a right-click on each object an then choose [Wrap Text] \u2192 [In Line with Text]. A much harder way to do it inside Word (See \u2018B\u2019) is to invert a tear-drop symbol inside word. To do that you need to: Start by inserting a text box where you want to insert the character (See \u2018B\u2019)Leave Word\u2019s cursor inside that text box.Go to the [Insert] menu at \u2018C\u2019.Select Symbol at \u2018D\u2019 and \u2018E\u2019 to get the Symbol window.In the Symbol window, select the desired \u2018Wingdings\u2019 [Font] at \u2018F\u2019.Find and click on the desired symbol. (In this case the \u2018tear-drop\u2019 symbol at \u2018G\u2019.)Press [Insert] at \u2018H\u2019 and then [Close]Rotate the text box 180 degrees to turn the tear -drop into a drop location (\u2018See \u2018B\u2019) and set to [In Line with Text] as above. If you may want to use other Wingdings in the future the table at this link might help yo find what you\u2019re looking for:   ",
