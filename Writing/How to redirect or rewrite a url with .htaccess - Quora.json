            "answer_text": "301 redirect /path/to/page http://absolute/path/to/page\u00a0This is a 301 redirect for htaccess. It has 3 parts. Part 1: 301 redirect - this tells what type of redirect it is. In this case it is a permenant redirect. This way googlebot can note that the page has moved for good. Part 2: Url path to the old location, without the domain name. This is called a relative path, In this case, relative to the root of the domain, Part 3: The full (absolute) url of the new location. There is a single space between each part. Each redirect should also be on it\u2019s own line. Be careful, because messing up the syntax can crash your site. Also, be careful of redirecting sub-pages with the same names.
