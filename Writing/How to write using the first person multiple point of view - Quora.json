            "answer_text": "Its not just editors. The majority of readers dont like reading first person either. Even when done well. And its very hard to do well because its easy to forget and slip out of character. In First Person you have to stay inside that characters head and see, hear, feel, taste, etc only what that character could sense or know realistically in any moment. If you dont do that it quickly becomes unrealistic and ridiculous. The writers that do it well tend to give their characters numerous friends and contacts with appropriate rolls to the story that can impart necessary information when needed. Those secondary characters are always written anout in third person though. You dont go jumping from head to head in First Person or you really will confuse readers and drive them away. The definately should only be one \u2018I, me, my\u2019 point of view in a story or it becomes too annoying to read. Writing a single First Person is hard enough let alone multiple first person point of views. And in first person the character (and you) need to onow themselves very well inside and out (as well as any human knows themselves from birth forward.) That means creating your character with very detailed back stories and knowing every detail from fav color to pet perves to deepest fears and darkest secrets no one but that person would know about themselves. You have to know every thing that character loves and fears and hates, how they will react in most situations, all the people in their lives and how those relationships work, etc. Think about all the things you know about yourself and your character needs to know similar things about themselves. And remember if you want to actually sell stories you are writing for your target audience, not just for yourself. If you want to sell you have to write what people want to read. First Person is difficult to maintain for experienced writers. Inexperienced writers should stick to third person until they are experienced enough. ",

            "answer_text": "Read stories that have multiple narrators. I suggest \u201cAs I Lay Dying\u201d by William Faulkner, \u201cA Visit from the Goon Squad\u201d by Jennifer Egan, and the Spoon River Anthology by Edgar Lee Masters. You can find a free pdf of the anthology online, as it was written in 1915 so the copyright has lapsed. Find some other multiple narrator stories and read those. Read them all with a critical eye, make notes about what you like and dislike about the technique, and try to focus on that while you're writing. The other way that you can do it well is to just do it over and over and over again. Only write in first person with multiple narrators, for everything you write. When you finish a story, put it away and revisit it after a few months to go over it with fresh eyes, and see what you're doing right/wrong. Write multiple narrator stories for 10,000 hours. Each time you sit down to write a new story, you will get better and better at the technique. When you get frustrated with your progress, it means you're on the verge of making a breakthrough. I know that some editors discourage writers from pursuing this type of storytelling, but if it works for you, and you get really good at it, you can actually use it as a selling point. I can't remember who it was, but there was some prolific writer who said once that in order to become a great writer you have to turn your weakness into a strength by exploiting it (this is just the gist, I can't remember the exact quote). You can make multiple narrators your signature style! ",
