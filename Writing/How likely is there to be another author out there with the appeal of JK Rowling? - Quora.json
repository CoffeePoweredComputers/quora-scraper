            "answer_text": "We can replicate talent but not time. So, while another author might come out with their own epic story, the time isn't as perfect as when Rowling did. You see, (and I don't mean to be rude) kids these days are usually more into technology and videogames compared to the past when said things weren't as advanced as now. Why pick up a book, or even an e-book app, when there's Call of Duty, Overwatch, Fortnite, PUBG, League of Legends, Clash of Clans, PS4 5, 6, (soon to be, maybe?) etc. I'm not hating on them but just making mention of various technology and games. Back in the day, Harry Potter came out at a time when we had just Gamecube, PS1, PS2, etc. Also, kids played a bit more outside and were the camping/reading types. Therefore, it was more likely that a book like Harry Potter would be read and enjoyed by the youth. And if one can make a book geared towards kids and adults, and which is fervently read by many of both, then you got the appeal that Rowling had. Today, however, even the best of book series tend to fall into one or two close age groups. For example, YA fiction, adult books, etc. There may exist gems similar to Harry Potter out there but, as I've said, today's time isn't always one of sitting down and enjoying the feel of a good book. I don't mean to generalize and might be wrong, but this is how I see it. ",

There are plenty of authors with a similarly-sized audience, who get movie deals, translations, graphic-novel adaptations, and more made out of their books. The only reason they are different from JK is that their genres tend to be a bit different. Just a few examples: James Patterson (YA/adult thriller, mystery, and adventure)Steven King (adult horror)Dan Brown (adult thriller/mystery)Rick Riordan (middle grade/YA fantasy and adult mystery/thriller)Neil Gaiman (middle grade/YA/adult fantasy/science fiction)Cassandra Clare (YA fantasy)Jim Butcher (adult fantasy)",
