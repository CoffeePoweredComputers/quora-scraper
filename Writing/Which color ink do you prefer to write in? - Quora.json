            "answer_text": "I absolutely prefer to write in blue. The funny thing is many people say my handwriting looks wonderful in black, which is not my preference but I have nothing against it.  It\u2019s blue, but looks too dark because of my potato-quality camera (via my blog) When it comes to blue ink, I prefer the brighter kind of blue known generally as \u201ccold blue,\u201d which used to be the default blue in Parker ballpoint pen refills and German-made brands (Schneider, Pelikan, etc). The typical blue in most pens today is just too dark or too purplish to be properly called \u2018blue.\u2019  \u2018Ming vase blue\u2019 (via Pantone 288C \u3063\u3066\u3053\u3093\u306a\u8272) Cold blue somewhat resembles the traditional Chinese \u9752 (q\u012bng), which is a bluer form of verdant (blue-green). If you\u2019re in the printing business, the closest is Pantone 288C \u2014 otherwise known as \u201cMing vase blue.\u201d My drafting ink colour idiosyncrasies I\u2019m an oldie \u2014 and an oldie creature of habit and habituation. So I have a fairly fixed sequence of ink-colour usage:\u2014 Internal first drafts I use red or pink for the first writeup \u2014 makes it immediately clear that the crap is definitely not for showing to third parties.Then I revise or edit in blue or black.Drafts and amendments that may be read by third parties I draft in black.I revise in pencil or blue.I edit and make amendments in pencil or green.Internal corrections are in red.All positions of amendments are \u201cblacklined\u201d \u2014 underlined in black.Colour sequence for markups (traditional) Black \u2014 blue \u2014 green \u2014 violet \u2014 brown.You can definitely see I\u2019m an editorial and printing person to the bones.

            "answer_text": "Blue is my go-to color. I use a lot of colors so I can differentiate between notes. I\u2019m kind of an addictive note taker. And no, I\u2019m no longer in school. Everything is written. To-do lists, ideas for articles and stories, agendas, tidbits I want to remember, quotes, parpagraphs and I\u2019ve even written out whole articles to get the tone of a particular magazine before pitching. I love my fountain pens and keep one with black ink at all times and one with blue ink at all times. The blue is Levenger Cobalt Blue. The black is Cross. The hunt for the fountain ink blue that resembles the Bic blue in the crystal stick pen eludes me. That is, by far, my favorite blue. Oddly enough, green is my favorite color, but most greens I\u2019ve tried annoy me. They just aren\u2019t what I\u2019m looking for\u2026.UNTIL, two days ago. I went to a craft store to check out some more colored pens like the Stabilo pens (I use these most in my planner so I can find what I\u2019m looking for quickly). I decided to try one of the LePens. I bought the teal and I\u2019m in love with that color. Not sure about the pen, but the color is awesome! Anyone reading this: If you are willing to share your favorite fountain pen ink colors I would love to hear them. If you happen to know one that looks like the Bic blue, please, please, please share. :) ",
