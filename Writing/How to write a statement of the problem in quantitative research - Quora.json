            "answer_text": "There is nothing inherent about quantitative reasoning that separates it from a specific usage of language. Meaning that you want to focus on what principles, methods, and facts are asked of you in quantitative work and more specifically when it is tested on standardized tests in quantitative reasoning. If taken as symbols, computation, or formulation without using words, these can always be expressed using words in writing and more specifically are read aloud in oral speech. So doing well in how to work with elements of quantitative reasoning such as numbers, geometric objects, algebraic symbols, operations, and logical processes is about how to express that using language. And within mathematics as a discipline, this is done using theory structured in theorems and proofs that depend on concrete definitions and very particular usage of the language, giving it a sense of coherence and rigor. Most people who see math from the outside will call those who study it logical, and that their work is partly about logic within its domain elements. You want to focus your statement if taken as a thesis or dissertation on how you are interpreting quantitative reasoning, what people have been saying about it, and then what your aims are in publishing that. You should have advisors and colleagues who will set the expectations on what you write about quantitative research. ",

            "answer_text": "The \u2018problem\u2019 your work adresses might be a lack of knowledge about a specific topic. So your statement then becomes a description of the investigation you plan into that topic. As a very simple example you could have this title: \u201cAn investigation into the frequency of Quora questions and reponses by nation and topic.\u201d So your data would list Quora questions and reponses over a selected time period, their topic and the nationality or country of the author. Can you imagine all sorts of graphs and charts showing which topics are popular in what areas of the world. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIncreased by ___%\u201d or \u201cdecreased by ___%\u201d You can also have a \u201cscale,\u201d like 1 to 10 to measure such things like performance. When you have more that one, you can compare and measure a difference, typology, and so on. For example, you can say that someone that has has a 40\u2033 waist is fatter than someone with a 38\u2033 waist. Or, you can shove a gallon a beer down a sailor\u2019s throat but only a glass for someone else. ",
