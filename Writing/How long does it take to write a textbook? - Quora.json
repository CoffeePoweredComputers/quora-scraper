            "answer_text": " I have a tetralogy of textbooks in the works, which has considerably slowed down the process, as they are circulations of the same ideas of acceleration in education but from differing vantage points. But having a larger structure has given me a structural basis of where to start and finish in each piece. I started teaching the actual first structure with children/teenagers in about 2005. I started formally documenting what I was doing, my methodology, building what would be my research base in about 2012. I really got serious with a level of drafts and a covers, a mock copy and then a galley proof in about 2016. I then realized Book # 1 was a structural fit to expand into 3 others and started their outlines. Unfortunately this stuff is all drawing board Educational work and I still have Fiction drawing board and Non-Fiction drawing board and Professional Development drawing board, all of which contain projects that are completed and therefore need management and ever-greening (E-Books in particular in our technological production era require we update links, information, covers, etc. It looks to be about every 1\u20133 years depending on the material) so like a circular table I\u2019m often turning the table to attack another area to a point then turning it to attack another area and so on. I would say all congealed, it has taken me about 1 year to pull together what would be a published textbook if there weren\u2019t 3 others that I have to consider the construction of as well. By the time you\u2019re writing a textbook I would surmise that you have a good 10 years of research/teaching/knowledge of your subject so the most difficult part is compressing that into one section\u2014-This Is What This Topic Is, then outlining what can be done with it with examples\u2014-This Is What It Does, then a form of teaching within the text itself\u2014- This Is How You Learn/Teach This. What takes so long, for me at least, is translating how one teaches without being in person, online, video, etc.. I essentially have to anticipate and therefore identity questions and \u201choles\u201d in the overall topic/work so that the textbook is as complete an idea as possible. Then I want the reader, some form of a student or a a teacher looking to create something, to be able to take it a level further, to create enough space within the work itself to be creative. I therefore have to anticipate the unknowable, their ability and creativity. Which means I go back to my work, to my source materials and point out areas that are expandable, open to interpretation or innovation. Which means that the work itself gets \u201cbigger\u201d and must be pared down to a manageable structure (which I\u2019ve found is about 400 pgs. to 600 pgs..) The last part is structural, again anticipating the reader. Do I have a glossary? What are the terms, ideas that are needed to be defined in my work? How much of my bibliography is necessary to reveal, when am I just mentioning everything I\u2019ve ever read? Then there is the consideration of marketing, sales and whether the work itself will require ever-greening\u2014 how often and what would be new considerations/information to include? A textbook seems accessible because of it is designed to be accessible, even if it\u2019s a subject you don\u2019t completely understand. But to design it from the inside out is the difficult part because you\u2019re constantly designing doors and windows on a moving train, but the accessibility can\u2019t destabilize the overall construct. I am diving back in, hoping to get several done and out this year. I would recommend that you don\u2019t stop and start, I\u2019m learning to barrel through with the future saving grace of being able to ever-green material. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect in the first edition, in fact the malleable design is one of the great things about textbooks. The next consideration is whether or not you/I want to design it as an E-Book as well which has it\u2019s own challenges. And the final challenge: pricing. Too low and your tome is a joke, too high and it\u2019s just an academic elite piece that you hope colleges and universities use regularly. Plus, being the publisher, I have to consider there are a variety of discounts, preferentials, etc that come into play from distributors. I\u2019m looking at building in the expectation of discounts to initial price. But there are also a couple of books I want to be financially accessible to students/parents. That means my low end price would be $49.99, knowing it could lose 25% or more in the sale itself (thereby affecting printing costs and my royalty\u2014-it costs more to print more pages, we haven\u2019t even touched on going for color images in a book which jacks up the cost, which means the price is higher\u2014-this is the real reason why textbooks can cost so much) and $169.99, again knowing that it will lose 25% to 40% in a discounting. All of the above aside from the writing itself is why the first one or two can take so long but like the other books I\u2019ve written, once you get your structure, layout, process and standards down pat it becomes easier to push an idea to the completed production-sale stage. #KylePhoenix #TheKylePhoenixShow ",
