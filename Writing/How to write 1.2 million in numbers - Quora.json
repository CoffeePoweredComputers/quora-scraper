            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s change the wording: what does 1.2 million equal? Let\u2019s change it a little more: what does 3 fours equal? To solve the 2nd one, you\u2019d multiple 3 * 4 and get 12. Multiply 1.2 and 1,000,000 and you get 1,200,000 if you ever get stuck on a word problem, try rewriting it with different values and solve it. Then substitute the original values back in and try solving it again. if you are not sure how many zeros are in 1 million, remember that we go \u201cup to a new name\u201d ever 3 zeros. thousand = 1,000 million = 1,000,000 billion = 1,000,000,000 trillion = 1,000,000,000,000 and in between, we have 10 thousand, 100 thousand, 10 million and 100 million, 1etc. thousand = 1,00010 thousand = 10,000100 thousand = 100,000million = 1,000,000 Good Luck and keep working at it!

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s funny, I know the answer, but I\u2019ve forgotten the reasoning behind it. 1.2 expressed as a fraction is 1 and 2/10. The number 1.2 million, however, simply means the number given, 1.2, multiplied by 1 million. One million is expressed as 1,000,000 as a number. It literally means 1 X 10 to the 6th power. So, we multiply 1.2 x 1,000,000 to get 1,200,000. Notice that you don\u2019t have six zeroes, but five, since the 2 occupies the hundred-thousand place. The shorthand way to do this is to simply move the decimal space the number of zeroes (or number spaces) according to the base ten value you are looking for. So, for instance, 6.4 thousand would be expressed as 6.4 X 1000, or 6.4 X (1 X 10 to the third power). This means moving the decimal three spaces, since we\u2019re dealing with a thousand. ",
