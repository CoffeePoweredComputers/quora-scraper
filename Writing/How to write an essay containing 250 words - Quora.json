            "answer_text": "One word at a time. Seriously, 250 words is pretty short, but here\u2019s the general formula: Write a paragraph introducing your essay. The last sentence should be what your essay aims to show. We call that the \u201cthesis statement\u201d. The rest of that intro should start general and get more and more specific, leading into the thesis. Write two or three paragraphs that support your thesis. Each sentence should contain either a supporting fact, or an interpretation that makes a fact (or facts) appear to support your thesis. Make each paragraph link in some way to the previous one and the next one. Now you\u2019ve provided evidence for your thesis. Write a concluding paragraph saying so. If you have words still available, say why the thesis is important in the greater scheme of things. Done. ",
