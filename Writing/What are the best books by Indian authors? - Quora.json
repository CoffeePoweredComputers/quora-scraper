            "answer_text": "1. White Tiger Arvind Adiga\u2019s debut novel White Tiger was widely acclaimed for its refreshing take on contradictions and social disparities in contemporary India based on class. The book is a thrilling narrative told from the perspective of Balram Halwai, a young man from a poverty-stricken remote village who moves to the capital to work as a chauffeur for the rich. Adiga won The Man Booker prize for this work and that too on his debut novel. 2. The Great Indian Novel This satirical novel by Shashi Tharoor recreates the Hindu epic Mahabharata within the context of the Indian Independence Movement and its following decades to become one of the most exciting reads in contemporary Indian literature. Recasting figures from India\u2019s freedom struggle and politics as mythological characters from a 2,000-year-old epic, his work is a powerful read regardless of how familiar you are with the country. 3. Train to Pakistan This historical Indian book by Khushwant Singh was widely revered during its release in 1956 for bringing a human perspective to the partition of British India into India and Pakistan. While most accounts of the partition at the time primarily focused on political aspects, Singh recounted the event in terms of human loss and horror. It is the summer of 1947. But Partition does not mean much to the Sikhs and Muslims of Mano Majra, a village on the border of India and Pakistan. Then, a local money-lender is murdered, and suspicion falls upon Juggut Singh, the village gangster who is in love with a Muslim girl. When a train arrives, carrying the bodies of dead Sikhs, the village is transformed into a battlefield, and neither the magistrate nor the police are able to stem the rising tide of violence. Amidst conflicting loyalties, it is left to Juggut Singh to redeem himself and reclaim peace for his village. First published in 1956, Train to Pakistan is a classic of modern Indian fiction. 4.The Guide R.K. Narayan is among the most read and celebrated authors in Indian books and literature. Based in the famous fictional town of Malgudi in South India, it follows the story of a Railway Raju, a corrupt tour guide, and the odd sequence of events which go on to make him a spiritual guide and eventually a revered holy man in the country. 5. God of small things Arundhati Roy\u2019s debut novel is a modern classic that has been read and loved worldwide. Equal parts powerful family saga, forbidden love story, and piercing political drama, it is the story of an affluent Indian family forever changed by one fateful day in 1969. The seven-year-old twins Estha and Rahel see their world shaken irrevokably by the arrival of their beautiful young cousin, Sophie. It is an event that will lead to an illicit liaison and tragedies accidental and intentional, exposing \u201cbig things [that] lurk unsaid\u201d in a country drifting dangerously toward unrest. 6.A Suitable Boy Vikram Seth\u2019s acclaimed work follows the story of four families in newly independent and post-partition India. Primarily revolving around the journey of Mrs. Rupa Mehra to find \u2018a suitable boy\u2019 to marry her daughter, the book meditates on a range of issues from post-partition politics, Hindu-Muslim strife, caste and class tensions, and changing family relationships. At 1,349 pages, Seth\u2019s work is among the longest English language Indian books ever published in a single volume. ",

            "answer_text": "Some of my personal favorite books authored by Indian authors: 1. A Fine Balance: this is one of the most heart wrenching stories ever and extremely well written by Rohinton Mistry. 2. Shalimar the Clown: written by Salman Rushdie, paints a poignant picture of the Paradise that was Kashmir and its subsequent fall from grace, as it parallels the lives of Shalimar and Boonyi's idyllic love and their descent into madness and revenge. 3. The God of Small Things: Arundhati Roy is a master of prose and her beautiful descriptions and the images she conjures are brilliant. 4. Family Matters: Another masterpiece from Rohinton Mistry as he walks us through the everyday travails of a Parsi family as it struggles to live while caring for the family patriarch. 5. The Great Indian Novel: A masterpiece by Shashi Tharoor that casts the Indian freedom struggle leaders and the post-independence politicians in the landscape of the Mahabharata. The re-telling is incisive and humorous and there is never a dull moment. 6. Midnight's Children: Salman Rushdie broke into the big league with his novel that told of story of India's journey as a free nation in parallel to one of its citizens born at the stroke of midnight as India was born. 7. Palace of Illusions: a re-telling of the Mahabharata from the perspective of Draupadi, the Pandava Queen. 8. The Chronicles of a Corpse Bearer: A heart-rending tale of the corpse bearers of Parsis in Bombay 9. The Guide: R.K. Narayan's masterpiece is a work for all ages and is unparalleled in its simplicity of prose and complexity of emotions. 10. Unaccustomed Earth: Jhumpa Lahiri is one of the best writers with her sense of nostalgia and melancholy that is reflected through her works. Unaccustomed Earth is a story that stays with you long after you've finished reading it. ",

            "answer_text": "So many good ones, its really hard to narrow down to just three!!! But here's what I have :- 1. The Namesake.   This is my absolute favorite. People have complained about it being too slow. Well, it is slow, but that is the beauty of it. It spans the life of a character, so true, so plausible. You actually grow up with him through the book. What I like most about the book is that the hero is flawed, imperfect. So many books frame the heroes as impeccable and having an unblemished life. \"The Namesake\", on the other hand, remains connected to reality throughout. You see the mistakes that the protagonist is making, but you also kinda understand why he's making it. And you love and loathe him for it. Also the beautiful writing of Jhumpa Lahiri doesn't hurt. 2. The Room on the Roof   I have been a big fan of Ruskin Bond ever since I read \"The Tunnel\" in the 4th grade. In most of his works, there is not a lot of plot. You have a sensation of the story not being written as much as writing itself. Sometimes when I read fiction, I have an expectation of what's going to come ahead. I am usually most happy when some unexpected twist proves me wrong (borne out of reading so many thrillers and mysteries). But with Ruskin Bond, I have felt that he doesn't write to trump his readers. He somehow walks together with the reader and what comes along is as much a discovery for him as much as it is to us. Also his usually detached delivery of the scene cooks up feelings in me that somehow are mine and not what he pointed I should feel. 3. I shall not hear the Nightingale   There is a lot of very good literature (both fiction and non-fiction) about the pre-1947 times in India. They speak about heroic tales of freedom-fighters, what they and their family had to sacrifice for the country. This particular work is different. The act of bravery in here comes from a character you least expect it from. You learn that being brave doesn't mean you have to be exceptionally charismatic, educated or even have everything figured out. You just have to a certain sense of what is right, and what is wrong. Everybody around you, people more intelligent, more \"sophisticated\" say things that are reasonable and the-best-thing-to-do-for-everyone in the picture. But that doesn't make a wrong thing right. You can't help but gasp for breath with admiration for the courage shown by this person. Other honourable mentions:  \"A Village by the Sea\" by Anita Desai\"The White Tiger\" by Arvind Adiga\"Untouchable\" by Mulk Raj Anand\"Q & A\" by Vikas Swarup (I know but its pacy and I like it) ",

            "answer_text": "In a sea of books, it\u2019s hard to dole out suggestions that which ones are the best because there are so many. But when it comes to this, I\u2019ve noticed that the Indian authors are mentioned less as compared to the foreign ones. So thank you for asking, below are mention of some great Indian authors and there must read. Cherished their writing and the content. Vikram Seth (Book : A Suitable Boy) Vikram Seth (born 20 June 1952) is an Indian novelist and poet. He has written several novels and poetry books. He has received several awards including Padma Shri, Sahitya Akademi Award, Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, WH Smith Literary Award and Crossword Book Award. Seth's collections of poetry such as Mappings and Beastly Tales are notable contributions to the Indian English language poetry canon.  A Suitable Boy (Review) : This is a story of ordinary people set in post- independence Indian background, who are looking for a suitable boy for Lata\u2019s marriage. Lata is 19 and she believes in falling in love first. There\u2019s not only the pursuit of marriage and happiness but heartache and disappointment, which is universal. Throughout its sprawling 1474 pages, there was no emotion left unexplored and no character left misunderstood. Ruskin Bond (Book : The Blue Umbrella) The Blue Umbrella (Review) : It is set in the hills of Garhwal and captures the life of villagers who portray heroic characters. Basically, it captures the life in a village.  Ruskin Bond (born 19 May 1934) is an Indian author of British descent. He lives with his adopted family in Landour, in Mussoorie, India. The Indian Council for Child Education has recognized his role in the growth of children's literature in India. He got the Sahitya Academy Award in 1992 for Our Trees Still Grow in Dehra, for his published work in English. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1999 and Padma Bhushan in 2014. Upamanyu Chatterjee (Book : English, August: An Indian Story) English, August: An Indian Story (Review) : If you have been to any government office or if you\u2019re working there, then this book is a must read. Upamanyu Chatterjee has presented how things work in an Indian office and it\u2019s refreshingly funny. The story revolves around Agastya Sen and how his life changes when he goes to Madna, a small town. The author has also drawn heavily from his own experience in the Indian administrative service to paint a picture of rural India.  Upamanyu Chatterjee (born 1959) is an Indian civil servant who currently serves as Joint Secretary to Government of India on the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board. He is a 1983 batch Indian Administrative Service officer from Maharashtra Cadre. Arundhati Roy (Book : The God of Small Things) The God of Small Things ( Review) : Roy\u2019s debut novel is a masterpiece. The book pivots around tragedy and hope. The book also explores the full range of human emotion.  Suzanna Arundhati Roy (born 24 November 1961) is an Indian author who is best known for her novel The God of Small Things (1997), which won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1997. This novel became the biggest-selling book by a nonexpatriate Indian author. She is also a political activist involved in human rights and environmental causes. Kiran Desai (Book : The Inheritance of Loss) The Inheritance Of Loss (Review) :Despite the humor and wittiness encompassing it, The Inheritance of Loss remains a powerful book written with sheer honesty. The inner struggles of the characters could not be conveyed any better. Desai has the capacity to place the exact words on the most abstract feelings! The book is unflinchingly honest. My favorite quote from this book is: \u201dSadness was so claustrophobic\u2019.\u201d  Kiran Desai is the daughter of Anita Desai, herself short-listed for the Booker Prize on three occasions. She was born in Chandigarh on the 3rd of September, and spent the early years of her life in Pune and Mumbai. She studied in the Cathedral and John Connon School. She left India at 14, and she and her mother then lived in England for a year, and then moved to the United States, where she studied creative writing at Bennington College, Hollins University, and Columbia University. Aravind Adiga (Book : The White Tiger) The White Tiger (Review) : The novel examines issues of religion, caste, loyalty, corruption and poverty in India. The story revolves around Balram, who worked his way out from his low social caste and how he became successful and how he overcame all the social obstacles.  Aravind Adiga (born 23 October 1974) is an Indian-Australian writer and journalist. His debut novel, The White Tiger, won the 2008 Man Booker Prize. Shashi Tharoor (Book : The Great Indian Novel) The Great Indian Novel (Review) : In this novel, Tharoor has masterfully recast the Mahabharata. He has compared the political figures of India with the characters of the Mahabharat. It\u2019s basically a retelling of the Indian epic, but it falls in the realm of political satire by drawing parallels with major events in India\u2019s political history during the freedom movement and the post-independence era. (Although a controversial figure!)  Shashi Tharoor (born 9 March 1956) is an Indian politician and a former diplomat who is currently serving as Member of Parliament of India (from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala since 2009). He also currently serves as Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs. Tharoor is a globally recognised speaker too, on India's economics and politics, as well as on freedom of the press, human rights, Indian culture, and international affairs.

            "answer_text": "\"Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal\" (Some People at Some times) written by Jayakanthan. Previously named as \"Kalangal Maarum\"(Times change).    Ganga, a college student from a Tamil Brahmin family, has a sexual encounter with a stranger who offers her lift on a rainy day. Ganga is uncertain about her participation in the event. She, overcome by guilt and self-loathing, construes the event as rape. She confessed to her mother about what happened earlier. Overhearing this, Ganga's brother, who's the 'bread' winner of the family, disowns and evicts her from the house. She then moves in with her uncle\u2014mother's elder brother in Madras\u2014who assures full support in continuing her education. After successful graduation she gets employed in a private firm and grows to take the top managerial position. Ganga until then lives a life with her mother resisting the pressure to lie about the 'incident' (which, presumably, would ruin her life with another man). Her assumed status as a 'spoilt' woman also implicitly encourages her lecherous uncle to make sexual advances. It is during this time she chances up on the 'stranger', Prabhu. (Prabhu is a rich man living with his wife and her daughter but leading an unhappy life because of misunderstanding with his wife as he is irresponsible both as a father and as a husband). Ganga musters up the courage to introduce herself as who 'she really is' and get Prabhu to discuss about 'that' fateful evening. She then realizes that she probably showed as much interest in the sex as did Prabhu. The revelation brings Ganga closer to Prabhu as friends. They find their characteristics agreeable and the friendship matures into love. But unable to transcend the society's norms, Prabhu advices her to get married to someone else. When all attempts to convince Prabhu fails, Ganga is forced to part ways with him. Feeling bad of this, Ganga's character changed arrogant completely.  P.S : The novel got Sahithya Academy award. The novel later adapted to a movie with same name, getting a huge positive response, it became the first Tamil film to feature Best Female Actor winning Performance, won by Lakshmi for her portrayal of the lead character Ganga.  Ezham Ulagam (Seventh World) - Jayamohan.  The novel about the unknown dark life of Handicapped Beggars. The novel talks about their life, happiness, celebrations, pains, love. The author created each characters with special care.  The agent who takes care of these people dont even consider them as persons. He just mention them as \"Uruppadigal\"(items).   photo courtesy : Gowtham Ramnath But these people forgetting all their sorrows, living as a joint family and live in their separate world.  We need to cross many painful pages in this novel. For the libido of a policemen, young lady is sent to him. A new-born child has been put on mid-day sun so that the people get mercy and give money. The handicapped people whom they think no more useful are handed-over to some other agents for money. The climax of the novel had a very deep impact in my heart. During the course of the story, the lady named Muthammai was forced to have sexual relationship with physically challenged persons to give birth to physically challenged children. She was forced to do this many times. In the end, she was again forced to have a sex with a drunken handicapped guy. While he touches her, she saw his hand and started shouting \"OTTRAI VIRAL, OTTRAI VIRAL\"(one finger, one finger). He was one of her handicapped children who were separated from him and she realized it. Muthammai was in a condition to have sex with his own son to give away a handicapped child. The novel ends with this. P.S : This story is adapted to a movie \"NAAN KADAVUL\" by Director Bala which earns him a National Award. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many. But recently released is this book. Men are from Earth, Women are from Earth - A New Scripture for Men and Women. The books speaks about Men and Women relationship. Gender conditioning since centuries. A very heavy topic has been written in a very simple and light manner. Balancing between the old psychology and new degrading psychology.  Today\u2019s mankind is a product of the culture of thousands of years. From the time we are born, we are socialized into playing traditional gender roles. Certain differences between the sexes are natural while the others are cultural and social (manmade). Be it any relationship, there are men and women involved. The kind of relationship we share with the same or opposite gender stems from our very first relationship with that gender, that is, with a mother and a father. And this is what the book deals with. Delving into the dynamics of these relationships, it brings forth a new definition of what it means to be a man or a woman through the characters Rhea, Siddhartha and Rohan. Here\u2019s a paragraph from the book: After listening to Rhea\u2019s case-studies and talks, his life events kept flashing before him; he felt deep pain and anger that he had numbed long ago. She had spoken on the lines of, \u2018Why do so many men have the impulse to disrespect, hate or violate women? Where does that really come from? And how do we stop it? To understand misogyny, we have to explore the first relationship a man ever has with a woman\u2014with his mother.\u2019 Book: Men are from Earth Women are from Earth - A New Scripture for Men and Women. Another Paragraph: Raina had just finished his coaching with me at that time. He kept apologizing for this indecent behavior and asked me not to leave the party. He instead asked his security guard to throw out that director-producer. He lost his movie as well. What these sexual predators don\u2019t understand is they are saying loud and clear to the whole world that \u2018their self-esteem is very low, they need a proof of their manhood by such acts, and they need a therapist. It also speaks about their first relationship with the female gender\u2014their mother and also about the kind of relationship his mother and father had\u2019. Not just them. Even the people who speak in a language like \u2018I just check out her moves, and body parts, the way they speak about having sex, etc.\u2019 There is so much disrespect to that woman. Now the man who himself has low self-esteem, how will he think of someone else\u2019s esteem? You hear them a lot on TV shows, chat shows and interviews, read on the internet and newspapers, but I also hear them in my clinic.

            "answer_text": "The question being too broad in scope, I would restrict myself to Indian Writing in English (IWE). But before doing that, I'd tell you what excites me most about IWE. It's when the authors try to express an Indian essence through an alien language, and in the way constructs an altogether different narrative style. On this line, let me tell you some of the best works in English by Indian authors. 1. A Fine Balance - Rohinton Mistry This book is 'The Best Book' I've read so far; and trust me, I've read a lot. If you want to read a book that is unputdownable, depressing, hopeful, charming and sad at the same time, go for it. You will cry, you will laugh, you'll want to pull out the characters and kill them, you'll feel the pain and you'll gasp with pleasure.    2. The Calcutta Chromosome - Amitav Ghosh While I was going through the pre-climax portions of it, my mom had to literally yell at me to make me have my dinner. Yes, this is enchanting. A historical sci-fi horror story about the adventures of a maniac in search of 'The Calcutta Chromosome' via the research done by Sir Ronald Ross on Malaria... Aah! Still not a complete description. And there are, I guess, 4 timelines running throughout. And I had a nightmare about one of the scenes - the scariest I've ever read.  3. Haroun and the Sea of Stories - Salman Rushdie Yes, I've read his Midnight's Children. And no, it's not in the list. It's a novel that Rushdie wrote for his son. It's children's fiction at its best. And yet, it is as much for adults as it is for children. Interesting names, inetersting plot, interesting narrative and a magical world. If you miss your grandpa's and grandma's stories that they told you with so much vigour when you were a kid, go for it. It may not be as good as those stories not because it is bad but because grandparents' stories were and will always be The Best!   4. Untouchable - Mulk Raj Anand This book will make you cringe with fear and disgust through its depiction of the atrocities that were faced by 'Untouchables'. Set in the pre-independence era, it tells you the horror that was an untouchable's life. And what a master-stroke of a climax. Read it to believe it!   5. Family Matters - Rohinton Mistry Rohinton Mistry makes a comeback with his heart-wrenching tale of a Parsi family. Though not as depressing as A Fine Balance, it'll make you cry your heart out at the miseries of the characters. The central character of Nareeman Vakil will stay with you for many years, and possibly forever!    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Those which almost made it to the list -             ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to add a few books as separate comments with the book's Name, Author and a brief description of the plot. Delhi - Khushwant Singh Singh blends facts and fiction in this glamoured story telling of Delhi's birth from its ancient cities. You'll read accounts set in your favorite city, some true, others exaggerated, all in all, making for a guilty pleasure read that's hard to put down. Ofcourse , Singh adds his own flavors to add to the narrative. Midnight\u2019s Children - Salman Rushdie This is a difficult book, no doubts about it. Rushdie is a powerful writer when it comes to magical realism. His prose is dense, and sometimes it will feel like you\u2019re navigating a thick forest of words. This book is not for everyone, but if you want to read India\u2019s best novels to the world, Rushdie will not be ignored A Fine Balance - Rohiton Mistry One of our most talented writers weaves a story of 4 unlikely friends: a housewife learning to be independent, a Muslim Dalit tailor and his nephew and a paying guest who doesn\u2019t know what to do with his life. This story is set in the emergency-era in India, and it has won several awards. Don\u2019t miss this treasure The Lives of Others - Neel Mukherjee Fat novel about a Bengali joint family where all family members react differently to their son becoming a Naxalite The Hungry Tide - Amitav Ghosh An excellent first book to read and you will be hooked from the first chapter. This is the story of a marine biologist exploring the wetlands of the Sundarbans area while living with a local family Barrister Parvatisam - (Telugu) - Mokkapati Narasimha Sastry Fantastic and humorous novel. I don't know if it has translations and if they are good. But goddamn this is one of the gems. The Discovery of India - Jawaharlal Nehru Love him, hate him, Nehruji writes quite beautifully the story of India from the Indus River Valley Civilization to the modern age dilemma of imperialism and the world wars. The Discovery of India builds a narrative of India\u2019s development as a cultural entity and as a diverse group of people and religions throughout the ages. The book shows the sheer amount of research and work that went into it. Nehru writes like a well versed scholar of Indian History and crafts quite a story to show how far we\u2019ve come and where we\u2019ve yet to go. It remains rather apolitical when speaking purely about Indian history but of course you\u2019ll see that nationalistic and anti imperialistic slant, not exactly a bad thing because Nehru tries to remain fair to history. It\u2019s quite a good book. Highly recommend a read even if you dislike Nehru because it\u2019s a book that all Indians can enjoy. The God of Small Things - Arundhati Roy (I know you've already called out Roy in the OP, but nominating Utmost Happiness and not tGoST is criminal IMO) The historical fiction trilogy of Sei Somoy (Those Days), Prothom Alo (First Light) and Purbo-Paschim (East and West) are absolutely incredible pieces of work by Sunil Ganguly. Gaban, Godan, Karmbhumi and Shatranj Ke Khiladi by Munshi Premchand. Rebati, Dhulia Baba and Cha Mana Atha Guntha by Fakir Mohan Senapati. The Demon Seed and Kalaam by MT Vasudevan Nair Gitanjali, Gora, Gara Baire by Tagore. English, August by Upamanyu Chatterjee A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry Em and The Big Hoom by Jerry Pinto Our Moon Has Blood Clots by Rahul Pandita Discovery of India by Pt. Nehru Train to Pakistan and Cuckold by Khuswant Singh. The Shadow Lines by Amitav Ghosh A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth - amazing piece of historical fiction. Even though a very thick book, it's really well written researched and written. I love how his portrayal of different facets of post-independence India. I seriously recommend it. Maximum City - Suketu Mehta Eminently well researched, enjoyable, honest and no holds barred non fiction about Mumbai. The Way Things Were - Aatish Taseer Story about a father\u2019s death and his son rediscovering this family\u2019s life before his birth. This novel spans many decades and explores how India has changed since the Age of the Maharaajaas. The Lowlands - Jhumpa Lahiri The story of what happens when a passionate man gets killed for his political activities and his brother is left cleaning up the mess of their personal lives The Ministry of Utmost Happiness - Arundhati Roy Imagine The God of Small Things but better and more relevant, this is a fat, hard to read book, so you might want to save it for later One part woman - Perumal Murugan An important read because it highlights the complexity of traditional practices in rural India, which stirred controversies and protests All I can think of from the top of my head! of course, Malgudi Days, Guide and other stories from RK Narayan, almost everything Ruskin Bond has written (Shout out to Blue Umbrella), Feluda by Satyajit Ray need to be there in that list. Just can't choose one! ",

            "answer_text": "There are some Indian authors who have changed the art of story-telling in the Indian literary landscape: Some of my favorites Indian books are the following:1) The Calcutta Chromosome by Amitav Ghosh.  The book has been awarded the Arthur C Clarke award for best science-fiction novel in 1997.The story is a heady cocktail of fact, fiction, science and mystical practices. It mixes some Hindu beliefs and modern-day scientific concepts and the story once you are into it is \"UNPUTDOWNABLE\". It is one of those books which does not give you all the clues and you need to think and I mean think hard to know what exactly happened in the end! 2) Train to Pakistan by Khuswant Singh  This is one of those books which is read widely and heavily quoted from even 57 years after it was first published.  The book depicts the partition riots between India and Pakistan in 1947 from a local foci of a village. It shows the realistic face of hardships faced by both communities, the local administrative authorities, an alien Samaritan with a backdrop of a torn love story. It paints raw human emotions at its finest. The book is still popular among literary circles because the story is applicable to even present-day situations 3. A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth  Firstly, one should read this book only when he/she is confident of reading a 1000+ pages book. A Suitable Boy is one of the longest books written in a single volume as it is 1349 pages in length. But, once you get into the groove of this book, it is a book which has myriad shades amalgamated into one. The book is a story of four families over a period of 18 months as a mother searches for a suitable boy to marry her daughter. The book is set in post-independence India and deals with issues like strife between Hindu and Muslims, abolition of the Zamindari system, land reforms and empowerment of Muslim women. It is a mammoth masterpiece and has won the Best Book, Commonwealth Writers Prize in 1994. 4. God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy  The debut book by Arundhati Roy won the booker prize in 1997. The book deals experiences of fraternal twins who are always preached the \"Laws of Love\" which proclaims \"who should be loved, and how. And how much\". The book's title aptly describes the story and tells the readers that sometimes though the big things are not in our hands; we can always take care of the small things.  After reading this novel, I hoped Arundhati Roy to write more because this is the only novel she has written till date.  5. Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri   Now, this is not a novel but Jhumpa Lahiri's debut work is one of those books which you cherish reading. It is a book collection of exactly nine short stories detailing lives of Indians and Indian Americans who are caught between their inherited culture and   the modern-day world. The book won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2000. The book mainly deals with relationships of different nature and different perspectives of people in the same situations. I have tried to paint the picture of Indian literary works in a diverse way here and hence have included these diverse out-of-the box books. There are many more books by Indian authors which are worth the attention, but these 5 from my reading experience are must-read novels. ",

            "answer_text": "Cuckold by Kiran Nagarkar Well\u2026.don\u2019t be fooled by its name..it may give you a giggle but the novel is more than that. Today, when most of the popular Indian historical fiction is retelling of mythological stories, this one is for those who have a different taste. Usually i\u2019d avoid Indian novels because i am more into fantasy and fiction, and most of the good Indian novels tend to deal with serious topics or romance or social problems. However, one day I came across this novel. And it\u2019s amazing. It was published in 1997 and won sahitya academy award in 2000. The novel is set in medieval India specifically in Rajputana era. The book tells the story of a turmoil in the mindset of ruling class. It\u2019s not a boring novel. It\u2019s detailed and illustrative and brilliant. Plot covers warfare, politics, internal ruling class problems and many more. And there is more to it that i wouldn\u2019t describe for fear of giving away spoilers. Just trust me on this if you are into historical fiction and want a masterpiece, this is it. Read it. And if you still have any doubt, read the reviews on various shopping sites to get the idea. Its got a sahitya academy award. They don\u2019t give that away for no reason, ",

            "answer_text": "Gachar Gochar by Vivek Shanbag and I just posted this review on Good Reads: Last night I was feeling unusually wakeful and active. Yet I did not want to get up and sit at the computer (something which I usually do). I remembered Jean Spraker\u2019s brilliant review of \u201cGachar Gochar) and immediately ordered it on Amazon.   Now, that was not a very smart thing to do. I should have ordered some feel good chicklit or picked up one of my old, well thumbed chicken soup series. Gachar Gochar made me feel caffeinated in a disturbing chaotic manner.  Now about the book.   Vivek Shanbag tells a poignant tale. He makes you listen to his story. He makes you listen to the mess in every character\u2019s head. You are drawn into the mad tangle of their being. You become a part of the constant din. As a writer, whose primary modality is auditory, this aspect enthralled me. Gachar Gochar is the story of a family(a joint one if you may call) who find their fortunes reversed. They move from their dingy ant infested house to a palatial house and overnight, the dynamics change. From a family who spends a sleepless night trying to tally the father\u2019s account book, they now become satellites round Chikappa and expend their energies to make him feel safe and protected deleting themselves in the process. I loved how the nameless narrator makes highly unsuccessful attempts to erase his loneliness through his conversations with Vincent\u2014the waiter from India Coffee House. Other Characters Chitra and Anita: Their vulnerability and intensity evoked a sense of loss within me. Their mess became mine. I loved them. Appa: From a man who once ruled a kingdom to a man who now laughs at his own jokes, this character moved me like no other. Amma: I wept for this woman. Chikappa: The king of the jungle who would go to any lengths to keep himself and his tribe safe. My favourite scene is the one where the protagonist (or the nameless narrator) buries his head in his wife\u2019s wardrobe after her departure to her parent\u2019s place. No I won\u2019t go into the intricacies. You have to read it and connect with it. The end is stunning. But so is the entire book.  A brilliant five stars to this book for keeping me awake throughout the night. ",

Beautiful, lyrical and evocative, Amitav Ghosh excels with this book. And it isn't even one of his more popular books. 2) The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy - (enough praises have been sung for this book in the many answers for this question but I cannot deny that this is one of my most favorite Indian author books ever. And it figures in my most favorite books list as well). 3) The Inner Courtyard, stories by Indian women(edited by Lakshmi Holmstrom) - Every story is unique and compelling.     4) Em and the Big Hoom by Jerry Pinto. 5) Swami and Friends by R.K. Narayan(I spent most of my childhood re-reading this).     6) The Guide.      7) The Inscrutable Americans by Anurag Mathur(a hoot and a half!)     8) The Moor's last sigh - Salman Rushdie.    ",

            "answer_text": "You may try following books written by Indian Writers: 1. The White Tiger by Arvind Adiga It is a social commentary on the effects of the huge gap between the wealthy and the poor in India. This large gap creates instability that often leads to morality being compromised for individual gain. The poor are so desperate that they are willing to do almost anything to make it out of poverty. At the same time, the rich are so far removed from the plight of the poor that they become desensitized and corrupt. The point of view from which the story is told, the use of humor, the patterns of imagery, and the end of the novel emphasize the disparity in wealth and the immorality that results. 2. Everybody Loves a Good Draught by P. Sainath. This book is acclaimed across the world and prescribed in over 100 universities and colleges. Everybody Loves a Good Drought is the established classic on rural poverty in India. Twenty years after publication, it remains unsurpassed in the scope and depth of reportage, providing an intimate view of the daily struggles of the poor and the efforts, often ludicrous, made to uplift them. 3. Wise and Otherwise by Sudha Murthy It is a collection of fifty vignettes of the real-life incidents of Murthy, which left a profound impression on her, both in good and bad ways. After reading this book, the readers will find a new way to look at life and people. This book will make them realize how small incidents can be a window of opportunity to understand myriad nature of human beings along with their virtues and vices. At the same time, a reader can realize how each moment and the small incidents in our life can be so inspiring and enriching if we give them our attention and thought just like the writer did. 4. Wings of Fire by A. P. J. Abdul Kalam It is an autobiographical novel that tells the readers a story about unlocking their inner potential. Kalam does a great deal to throw light on his journey to igniting the fire within himself. This book is divided into seven parts, and begins with an Introduction and Preface. This is then followed by an Orientation, which contains a quote from the Atharva Veda. After that, the readers are also enlightened on the incidents that made Kalam what he is today. 5. Ignited Minds by A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Ignited Minds is a book by Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, the former President of India. In this book Dr. Kalam talks about his dream of developed India. The title of the book comes with a tag-line, \u201cUnleashing the power within India\u201d. The strength of this book by Dr. Kalam is that it has been written in an easy to understand language, where he presents some of the most difficult issues our country is facing today in a very simple way. The book has been divided into nine short chapters, each one of them dealing with various themes. Each chapter begins with a quote and ends with a summary giving the reader something to think about. 6. Train to Pakistan This historical Indian book by Khushwant Singh was widely revered during its release in 1956 for bringing a human perspective to the partition of British India into India and Pakistan. While most accounts of the partition at the time primarily focused on political aspects, Singh recounted the event in terms of human loss and horror. Train to Pakistan is an essential read for anyone looking to explore Indian literature or history. 7. The Guide The Guide follows the story of a Railway Raju, a corrupt tour guide, and the odd sequence of events which go on to make him a spiritual guide and eventually a revered holy man in the country. 8. India Grows At Night: A Liberal Case for a Strong State by Gurcharan Das 9. The Difficulty Of Being Good by Gurcharan Das Apart from the above, if someone is interested in books written by Indian Author in Hindi Language, then following are some of the gems of Hindi Literature: 1. Godan by Premchand. 2. Raag Darbaari by Shreelal Shukla. 3. Tamas by Bhism Sahni. 4. Gunahon ka Devtaa by Dharamveer Bharti. 5. Kitne Pakistan by Kamleswar. 6. Mahabhoj by Mannu Bhandaari. 7.

We can definitely find many  Anupamas, Anands and Radha akka in our Indian Society. It is a must read for every  young girl and boy before they turn 20. It is an evergreen epic  by Sudha Murthy. Hats off to her boldness and courage to create such realistic portrayals of each character of the novel2)One Night at the Call Center beautifully brought the problems faced by the youngsters of our modern India to lime light. Especially the conversation between God and the Call center employees, towards the end, was completely inspiring. I still read that chapter again and again whenever I feel down or dejected due to something in my life.3)The Old Man and his god helped me to understand the real values of various things in life. It reminds me that there is still humanity and kindness left in the place where I live. I am not sure if the old man and his wife who are portrayed in the story are still living to hear these words. But dear old man, I salute you from the bottom of my heart. Your words, made me realize what I want and what I do not want from life. 4)This Trilogy, setting apart the action packed way in which  Amish had narrated it and the various twists and suspense it had in store throughout the three books. I felt there were few most beautiful characters which were carved by Amish. My top favorite ones were Sati, Shiva, Parvateshwar and especially the old man who appeared in the second book (I am not sure whether it is second or third) at Ayodhya. He shared his little food with Shiva. There was self respect and kindness in his attitude. Though his role lasted only a page in the book, I felt, it showed me how to treat elders, when they grew older. That old man is my third favorite after Sati and Shiva.I cannot forget Sati, who fought till the very last moment with all her power, despite knowing the fact that she might die any moment!. She had the courage to admit her mistakes and at the same time stand up for her people till her last breathe!.5)Blue Umbrella is a must read for everyone on this earth. I will not disclose any more about it. Read it for yourself and find it. 5) I am not qualified enough to review this masterpiece of this uncrowned Fiction King of my motherland. We will always miss u sir!. Please buy this book if you have not and read it. Trust me, you will definitely have the most wonderful experience to last a life time. P.S: I am yet to read many other books by Indian authors. I shall further update it once I manage to read others. ",

While most accounts of the partition at the time primarily focused on political aspects, Singh recounted the event in terms of human loss and horror. 4.The Coin by Sandeep Sharma  Who likes Sudden death?\u201d That's the only question he used to ask before killing his prey. Random people are being abducted from the capital city, Delhi and are being killed mercilessly. Before killing, the murderer is reciting them a story, a story about a 9-year-old child who saw the brutal side of the world at a very young age. All the stories are being recorded for the Police department to see. Raunak Upadhyay, the Police inspector who is handling the case, links the style of serial killing to the case he solved years ago. But the murderer of that case is in jail then who is following the footsteps? Does the murderer want to convey something? Whose story is being recited? Why is the murderer taking personal interest in Raunak? Is there any other side of this coin or both the faces are just the same? Welcome to the Brutal world! Less PS.

            "answer_text": "I am deliberately including these books of spirituality as I think most of the Quora writers have been dealing the average Indian authors\u2019 books. The writers I am going to mention are the pillars of indian spiritual wisdom. Each and every youth should go through these books. These books will be your life companions if you go through them with a loveable heart. The Complete Works of Swami Vivekanand. This book must- read for a youth who wishes to peep into indian spirituality.  The next book is Bestseller spiritual book by Praamhans Yogananda, the Kriya yoga master. Nearly each seeker of indian knowledge reads this great book.  Here is the life and philosophy of Brahmarshi Devaraha Baba. This well written book gives a detailed account of Babaji's life and teachings.  Swami Ramtirtha was a great poet also. One may read lovely prose and equally lovely poetry in this book. His works are the heritage of Indian ancient wisdom.  Sri Aurobindo's The Life Divine is a difficult book but whatever I could read and understand is that book is as priceless as any book of the world.  Swami Abedananda was another great disciple of Ramakrishna Paramhana. His philosophical notions are deeper than even Swami Vivekanands. He is one of the first men who inquired about Lord Jesus in India.  Meher Baba's God Speaks is as difficult as the Life Divine but at few places Baba ji has written so well that he may be counted among the best Indian saint authors.  Prof. N. Kasturi is known for his biography of Satya Sai Baba. But this book is about his communion with Babaji. This book is written in exquisite English. One may develop one's writing skill after reading this.  Narahari: Prophet of New India is a novel by one of the greatest Indian English poet, critic and novelist. The book was written under the tutelage of Sri Satya Sai Baba. A great book by a great author.  Osho spoke two books when he was in silence from public. This book saw the light of the day when he was with his close disciples. This is a lovely book of a spiritual master of our time.  Krishnamurti is one of the wisest seekers of our time. He has written so many books. But this book has fascinated me to the bone. The book is also liked by Osho who was his adversary. The foreword of this also well written by Alduos Huxley.  Those who have read Autobiography of a Yogi should read this book. They will come to realize how great and deep this saint was.  Swami Rama's Living With Himalayan Masters is his account of his days in the Himalayan Yogis. The book has also a pic of Jesus\u2019 tomb in Kashmir.  The present book 'Autobiography of a Sufi' is an account of the life of Mahatma Ramchandraji of Fatehgarh (Janab Laalaaji Maharaj). He is known as the first Sufi saint from the Hindu religion, who is fully authorized to train others and in turn to authorize them to do so in accordance with the Naqshbandi Sufi tradition. Autobiography of Sufi is a book about the life founder of Ramchandra ji of Shahjahanpur.  The Hearfulness Way is another book of Ramchandra Mission. I should pay my humble thanks to shri Deepak Tyagi ji for such a lovely book. The book will change your life if you read this carefully. I will write about this book in detail later.  Shri Ram Shrma Acharya ji is one of the great saints of previous century. He has written more than hundred books. Each and every book by him is worth reading but to me this book surpasses all other books. My father and I both were lovers of this book.  Bal Gngadhar Tilak's Gita Rahasya is one of the best books on The Holy Gita. The foreword of this book gives a detailed and thought provoking essay on Indian philosophy. Each and every reader of the Gita should go through this great book.  HH Swami Chinmayananda's commentary is his authoritative study of the celestial songs of the Geeta. One may guess the great and insightful knowledge of HH Swami ji Maharaj. The book is must for the Geeta lovers.  Gita with Purushartha Bodhini Commentary of Satwalekar (Set of 4 Volumes) is also a great commentary on the Gita. A must read book.  Anni Besant has written dozens of books and the book that charmed me is his The Ancient Wisdom. The book tell us about the eternal heritage that we all indian posses but are not aware of.  At the Feet of the Master by J. Krishnamurti was written when he was an adolescent. This is a very small yet very great book.  By His Grace by Dada Mukherjee is an account of Neem Karoli Babaji who is the guru of Sophia Lauren and Steve Jobs. The great book tells us that \u2018We are not following the guru; the guru actually is following us.\u2019  Bhagwan Das was a basically a theosohist. His teachings are basically an examination of the similar truths in the religions of the world. A seeker who wishes to find the underlying unity in all religion should read this great book.  There are many biographies of Shirdi Sai Baba. But this one is read among Baba lovers as book of japa. This is a great book in simple words and style.  Prof. B L Atreya was my maternal grandfather's teacher. This is the best book on Yoga Vashishtha. Each and every spiritual sadhak and youth should read yoga vashishtha because this book is the base of all indian knowledge system.  The Sufi Teachings of Hazrat Inayat Khan Sahab are sprawling in many volumes but the book The Bowl of Saki contains his teachings, wisdom and enlightenment for daily use.  The Gitanjali of Tagore is also an exquisite volume of poetry by noble laureate poet. These divine songs stir and tickle a devoted heart.  Toru Dutt's poetry is deeply drenched in Indian tradition. One can mark out her simplicity and lyrical quality in these poems. A worth reading collection.  Subodh Chandra Sengupta is known for his Shakespearian criticism but this book is written about his fellow teachers friends and his memoirs of youth and career as a teacher. It is a great Autobiography of a great teacher.  I will add more books when they flash through my heart. ",

            "answer_text": "I like Maximum City by Suketu Mehta. This is a non fiction book about Bombay (as it was called at that time). It describes what shaped the city and made it what it is and is also filled with anecdotes and stories of various people who came to Mumbai. There are chapters about the Underworld, the police, builders, politicians, immigrants from Bihar who live on the streets, the people working in dance bars and many more. Mehta is an author who actually lived in Mumbai and met the people whom he talks about in his book. This book has won many awards including the Pulitzer prize in 2005. Another book which I have not yet read but which I will get down to is A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth. That is an acknowledged classic that I think everyone who wishes to understand India needs to go through. I am describing myself when I say that most of the books that I have read in English are by western authors who do not talk about India. As a result for many years I did not do any reading about the country which I lived in. Reading books by Indian authors will be of practical use to you as it will tell you about India and Indians and help you understand them.\\ I look forward to reading the other answers to this question as I enjoy reading and like talking about books. Thanks for the question ",

            "answer_text": "These are the ones which I have read and thoroughly enjoyed. ________________________________________________ 1)The Krishna Key (Ashwin Sanghi)  The author can be called as the Indian Dan Brown. Rich in information and research, the book offers a unique perspective on Indian mythology. Based on this perspective and background, a thrilling story emerges where we are taken through the mysteries and science hidden in the ancient heartland of India. It takes us on a quest to find one of the most priced possessions of none other than Krishna himself. Inspite of the massive storyline and enthralling concepts, the story ends on a note of humbleness. 2) Swami and friends (RK Narayan)  Nothing tells about the innocence of childhood and the fantastic experience of growing up in India before the age of technology took over , better than this book. 3) Waiting for the Mahathma ( RK Narayan)  A fiction, telling the story of a boy, who falls in love with a girl, who is a disciple of Mahatma Gandhi and a freedom fighter. The boy joins the Indian freedom cause just for the girl. He then gets involved in it and makes it the aim of his life.Torn between desires to unite with each other and the fervent desire to fight for their nation, their decisions make way for an interesting read. 4) Shiva Trilogy (Amish Tripathi)  Beautifully written. Each description offered, each philosophy endorsed and each character sketched is worth hundreds of gallons. Deeply rooted in Indian mythology, it offers a unique perspective of Shiva, that of a common man, who rose to the occasion to save his people and country from evil. Depicted as a common man, each of the decision that he takes is under scrutiny and debatable. That is the beauty of these novels. It makes the readers question each philosophy offered for themselves and then understand them. Also offered in these books are wonderful and unique explanations for the concept of avatars,gods and many myths. I have read only the third part of the series.Even then it was an amazing experience. 5) Seven Conversations (Nistha Tripathi )  The book revolves around a person, who has a failed marriage and is afraid of the consequences that she has to face. At one stage, she is ready to take her own life. But, life has other plans for her. As the book progress, the reader is taken for an amazing journey along with the protoganist , getting access to the secrets of life contained in the holy book of Gita, and getting liberated at the end. The book has something for each type of reader. The wisdom offered in this book is something that only life can teach. 6) The White Tiger (by Aravind Adiga)  Describes the story of a boy,who climbs from the lower rungs of the social ladder into higher levels to become a successful entrepreneur 7)India after Gandhi (Ramachandra Guha)  You know the story of the birth of the nation of India. But do you know the story of the struggles and challenges that the nation had to go through while growing up? Do you know the persons who nurtured the system and this nation with their experience and knowledge to give it the shape that it has. The book constantly compares the idea of India as an experiment in the idea of democracy, prophecied at regular intervals to be doomed, but only to revive back with greater valor and strength. It makes us believe in the power of democracy and that we are going to achieve much greater heights. Books yet to be read: The Great Indian Novel(Shashi Tharoor)  The God of small things( Arundhathi Roy)  The argumentative Indian ( by Amartya Sen )  ",

            "answer_text": "This is one of the book I just read and I would definitely recommend it.Chanakya Chants by Ashwin Sanghi  This novel has two stories going simultaneously. First story which is 2300 years ago is about how Chanakya leads Chandragupta to become the king of India by defeating the brutal Dhanand and even stopping Aleaxander the great to enter the Great kingdom of Magadha. There are many witty lines by chanakya in the book. As we all know Chanakya's management skills are world renowned. This novel proves it all.Second story is about the present political system and how Gangasagar the protagonist leads Chandani to become first woman Prime minister of India. He does what it takes to thrash the ruling party.There are some similarities between the two stories.  Here are some quotes from the book:1. Friends come and go, Enemies accumulate. 2. A man on a date wonders if he'll get lucky but the woman already knows. 3. Battle is never about who is right, it is mostly about who is left. 4. The problem is that most things in life that are pleasurable are usually illegal, immoral or fattening. 5. No one is a virgin, life screws them all. 6. It's often easier to give forgiveness rather than permission ! 7. When a full house is adequate , why should I use straight flush?  8. In politics the only relevant currency is information. 9. Strange how women instantly depreciate in value the moment one acquires them. 10. A clear conscience is usually a sign of bad memory. 11. When two elephants fight, grass will suffer. 12. Worry is like a rocking chair; it keeps you in motion, but gets you nowhere. 13. Political power hopes to control the economic resources of the country. Economic power hopes to control the politicians. 14. Winning isn't only about increasing our stregth but also about reducing the enemy's. 15. One should never be too upright, it's always the straight trees that are cut down while the crooked ones are left standing. Happy Reading! :) ",
