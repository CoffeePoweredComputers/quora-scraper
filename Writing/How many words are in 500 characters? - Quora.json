            "answer_text": "You can estimate that in a corpora with passages and texts from various subjects or contexts. You delimit the words in 500 characters and count how many words there are. Then you divide the total number of words in 500 characters. Do this for all 500 character sequences in your corpora, and average every word per character statistic. This is using at least the orthographic way to write words, in which case you can do it for phonetic spelling too, if that is an interest. This will tell you one thing, how efficient your language is at written words encoded in characters taken as letters or phonetic letters. If you compare languages in that corpora and character encoding, you can see how many words per character there are on average for each corpora by language. And then compare those averages to see how many words on average there are in 500 characters, separated by language. That will tell you which language is most efficient at encoding those words in passages, using various characters or encodings. And also that implicitly you are comparing corpora of translations between languages. It\u2019s very important to understand that word to character ratio, which is like a morpheme to syllable ratio but taken more computationally by the computer. That can be studied in computational linguistics even at a very basic level, wherein the more you study in that field, the more linguistic theory you should be developing as it is applied to computer encodings and information exchange. Also, we should note that a computer has finite memory and process for instructions, and that it is actually using energy taken from an electrical power plant as a source. So that though we do have abundant resources in the United States for example, but it is not unlimited, but made more economical and gains from architectural advancements in efficiency. That means at the basic level, you want to be using a language or the grammatical structures and words in a language, that is more efficient and economical in word representation. ",

            "answer_text": "Anywhere from either less than 1 to (depending on what you call a word) to either 250 or 500, depending on whether you count blanks as characters. There is a technical word for a protein that has 189,819 letters but it has never been published. There is also a technical word (the chemical name of one variety of E. Coli) that has been published and has 1909 letters. Even if we exclude those, it can be tricky to decide what exactly a word is. Of all words that have not been challenged as words, the longest is Antidisestablishmentarianism with 28 letters, which could fit 17 times in 500 characters. Source At the other extreme, there\u2019s A a a a a a a a \u2026. a. Which would be 500 or 250, or maybe less if you demanded punctuation. In ordinary writing, the average length of a word is probably about 5 or 6 letters (source) so there would be about 80 or so. ",
