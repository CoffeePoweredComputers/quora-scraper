            "answer_text": "Personally, when planning a content strategy, I try I tend to consider the following stages: #1 The awareness stage \u2014 where people are actively looking for answers and browsing valuable resources. Make no mistake: you\u2019re trying to lure in new readers, so you have to create engaging content pieces that can easily be discovered and, hopefully, shared. The easiest way to get people what they might be looking for is to perform thorough keyword research first and check what content your competitors are creating (and how well they\u2019re doing it). What can you write at this stage? High-quality, SEO-optimised website copy and blog posts to attract organic traffic,Round-ups and research pieces featuring other experts (who are likely to share the content themselves),Lead magnets (i.e. ebooks, white papers, checklists, cheat sheets),\u201cViral\u201d social media content,Ad campaigns.#2 The interest or, in other words, engagement stage \u2014 where people become familiar with the brand and start to follow it, but are nowhere near being ready to buy. Good job, potential customers finally know who you are! They definitely are interested in what you\u2019re up to, but not completely sold on your offer. They might already follow you on social media, have your site bookmarked, and subscribed to receive email updates (fingers crossed for this scenario). Here\u2019s when you need to be more precise about your content and personalise it whenever you have a chance. Write engaging posts across social networks, chose strong email subject lines, and pick attractive blog post titles to keep your followers hooked. What should you focus on at this stage? Pop-up copy that converts,Emails, emails, and more emails (really good ones, though),Attractive social media posts,Ad campaigns (remarketing),Plus, don\u2019t forget to keep blogging! #3 The consideration/evaluation stage \u2014 where people are already familiar with the brand and are trying to decide whether or not it is a good fit for them. It\u2019s finally the time to back up everything you\u2019ve been kinda saying \u201cbetween the lines\u201d about your brand. You\u2019ve attracted potential customers and maintained their interest \u2014 now you have to come at them with some proof that would explain once and for all why you\u2019re the best. Keep in mind that these readers are basically ready to buy, and your content is likely to help them make the decision and choose your business among its competitors. What\u2019s not to like about that? What can you create at this stage? Comprehensive case studies,Portfolio with some examples of successful projects,Testimonials and reviews from happy clients.#4 The conversion/purchase stage \u2014 where people are making the actual purchase decision and leave their personal data (or buy the product/service if available online). Congrats, you\u2019ve made it (or you\u2019re about to). This doesn't mean that you can slack off, though. Many businesses lose potential customers very close to this stage, just because their CTAs or landing pages are not intuitive and convincing enough to give that \u201cfinal push\u201d. Make sure you\u2019re not one of them! The experience with the actual sale has to be as seamless as possible, with clear instructions and welcoming language. What to pay attention at this stage? Well-designed landing pages,Powerful CTAs.#5 The post-purchase, loyalty, or advocacy stage \u2014 where people become advocates, ready to recommend the brand to others. Did you know that it\u2019s much easier to convince an existing customer to buy from you again rather than attract an entirely new one? Happy customers can be much more willing to buy from you again. If they actually are happy. At this point, your customer service becomes a part of your marketing strategy \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a bad thing. Your customers should be assisted whenever they ask for help, or they should at least be able to help themselves. It\u2019s your role to provide them with the right tools to do so. That\u2019s precisely why it makes sense to prepare: Tutorials,FAQ / \u201cself-help\u201d sections,Follow-ups and seasonal check-ins (to build relationships and collect testimonials).There you have it \u2014 a content strategy template in a nutshell. Once you map these stages and different types of content that can be useful at each and every one of it, it becomes a lot easier to figure out what content you should actually produce in the long run.  What you really want is a cycle rather than a funnel, where customers make it through to the last stage, and then start over again anywhere from the interest/engagement phase and beyond. Well-written and carefully planned content, of course, will keep playing a big role here. I hope that helps! Here\u2019s more on common content strategy mistakes and available resources, in case you\u2019re interested. ",

            "answer_text": "Before answering this, we must ask 2 questions: 1) What exactly is a content plan? 2) Do we really need one? A content plan lets you define the role your content will play as part of your overall brand building strategy. To create a content strategy that actually works, you must first define a content territory that is strategically relevant for your businesses. This is paramount and must lie at the intersection of your unique value proposition and your audience's pain points. Your content strategy will influence what your audience thinks of your business. It will not only determine the topics you\u2019re associated with, but also decide when, how and where you link with your prospects. The idea is to provide your audience with a compelling value-added proposition that gets them to become repeat buyers \u2013 or in other words, earn their loyalty. With regard to the second question, it\u2019s a no-brainer and the answer is a RESOUNDING YES! Studies tell us that brands which produce a well documented, actionable content strategy tend to do better than those that don\u2019t. They drive more ROI from their content marketing efforts. Getting Started Depending on your brand's purpose and identity, you'll need to find different ways of getting them to care about your content and come one step closer to you. While this may vary from organization to organization, consider incorporating these three themes that will be consistent across all content types. Educate: Help your audience know something useful that they can apply right away to solve a problem in their lives. Entertain. Surprise them, make them smile, laugh and eventually care enough to share with their friends family, colleagues and the rest. Inspire. Tell them emotional and relatable stories that matter - that they want to be a part of \u2013 and let them know important they are to you even beyond generating business. You need to understand two key facets inside out to effectively target your users and produce content that meets their needs: \u25cf Business goals & objectives \u25cf Target audience Ask yourself these questions \u25cf What are your business goals? \u25cf What does your audience typically speak about and what do they want from you? \u25cf What action would you want your audience to take when they come face to face with your content? \u25cf Which channels do they use most often? \u25cf What type of content must you create to reach out to people at every stage of the buying cycle? The Buying conundrum As marketers, we understand the importance of tailoring the same message differently to meet our audience at their exact point of need. But why is this important? Today, buyers are past 66% of the purchasing journey before they really decide to contact a sales person. In other words, your prospective customer is going online to get educated \u2013 either from you or your competitors. Don\u2019t leave your customers to connect the dots. Make it damn easy for them. Spell it out for them. When did you hear about a website (or an app or a form) being too easy to understand? Yes, never. People who are already familiar with your brand or product and are having trouble deciding whether or not they need to consider buying from you need to be given a different message than those who\u2019re just getting to know you better. It\u2019s all about being valuable through the art of adding value. But what on earth is \u2018value?\u2019 According to research, only 16% of the audience is ready to buy. What about the remaining 84%? They are waiting for you to make them ready to buy. Forrester Research tells us that the brand that gets in early and helps provide a clear solution to their customer wins 74% of the time. Value lies at the meeting point of all sales and marketing initiatives. It can be defined as: Perceived relevant benefit \u2212 total cost of ownership. But to be more relevant, you must first understand what is actually important to your audience. Here, the customer would perceive value in terms of how soon you can get them the growth they are seeking. If content is the king, perception is his battle ground, considering 68% of organizations lose business due to perceived indifference \u2013 which means customers think you don\u2019t care about them even if they\u2019re all you care about! Adding value in content A whopping 90% of the content created by B2B marketers is never used by the sales team and 43% of content marketing efforts don\u2019t bring in the results. Thankfully, B2B Buyers generally look at 3-5 pieces of content before talking to a salesperson. This means you have plenty of scope to add value in your content and tilt the buying factors in your favor. A good place to begin is to map out useful content based on the different stages of the buyer\u2019s journey, and figure out how your content can be plugged in effectively. This cycle can be broken down into four stages: \u00b7 Discovery \u2013 This is the stage at which the customer is just getting to know your company and figuring out if they need your service. \u00b7 Research \u2013 At this stage, the audience is partially convinced that your product might overcome their problem. \u00b7 Validation \u2013 Here, they begin to explore other options (your competitors) and start narrowing down their choices to zero in on one service provider. \u00b7 Buying \u2013 This is the last stage when your customer finally takes a call on who to buy from. It\u2019s best to engage your customers via blogging and/or social media at the first stage of discovery or awareness \u2013 on your own website as well as on others. However, that strategy may not work at the research and validation stages, as chances are that your audience is looking for credible evidence about why they should do business with you. At this stage, you may want to look at producing slightly more in-depth content like case studies, white papers, webinars or eBooks. And of course, you can make your social media interactions more meaningful - especially on platforms like LinkedIn or Quora where you can stand out tall as a thought leader and influencer. Why? Because this gives your audience an implicit message that you mean business and are so knowledgeable about what you\u2019re talking about that you can shape opinions and influence buying choices. As your customers begin to realize that (this will not happen in a fortnight though), they\u2019ll slowly start to invest their trust in you because you\u2019re now giving them a valid reason to take their attention from competition - they would rather buy from someone who is an expert and cares about their personal needs than someone who appears too sales-driven and focuses more on making exaggerated claims (style) than on driving value (substance). Measuring value A useful indicator of finding out how valuable your content has been is to use a win/loss analysis. This practically forces you to know why you did or did not bag the deal. When your customers say that the price is too high, you can be pretty sure that the actual reason why they did not buy from you was because they didn\u2019t see the hidden value in your offering. Put simply, if you DO NOT create enough value for your customers (your product or service) they will begin to seek value with regard to price. Therefore, the foremost step in creating a content strategy is to understand what it is that your customers value most \u2013 price or a substantial benefit for which they would be happy to pay that price.
