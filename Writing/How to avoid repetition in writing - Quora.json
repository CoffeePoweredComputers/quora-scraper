            "answer_text": "Variation. Variation with words, sentence structure, length, and paragraph structure. It\u2019s honestly a lot easier than it seems. Make sure that your sentences aren\u2019t all the same length; and make sure there is variation is paragraph length as well. This makes the page visually interesting, and shakes everything up. This makes it easier to digest, and easier to read. Variation with words is also a pretty simple thing to fix. Thesaurus.com - The world's favorite online thesaurus! will save your life, I promise. Make sure you\u2019re not using the same word in every sentence, and paragraph. \u201cSaid,\u201d is one of the most obvious examples. If you\u2019re constantly using the word, \u201csaid,\u201d things are going to get a little monotonous. Even switching to, \u201cspoke,\u201d can help. But make sure you\u2019re not only using those two words. Get descriptive. Instead of \u201csaid,\u201d if your character is angry, use \u201cgrowled,\u201d or if they are sad, perhaps \u201cwept,\u201d or \u201ccried\u201d is better. If you want to get rid of repetition, then shake things up. Variation will be your best tool. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re using MS Word - try running a search on some words you visually see repeated when you self-edit, but also run a search on common junk or bloat words - big culprits are the following: \u201cthat\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d which shows up more via dialog or right before a dialog tag, but also \u201cbeen\u201d and \u201chad\u201d which is frequent in narrative. Some others are: pretty much, really, probably, seriously, and suddenly- you can find them on Word by entering in \u201cly\u201d and it will highlight every egregious adverb in your writing - it was also reveal which of those are your subconscious \u201chabit\u201d words you\u2019re prone to repeating without even realizing it. I was appalled when I saw how many times my character said \u201creally\u201d, for instance - when using Word\u2019s \u201cfind\u201d function to weed trim the bloat. You can look online for frequent repetitious words, a nd you can also use grammar software, such as Grammarly or Autocrit - a trial version of either one will be enough to get you started on how to create a search/find on Word to break your repetition habit. Keep a dictionary handy (or use one online) so you can swap out repeated words. ",
