            "answer_text": "Hummm... Literary... what makes it literary. Very well. First of all, yes, I believe so. A science-fiction novel may be a literary novel. It all depends on the sort of \"codes\" that you use while writing it - in case you're the writer, that is - or that are there to be read - in case you're the reader.  In any case, those codes are there. So, first of all, it is with those codes that we can draw a - yes, more or  less arbitrary - distinction between what is paraliterary and literary; like between the Da Vinci Code and D. Quixote. Now, what are those codes...? And what sort of codes are there, then? Are those all that matters when it comes to the nature of a work as a work of pure literature? Yes and no. A writer needs one of two things - one of two, at least. One is an original view of the world. With that original view - let's call a world-view -, he then can start exercising his own voice with his own statements regarding his view of the world. Still, original as he or she may be, that does not mean that he or she knows or can actually write a work of literature. He or she may have something interesting to say according to his or hers specific point in time - think about Henry Miller and his sort of confessional novels - but, after that particular moment has passed he or she, well, may not be so relevant in terms of what is deemed worthy of entering and remaining in the literary canon and thus will not be read and studied in the future like some people study Homer, Shikibo, Chaucer - you get the idea.  This, I hope, covers the original world-view/voice part. Now: the literary knowledge part. This is where the codes thing comes in. You need to read a lot - and I mean: a lot. Starting, for example, with the greeks and reading all the way through the classics of your own national literature and world literature all the way up to the more recent ones. Now, meanwhile, you should also read about what you are reading. You need to learn how those works are structured in terms of character composition, narrative, word choice, theme construction, etc. That way you'll be able to start recognizing those literary codes that make a written work - like a novel or a poem - a true literary work. A this point you may be asking yourself: but isn't that strictly a formal matter, then? Yes and no. As in the case of the world-view/voice element, having those literary codes in a work of literature may mean nothing in terms of entering the canon. Writers who in their own time were highly praised and considered literary writers - because they were, well, so literate on what was literary -, later did not enter the canon and were forgotten - also,  in case you're wondering, the opposite happened to the likes of Isidore Ducasse who later was discovered by Andre Breton and the likes and became this sort of grandfather of surrealism. In the case of a literary work, what is desirable in terms of its literary merit as a work of literature, is a healthy mix of both of those things. So, yes, a sci-fi novel may be a literary novel.  Genre is just that: a genre. A farce, a rhapsody, a tragedy, drama, comedy, tragicomedy, dramedy or whatever, are just forms or ways of writing a story in a certain register - a certain register that a priori implies a certain set of rules that you may obey or pervert accordingly. What you need is an intelligent approach to working the underlying themes or message/s of any story, and by intelligent I mean to the benefit of the story and its message - message or problem that you want to pass on to the reader; both present and future. With that you may be able to snatch from your own historically contingent experience something that is really representative about your time and place in this world, and also that or those certain somethings that are perennial to the human experience.
