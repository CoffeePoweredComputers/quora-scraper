            "answer_text": "Is writer\u2019s block a sign that I\u2019m not good at writing? No. One has nothing to do with the other. Almost all writers experience the horrible \u201cblock.\u201d All of them have to discover their own way out of it, whether on their own or through advice online or who knows where. If you haven\u2019t noticed, Quora has no small number of answers for the questions. It\u2019s just that the questions are worded a bit differently. Since I might assume you\u2019re a writer-in-progress at least, then you ought to have the research acuity to do this on your own, either with Quora, a Google search, or other references you might stumble upon. There exist hundreds - possibly thousands - of suggestions on how to break the almighty, horrible, frustrating, dream-killer FACT of the BLOCK! Just go to any search line and type in \u201cwriter\u2019s block.\u201d As far as that being a sign you\u2019re not good at writing - no one can assign that to you. You need to move through all the trials and tribulations we all do, attend to good advice, learn to recognize advice-for-money, and plow ahead. Best to you. If you love it, it\u2019ll love you back. Hang in there. ",

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily, it might be a sign that you are good at writing. If by \u2018block\u2019 you simply mean the fact that you find it very hard to write, then that is a sign that you are doing it right. Because every writer, every real writer, knows that the task is very difficult. The great German novelist Thomas Mann once said, \u2018a writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for others\u2019. So rather than be put off by difficulty, you should be encouraged. And the only way I know to get through the difficult times is to cultivate a writing habit. Appoint a certain time every day, the same time every day, and sit down and write. And if nothing comes, sit there anyway. If you keep doing that consistently, day after day, the muse will deliver. I hope this helps a little bit. If you want any more help with your writing you might like to check out my free novel writing course here. ",

            "answer_text": "No, you are simply experiencing a lull in your creative process. Do anything to get your mind off the act of writing, like taking a walk or pursuing a favorite activity. If you have a recording app on your cellphone, take it with you. Record your random thoughts. Do not worry about grammar or where you\u2019ve stashed your thesaurus. Do not worry how the words sound as they come out of your mouth. Just freely associate. And if you carry your cellphone to record your thoughts, do not, I repeat, do not take calls or make them. This is your time alone. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn't say so. Everyone is blocked at some point. It's what you do with that block that determines if you'll succeed or not, but that doesn't have to do with the quality of your writing. Writing is a skill we have to learn, and that includes the process. Sometimes you have to drop an idea and sometimes your process isn't right and sometimes you just need a small break before you can get back into the flow of writing again. Good luck, I hope you figure it out soon ",

Take a step back from the story. Read it. Maybe even give it to someone else to read, and ask for their opinion on where it should go. And then come back, and (if you do it like i do) take a metaphorical sledge hammer to that block and power through. Writers block just means you're a writer, not that you're a bad one. ",

My subconscious noticed before my brain, and stopped me from going on with such abysmal plans. It might be this, it might be another reason. Don\u2019t give up so easily! ",

It\u2019s not about being \u2018good enough\u2019 to get out of the block, but it\u2019s about finding the right material and motivations to get you into a passionate flux. Your best bet would be to look into what you have around you for ideas. Find a topic, genre, time span, or even old tale of folklore to get you going again. It requires some dedicated time of researching, yes, but it\u2019ll be worth the work when you start rolling out all your ideas and soon enough, you\u2019ll have a few paragraphs. ",
