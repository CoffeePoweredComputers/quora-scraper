            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t have recordings of most of our presidents. One impressive speaker was Theodore Roosevelt. The man could talk for 3 hours and have his notes still in his pocket. Which is a good thing since they saved his life. Ever hear the story where Roosevelt had almost a book of notes in his pocket, ignored them and was speaking. A guy shot him- where the notes were located. Roosevelt was still shot but he still talked for a few more hours. We have the speech on film but no sound. Back then, eloquence had a different definition. If you look at Abraham Lincoln\u2019s children\u2019s writings- you would think a present day college student wrote the words. The son who wrote the paper (it was in a museum, forget which son) was 12. I bet the bar of being eloquent was a great deal higher 100+ years ago than today. Reagan was a very good speaker. Being an actor and trained to keep an audience helped. I disagree on Obama. Without his teleprompter- Obama\u2019s every other word is \u201cah\u201d. I don\u2019t consider that eloquent. Plus he talks to you like a professor- not very engaging. That is one of Trump\u2019s strong suits. Bill Clinton kept an audience too. But is that eloquence? \u201cDefinition of eloquence 1: discourse marked by force and persuasiveness also : the art or power of using such discourse 2: the quality of forceful or persuasive expressiveness Eloquence is generally considered an asset when it comes to spoken and written language. The art of using eloquent language in a persuasive manner is called rhetoric, and the two often go hand in hand. However, eloquence differs from rhetoric in that rhetoric, by its very definition, has a purpose: convincing someone of something. Eloquence may be used in rhetoric, but it can also exist for its own sake of simply appreciating and using the possibilities of language. \u201cEloquence can be achieved in a wide variety of ways. There are some elements or techniques that are generally important. Things like interesting word choice, varied sentence structure, repetition, and logical progression of ideas all may play a role.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Who is the most eloquent president we've ever had? I'm going to go with Abraham Lincoln, who stood out as a great speaker in an age when tv and movies and great bands on tour didn't exist, and attending public lectures was a major form of public entertainment and education. People had expectations for what a great speaker was, and experience in evaluating and judging them. And Lincoln stood out, even with what is reported to have been a high, thin voice, not the voice you expect for public speaking. Other contenders might be Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama. But I think Lincoln is the best. ",
