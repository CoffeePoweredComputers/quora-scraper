            "answer_text": "There are about 195 countries in the world. Each will probably have their own licencing authority. Some, like Australia, Canada and the USA issue driving licences at a province/territory/state level. So to know how to identify a duplicate licence (if indeed there is a difference) you would need to identify which licencing authority issued the licence. Without knowing that any answer can only be guesswork. ",

            "answer_text": "How do I spot a fake driver\u2019s license? There are several ways to do it. The features of a license vary from state to state. Use a black light. Each state will have some kind of logo that is visible under black light. A fake one will either not have the logo, or a shoddy version of the real one, since it is difficult to replicate. (This is the easiest way, and I would recommend any establishment needing age verification to carry one.)Look at the micro printing. Most licenses have small lettering that may look like lines under a normal eye, but with a magnifying lens, the letters become visible.Most licenses are double laminated. If a license feels too thin, it probably is fake.After seeing multiple licenses, you get a general idea of how text and pictures are supposed to align. A misalignment on any of them screams fake license.Hope this helps. ",

He would merely check it via radio or in car internet and would thereby know you'd bought it at some 10 bucks forgers shop. ",
