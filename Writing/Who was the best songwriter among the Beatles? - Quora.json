            "answer_text": "Very good question, and one that will never find a satisfying answer. There is an obviously wrong answer, Ringo. Everyone in the world would admit that, even him. His strength was his drumming and keeping the band together. But what about the other three? George: He did write some of the most interesting songs. For example, Here Comes the Sun, Something, Blue Jay Way, Within Without You, Northern Song. Each was different each had unique attributes, each could be the defining song in almost any 60\u2019s band. Except for the Beatles. It\u2019s hard to say if he was kept down by the writing talents of the other two or if he was inspired by them. John: Well, what can I say? Let\u2019s just confine this to the Beatles songs. Imagine is said to be the best song ever written. (I think it\u2019s a pretty tune and little substance. Anywhere in the western world outside of the US, it\u2019s trite lyrics amount to \u201clet\u2019s be nice for a change\u201d. In the US it\u2019s the Communist Manifesto in a song). The early songs are hard to figure out for the layman, and even for the writers. Help is one of the first songs to layout the writer's psychological problems. Norwegian Wood is a masterpiece in personal storytelling. Nowhere Man is a personal examination. Strawberry Fields is unique in music. Tomorrow Never Knows is ground-breaking and genre-defining. This is just a sample of his output, I\u2019ve missed out many of the best songs of the 20th century, who knows how good he could\u2019ve been if not for his massive heroin addiction. Paul: Probably not as innovative as John, but the music magpie that borrowed from the best. He has a musical mind that is constantly creating. Not that many original ideas, but he took the sounds from others to create some of the best music of all time. Penny Lane is a showpiece of his ability to craft a tune. Yesterday was so good he spent ages asking others if they knew the song because he thought it was so ubiquitous someone else must\u2019ve written it at some time. One of his creations was heavy metal with the huge overdrive on Helter Skelter. Blackbird is probably one of the best anti-racist folk songs out there. He helped develop the recording magic, with tape loops and mellotron. He used the western classical tradition and made it into pop songs. Eleonor Rigby and She\u2019s Leaving Home are great examples of using English folk modes to create pop songs. OK now, here\u2019s the hard bit, who is best\u2026 This is THE hard question. What do you mean as best? Is the most influential better than the one who wrote the best song? Is consistency better than flashes of genius? Personally, I would say Paul, John was unique and brilliant and in the top 5 songwriters of all time. But Paul beats him for variability and innovation of fusing classical and pop traditions. I don\u2019t think either of them would be as good if they didn\u2019t bounce ideas off each other. Perhaps the only real answer is Lennon/McCartney. Even apart they needed to one-up each other. ",

            "answer_text": "Paul McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison were all outstanding songwriters. Any music project would kill to have just one of them on board. Overall though, I lean to thinking that Paul McCartney was the strongest songwriter. If you ask people to name The Beatles\u2019 most iconic songs, the most ones you\u2019ll most likely hear are: \u201cI Saw Her Standing There\u201d, \u201cShe Loves You\u201d, \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d, \u201cYesterday\u201d, \u201cHey Jude\u201d and \u201cLet It Be\u201d. Most of those were written mainly by McCartney, except for \u201cShe Loves You\u201d and \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand\u201d which were true collaborations between Lennon and McCartney. McCartney had a real knack for coming up with memorable melodies, and was willing to take on board new influences and experiment. In the last years of The Beatles, he was basically in the driving seat. McCartney also probably had the strongest solo career between 1969 and 1980. Although Lennon and Harrison both had moments of excellence in their solo careers, and McCartney\u2019s solo career was hardly consistent. To be clear, John Lennon was indispensable. He wrote many great songs including \u201cI Feel Fine\u201d, \u201cIn My Life\u201d, \u201cStrawberry Fields Forever\u201d, the lion\u2019s share of \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d and \u201cRevolution\u201d. He introduced many new influences to the band\u2019s music and lyrics and a sardonic edge. He was definitely the best lyricist in the band, and \u201cIn My Life\u201d stands out as maybe the best lyrics of any Beatles song. And the Lennon-McCartney partnership meant that they acted as a check on each other. Lennon often gave McCartney\u2019s songs more edge, while McCartney made Lennon\u2019s songs more accessible. Given that he didn\u2019t write as much material, I suspect that most people wouldn\u2019t say that George Harrison was their best songwriter. But he was limited towards the end when Lennon and McCartney wouldn\u2019t let him write a greater share of songs, and he had a habit of writing one of the highlight songs of each album. \u201cSomething\u201d is one of my favourite Beatles songs, and he also wrote \u201cTaxman\u201d and \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d. No-one is going to say that Ringo Starr was the best songwriter, as he only has writing credits to a handful of songs. Most of them weren\u2019t standouts either, though I do enjoy \u201cOctopus's Garden\u201d. And although he did do some good songs in his solo career, it wasn\u2019t as noteworthy as the other three, most of those were covers or collaborations. ",
