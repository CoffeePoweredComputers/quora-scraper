            "answer_text": "Starting your autobiography is actually pretty easy - finishing it is the hard bit! I'm going to outline a simple strategy to start (and finish) your autobiography in a really short space of time. Your autobiography won't be sold in bookstores and make you $1M in royalties. But it will be an absolutely perfect autobiography for your children, grandchildren and loved ones to read and cherish for generations.  So what's the strategy? In a nutshell: answer questions about your life and write down your answers. A bit of background, when my daughter was born my wife and I realised how little we knew about our parents and their family histories. We wanted to capture their life stories for her (and to be honest, for us too). We went searching for a something affordable, easy to follow and perfect for a novice writer. We didn\u2019t really find anything that worked. Our solution? We designed an interview with 101 questions for our parents to answer. Every question was designed to be thought provoking and take no more than a few minutes each to answer. We broke the questions up into different \u201clife chapters\u201d like childhood, work, love, children and more philosophical questions as well. The idea was that although the questions were simple enough to answer easily, they\u2019d also be detailed enough to cover our parents\u2019 lives. It was easy, motivating and most importantly\u200a\u2014\u200athey finished their books! We left the books in \"Q&A format\" so anyone that reads them feels like they're listening in on this incredible conversation with them. The magic of an interview is it\u2019s fascinating to read\u200a\u2014\u200aas soon as you hear a question you want to know the answer. And the answer says so much about who that person is. Just think about your answer to these questions - whatever they are, they will be unique: What advice would you give to your 18 year old self?What\u2019s the most valuable thing your parents taught you?If you could share a meal with anyone in the world, who would it be and why?My wife and I got so excited about how well our parents\u2019 books turned out that we launched A Life Untold (www.alifeuntold.com) to give absolutely anyone the ability to write and print their life story into a captivating and professionally designed hardcover book. And because it was designed specifically to help our families get started with writing their life story, it's definitely worth trying if you're struggling to take that first step. Happy writing! ",

            "answer_text": "Writing an autobiography (a book about your own life) is no different than writing a biography or any other book. The main step is research. Research will have you looking at old photos, old letters, old journals, speaking with family about yourself, as-well-as friends. If you can, follow-up with opinions from former teachers and possibly even former employers. You will outline your life from day of birth and compile as much information as will explain who you are and have become, since your birth. You will explore all the factors that have influenced your beliefs and behaviors. You will highlight any event that was a turning point in your life. What happened to your path through life and how it was make to turn without your desire, and how you made the best of it. You will also have to decide on the names to use in your story. Will you use the name of a former boyfriend or husband and explain how they screwed up your life, or will you treat is as \u201cfirst boyfriend\u2026let\u2019s call him Bob\u201d fashion. This is brought up here because anything bad being said about someone in your life without absolute unquestionable proof could be inviting a slander or libel suit. At the beginning I mentioned \u201cmain\u201d step instead of first step, as was asked. If you plan to write an autobiography you first have to be honest and decide whether or not your life has been so super different and interesting than the next person\u2019s to warrant writing something that readers would agree would be seminal to the general culture. If you are a woman writing a \u201ctell-all\u201d about being a mistress to the last several Presidents then you have to be ready to prove it all. The same can be said about a man who writes an autobiographical of working for CIA and and reveal national secrets. You have to be 100% clear on the motif for your autobiography. I have had something of an above average life but I would rather use that life to write a really good fiction over naming names and having to look over my shoulder as to whom would be gunning for me.
