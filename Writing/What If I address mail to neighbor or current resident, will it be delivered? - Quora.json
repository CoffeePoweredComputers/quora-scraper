Mail to \u201cPat Jones or current resident\u201d will be delivered to the address on the envelope whether Pat Jones lives there or not \u2014 even if there has never been a Pat Jones at that address, or if Pat Jones moved months ago. However \u2014 people are less inclined to open mail addressed to current resident, as this is the form typically used by bulk mail senders for their advertising. What are you sending? Is it important it get to a house, or to a particular person? Do you need proof it was delivered (or refused)? Would it be simpler to walk over and hand it to Pat Jones yourself? ",
