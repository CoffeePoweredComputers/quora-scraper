            "answer_text": "Here are 10 rules to be a successful anchor. 1- News anchors have to be very knowledgeable about current affairs and history. 2- They have to be prepared to deal with the unexpected and go live on air to deal with a crisis and talk extemporaneously on the breaking news. I covered the Berlin Wall the morning after it fell. I was ready. I knew its history ... when it was built, why it was built and who were the players. Anchors have to have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge on all manner of subjects. They have to be eclectic. 3- They have to be skilled interviewers (hint ... the secret of being a good interviewer is to listen and never bring your notes or interview questions into the studio). 4- They have to be excellent writers and choose words that everybody will understand. 5- They have to be a team player. They have to work with and get along with the news staff (prima donnas need not apply). 6- They should be humble (think Walter Cronkite). 7- If you are fortunate to be selected as an anchor and it is contract time, fight like hell to be the ultimate word on what gets on the air. This is vital. If you don't have this power you will be at the mercy of a producer and bean counters. I have been in this business for 50 years. I was also the bureau chief and European correspondent for Canada's Global TV network. I was also a correspondent for CNN (Berlin bureau). I have little use for producers. Most of them are on-air wannabes. In all my years in this business I would be hard pressed to name 5 news producers that were up to scratch. Bean counters (accountants) are the curse of the news division. Be prepared to do battle. 8- Anchors have to be experts in the English language. They have to be masters in grammar, pronunciation and have a vocabulary that can be called upon to colourfully describe any event. They should also have a working knowledge of French, German and Arabic. They should also be experts in Geography. 9- Don Hewitt of 60 minutes nailed it. It was beautiful in its simplicity: \u201ctell me a story\u201d .... engage me.... seduce me ... tell me a story. But check your facts, then check them again. Truth. The audience wants to feel assured that the story you tell is the truth. Truth .... not as you see it ... not as you interpret it..... but truth. And please don't editorialize. In an intro or extro to a story don't say things like \u201chow awful\u201d and so on. The audience doesn't give a damn what you think. You are a glorified messenger, a modern day town crier. Know your place and keep it .... be humble! 10- Stay away from the booze. It will be your undoing. And for god's sake do not have sex with a staff member. This will be your undoing too..................... good luck........... It's a tough business and only the strongest survive. ",

If u r good at singing, then along with ur anchoring u can sing a line or two\u2026 as mostly I do\u2026 It actually catches d attention of evn those who do not listen to monotonous speech\u2026 There r still many more things which can make u a real anchor\u2026will discuss later\u2026 Regards Pratistha ",
