            "answer_text": "It depends on who you\u2019re emailing and why, the setting, and your relative standing with respect to them all. For example - if you\u2019re replying to a question posed by your boss, who copied a bunch of other people\u2026address your boss (e.g. \u201cGood question, Bob\u201d)If you\u2019re originating the email, you can start with something along the lines of \u201cHi, all\u201d or \u201cEveryone\u201d or something along those lines. If the recipients are all men or all women, you can even start with \u201cHello Ladies\u201d or \u201cHi Gents,\u201d although I suppose you run the risk here that someone might find a way to take offense.If you\u2019re replying to a question posed to a group of people then you might dispense with an address altogether and just answer the question (\u201cBob asked about\u2026.\u201d or \u201cPart of the answer to Bob\u2019s question is\u2026\u201d)If you\u2019re way down on the totem pole and everyone else on the email is senior to you, it might be safest to go with something along the lines of \u201cHello everyone, and thanks for the question, Bob.\u201dIf it\u2019s a bunch of your friends then you have greater latitude in how you start the email, but remember to take into account the sensitivities of all of recipients (e.g. \u201cYo bitches\u201d might be good for your frat brothers, but maybe no if some have copied their wives, girlfriends, or mothers into the email chain)One more comment\u2026. The greater the number of people copied on the email, the greater the number who you don\u2019t know, and the higher the level of seniority of the highest-ranking person on the email (in the corporate world) the more careful you need to be with regards to formality, phrasing, content - and with spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. If it\u2019s just between you and the others on your team, type it up and hit \u201csend\u201d - if your CEO is one of the recipients you likely don\u2019t want to start your email with \u201cYo bitches\u201d or to send a poorly written email that sounds like you consider your CEO to be one of your frat brothers.

            "answer_text": "Basically, there is no special rule for \u201can e-mail addressed to multiple people.\u201d Just address it \u201cto the people you\u2019re writing the e-mail to,\u201d denominated by a list of names or by descriptive groups, in whatever register\u00b9 you have determined to be appropriate based on the relationship with the people and the type of communication. In fact, there\u2019s no unified style for addressing e-mails, even business e-mails, the way there sort of is for business letters. \u201cDear\u201d is frequently omitted in e-mails; I personally don\u2019t use it and if I bother with a salutation line at all it\u2019s usually just \u201c[Name]:\u201d Or in this case, \u201c[Name] and [Name]:\u201d. In less formal situations, it may be \u201cHi [Name]:\u201d. Otherwise, however, you\u2019d do this the same way as you would a letter with two addressees: to wit in most formal style (and some people do write their e-mails in the exact same format as a paper letter) \u201c(Dear) Mr. Smith and Dr. Jones:\u201d, \u201cMr. and Mrs. Smith:\u201d; \u201cMessrs\u00b2 Jones and Smith:\u201d, &c. If there are a lot of names (probably more than three at the least), \u201cAll:\u201d or slightly less formally, \u201cEveryone:\u201d, may be acceptable. Sometimes a term like \u201cCounsel:\u201d (referring to multiple attorneys) or \u201cMembers of the Board:\u201d or the like may also substitute for a list of names. In a slightly less formal style \u201c(Dear/Hi) [First Name]\u201d may be used; if there are multiple recipients, \u201cDear John and Mary\u201d or the like. Whether it\u2019s appropriate to address someone by first name alone has little to do with e-mail and varies with the context of the relationship. This is far more common in American English than in either British or international style, and it\u2019s far more common now than it was a generation ago when I was young. This is not unusual, though, in correspondence between attorneys who know each other in a small Bar, intra-office correspondence, or otherwise in cases where the people would probably be on a first-name basis if they spoke in real life. Most people tend to write e-mail a step down in register from formal letters; this may extend to a greater willingness to use first names (or, perhaps, a greater reluctance to use first names alone in paper letters), but the long and the short of it is it still depends on the relationship. I would never use first-name only to correspond with someone I wasn\u2019t already familiar with, though, like an out-of-county attorney with whom I\u2019ve never worked before. It also goes without saying that it\u2019s not normally appropriate to use first-names only when writing to someone who outranks you (except, perhaps, a direct supervisor). If I were addressing the Judge, for instance, the title and last name, or at a minimum the title, would be required. If this is not a business e-mail, just use whatever you would normally call the people: \u201cHi Sue and Johnny:\u201d is fine. P.S. I join in Jeff Greene\u2019s observations as well, to the effect that (1) there may be cases where the salutation is omitted entirely (after all, the person is being sent the e-mail, which implies it\u2019s addressed to them)\u2014in my case this is especially true for e-mails that are in a chain of close-in-time responses\u2014and (2) you don\u2019t normally mention people being cc\u2019d on the email, only main recipients. It\u2019s also not necessary to put \u201ccc:\u201d at the bottom of the message.  Note: \u00b9 \u201cRegister\u201d and \u201cstyle\u201d are similar concepts; the former term is usually used to describe how formal a piece of language is. See also this answer. \u00b2 The classical plural of \u201cMr.\u201d is messieurs or \u201cMessrs.\u201d; of \u201cMrs/Ms\u201d mesdames or \u201cMmes.\u201d These are rare even in formal American English these days, though I\u2019ve still seen them occasionally in formal international style.

You are the specific person emailed and everyone else is C.C.) or the email is sent with a general question requesting input from everyone. If the email is specific to you, you must address and address it quickly, even if you don\u2019t have an answer. If you do not have a specific answer because it is a problem you are working on, you should answer that you are aware of the issue and you are working to resolve it. The fact that the email was sent to you but with multiple parties suggests that the sender views it as an urgent matter. It may not be, but you cannot ignore the senders perception and responding punctually even if not completely should be reassuring to them. You also have to respond by using reply all. It would of course be much for the better if you can provide an answer that communicates what has and is being done, but in so doing just use a very factual tone. Go out of your way not to be defensive. If the sender is out of line with their email and CCing the friggin world try to get face time or get on the phone with them and talk it out. Many people get very brave and even bold behind an e-mail but in person are very kind, the medium of e-mail is not the best for everyone. If the email is a buckshot e-mail to a group asking for general input it is good to respond but only if you have something to offer. In these situations the sender is looking for help, if you have little to offer there is no point in responding. If someone else offers something that is helpful you can piggy back in their email and say something \u2018yes I have done that also and I have found that to be helpful as well\u2019 and acknowledge the senders contribution. If you do have something helpful to offer don\u2019t hesitate to be the first to respond. The goal here is to be helpful. ",

Meloncamp, Director of Music\u201d and keeping the list one name directly under the prior name. This also works for more formal situations. You may address people according to how you are sending it, too.

To address a large group, I prefer to use \u201cHello\u201d, \u201cTeam\u201d, or some similar neutral heading that reinforces the business topic. If it is a more personal email, such as announcing the birth of a colleague\u2019s child, use \u201cDear whomever (e.g., Dear Department of Transportation, Dear colleagues in the Bureau of Happiness) or just \u201cGood Morning\u201d. Some companies or parts of companies have specific rules. Keep in mind that some address line have to be broken out for people with titles (e.g., President Smith, Dr. Jones, Captain Ahab). If you have no personal or working relationship with the addressee, you might want to use Ms. or Mr. or the form of address expected in their country or culture. If there are such rules apply them as needed. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask your management or colleagues for guidance. ",

Then constructing the contents as a memo should make it appear that the email was directed to them. Listing all recipients in the receiver box lets everyone know who you sent it to and includes their email addresses, too. Not necessarily good if someone fails to protect their contacts and contaminates everyone's emails\u2026 if your email is intended primarily for one person you can put them in the receiver section and cc the rest. Then you can personalize the email to the main recipient and everyone is supposed to understand that that was the primary audience. Now, if you are sending the same email to multiple people and you do not want to rewrite the email for each name you can copy the email and just enter each name and paste the copy and send. One copy and one email kind of personalized. When all else fails to appear to fit, I'd suggest you fall back on the \"To Whom It May Concern\" heading\u2026 im sure there are some folks out there who are a whole lot smarter than I who can give you better advise than I.

If you are sending info to them, visibly to them all, then say so: \"Dear All, I want you all to have this information and to know who else has received it.\" You'd probably go on to say something like \"This can be circulated to colleagues and customers\" or \"This information is to please remain confidential to this group of people at the moment.\"If you're sending it to each of them, effectively privately, then either use a CRM to do an e-mailshot including e-mailmerge, so you can slot in their relevant salutation name, or put all the recipients on the BCC line (to protect their privacy), and simply begin with \"Hello\", \"Good morning\", \"Hi\", or whatever is most suitable.

To friends, you might start, \"Hi Friends!\" To people who aren't necessarily friends but where it's not formal, you might choose, \"Hi Everyone!\" Where it is to not too many people, I'd say about five maximum, you could simply say, \"Hi [name 1], [name 2], [name 3], etc. ",

Alternatively, you have to decide if you are letting the other people know who has been copied. There are blind cc\u2019s. So, it could be correct to say: Dear Bob, Dear Mr. Jones, To all department heads of the ABC company, depending on how formal the communication is, whether you want everyone to know who has received, and whether hierarchy is important. An email sent to the entire company with details of the upcoming picnic is obviously quite different from an email regarding an upcoming termination. Scheduling a meeting between the CEO, CFO and Board of Directors regarding a company acquiring another involves a whole lot of care not only in addressing the importance of those involved, but also the sensitivity. When in doubt, consult similar emails sent in the past or the level of formality expressed in emails sent to you. ",

So if I send an email to the leader of a team at work but carbon copy the entire team, i may just address it to the team leader. As a funeral director, I sometimes send an obituary by email to multiple newspapers, so I just leave the greeting off because sometimes I do not know who will be handling it at any of the papers that day. Otherwise, Greetings, Greetings everyone, or something similar. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A It depends on context - I often start with \u201cDear colleagues\u201d, even if it is to something like a customer services address. However just putting \u201cHello\u201d as an opener would be enough when the recipients are strangers. If it is a social context you could try \u201cDear friends\u201d, or \u201cHello everyone\u201d; if it is informal, or part of a frequent chain of messages simply \u201cHi\u201d would be sufficient, and many emails these days just start the message without any openers. In UK many of us feel obliged to put: \u201cDear\u2026 I hope you are well.\u201d Even when it is to more than one person. I think this is left over from letter-writing days, when we were taught write letters, such as thank-you letters, starting them in this way. It does look a little odd in some emails! But it is perhaps more congenial to start with something that acknowledges the individual in some way. Sometimes I find myself going back and inserting a more personal greeting at the start, to show I am aware of the recipient as a person, and am not just thinking about my own reasons for sending the message, and barking it at them. A thing I have noticed is that emails may not be \u201cread\u201d in the same tone that they were \u201cwritten\u201d, so that a mood is conveyed that was not intended - accusation, for instance, or blame, and the message is interpreted in an unintended way, misunderstood. So it is probably a good idea to acknowledge, in some way, the person or people to whom you are writing. [Edit]. Oh. Now that I have spent my time and effort in writing this, I see you have over 100 answers to this mundane question already. Now I feel stupid. You are obviously on the QPP track, and just looking to generate answers for money by A2Aing me. Dear Cory, I hope you are well. Please consider yourself blocked and muted. ",

If you are in contact with the people through an organization, such as a school, workplace, or volunteer organization, it is best to check with them to get their standards. Most places have some kind of protocol. In general, make sure you are blind copying everyone. This way you are not sharing email addresses - not everyone on the list will necessarily be ok with that. You also want to be sure, as the sender, you are using an appropriate account. For example, a school may want you to use an address they have assigned you, and not the one with the amusing name you chose for your gaming contacts. This is for your security as well. Within the email itself, if protocol doesn\u2019t specify, it is good to use a group greeting - such as \u201cGood morning, Classmates\u201d, or \u201cTo all employees\u201d or \u201cGo Team! Game Day is Tuesday`\u201d or something like that. A simple \u201cGood morning\u201d or \u201cGreetings Everyone\u201d will do. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the context and who the people are that you're writing to. You'll also need to think if it's an official or formal email or to a group that you personally know and you're writing not for work. Begin with \u201cDear\u201d if it's a formal, work related or official email. Otherwise you can use \u201cHi all\u201d or \u201cHi everyone\u201d in any informal and not work related context. Going back to the work related, formal or official context, if you are writing to your customers, use \u201cDear customer\u201d, if it's a shareholder use \u201cDear shareholder\u201d, with colleagues \u201cDear colleagues\u201d. You may have noticed that when you write to someone who is outside your company you use the single instead of the plural. This makes the reader feel that he's being personally addressed (although using their name individually would be the best option) rather than in a group. So far it's simple. There are some addressees where additional formality is required, such as when you write to Courts, nobility, royalty. Here you would prefer to write individual emails as you would need to use either \u201cSir\u201d or \u201cMadam\u201d. And this is just touching the surface. ",

You can get uproarious laughter, or fall flat on your face. An example from my career. One of the teams for which I was responsible came into a time critical operation 16 hours behind schedule due to delays in other parts of the bank. We were using a voice mail system for bank wide status updates. At the end of that shift, that team had made up the 16 hours, got their 8 done, and left their section 8 hours ahead on the timeline. 32 hours of work in 8. As I dictated their accomplishments, I wound it up with the words: \u201cCongratulations to the Commercial Lending team for kicking ass.\u201d Ten minutes later I was being lectured by my boss for my use of unprofessional language in bank wide communications when a beep interrupted the call announcing a new message. We mutually put each other on hold and listened. It turned out to be the Chairman of the Board, who had just left a bank wide message, congratulating my team for \u201csome serious ass kicking\".

In the past, I have used \u201cDear Sir/Madam\u201d when I don\u2019t know the recipient (e.g. an email to report a product fault). This is no longer adequate, so I briefly flirted with \u201cSir/Madam/Other\u201d but felt that this was offensive to those who did not accept the binary definition of sexuality and thus were classified as \u201cother\u201d. When sending emails within my organisation, I use \u201cDear colleagues\u201d. This does not place an arbitrary label on anyone, and is professional without feeling stilted. If you are addressing an email to a particular professional group then something like \u201cDear Doctors\u201d may be appropriate, while if it is addressed to specific types of organisation then perhaps \u201cDear small businesses\u201d or (if you are in that group) \u201cDear fellow small businesses\u201d sounds more attractive. Returning briefly to the \u201cSir/Madam\u201d form of address, I asked a colleague a few years ago about this and he said he used \u201cMesseres\u201d. This sounded good, but a quick lookup told me - and subsequently him - that it was a masculine term. That said, I have seen \u201cMessere\u201d used in a computer game to refer to both sexes. Perhaps \u201cDear Sir/Madam/Messere\u201d may be appropriate, but it is not something I would use. If you are unsure of any way of sensibly, non-judgmentally and non-offensively classifying your audience in the heading, I would stick with \u201cDear People\u201d. ",
