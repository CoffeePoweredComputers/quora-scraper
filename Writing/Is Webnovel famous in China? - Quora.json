            "answer_text": "Yes, and actually it\u2019s considerably famous. Most of my classmates read web novels in their spare time. My parents also read web novels. There\u2019re hundreds of millions of webnovel readers and nearly ten million of webnovel writers. What I can say doubtlessly is that web novel will be an extremely prosperous industry all over the world. I\u2019ve read lots of excellent web novels. How I wish that they can be spread abroad! In fact there are people doing these things now. According to statistics, the WuxiaWorld has nearly 4 million active users everday, and its readers are distributed in more than 100 countries and regions, of which North American readers account for 1/3. Besides, more than 100 overseas communities and websites have been translating and sharing Chinese web novels. Some even consider the Chinese Web Literature along with Hollywood Blockbusters, Japanese Anime and Korean Dramas, as The World's Four Cultural Wonders. ",
