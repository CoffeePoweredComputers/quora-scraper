            "answer_text": "See you just need minimum 50% in your class12 board to appear for NEET entrance exam. There is nothing like passing the neet exam. It is a competition ..nothing like mimimum score that after scoring that much you can get any college. for e.g if a person score 580 /720 although its a good score but if more than lakhs got more than 580..than that person will not get any college. If he score 400 and nobody score more than him..although its a bad score but..still be at 1st rank. So basically these competitive exams are relative. Your target should be to crack neet with some great score like 550+to 700+ out of 720 to get a medical college.Forget what happened before and give a fresh start. Start with the basics first.work on your concepts. Start practicing questions as much as you can. for any guidance you can check my other answers. It will really help you that I can promise. best of luck :) ",

            "answer_text": "Not only pass in NEET, you will have to secure good rank in NEET. Only then you will get MBBS seat, if your rank is low you will get dental seat. Neet is 720 marks exam. A student who secured 130 marks is also passed in NEET but he will not get a college or can't select for MBBS. For MBBS seat he will have to cross the cutoff marks. Cutoff marks depend on toughness of paper. If paper is easy for a particular year cutoff will be high, and if paper is tough then cutoff will be low. I hope you understand.
