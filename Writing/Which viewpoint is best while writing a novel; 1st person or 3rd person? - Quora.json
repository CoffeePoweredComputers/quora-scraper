Write what is comfortable for you, and that you have the skills to do well. (Counter-intuitively, First-Person can actually be harder for a certain level of writers). And what works for the kind of story you are trying to tell? Well, I have a couple of opinions. I wouldn\u2019t call them hard facts. More like how it has worked so far for me. First Person is harder to objectify in. Third Person is harder to do running commentary in. I\u2019ll take the later first. Yeah, I started a book in First Person because my character was going to spend half of the book alone and I didn\u2019t want to add a soccer ball just so they\u2019d have someone to talk to. There\u2019s a reason the default for Urban Fantasy has been called \u201cFirst Person Snarker.\u201d And that\u2019s because in First Person you can make all sorts of comments and observations, explain background information, and drop pop-culture references. This just doesn\u2019t work as smoothly in Third Person. \u201cSam looked at the guard\u2019s uniform and all he could think of was Flash Gordon.\u201d On the flip side, it is harder to be a badass in First Person. That\u2019s part of what I meant by objectification. It is harder to torture a First Person because they can\u2019t describe pain without sounding whiney. Whereas a Third Person can go into a blue funk and stop moving or caring, if a First Person were to do that the narration would stop. They also come out short on descriptions. Mirror gag aside (and is it ever truly aside?) a Third Person can be introduced with a terse, \u201cHe had red hair and a physics degree and had served two rotations as a Navy SEAL.\u201d A First Person can\u2019t make a stealth dump like that. They have to say it. And it sounds boasting if not narcissistic. I mean, a Third Person can brush their hair back or scratch an itch without giving a thought to it, but a First Person can\u2019t do anything unconsciously. They narrate their entire lives for us. Make no mistake. With enough skill you can do the same things in either voice. They do tend to gravitate more in certain directions, though, and that might be a good reason to chose one over the other \u2014 for a specific story. ",

            "answer_text": "Third. It \u2018sounds\u2019 a lot better, and makes your writing sound a bit more grown up. I won\u2019t lie, I find it very difficult to read anything in the first person. For starters, writing in the first person kinda locks you into the present tense, as \u2018I did this\u2019 and I did that\u2019 makes it seem like the protagonist is recounting something, which is fine for dialogue, but not so much for a whole book. Present tense in itself isn\u2019t great either, it\u2019s kinda\u2026I don\u2019t really know how to explain it, but it\u2019s kinda simple. Plus if you can change tense, you can change the pace of the story. This option would be more cumbersome if you write in the first person. Generally from what I read online, (tends to be fan-fiction type things, some original stories) first person is the style of a teenage writer, and if you\u2019ve got that in your head while reading it, you don\u2019t appreciate it as much. Well I don\u2019t but I\u2019m kinda an arsehole, so there\u2019s that to factor in. Third person on the other hand makes you seem a bit more grown up, shows you learnt how to write in school, and you\u2019re not writing like a sophisticated five year old. There\u2019s also the effect on the protagonist. Writing in the first person kinda makes the protagonist a bit wishy washy character-wise. Is the protagonist going on the adventure, or is it the reader? If the reader is supposed to be going on an adventure, sure, by all means use first person, but otherwise, stick to third. Third person also means you can remind the reader of your protagonists name in a less obvious manner than someone using the name when speaking to the protagonist. Personally I write in third (except for now obviously), just cos it\u2019s easier to switch perspectives within a chapter. For example (not my writing): Susan walks down the street. She buys bread. John walks down the street. He is out to slay a dragon Here we have clear cut perspectives from two separate characters. I walk down the street, and buy some bread I walk down the street to slay a dragon Even if there is some sort of division between these two perspectives, the reader won\u2019t know who\u2019s perspectives they are, which, the further into the book/writing they get, will become very annoying, the perspectives will get mixed up, it\u2019d be a generally frustrating read. I\u2019m no expert on this though, I\u2019m just giving my opinion on the two persons in writing. I stick to third cos I like it better, and because my stories tend to follow multiple characters at the same time, with no \u2018main\u2019 character. Well there s a main character, but they\u2019re not like, the protagonist. Anywho, I hope that helps answer the question, good luck with your writing :D ",
