            "answer_text": "I got hungry. Bob Schwartz\u2019 \u201cDiets Don't Work\u201d seminar came up when I was exactly at a point that I acknowledged I simply couldn't find a good answer; I couldn't solve the problem. I had used Stillman's diet when I was young \u2014 64 oz. water a day and all protein \u2014 to lose weight successfully; I gradually regained the weight and found that even the same very drastic diet didn't work. Bob was from the physical fitness industry and he had noticed that diets don't work for fat people, regardless of intensity or discipline. He didn't supply the answer; he supplied the question. \u201cWhat is hunger?\u201d He gave 3 rules that work after you allow hunger \u2014 in the gut hunger \u2014 to come up. Eat when you're hungry, every time you're hungry, and don't when you're not.Eat exactly what you want.Stop eating when the taste disappears.I used a 3-day healthy fast to find out what body hunger felt like. From there, it was falling off a log. I had the assurance that there would be no doubt when hunger happened; there's no doubt. Hunger is the physical mechanism that keeps the human species thin. It supports us in doing that. It measures exactly the difference between food input and energy exerted. It makes food choices. It turns the tastebuds on and attunes them to detect the nutrients the body requires. It turns the tastebuds off when the need is fulfilled. Every skinny person knows that; they just don't know they know that. My son was born shortly thereafter. I gained 15 pounds during the pregnancy and lost 35 after delivery. It was an extraordinarily healthy pregnancy and I'm forever grateful that I found the answer exactly when I needed it. Thirty-five years later, I've never had to do anything else. The weight loss occurs at the rate about 10% to 20% the first year and 10-15 lbs a year thereafter. No effort is involved. It's an end to the problem. Only years later did I comprehend that it rewarded me with several hours a day that had been spent constantly dealing with food issues. I knew from the first that the problem was over. It's like being thin overnight and just waiting for it to show up in the mirror. I gave up scales entirely. I don't have to measure anything ever. I didn't increase exercise \u2014 which is what you can do to increase hunger \u2014 until years later. I like exercise, but not mindless exercise, and I eventually discovered that gardening provided the exercise in an effortless sort of way; working outside also returned me to my love of the outdoors, which I had forgotten. The hardest part was giving up everything I thought I knew about food, nutrition, and dieting. Listening to the diet industry mantra is painful; it's agonizing to observe the useless effort so many put into it. More useful information to undo that. Carbohydrates assuage hunger; fats and protein add taste. Satisfying hunger is primal. Compulsive overeating is an attempt to satisfy that primal urge, the need to satisfy hunger. What's missing is the hunger. The reward is taste. An almost orgasmic pleasure for a long time. Hunger turns the tastebuds on. What we take to be taste otherwise is that chewing causes the flavor to rise up the back of the throat to be observed olfactorally by the sense of smell. Different experience altogether. Oh, one more thing \u2014 since this one makes it as easy as falling off a log. Eating to satisfy hunger prevents overeating. Naturally. The inclination to eat without hunger disappears. That does bring up the only problem I've ever run into. Getting too hungry results in overeating. That comes up virtually every time I drink an entire soft drink, so I do limit them. They satisfy something, cause the hunger to disappear, only to reappear as \u2018too\u2019 hungry, which causes overeating. The solution to overeating is to get hungry again before eating again. [ I do want to add this caution and new info regarding the Stillman diet. The damn thing could have easily killed me; it's that unhealthy to do for a long period of time. However, it has been noted that people who do the two week diet leading up to gastric bypass surgery \u2014 which is essentially the Stillman diet \u2014 do not develop type 2 diabetes or cure type 2 diabetes. I'm a prime candidate to have developed that problem, and never did. The diet is used for the surgery to disappear organ fat quickly; and fat in the pancreas has been blamed for adult onset diabetes.] ",

            "answer_text": "The HOLY Grail of weight loss\u2026 This took me 10 years to figure out... If you understand what I\u2019m about to tell you, it will save you thousands of hours of wasted effort. I\u2019m going to give you my entire weight-loss philosophy, what took me thousands & thousands of hours to figure out, in one sentence\u2026 These 7 words, might be the most important weight-loss words ever spoken. If you understand this one sentence, you\u2019re guaranteed to become a superstar in weight-loss. I was researching all these famous and wealthy people. And their lives all had stories of ups and downs and hard times. Some of the stories were unbelievable. And there were all these inspiring quotes from all these successful people. But guess what? There maybe hasn't been a human being ever that said something as smart as what I\u2019m about to tell you\u2026 Can you believe me, someone who was 300 pounds, lazy & unhealthy, can come up with something about weight-loss that\u2019s so brilliant? To the best of my knowledge, I\u2019m the single human being that said this first. You know Steven Hawking hasn\u2019t ever spoken something as smart as what I\u2019m about to tell you. 7 simple words that\u2019ll change your life forever. Ready to read it? My entire fat-loss philosophy broken down into one single simple sentence\u2026 Guaranteed to get you six pack abs\u2026 Gonna save you thousands and thousands of hours of waste and heartache. Ready? Here it is\u2026 You must gain fat to lose fat. Is that brilliant? I was so scared of gaining weight that it prohibited me to lose weight. Fear is what was holding me back. You see the other part of that sentence is: \u201cWeight loss is 3 leaps forward, and 2 steps back.\u201d Finally, I learned the truth! My fear of gaining fat was the reason why I was fat. I realized it wasn\u2019t a sprint, but like an Indy car race, every so often we need a pit stop.3 Leaps forward and 2 steps back. It did not matter HOW many times I worked out, HOW many calories I got a day, WHATEVER routine I bought and did. Nothing mattered but this one simple sentence\u2026 You must gain fat to lose fat. It went against everything I heard that is thought of as common knowledge. It was only by accident I discovered this. My SET BACK was a SET UP for my COME BACK. Like a sling shot. My failure was what made my success. I realized that every time I had a relapse and got off my program diet, I would gain fat. It was depressing. Then when my will power kicked me in the butt and said, Dammit Dan, you\u2019re supposed to be somebody, you\u2019re supposed to do great things with your life. Are you really going to throw in the towel? And I noticed something\u2026 Whenever I started my diet back up, the fat poured off... I would get ecstatic and say: \u201cIt\u2019s finally working!\u201d But after a few weeks of consistent dieting, the weight loss slowed and eventually halted all together\u2026 and my wheels spun again, until my next relapse. So I studied and researched science, not weight loss guides, but actually scientific studies. Boring stuff, no pictures, big words I barely understood. I had to stop every other sentence just to google what some of the words meant. I was a student of the game, never taking failure for an answer. I just knew there had to be something. I researched fat, and carbs, and protein and everything I could. I researched how the body reacts to carbs and fats and everything else. I never knew that fat was meant to be our natural supply of energy and carbs where to be supplement energy. Then it clicked\u2026 holy shit\u2026 it clicked. The light switch turned on, and the words that came to my head were, You must GAIN fat to LOSS FAT! It was so brilliant, so perfect. I went back, studied my relapses, saw where and when I saw the most progress. My own notes became my ultimate guide. I found out that the body must THINK it has unlimited energy, it must think that CARBS are the main source of energy and not fat and it must think the carbs are unlimited. We don\u2019t want our body to think fat is it\u2019s main source of fuel, then it uses it sparingly. The goal is to trick the body into thinking it has the unlimited supply of power. The Trick: We eat carbs for an extended period to convince the body of this, over the normal amount to shock the body. The body HAS to process these carbs, it has no choice\u2026 and when there is an extreme amount, the body ramps up the metabolism and burns them at a rapid rate. So it\u2019s using energy at it\u2019s maximum. This is good because if the body thinks it has the unlimited supply of energy, then it will use the maximum amount of energy it can to perform as exceptional as possible so you can produce the best offspring. The body doesn't settle, it always goes the optimal route, always rises to the top. If it has unlimited energy, it will use the most it can, so we trick the body into thinking this. Then we flip the switch! The body still THINKS it has unlimited energy so it burns the fat as if it has unlimited energy. Imagine Mike Tyson punching a wall of semi-wet clay. His fist would hit the wall at top speed, and stay at a top speed until it eventually started to slow and ultimately stops. We are trying to have Mike hit with the other hand as we pull back our main hand. There is never a lull, always burning fat at top speed. RIGHT before it gets suspicious of what's going on, we hit it with an extreme amount of carbs (Mike\u2019s fist). It then goes into shock, like a reflex it can\u2019t control. This ramps up the metabolism to as high as it can go, using the maximum amount of energy it can. We\u2019re constantly tricking it into burning the maximum amount of fat possible. By doing this we also receive the most energy possible. Keep in mind: Going low carb for too long makes the body realize that fat is it\u2019s main currency and not carbs, your metabolism will slow. Some it will slow more than others based on weight, age & sex. Carbs are a powerful weapon if used right, don\u2019t hurt yourself with the weapon, use it smart, to your advantage. Use strategic routines to accomplish this. Your body is far from dumb. Even if it gets plenty of carbs, but not enough for it to be shocked, then it will know fat is the main fuel, and it knows exactly how much fat it has in the tank. When shocked with carbs, however, it goes into a primitive mode, where it burns as fast as it can just to handle the overload of carbs. It\u2019s not so smart however to catch on to the switch from carbs to fats immediately and still stays in rampant state. To do this, you must eat a surplus of carbs for an extended period of time to convince the body that carbs are the reserve, and that it has unlimited amounts of energy. The body eventually catches on to even this and we have to shock it differently. Once the body hasn't produced any excess fat in a long time, regardless it will catch on. The only way is to shock the system by eating excess carbs and gaining some fat strategically. Once the body catches on to your routine, you\u2019ll have to switch it up. I either do 2 x a week shock for a couple weeks, or I do the opposite and have 1 shock day in the 2 weeks, then 3 back to back shock days. The object is to get the body uncomfortable and always alert. The Formula: Week 1:Two Shock Days & eat at Caloric Maintenance the other days w/ moderate carbs.Week 2:Day 1: Workout Day - .6\u20131g per lb of carbs - Caloric MaintenanceDay 2: Workout Day - .6\u20131g per lb of carbs - Caloric DeficitDay 3: Rest Day - 50g\u2019s of carbs max - Reverse Shock Day (1k below caloric maintenance.)Day 4: Workout Day - .6\u20131g per lb of carbs - Caloric-MaintenanceDay 5 : Workout Day - .6\u20131g per lb of carbs - Caloric-DeficitDay 6: Rest Day - 100g\u2019s of carbs max (no fast acting carbs) - Caloric-DeficitDay 7: Rest Day - 2\u20133g of carbs per lb pound. - Shock Day (LOW FAT/LOWER PROTEIN! The goal here is carbs, not calories. We do need to be at a surplus of at least 500 calories. We want to get to 2\u20133g of carbs per BW lb while keeping calories at 500\u20131k above maintenance. Dextrose powder is good for this. Look for fast acting carbs with lean sources of protein. Protein at .3-.5g per lb.)This is a basic formula. Some may need a shock day every other week for awhile and some may need 2 or 3 in a row. It all depends on how your body is conditioned when entering this path. If you\u2019ve done carbs for awhile, often, you may want to go with the plan above. If you haven\u2019t had any carbs for awhile, do the exact opposite of this plan and have more surplus days then deficits days. Remember that you really have to shock the body on Shock Day, it has to get an extreme amount that it\u2019s not used to. It\u2019s not a \u201ccheat day\u201d or \u201crefeed day\u201d as you commonly hear, this is a Shock Day. The difference is, you eat so many carbs that the body literally goes into shock, frantically burning as many carbs as it can as a survival mechanism. You eat carbs in the morning through the night, lower protein/fat. Eat a lot of carbs this day, as many as you can handle. If you\u2019ve never done a Shock Day, ease up, test it and see where your limits are. Everyone's different, so just understand the situation and exploit it as much as you can. Keep in mind this is just the first two weeks\u2026 As the week's progress, you\u2019ll need to incorporate refeed days and cheat meals strategically. No need to count calories, just consciously eat less on deficit days and more on surplus days. After:  Before:  ",
