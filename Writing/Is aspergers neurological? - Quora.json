            "answer_text": "I have recently discovered I may have Bipolar II disorder, because of this every answer I have written since the creation of this account must be taken with a grain of salt as I wasn\u2019t aware of my condition because of my preoccupation with ASD. Now that I am aware of this I would like those who read my answers to understand some of my pieces were written in a state of delusion, I intended to to harm no one but wanted an outlet for creative expression as I have spent the last years in isolation. Most of the answers I wrote that involved economics and philosophy were NOT written to achieve an agenda, I was writing what I was thinking at the time based off of the books I read and my personal observations, I don\u2019t think I ever claimed to be an absolute expert on anything I wrote on, I was using my intuition while waiting for responses (comments) on my posts so I could understand if my ideas were flawed or not. Instead, many read my answers without providing adequate feedback which encouraged me to keep writing about the same topics. Although I may be Bipolar, I know for sure I have ASD. Indirect communication is hard for me to register. Because of this I have decided to permanently leave Quora as I am not healthy enough to continue writing while maintaining full integrity. everyone has struggled tremendously in some aspect of their life, some handle stress differently than others. I would like to remind those somewhat hostile towards me that I have not had the opportunity to recover my mental health since I graduated from high-school a year ago, since then I have been in two shelters and now reside in a transitional program while having no friends or family to communicate with in a healthy manner. I have essentially raised myself which has positives and negatives. One negative is that without any role models or individuals irl to communicate with I have had to learn the hard way from many of my mistakes, this is sobering as I cannot predict when something will go wrong or even register when I am doing something wrong because no-one informs me. Seriously, the past week I have experienced delusions severe enough to cripple my perception of reality because of Bipolar II. I only came to realize how delusional I had gotten after staying awake for nearly two days before completing breaking down. During this time I instantly felt regret for some of the pieces I had wrote and a review for my math teacher a couple days ago as I had neglected to exclude some of the more radical ideas in them and failed to communicate my message directly. I should have made it clear from the start of this profile I hold no political bias and I do not belong to either side, I just wrote what I felt at the time and now I just simply want to move on past this experience with a better sense of what is and isn\u2019t appropriate to broadcast to the world.

            "answer_text": "Yes; even though autism spectrum disorder is in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders Version 5 (DSM-V) replacing Asperger Syndrome in Version 4 (DSM-IV), it is not a psychiatric condition or mental disorder; it is a neurological condition that causes mental vulnerabilities. One of the most common causes is a sub-optimal prefrontal cortex, where many of the abilities people with autism lack are located. The cause can be genetic (increased cell mass in the prefrontal cortex), natal (testost\u00e9rone or alcohol in the womb affecting prefrontal cortex development) or environmental (traumatic birth, causing changes to the left prefrontal cortex; traumatic reaction to medicines or vaccines causing TBI in parts of the brain associated with autism, including the prefrontal cortex; adverse childhood experiences or social exclusion, causing PTSD-like changes to the prefrontal cortex).
