            "answer_text": "No. Many book authors do not receive advances. Among those who do, advances range literally from a a few hundred dollars to millions. It all depends upon whether the author is a superstar (biggest advances), proven bankable over a string of books (next biggest); has a good agent to negotiate a good contract (varies); debut or unknown but has a killer, blockbuster book guaranteed to sell millions of copies (sky\u2019s the limit, particularly if it\u2019s a book about celebrity or scandal). On the \u201cno or little advance\u201d side would be many genre books\u2014mysteries, romances, sci-fri\u2014or niche books like poetry of the Middle Ages, which have very small potential audiences. For the most part, advances are based roughly on anticipated sales and profits of the book, and whether you are a proven moneymaker. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. Many books are published by small publishers that cannot afford to offer them. Advances are projections of future earnings and many books do not generate much money. Being accepted by a small publisher is helpful in many ways, and even small publishers turn down many many more books than they accept. Depending on the contract, an author may have to return money given as an advance if the book does not perform as expected. ",

            "answer_text": "Many smaller presses offer no advances, while the big five traditional publishers customarily do pay advances. The size of the advance depends on many factors, including whether the the author already has a significant readership or platform, how well the editorial team believes the book will sell and whether several publishers were bidding on the title at the same time. Generally, a new or unknown author will have a tough time landing an advance of a few thousand dollars. Stories of million dollar advances are extremely rare. ",
