            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A.! Average copywriters write average sentences. You, I\u2019m guessing, don\u2019t want to be average. You want to be great. You believe you can be remarkable. That means you need to write damn good sentences \u2026 without even thinking about it \u2026 day in and day out. 1. Insert facts This is nothing more than basic subject and verb agreement: \u201cMoses ate a muffaletta.\u201d Logical and consistent. The building blocks of a story. You insert facts by thinking through the 5 Ws: Who, What, When, Where, Why. Compare \u201cOn the first day of winter Moses fed his muffuletta to the woolly mammoth\u201d to \u201cOn the last day of winter Moses fed his muffuletta to the woolly mammoth.\u201d The significance is heightened in the first sentence, minimized in the second. All by one word. And notice how your sympathies change when I write, \u201cOn the first day of winter, Moses fed his muffuletta to the three-day old woolly mammoth.\u201d Those new facts heighten the emotional appeal of that simple story. It\u2019s the same sort of feeling you get when you read \u201cBaby shoes: for sale, never used.\u201d 2. Create images It\u2019s not a coincidence that the root of \u201cimagination\u201d is \u201cimage.\u201d Imagination is the capacity for people to see the world you are trying to paint. Intelligent people like to use their imagination. Don\u2019t insult their intelligence by over-explaining, but also don\u2019t abuse their intelligence by starving it. Use active verbs and concrete nouns and you will naturally create images. \u201cThe buzzard bled.\u201d Introduce one, two, or all of the five senses (sight, smell, touch, taste, and sound), and you\u2019ll enhance those images: \u201cThe screaming buzzard bled.\u201d Use phrases like \u201cimagine this\u201d or \u201cpicture this\u201d to signal to your reader you are about to paint a picture. Imagine a fifty-something man in a blue long-sleeve shirt, the cuffs unbuttoned, his knuckles thick and coarse. He\u2019s on the side of the road, quibbling over a stack of used cinder blocks with a merchant. In those two sentences you learn the color of the shirt, the state of the cuffs, the condition of his knuckles. I tell you where he is and what he is doing in concrete language. I use very precise language to tell you what he was doing: he wasn\u2019t talking, he was \u201cquibbling.\u201d Something entirely different than chatting. 3. Evoke emotion You can naturally get mood into your sentences if you follow the two steps above, but as a copywriter you don\u2019t want emotion to be an afterthought. You must carefully plan and manufacture emotion. This starts by asking:What problem is he or she trying to solve? Is it fear over losing a job? A spouse? A scholarship? Pride of donating to a good cause? Joy for finally getting muscular definition in his calves? You must know what keeps your ideal customer up at night. What makes him get up early? What are his hopes, dreams, and fears? And then you must insert that emotion into your sentences. In a post introducing the , I wrote: How often are these little tragedies repeated in your life? You write something clever, but everyone ignores it.You hear about a new opportunity, but don\u2019t pursue it because you don\u2019t have the skills or confidence to attempt it.You get overlooked by everybody \u2013 including your boss \u2013 because the guy in the next cubicle seems to know everything about SEO, email marketing, or copywriting.You hear about all the new clients your peers are picking up \u2026 but none are showing up at your door.I identified the relevant pain and agitated it so the solution was a no-brainer. In other words, if you can identify with those conditions, then the solution is probably a good thing for you. 4. Make Promises But as a copywriter you aren\u2019t merely interested in heightening people\u2019s emotions for the sake of heightening emotions, otherwise you\u2019d be a novelist or screenwriter. Entertainment is not a copywriter\u2019s bread and butter. Getting action is. So, you need people to see hope in your sentences: What promises are you making to the reader in this sentence?What advantages will the reader gain?What pain will they avoid if they obey you?I\u2019m guessing you want to write copy that sells. You want to write copy so irresistible it makes your readers scramble down the page \u2014 begging to do whatever it is you want when they\u2019re done reading \u2014 whether it\u2019s to make a purchase, send a donation, or join your newsletter. The promise is that you can learn how to write in such a way people can\u2019t resist your words. And that\u2019s compelling for the right people. 5. Practice, practice, practice Writing great sentences takes work. At first it may feel mechanical, wooden. That\u2019s okay. The goal is to get to a point where you unconsciously blend these elements so they feel natural in the sentence and can\u2019t be pulled apart. Sort of like when a golf instructor stops your swing to adjust your mechanics. That may feel mechanical and unnatural, but eventually your swing becomes natural and he stops interrupting you. Here are some exercises to help you improve your sentence writing: Copy great sentences: Hand-write 100 great first sentences. Memorize portions of great sales letters. Dissect killer lines.Opening and closing paragraphs: It\u2019s arduous to consciously think about each and every sentence you write in a 500-hundred word article. However, you can pour energy into every sentence inside the opening and closing paragraphs.Headlines: Your headlines won\u2019t be complete sentences, but they offer you an opportunity to focus closely on what you are writing.Subject lines: Unlike headlines you can use your subject line in an unconventional way. Write complete, robust sentences. \u201cThought of you while I was at the steam bath.\u201d Who\u2019s not going to open that email up? Measure responses, adjust, and test more ideas.",

Norman Thomas, \"Great Dissenters\" Happiness is not having what you want, but wanting what you have. Hyman Judah Schachtel, The Real Enjoyment of Living The truth is that when we are in trouble we discover swiftly and often painfully what kind of inner resources, what imperishable treasures of mind and heart we have deposited in the bank of the spirit against this rainy day. A. Whitman, \"Resources to Last a Lifetime\" Dr. Robert Harris, water specialist at the Environmental Defense Fund, suggests that before you make a major investment in bottled water, check with the manufacturer as to its source, the type of processing, and results of tests of its content and purity. Jane E. Brody, \"How to Make Sure Your Water Is Fit to Drink\" Nonverbal communications signal to members of your own group what kind of person you are, how you feel about others, how you'll fit into and work in a group, whether you're assured or anxious, the degree to which you feel comfortable with the standards of your own culture, as well as deeply significant feelings about the self, including the state of your own psyche. Edward T. Hall, \"The Sounds of Silence\" The teacher's job is not to implant facts, but to place the subject to be learned in front of the learner and, through sympathy, emotion, imagination, and patience, awake in the learner the restless drive for answers and insights that enlarge and give meaning to the personal life.
