            "answer_text": "I think I am the one who can answer this question. I decided to take the medical field when i was in class 10 as i know that doctor is one of the nobel, respected, demanded profession in today's world. So I started to study about NEET and various exams required to become a doctor. I took some notes , study material from my relatives and friends to make my dream true. and after 12th i gave that exams for which i am waiting for 2 years. I got rank in range of 2 lakh, It destroy my whole dream. So I decided to take admission in some degree college like DU and filled the form. After some time someone told me that you should give yourself one more opportunity to pursue your dream and take a drop. I think for some days and decided to do that. I started taking coaching in Aakash Institute.I got some good marks in aakash test. After one year I again gave NEET and I got 80K rank. This makes me clear from my mind that i was not born to become a doctor \ud83d\ude14. Now the answer of the question As my father is a teacher and he is very much settled in his field. so i decided to took this stream. So Now I am Pursuing BSc BEd 4 year integrated course from RIE, Ajmer. My advice to all of you is that, no degree is small or big, the thing that makes the difference is the way we are pursuing it. We can earn the same fame, dignity, pride by Doing BSc as MBBS , but we have to do that in the right spirit. \ud83d\udd25 ",

            "answer_text": "I choose bams because if you don't get mbbs ayurvedic medical college has a good scope as in this branch you well learn both ayurvedic as well as allopathic medicine you learn everything as a mbbs student learn in there branch. But let me tell you bams is a branch where you will have learn sanskrit which is one of the biggest/tough point that all student face it and in you have to write all the answers in hindi with shlok. So I would say please work more harder to achieve good rank in neet so that you can get good branch with good college. Let me tell you I have cleared my neet exam but as day by day nta is making more rules its important to clear neet to get admission in medical college . I hope you got your all the best ",
