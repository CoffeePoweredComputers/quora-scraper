            "answer_text": "Sure. However, prisons do not let people wander around, nor give them tours, just to satisfy curiosity. A prison is not a zoo nor a freak show. If you show up at a prison, without knowing a prisoner, the staff will inquire rather deeply into the purpose of your visit. They will naturally be suspicious that you may be trying to set up or aid an escape attempt, or some other mischief. I once visited a State Prison, and asked to see the prison cemetery. That was regarded as quite peculiar, in fact unprecedented. After I explained that I wanted to see the grave of a specific deceased prisoner, who was a good friend of an inmate who had been transferred to another prison, they were extremely open and helpful. The prison cemetery turned out to be quite an attractive natural area, which was well tended. They were able to locate quickly the grave I wanted, and cleaned off the headstone so that I could get some good pictures. In fact, the official in charge of the cemetery gave me quite a lengthy history of the place, and a detailed description of how it is operated and cared for. He even showed me the registry of the graves, which included military veterans from the Civil War onward. And he pointed out a number of graves holding former members of notorious criminal gangs from the 1920s and later \u2014 gangs featured in TV dramas and documentaries. Interestingly, the prison cemetery is not open for visits by current prisoners, to see the graves of their deceased friends. That is considered a security risk. Only outsiders, mainly family members, are allowed to visit the cemetery. Sadly, I was told that family members never come to see the graves of their deceased relatives, those who died in prison. And this for a cemetery which had been operating for most of the 20th century. I was the first outside visitor in more than 70 years. Not only are most prisoners neglected while they are imprisoned, they are utterly forgotten about after they die. ",

Even visitors visiting an inmate on visiting day had to use a phone in the parking lot to call before coming up. I once was walking around the track and on the other side of the fence this guy just came walking into view, walking on the roads outside the prison the patrol cars do. I was afraid to talk to him because I was worried the staff might think he was there to me but I was like \u201cdude, what the f*** are you doing!? They\u2019re going to roll up on you and arrest you.\u201d Literally 5 seconds later a patrol car rolls up flying, the CO jumps out and starts questioning the guy. Two more come up. Later on I found out from one of the CO\u2019s the guy was just taking a walk and walked up on the prison and thought he could walk through it. Obviously not. Other than that people I saw from the outside come in who weren\u2019t there to visit the a specific inmate included: InternsStudents from the Dental SchoolOutside religious groupsOutside mentors (mostly religious)Special guest speakers (rarely)Outside construction crewsOutside medical and fire personnel for drills (while we were locked down)Groups of politicians touring the facilityThe organization that did the annual \u201cCertification\u201d processThat was really it and it was a rare occurrence. They did not do tours for the general public. Federal prisons have also long had a policy against letting cameras inside the facilities. ",

However all states do not have the same policies on that.Usually allowances for this are made for legitimate organizations such as legal firms,clergy or church groups and also members of the press. And there is probably permissions given to doctors,but I can't be 100% positive on that. You can't as well as I know, just go to any place of incarceration and request that you be allowed to visit any inmate just because you want to.Most places require that an inmate complete a visitation list that must be approved by the prison administration. Visitors also are required to have valid identification as well and not been incarcerated for a certain period,sometimes you have to be immediate family members or a spouse. Your best bet would be to call and ask for their policy. Hope this helps you. ",

When I was in prison they would often bring tours of average citizens through to allow them to see a little of what's going on behind the walls (although they also prohibited the media from coming in) and show them some fake unit where it looks like we are living in the lap of luxury. In any event, if you really wanna see what's going on from someone that lives there I would look through the newspaper and find a name and go visit that person. You will get a good look at it from the inside out that way. And you will also have made someone's day. ",
