            "answer_text": "The more I thought about these sentences, the more I understood the reasons they are confusing from a foreign student\u2019s perspective; so I will try to explain what the best option is, and why, using the barest of grammatical terms, which sometimes can be off-putting. The correct choice is \u201cYou are the best thing that ever (HAS) happened to me.\u201d Here\u2019s why: First our sentence has 2 parts, called clauses, the first: \u201cYou \u2026are the best thing\u201d, (the word \u201dthat\u201d) introduces the second, which is : \u201chas ever happened to me. \u201c If you were to re-word the sentence, what would you get? \u201cThe best thing that ever has happened to me, is you.\u201dThis shows that YOU is not REALLY the subject of the sentence, rather \u201cTHE BEST THING\u201d as a CONCEPT or IDEA of \u201csomeTHING\u201d, is the subject; and since a \u201cthing\u201d is inanimate, therefore 3rd person singular: i.e. I have, you have, he, she , it HAS. Confused? The added problem in all of this is the pronoun \u201cYou\u201d requiring a bit of English Language History. From Old to Middle to Early Modern English there were 3 singular pronouns: I, Thou, He/She/It, and 3 for the plural: We/You/They. Soon YOU meaning singular AND plural became more common, and by the mid 1800\u2019s people weren\u2019t using THOU at all in common speech (except for some religious sects even today.) What is one supposed to use, and what verb form ? The matter was settled by using the 2nd person plural YOU, along with its plural verb form, to cover BOTH singular and plural. How do you tell the difference? By context. Two final points: 1. it is perfectly acceptable in the original sentence to say: \u201cYou are the best thing that ever\u2026. happened to me,\u201d eliminating \u201chas\u201d: In that case you are simply changing the past tenses, from compound to simple past. And 2. You will also hear \u201cYou are the best thing that has ever happened to me,\u201d with \u201cever\u201d in between \u201chas\u201d and \u201chappened\u201d in the compound past. I myself likely would say something similar, and I have heard it in colloquial speech as well. (To me, it places the stress on \u201cever\u201d, whereas placing it before \u201chas\u201d sounds somewhat stilted.) Nonetheless it is frowned upon by some purists., who prefer \u201cYou are the best thing that ever has happened to me.\u201d I make no judgment here. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "The main clause is \u201cYou are the best thing.\u201d The subject is \u201cyou,\u201d the verb is \u201care\u201d and \u201cthe best thing\u201d is a predicate complement, specifically a predicate nominative. Then there is a subordinate clause modifying \u201cbest thing.\u201d Its subject is the relative pronoun \u201cthat,\u201d which stands for \u201cbest thing,\u201d and therefore it\u2019s singular. Therefore you want a singular verb form, \u201chas\u201d if you\u2019re using the present perfect tense. If the main clause had been something like \u201cThose are the best things,\u201d then the relative pronoun \u201cthat\u201d would stand for \u201cbest things\u201d and would be plural, and the verb would have to be the plural form \u201chave.\u201d The point is that \u201cyou\u201d is not the subject of the verb in the subordinate clause. It\u2019s the subject of the verb in the main clause, and the verb is \u201care\u201d which is the appropriate form for \u201cyou.\u201d The subordinate clause has its own subject and its own verb. In other words, the sentence isn\u2019t saying \u201cyou \u2026 have happened to me\u201d; it\u2019s saying \u201c\u2026 the best thing \u2026 has happened to me.\u201d Native speakers of English don\u2019t consciously analyze sentences that way. We have learned how the language works and we do the right thing without thinking about it. Which is correct, grammatically, \"you are the best thing that (has) ever happened to me\" or \" you are the best thing that (have) ever happened to me\"? ",
