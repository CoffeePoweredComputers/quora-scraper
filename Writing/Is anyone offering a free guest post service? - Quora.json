            "answer_text": "To write a good article or blog post, it can be hard for some people. And it\u2019s undeniable as one of the best ways to build a successful blog and grow your online business. Hence, it\u2019s hard to find people who do it for free as this writing skill need passion and learning to be the best. Still, if you want to get your brand mention in high authority site and then raise your brand awareness, you can catch curated marketplace to help you achieve this. They will get you a high quality guest post writing and submission with dofollow links. Sounds good? Here are top 3 benefits of guest posting: 1.Get quality traffic By doing guest posting, you will receive a quality traffic not just about the number of traffic. From my experience, while visitors from stumbleupon spend an average of 1 second on my blog and result in a 90% bounce rate those from my guest posts spend as much as 4 minutes on my site and only have a very low bounce rate of around 40%. 2. Build online presence Guest posting on other sites that are bigger than yours is a perfect way to affect others\u2019 lives and make them have a good memory of you for the rest of their lives. You may wonder if you can\u2019t influence people on your own blog, but the fact is that by bringing the audiences of other bloggers together compared to when you\u2019re standing alone, you\u2019re going to reach far more people. 3.Increase exposure and brand awareness Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve written a blog post with 20,000 users every day and your guest post has been viewed 5,000 times. Although from that guest post you may not get more than 300 visitors to your website, the fact is that your name has just been revealed to 5,000 more people. If this continues and you start to see more people visiting your blog or website because they\u2019ve seen your name online enough times to make them curious about what you\u2019ve got to offer. As a conclusion, guest posting is a good way to make new relationships with other loggers as well as a source of traffic and exposure. ",
