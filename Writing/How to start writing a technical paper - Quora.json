            "answer_text": "The best technical papers provide an answer to a question that others might ask.   Structure Start off with a statement of the question, and an overview of why it is significant.  Cite references.  (Answering multiple, related questions is okay too, but be sure they are closely related, or else write multiple papers.) The next thing a reader will want to know is why other solutions or approaches didn't answer the question already.  Thus, you want to provide some description of related work by others (with citations).  What did other people do?  Did they try to answer the same question or something related?  Why weren't their outcomes suitable? Cite references.  Next, describe your assumptions, experimental design, data, etc.  Then describe your solution and how you went about finding it.  Be clear about the limitations and any possible sources of experimental error. Penultimately, you can write about other questions that came up, other approaches, implications, etc. Finally, restate your question and the answer you found.  Acknowledge any particular sources of assistance or insight that didn't rise to the level of coauthors. Pitfalls Here are some of the common problems with technical papers by new authors: The paper describes the building of a \"thing\" instead of the answer to a question.  OK, so you built a program, mechanism, or circuit \u2014 big deal \u2014 lots of people build things.  What does yours do that others don't?  Why should we care?The paper is poorly structured, uses bad grammar, or has lots of spelling mistakes.   A paper that is difficult to understand may not be read.  This also applies to overly long or wordy papers that present too much information that isn't needed.The paper doesn't show a relationship to other work.  Good results always build on other things.  If the author fails to relate her/his work to prior results, it (should) make the reader question whether this is duplicative and the author is simply unfamiliar with what has already been done by others.Plagiarism: Not only is it a major breach of ethics and sometimes law, once discovered it casts all of the author's work in shadow: if the author will steal someone else's work as his/her own, can we ever trust anything else \"written\" by the same author?For the same reasons as plagiarism, don't ever falsify results or outputs. (You can see what my department publishes for our students: Academic Integrity)Suggestions A carefully chosen graph, diagram or equation is usually much clearer than several paragraphs of descriptive text.  However, if not done well, those same items can completely confuse the reader to the point of abandoning the paper.Write an outline of the paper, first, then fill in the outline.Use whatever spell check programs and grammar checkers you have at your disposal.  Fix what it flags as incorrect.Don't use sarcasm, insults, humor, or exaggeration in your technical writing \u2014 not all of your audience will \"get it,\" and many will dismiss your serious writing because of it.  Leave those embellishments for informal correspondence and Quora answers.After you have thought about all the above. look at some papers that you (or others) think of as good examples.  Pay attention to how these points are addressed.  Studying how another person writes a paper (or a program) can give you insight on how to improve your own work. I have compiled a set of links and suggestions on good technical writing: Info for Spaf's grad students. (That page also has informative links on research ethics, how to do a PhD proposal, and more.)

            "answer_text": "Based on the conversations with hundreds of published research scholars, professors and independent researchers, below are few steps you can follow to get started with your research writing. Some of the ideas here might sound counter-intuitive - they are, the focus is on to get started and to learn by doing. Start by writing. In this amazing talk, Simon Peyton Jones from Microsoft Research explains how writing can \u201cquick start\u201d your thought process on your research. Personally, I have experienced writing as a way to think deeply in any area I want to build my knowledge on.Don\u2019t worry about \u201cpath breaking\u201d ideas. Ideas especially at early stages are raw. You will have to spend the time to nourish and develop them. Just start with an idea that can be validated and will be useful.Don\u2019t try to put in too many concepts in one paper. Focus on one simple construct and build your arguments around it.Make it interesting! Academic papers need not be boring. If you want your knowledge to spread around, take the time to construct your narrative in a way that is easy and interesting for readers to grasp the information. Introduce your concept, tell why it\u2019s interesting, the idea, how it works and how it will solve the problem. An original and unconsumed idea is a huge loss to science.Write the abstract at last. By the time you are done with your research paper, you will have a better grasp on what you are talking about. It\u2019s far easier to write the abstract at the end than at the beginning.Use your writing as a way to question your own assumptions and inferences. This way your writing can sharpen your content for the better.Use tools available to weed out unwanted parts of your research process. For example, for following author guidelines and formatting, try Typeset- it automatically applies all the rules on your content in a click. You can use Mendeley to discover and collect all your references. So when you are ready to write your paper you can quickly get your sources in a click. If your research workflow is online you can also use Paperpile.Reach out to people who have already published, understand what it takes to be published. Share your paper with reviewers whom you trust. Usually we spend a lot of time writing and less time for feedback. Take lesser time writing your content, and more time getting it reviewed. Especially if it\u2019s your first paper, you might spend more time on aspects of paper that are not important. A good reviewer can help you shape your paper for the better.Identify parts of research paper that are more important. Yes all parts are equal, but some are more equal. For example - your idea, its introduction, the problem you are solving - these areas will have more eyeball views than say details or bibliography. Focus on making the argument strong in these areas.Get it read by your friends and see how easy it is for the information to be grasped and absorbed. Are they getting the idea, the problem? are they seeing the solution directly linked to the problem? Presenting your knowledge in an easy and simple way is as important as the idea itself.Now that you have gotten started with your research writing, there are few things you have to take care of to improve your chances to get published - Choose the journal carefully - Your article should fall within the scope of the journal you are submitting to. Read recently published articles in the journal to ensure this. Not doing this ground work would mean that you will be submitting your article to a journal that would not even consider your paper to begin with.Build research of impact - If you are looking for a high impact journal, to get published your content\u2019s impact should be in line with what has been published so far in the journal. You will have to explain clearly what are the gaps in knowledge your paper is addressing and how does it stand in the context of research in the space you are writing on. There is a basic necessity to explain the theoretical implications and the practical applications of the concept you are proposing.Follow author guidelines specified by the journal - Now there are journals which are not that strict enough with authoring guidelines but still majority of journals insist that you follow the rules and specifications to the tee. Ensure your manuscript has all the mandatory sections of the journal and follows the formatting rules. Using tools such as LaTeX or Typeset- Auto-format your paper to any journal in a clickcan help you achieve journal compliance easily.Construct a strong argument - Clearly present your idea and validate them with sufficient data. Properly arrive from the data to conclusions without any invalid or un-validated assumptions. Use clear, recognizable procedures and methodology to present your data and arrive at conclusions. Ensure that the results are statistically valid. Talk to a reviewer or mentor to validate if your research can be concluded as complete.Use good references - Use latest and good references - references from sources which have good impact factor. Avoid too many self-citations.Communicate effectively - ensure good choice of words and language quality. Arguments should be clear, valid and logical. Present the story in the order of logic, not in the chronological order of experiments. Ensure that language, structure and figures presented are all clear.Write review pieces - Research paper reviews and responses have a better chance of getting published, especially if you have just started your career as a researcher. And you will get a better idea of the publishing eco-system. Publishers and journals like pieces which stimulate discussion on a recently published article.Writing vs editing - To begin with, try to convey your knowledge in simple words. Plan all the different sections that needs to be written and start writing in your own words. Once you have written all the arguments, you can then proceed to edit/format.Keep the core idea clear - Don\u2019t try to cram everything you know about the topic in one single paper. Write the basic argument of your research paper and build supporting evidence around it. If you feel that you have multiple ideas, you can split them into separate papers than confuse the readers on what is the research you are advancing.Getting good co-authors - Even though majority of research sounds solitary, it need not be. Having good co-authors could actually improve your chances - you can split the work, be more effective and efficient, and authors having complimentary skills that contribute to the research could help improve the final output.
