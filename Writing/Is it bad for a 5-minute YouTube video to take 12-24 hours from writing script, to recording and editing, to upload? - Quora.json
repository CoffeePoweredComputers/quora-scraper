And vice-versa! Time taken to do an edit, write, shoot, et.does not necessarily equate to quality. I have directed, shot and edited interviews and had them on air in a matter of half an hour or so. It happens in news all the time. I have, written shot and edited TVCs within a few hours and had them on air the same evening. Possibly they weren\u2019t great works of art but they did the job. I have also done the same where the editing alone for a 45 second TVC took three weeks and about 10 recuts and pack changes, firing of the VO artist and a client who changed his mind whenever he came into the suite. It happens! It\u2019s easier on You Tube because you don\u2019t have to meet broadcast standards.\u2014or any standards as far as I can tell , and you probably don\u2019t have clients, And of course it could be a single shot 5 of minutes with a VO read by a good VO artist, needing no real editing excerpt black on either end, On You Tube in a couple of hours. The main thing is the content and the execution - the time taken is not relevant. ",

            "answer_text": "Well that depends on the video, and why you consider that time frame bad. For example, a typical Kurzgesagt video takes approximately 1200 hours of labour to create. That\u2019s around a 100 solid working days, and in actuality that works out to about 2\u20133 designers and 2\u20133 animators plus a team of others working for many weeks, sometimes more than a year to create a single video.  So are you suggest that you\u2019re not creating content fast enough, or is it that you\u2019re not putting enough time and effort into the content? ;) Its all relative. ",
