            "answer_text": "Ha ha ha ha ha. Of all the ways you can make money, writing books is so far down the list that it\u2019s a joke. If you want to make money as a writer, try technical writing or reporting. At least with those, you have a chance you\u2019ll earn money the same month you wrote the story. Books typically pay money a year after you write them, and that\u2019s if it\u2019s a book that gets accepted right way. And the amount of money them make, the ones that are accepted, published and sell, is less than you would make stacking the shelves in Penneys. The majority of published authors have a day job which pays the bills. And the ones who live on their writing income tend to have an income which just about feeds them and pays the bills. They are not driving around in fancy cars. ",
