            "answer_text": "I think one of the best ways to learn how to write like an artist is to look at their history in terms of lyrics and how they developed their current writing style. Here's an excerpt from one of the earliest Justin Vernon recordings, \"Morning\" off of his 2000 album All of Us Free by Mount Vernon (Vernon was 19 when this was released).  The sun's coming upWind is blowing through the treesMy country road is quiet nowAs quiet as it can beAnd I wake up in the morningtimeWith the sun breaking in my bedroom Thematically, we see a pattern that continues throughout all of his lyrics: a focus on nature and rural life. We also see Vernon eschew typical rhyming patterns - though the second song section of this particular song does feature a lot of rhyming. Let's skip forward a few years. Justin released a few albums in the 2004-2005 years. He wrote \"Silent Signs\" under his band DeYarmond Edison off his 2005 album also named Silent Signs. Non given tuesday,and only your star studded birthday suit remainslong and tamethe end of sundaya gain thats lost like ones head now you're wishin'don't be done and the pain is just a comfort gone from missinglike the green leaving when the wind starts hissing desire directionand once a little vital laugh sings introspectionredefinedburied in brotherhoodmy body's built much braver cause i once befriendedbut gone from me know So we can see right away that in these 5 years, he's developed a much different lyrical style. For one thing, he's using extensive metaphors as opposed to directly telling a story. This becomes really the key attribute of Vernon's writing for the rest of his career. You might also notice that there's a lot of rhyming and a lot of alliteration - it almost reads like a poem rather than a song lyric.  A year later, Vernon released the album Hazeltons under his own name. The title track is very reminiscent \"Holocene\" from his 2011 album Bon Iver.   Settle up, you're calling up the pain\nSitting dead, the sinker and the string\nYou came, you saw, you sawed her brain\nCut out all the parts that held your stain Starting to see a pattern? Tons of rhyming, tons of assonance - a very playful use of words and language - and a strong use of metaphor to blur the subject of the song. The excerpt is presumably talking about the process of moving on after a difficult breakup, but then again, who knows? It seems more concerned with the way words look and sound next to each other than making a clear story. It's also very vivid in its word choice. Skip forward two years and we're at his first Bon Iver album, For Emma, Forever Ago. There's plenty of famous examples of great lyricism here, but I think one of the most illustrative is \"Flume,\" which Vernon states is the first song he wrote off the album.  I am my mother on the wallWith us allI move in water, shore to shoreNothing's more Only love is all maroonLapping lakes like leery loonsLeaving rope burns, reddish ruse Only love is all maroonGluey feathers on a flumeSky is womb and she's the moon You're probably starting to see a definite pattern. Again, tons of rhyming, half-rhymes, consonance. Just a lot of words that have similar sounds put together because they sound beautiful. \"Gluey feathers on a flume, sky is womb and she's the moon.\" What does the song mean? It's probably about his mother, maybe not - water seems to be a recurring theme, but the point is that it's just vivid imagery, all very nature-oriented, that's beautiful composed and you can just breathe in the feeling of it.  One more example and then my conclusions. This is \"Beth/Rest\" off of the second Bon Iver album, Bon Iver.  errant heat to the starand the rain let inthe hawser rolls, the vessel\u2019s whole and Christ, it\u2019s thin well I\u02bcd know that you\u2019d offer would reveal it, though it\u2019s soft and flat won\u2019t repeat it, cull and coffer\u2019s that for the soffit, hang this homeward  pry it open with your love sending lost and alone standing offers It shares a lot in common with Flume, don't you think? The incessant rhyming, the implaceable feeling that you're reading a secret language developed between two people in love? The word choice is so strange that it almost seems nonsensical - he references a \"hawser,\" which is the heavy rope they use to dock ships, \"coffer,\" which in this case probably means a recessed ceiling, and \"soffit\" which is the material that bridges the gap between the walls of a house and the undersize of its roof.  So, after that long study, your question: how do you write lyrics like Bon Iver? - Rhyming. Coming up with creative ways to put words and phrases together that share sounds and not just at the end of the line.- Imagery. Focus on natural themes.- Metaphor. If you're writing about a specific thing, try blurring the details and focus on specific images, specific thoughts, specific places. ",

            "answer_text": "Die and be reincarnated as him? Give the Devil your soul in exchange for having exactly the same talent as him? BASES ON THE SONG BELOW : Joking above aside, IF you have the basic talent to begin with, analyze his songs. What chords does he use? What type of lyric rhymes? LEARN to fingerpick, as with this song. Also LEARN to use the different male voices you have (bass, head, soprano, hush, dirty throat). Sing the lyrics you write and NOT just the melody! Analyse the structure of the songs he wrote that you like. Look at the chords of a song and how the chord at the end of one of the sections leads theoretically into another. Learn to strum the chords he plays in the songs you like. Vary your voice loudness to flow along with the emotion. I know you may not believe me, but I have written a couple of songs like this one BUT NEVER recorded them for the reason that my \u201cdouce moiti\u00e9\u201d is bothered by the emotional sensitivity of the sort that you can hear sung in this song. Hearing this song makes me want to pull out a song or two I wrote like this one and threw away because the pain was too apparent when I sang it. FOUR million people listened to this song on YouTube? I guess that there are actually a lot of people who like this kind of emotion and song. Thanks for introducing me to this artist that I had never heard of before.  ",
