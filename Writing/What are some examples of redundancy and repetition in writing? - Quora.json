            "answer_text": "Redundancies I find often while editing: The nape of his neck itched. (Where else does a person have a nape?)The wrist of his forearm. (Right, that wrist. Not the one on his leg.)The palm of his hand. (His palm is adequate, unless you\u2019re talking about trees.)He nodded his head. (What else would he nod?)When rowing with oars, keep a steady rhythm. (You only row with oars. If they are paddles, you\u2019re paddling.)Surrounded on all sides by forest. (Surrounded means on all sides.)The evening sunset. (What, it\u2019s different from the morning sunset?)Saute the stir-fry vegetables. (Well, it\u2019s better than boiling them.)Careless writers use repetitions too often. I highlight repetitions and suggest the writer use synonyms to eliminate repetitions because over-use of repetitions can be distracting in a sentence or paragraph. However, if you use repetitions judiciously for emphasis, such use is often ignored. Sorry, couldn\u2019t resist. ",
