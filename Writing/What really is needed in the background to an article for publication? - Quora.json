            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s first just talk about getting an article published. Every publication has a target demographic and an editorial slant. I\u2019m going to tell you a tactic that has worked for me. Go through the publication in question and look at every ad, and I mean every one. For each ad, try to determine who the ad is targeting. What is it trying to sell? What message is it using to sell it? I wrote all this down so that I could more easily spot trends. If you do this, you will get a remarkably clear idea of exactly what the publication\u2019s demographic and editorial slant is. Of course, you also need to examine the articles for style and subject matter. How long are they on average? How much detail? Do they start with an anecdote, or with the main information all in the first paragraph? Why go to all this trouble? Editors get blizzards of submissions every day. Most go directly from the inbox to the rejected file because they don\u2019t fit the publication\u2019s strategy. Don\u2019t fool yourself that your piece, which is too long, of no interest to the demographic, or not in the preferred style, is so amazing that you can convince the editor to break with all her guidelines. This is very unlikely. I\u2019ve been both an editor and a writer and have learned a very important lesson. The easier you make the editor\u2019s job, the more likely you are to be published. Editors are overworked and underpaid. They don\u2019t need people making more work for them, especially new writers they don\u2019t know. Once you establish a relationship with an editor, she will probably give you more slack. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Essentially, what is needed at the background of any formal writing is an introduction sort of. Whatever the topic of your article, there must be a cursory insight into the article in terms of the content, significance as well as the relevance of what you want to get across to the audience. You can start with general facts, statistics, illustrations, examples, or anecdotes spiced with the right dose of relevant definitions, quotes, analogies etc. in order to lend credence to what you will discuss in the main body of the article. Now this helps the reader to come to term with the thrust of your write-up. Regards, Izuchukwu ",
