            "answer_text": "Here, the sentence uses wrong punctuation mark, comma. Several comma (,) usages are to separate idea(s) and finish the dependent sentence (in beginning). Comma can also be used before conjunction. Here are some examples: There are apples, oranges and bananasWhen he is reading, I am cookingShe loves\u2026 , but she hates\u2026For more comma usages: 13 Rules For Using Commas Without Looking Like An Idiot The sentence you ask above should not use comma because there is no conjunction after comma. If you want to use comma, your sentence should be: \u201cShe doesn't want to be videoed, so that's why she didn't look at the camera.\u201d\u201cShe doesn't want to be videoed, and that's why she didn't look at the camera.\u201d To combine both of them without using conjunction, you need to use semicolon (;), which one of its functions is to join the independent clauses which are related to/contrast to one another. Then, your sentence will be: \u201cShe doesn't want to be videoed; that's why she didn't look at the camera.\u201d** If you want to use period, your sentence will consist of two independent clauses: \u201cShe doesn't want to be videoed. That's why she didn't look at the camera.\u201d",

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t correct in formal writing, because you have two principle clauses (\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to be videoed\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s why she didn\u2019t look at the camera.\u201d) You can have two or more clauses in a sentence, but in formal writing they must be joined by a co-ordinate conjunction that usually shows the relationship between the ideas in the clauses. She doesn\u2019t want to be videoed and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t look at the camera. She doesn\u2019t want to be videoed, so she didn\u2019t look at the camera. She doesn\u2019t want to be videoed, yet she looked at the camera. She doesn\u2019t want to be videoed, but she looked at the camera. You cannot use commas to join clauses; commas separate things to make the meaning clear. The exception would be a list of principle clauses like this: John did his homework, Mary played video games, and the twins cleaned the house. Here the list structure supersedes the rule about joining clauses. ",
