            "answer_text": "Why yes, you can. As Zen says, there is no secret handshake. But it is hard for the following reasons. If you are publishing a scientific paper, it must be scientifically sound. By that, I mean that your findings and conclusions must be well reasoned and based on current scientific understanding. It is likely that it must contain references to scientific literature to place it in the framework of current science and if it has conclusions that are contrary to accepted science, then there must be darned good reasons to back it up. I say this because I occasionally run into people who are not trained as scientists and they want to convince me that they have showed that, for example, plate tectonics is all wrong. Usually, there arguments are not scientific, they have cherry-picked some piece of data, and their reasoning is neither trained nor sound. There is a reason that scientists take 5\u20137 years of study to get a PhD. If you try to publish your paper, you should read (very carefully) the journal guide for contributors. Your paper should be appropriate for the journal and should be in the format and length that the journal requires. If you don\u2019t do that, expect a swift rejection. The journal will send the manuscript out to anonymous reviewers, who are likely scientists in your field, who will judge the merit of the manuscript. If your manuscript is not well written or not written in a good scientific style, your reviewers will probably not appreciate it. If you have connections with scientists, it\u2019s always a good idea to ask someone to review and critique your manuscript. And by the way, criticism is a part of science writing. It is usually helpful, however, it may not seem that way when your beautiful manuscript filled with deathless prose and razor insight comes back with red ink all over it (or the electronic version of red ink). Criticism gives you insight to how other scientists will see your manuscript and allows you too make it better. The vast majority of papers I have written were returned for major to minor revisions.
