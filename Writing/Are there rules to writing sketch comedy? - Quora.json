            "answer_text": "There are very few rules in sketch comedy, and like most things in comedy, it is OK to break them (but only under careful consideration!). The main rule is that your sketch should focus on one single comedic premise (also known as \u201cthe game\u201d of the sketch). If you have taken improv with UCB, then the \u201cgame\u201d is also the one weird thing about the scene. It\u2019s the \u201cgame\u201d that gets heightened and escalated throughout the sketch that keeps the pacing and jokes interesting. It\u2019s also important that the \u201cgame\u201d is simple. If you are unable to communicate the \u201cgame\u201d of your sketch in a single sentence, then chances are it\u2019s too complicated. This is critical because your audience must understand the context in order for your jokes to land. If the \u201cgame\u201d has too many layers or you\u2019re attempting to tackle too much in your sketch, then many times the main comedic premise gets lost and the audience won\u2019t be with you when you make your biggest jokes. In which case, cut all the superfluous stuff and only focus on exploring the funniest game (all of the other jokes that may address other games in your sketch would only be seen as distracting for the audience). Similarly, sketch writing, like any other form of comedy, relies heavily on economy. Use the fewest number of characters. Jokes should have the least amount of words to effectively get to the punch line. Get to the game as fast as possible (where the game is revealed to the audience) so that every subsequent joke will land. Lastly, read your sketch outloud! This will help you uncover awkward dialogue and pacing. And share your sketches with your friends\u2014don\u2019t write in a vacuum!! ",

            "answer_text": "Just like there are rules to writing in general, there are definitely rules to writing sketch comedy. Process matters. Whether you think of buttons (the ending) first or like to think of witty premises or characters, at some point your sketch has to have a beginning, middle and end. Fortunately, you can look at any storytelling arc to identify how to develop these. \u201cOnce upon a time, THIS existed. Then, suddenly THIS happens. Because of THAT, then THIS happens. Then a crazier THIS happens. Until finally, THIS ends it all.\u201d I like to think of sketch comedy writing in beats. For example, Beat 1 - The Setup Beat 2 - Something odd happens Beat 3 - We see this odd thing become a pattern Beat 4 - Break the Pattern (also called The Turn) Beat 5 - Resolution / Punchline Not every sketch has to have 5 beats. They can have 2 or 3 or 10. But, that\u2019s the main process for writing sketch comedy. Here\u2019s a really simple example, I like to teach: Beat 1 - Guy is walking, trips over log. Beat 2 - Guy is walking, trips over small pebble Beat 3 - Guy cleans entire side walk paying close attention to every possible little thing to ensure that there\u2019s nothing possible there that he could trip on. Ending - Guy walks - trips over white line painted on the sidewalk \u2014 Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "When it comes to advice about sketch comedy, ignore what most people tell you about \"finding the game\" or heightening the situation and just try to write something that makes you laugh. There is no hard and fast rule which school of sketch comedy is best but funny is funny no matter how you present it. My only other advice is to get in and get out. Make your point and move on. A sketch is a one night stand and not a romance. Usually you first pass at a sketch is always going to be your funniest. There are places like UCB that preach breaking down the sketch and and analyzing it bit by bit. Writing classes there often make you work on one sketch for more than one week. That is absolutely the worst idea for most people because funny is an instant thing and not something to labor over.Ut may and has worked for many people but I believe the vast majority of people trying to write a sketch are better served committing the original idea to paper and then going onto something else.

            "answer_text": "There are certain principles that one can learn that would help them with their sketch writing (i.e. establishing their game, as they say at UCB, or ways to present your idea clearly and efficiently in order to get out of the way for jokes). That said, I think everyone can sort of figure out their own style of sketch writing. I think that the most exciting part of sketch writing is when a writer sort of transcends clearly explaining something and just servicing an idea and actually puts a lot of their personality into it. I think everyone has their own ideas of how to get their own ideas across. I think you would say an SNL sketch is very different from a Tim and Eric sketch, but the underlying theme is they get their ideas across clearly in the way they want them to come across. The ideas are understood by the viewer, as long as you are making your idea clear and concise. I think the most exciting part about reading a sketch, or watching a sketch, is the surprise element of seeing jokes in there that you never expected to see or have never heard before. ",

What do your characters want from each other? In the material sense, and in the emotional sense. And why are they here? And why now?

            "answer_text": "A lot of these answers are about writing something focused on story. Sketch comedy isn't necessarily about a story. It has its own needs: Find the one unusual thing/funny idea, and find ways to heighten it and explore it.  If that one unusual thing is true, what else would be true? How would people act?  What else is strange in the same, but possibly bigger way?  Try to keep it simple and not clutter it with jokes. The simple ideas hit the hardest. Look at videos that have hit big and gone viral: They're just one simple idea explored and heightened. ",
