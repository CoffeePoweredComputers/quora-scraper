            "answer_text": "It really depends on your experience level, what types of clients you are working with, and how well you can negotiate your fees/salary. From a previous answer I wrote: A content writer can earn as much as his skills are worth, or rather, as much as he can negotiate from clients based on his skills and negotiating ability. It\u2019s true that content writing jobs that are advertised by companies, or on sites that outsource content writing to freelancers, pay very little for new graduates, and not that much higher for experienced writers. And while the salary/fees are low when you're starting out, perhaps 10-15k/month, with a lot of time spent writing and learning (take online classes, read as widely as possible, follow good writers in advertising and bloggers like Ramit Sethi and Tim Ferriss and Ryan Holiday), you can boost your earnings very quickly. Part of a content writer\u2019s job (a term I\u2019m not a big fan of, which is why I use \u201cconsultant\u201d rather than limiting myself to only a writer) is to educate clients as to what he or she does, which is not just writing copy, but actually thinking about how to refine the client\u2019s brand, how to get people more interested in a product, etc. This involves some marketing thinking, some sales, even some design and business development type thinking. A content writer writes things the client asks for. A consultant comes up with ideas for what the client should have as written content, gives the client advice on how to bring in more clients using the web content, how to pitch the business, etc. Imagine that rather than signing up on 10 websites for content writing freelance jobs, you spend time going out and meeting people (or reaching out online via LinkedIn, social media, etc.) to companies that might need your services. Imagine you alsodistinguish your service from that of other writers by showing examples of previous work in your portfolio, etc. Yes, you can\u2019t do all of this (have examples of past work) if you\u2019re just starting out. But even just starting out, you don\u2019t have to accept what the company is offering without negotiating. If you really believe you\u2019re a great content writer, even if you don\u2019t have 5 yrs of experience, offer to do a small piece for the client free, with the understanding that you can then discuss further work if they\u2019re interested. Now you have some leverage to negotiate a higher rate for your work, rather than simply accepting the rate they offer to every single content writer they talk to. Yes, being able to negotiate is itself dependent on your actual writing skill level, where you are (if you are in a small town with low demand for content, you can\u2019t charge high rates\u2026but that\u2019s where the internet changes your reach), etc. But you can start with figuring out how much you can charge and what you should charge, rather than what you can get paid and what companies will pay you, and then negotiate. Notice how you are flipping the script on who decides what the rate is. Whether it\u2019s with freelance sites or with individual clients, or with people in your network, you always have the option to negotiate. Sure, you might have to sign up with sites that offer freelancing opportunities for content writers, when you start. But don\u2019t depend on these for survival and get addicted - they won\u2019t pay very good rates, and you also can\u2019t develop your own client base since you get no contact with the clients. Go out and network - I\u2019ve met clients simply by doing the things I normally do every day (sports, going out with friends to a restaurant or for coffee) and talking to new people about what they do and what I do, and offering to help with their business. There is a huge demand for content, which means the same clients who are outsourcing their work to the freelancing sites can also be found by you directly, with a little effort. You have opportunities everyday to connect with new clients, whether offline (ideally) or online. Talk to people, pitch your services, and when it comes to prices, don\u2019t accept the first offer. Negotiate\u2026worst case, they can say no and you can choose whether to accept the original offer or walk away, but you always have the choice. Another thing to keep in mind is working on a project basis rather than an hourly or per words basis. A lawyer doesn\u2019t charge on how many words there are in a contract, and a software engineer doesn\u2019t charge based on how many lines of code are in the site or program. If anything, coming up with content that is shorter and punchier and more effective takes more work than writing a long piece, as you have to do multiple drafts and edit things down, since you have a shorter attention span from the consumer to make an impact. So why would you charge by the word and charge less for a key piece of short content? Just something to think about - your pricing should be based on a combination of factors like difficulty of the material, how much time you\u2019re spending on it, if you have to do further research, type of client (corporate vs. individual vs. nonprofit) and there\u2019s no fixed answer. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept whatever is being offered. Change the game. I've never worked full time as a \"content writer\", rather I've worked in marketing producing content for an investment firm, done tech recruiting, and now consult on content and business strategy. I think it's highly possible to make 1-1.5lakhs/month as a consultant for content, rather than branding yourself as a content writer and going with the rates freelancing sites and many clients offer you.

            "answer_text": "There are quite a number of variables that determine how much you can get paid. These include: Your level of expertise in the field. The longer you\u2019ve been writing content the more people are willing to pay you as they perceive you to be an expert in this field based on your years of experience.How you position yourself. If you\u2019re just starting out don\u2019t be disheartened. This does not automatically mean that you'll get the least paying writing jobs. If you manage to position yourself as an expert in the field from the get-go you can create a good source of income for yourself.Positioning yourself as an expert would include things like having a professional-looking website or profile. Put yourself in the prospective client's shoes and write content that will provide them with useful information that will show them that you know what you\u2019re talking about and you\u2019re the person they should be hiring. Think about where your prospective clients hang out and make sure to be found there interacting with them. The more you do this the more they trust you and therefore the more money they are willing to pay you to get the job done. Okay, now let's talk actual figures One platform that allows you to place yourself in front of clients is Fiverr. This is a good starting place for beginners. Writers charge within the range of $5 - $200 per article. How you price your service is entirely up to you. However, as a beginner, you might want to start on the lower end of that range just to get your foot in the door while using this platform. Make sure to give each project 110% percent because the more good reviews you get the higher up Fiverr will rank you and a higher rank will allow you to charge upwards of $100 or more per article. Below are some links of websites that can pay you upwards of $100 in exchange for a well-written piece of content (in some cases even with very little experience) include Write For Us - Contribute - Best PickistWrite for Us, Share Your Hard-Earned Parenting Wisdom, Get Paid - A Fine ParentGuest Post GuidelinesContributor's guidelinesBarefoot Writer offers the best freelance writing jobsWrite for Ushttps://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/guidelinesWriter's Guidelines | Great Escape PublishingWOW! Women on WritingBecome a Link-able Author & Earn More for Your WritingI\u2019m sure you can google other sites that offer writing opportunities. Some websites don\u2019t always have a writing opportunity open therefore in order to earn as much a possible in this field you might need to be highly alert and check the websites on a consistent basis. Lastly, I advise you to make yourself active on Linkedin and make sure your profile is detailed in regard to the kind of writing you do. I got my first few clients on Linkedin and two of them I didn\u2019t even have to look for because they found me instead. ",

            "answer_text": "I would like to write a detailed paragraph including market standard salaries and well-accepted evaluation criteria practices when hiring a content writer, just for the benefit of fellow writing enthusiasts.  There a few considerations before deciding the pay scale for a content writer. LocationExperienceSkillsJob profile Because most people are driven by the maximum monetary benefits associated with a profession, not otherwise, I choose to keep the location as Bengaluru. Because Bengaluru is a relatively higher-paying hub. So, yes, location-wise salary variations are significant for a content writing job in India. Due to the excess of scope and lack of skilled professionals, content writing is a growing commercial rapidly. Based on the relative cost of living, employers decided the minimum end of the pay scale.  A good thing about a content writing job is in its selection process. Most employers expect the best from their employee. Hence, they try to make their decisions very informed. As a result, experience of a writer is what they look at in the very first glance at the resume. For a entry-level writer, typical pay scale ranges between 1,50,00 to 5,00,000 (INR). Base salary: 1,20,000 - 4,50,000 (INR)Compensation and benefits: 2,000 - 50,000 (INR) And for a mid-career writer, pay scale ranges between 1,80,00 to 8,00,000 (INR).Base salary: 1,50,000 - 7,50,000 (INR)Compensation and benefits: 5,000 - 50,000 (INR)  But experience alone doesn\u2019t provide enough information to make a decision. What is the point of experience when the skill set is not updated? Probably this is one of the messiest crossroads employers are in. Striking a balance between the work experience and the skills acquired is a must for any profession in general. With a decade of experience and outdated skill set, you are not portraying a promising self-image. For a content writer, SEO, copy writing and editing the content are a few skills that add an edge.  Content writing is an umbrella term for different types of professional writing. Academic writingBusiness writingCreative writingTechnical writingCopy/Content writingAcademic writing involves refurbishing scientific data and ideas into easily understandable, authentic and simple write ups (essays, dissertations, research papers etc). There is a very little room for creativity in this form of writing. The reason behind this is the rigid writing styles and predefined structural layouts. An academic writer not only writers, they also edit and proofread the content. Business writing has two verticals too. Emails, notices, memos etc fall under the bracket of casual/informal business writing. Business plans, business models, business proposals, project reports, brand manifesto, business communications, marketing campaigns etc are all formal business writing verticals. Resumes, cover letters, recommendation letters are personal business writings. Creative writing is perhaps the offers the diverse writing opportunities for a writer. Novelty, creativity, and innovation are the three wheels that keep a creative writer running. Literary writing (fiction and non-fiction), Screenwriting, Dramatic writing, Poetry, Comics, Autobiographies, Journalistic writing etc are considered a part of creative writing. Technical writing is what helps common man understand the depth of technologically advanced topics, products or operational facts. In the form of catalogs, descriptions, operation manuals, how-to guides, troubleshooting pages etc. Copy/content writing are often used interchangeably. Copy writing is to promote. Content writing is to inform. Advertisement copies, brand slogans etc are the work of a copy writer. Blogs, website content etc are the responsibility of a content writer. The reason for explaining these types of professional writing is that they all command different pay scales. Creative writing, copy writing, content writing are often very competitive as the availability of skilled writers is pretty scarce. Academic writing, technical writing, and business writing, on the other hand, are a little less competitive relatively. A typical creative writer is paid more than a technical writer.  The highest salary of a content isn\u2019t an absolute number. Based on excessive considerations, the pay scale can be narrowed down. The idea behind this answer is to help writers self-evaluate themselves. Instead of dreaming unrealistic dreams, setting informed expectations is always better.

            "answer_text": "An infinite amount of cash, depending on your price per article and your writing frequency. However, a great way to approximate the amount you can make from copy writing is by gauging your price per article. While your pay per task depends, to a large extent on your skill level and the type of jobs you bid on, you can earn any amount ranging from $2 to $50 for 1000 words article (or even more as this is my pay range since I embarked on my writing journey). However, good pay takes both time and commitment to better your writing skills and create a network of clients, thus attracting new, better-paying prospects. For a start, you may opt to establish a personal blog or enroll in a content mill. However, starting a blog may prove costly and disappointing for a newbie with little grasp of steps for unique content creation. While content mills are highly competitive spaces, they are ideal if you are new to writing and seeking to learn what comprises good \u201ccopy.\u201d Although many demonize content mills as a sinkhole for writing skills, this was my path to my current writing position. Honestly, the start is not a stroll through the park. Usually, being a newbie on content writing mills means bidding on less paying tasks and taking tons of criticism in your stride. After gaining some recommendations, you can gradually increase your charge per article and earn a price worth your skills.

The term content writer is same as copy writer/s used in other domains like Advertising Agency, Newspaper group or now a days in Digital Marketing firm or if you are working online as a Freelancer. Suppose you are working in advertising agency or in Newspaper industry - same person will be known as copy writer or part of Editor team. Although there is not much difference between copy writers or content writers - but still different fields need specific skills. Copy writer should know how to writer short, sweet, catchy lines or headlines along will good copy. Where-as now a days content writers usually in Digital Marketing Firm work as per Keywords after doing Keyword research. So if you work in advertising or Print Media / Newspaper / Publication industry - sky is the limit as per your capacity. But will start based on your bargaining capacity. You can earn 15,000-20,000/- plus as a beginner if you have really great ideas and writer wonderful lines. If you work as a Freelancer you can bargain and if you become famous you can demand more. But usually for example: if you take projects online than you can ask for Rs. 500 to 1000 or $ 30 to 40. Do whatever you feel and explore but go join Advertising agencies or digital marketing firm big one/Good/ reputed ones; earning will be good but only if you can handle pressure and attitude of others.

            "answer_text": "Content writing is a profession that gives you the freedom of expressing your thoughts and moulding it into the shape that you desire. Today many people are willing to take up content writing as a full-time profession. But why should you shift from your 9\u20135 job just to sign up for another similar tedious work life? As per my understanding, freelance writing is the best option in this scenario. As a freelance content writer, you\u2019ll get the liberty to work according to your schedule and get the freedom of enjoying your own space. I have worked as a freelance writer, and with experience, I could make one conclusion; always consider the exposure. The first thing you should look at is the vast diversity and consistency that you get offered. If you go for a platform where you have to bid for projects, there is a question of luck. So choose a platform that ensures you the maximum exposure and respects your time. WittyPen is one such content marketing platform that brings together bright minds. Clients who understand the value of digital marketing and content creation, and writers who are passionate about delivering the best content. We pay you no less than you truly deserve. You appreciate your professional goals and help you grow because, at WittyPen, we give the writers the liberty to work on projects according to their domain of interest. We make the payment every week. So you can count WittyPen as a constant source of income. It will be unrealistic if I give you a specific number because as a freelance content writer, you\u2019ll get the freedom to earn as much as you want to make. ",

            "answer_text": "My first earning as a newbie freelancer writer was around $1 for 500 words, that was in 2011. I was not particularly concerned about the pay, I was happy that I could earn money online doing what I love the most - writing. But as I learned how to write very well, my rates also increased tremendously. So, I can say that the amount of money a content writer earn is dependent on two things: Experience: Are you a newbie writer just starting out? How many articles have you written so far? Do you have substantial knowledge in the niche you write for? All these things will determine your earning. You can\u2019t expect to earn what professional writers earn as a newbie writer. It won\u2019t work.The quality of your content: What can you offer your clients as a freelance writer? The quality of content you writer matters. Is your content Search engine optimized? Do you include inbound and outbound links? Does it have images, graphs, and charts? All these things will determine the quality of your content and it will affect your earning as a writer.Newbie writers can earn $1 per 100 words and if you are an experienced writer that knows your onions, you can earn as much as $50-$100 per 500 words.

Elaborating this, as a freelancer content writer there are no proper slabs out there that the recruiters or even freelancers follow for payment. It all works on what the writer asks and what the recruiter agrees on. Personally when I started out, I used to receive Rs 700\u20131000 per month. The only key to earn more is keep going, keep proving good content and keep looking for better opportunities. Hope this helps. ",
