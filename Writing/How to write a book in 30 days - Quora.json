            "answer_text": "Start writing your 1st draft as per the thoughts bursting out of your mind without caring for the feeling that you are writing a book. You have to complete the 1st draft with 10-12 days. Now relax or have some outing for 2-3 days and then come back for 2nd draft. Now start shaping your book as you wanted. You have to remove all the extra stuff you have put in 1st draft and narrow down the long sentences and use perfect words with synonyms. Now you will have your 2nd draft in your hand, try to complete this process in one week. At this moment you have to take help of others either from your friends or from a professional editor to edit your 2nd draft because it is quite difficult to mark out own mistakes like spellings, punctuation etc while writing. While your draft is under editing process,  you could design a descent cover for your book. For editing  professionals would not take much time within 4-5 days your correction would be marked on your written draft.This is the time to make a last move to complete your project by writing the final draft. After completing's final draft you can go for publishing. ",
