            "answer_text": "Song writing is largely song-editing. I suggest starting with an idea and writing down a lot of words or phrases that support that idea. Metaphors, imagery, memories, personal stories, historical/cultural references and literary references are all valid content to pull from. Take all of these supporting thoughts, write them on a page in a sort of word-cloud and then begin to organize your thoughts. You may have a good idea you can go back to at a later time. I also think that starting with a catchy chorus melody/hooo is a good place to start building your idea. Practice your writing just like you would practice an instrument. Grab a pen and organize thoughts every day. Maybe pick an object and write descriptive terms about it to get yourself in a creative mindset and keep describing things in your head throughout the day. This sounds mundane, but it can really help make you into a good story-teller. ",

            "answer_text": "Feel the music. The best lyrics match the vibes of the music and build upon the overall mood, penning down the abstract feeling in words.   Listen to the music repeatedly. Ponder upon what the music makes you think and feel.  Then come up with 3 - 5 different ways to convey that thought and feeling to the listener. Imagery and metaphors are your best friends.  Hum along, find random words to fit in (in case you are aiming for end rhymes).  P.S. - Mumford & Sons, Leonard Cohen, and Passenger have some of the best lyrics. Look up some of their works for inspiration. ",
