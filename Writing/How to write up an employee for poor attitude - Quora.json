            "answer_text": "I am not sure you can, unless their poor attitude is reflected in their work ethic, and their performance. You can verbally warn them that their attitude is affecting others, and if they are having a tough time, the workplace is not the place to let off steam. Poor attitudes can often be seen as a sign of already existing morale within the workplace, or it could be just their personal attitude, and the way they think. You can\u2019t warm someone for being angry, or feeling miserable, but you can warn them about the effects. In customer service, you can write them up for failing to serve the customer properly, and siting examples of poor attitude making situations worse. In an industrial workplace, a poor attitude is reflected in their interactions, what they say, and behavior. They can also show poor quality work as a result, and bring the rest of the plant down. In the end, the employer has to balance the needs of the company, the needs of the employee, and the needs of the customer. Sometimes, someone else has to take on the responsibility of being the employee in order to balance the needs of the other two parts of a working business relationship. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, personally, I would document a little chat. Hopefully other measures have been tried first. It depends on the severity of the attitude and your personal managerial style. So I\u2019ll speak from my own scenario. As a supervisor, a bad attitude isn\u2019t going to bother me much, at first. I would want to sit the employee down and have a chat, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You seem a little too unhappy here.\u201d Open up a discussion. Clear the air. Is it the job, the environment or is it just all from the employee? I would explain this conversation needs to be documented, so it can be written up. I would say it\u2019s a start, so hopefully things can improve. In all fairness, the employee might have a legitimate complaint, or something we can work with. If the attitude had specific wording or histrionics directed at me or any other employees, it would be documented as a verbal warning. Especially if the attitude is demoralizing others and impacting the work environment or performance. And especially if others have complained about it. Again, it depends on the severity and its impact, but there is a gamble that any write-up is not going to improve someone\u2019s attitude. (I definitely know that I myself have been guilty of an occasional bad attitude, and kept most of it to myself. Thankfully, no one wrote me up.) ",
