            "answer_text": "The name you choose to call your blog are largely determined if you want to build a personal brand or a company brand. Next is based on the niche you have chosen to dive into. While the name you give your blog is very important, what matters most is, do you have a blogging business plan? Without a successful blogging business plan, your blog is dead on arrival. Struggle will be the order of the day. With an effective blog business plan, backed up with solid blogging pillars, stealing customers from your competitors becomes a walk in the park. I\u2019m speaking from experience. I have seen it play out a multiple times. So focus on the major not the minor. Some will tell you to choose a search engine friendly name, avoid symbols and use a name that is easy to pronounce but at the long run, what matters most is whether you want to promote personal brand first before company brand or the other way round. Good luck! I am Emenike Emmanuel ",

I wouldnt worry about the SEO stuff right now (but as the others have said, be careful about any porn innuendos! I would totally stay away from anything with the word porn in it).  For example, if you are going to \"niche down\" and write a blog about mascara, you could name it something like \"the mascara chronicles.\"  When I started a beauty/fashion blog, I knew I wanted something that was going to begin with \"L\" because that's what my name is.  Hope that helps! ",
