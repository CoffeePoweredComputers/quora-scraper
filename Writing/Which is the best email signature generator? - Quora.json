            "answer_text": "I am the maker behind signature.email, a new email signature designer and generator for companies.  signature.email - Email Signatures for Designers & Agencies It is more than a simple generator though, it is a powerful no-code design tool that gives you creative freedom to design the exact email signature that you want. You can start with one of our templates and then literally change anything about it. Drag and drop fields, change fonts, colors, sizes, add more fields, no limitations. In my experience using signature generators, this allows for the creative freedom to make what you want and have it match your brand well. The other important piece of the tool is the signature sharing that is included with paid plans. You can design your template for your whole company, choose which fields are baked in the template, and which fields an employee needs to fill in their own information. Then distributing the signature out to your entire company is as easy as sending out a link, like this. Each employee fills in their name, title, etc. and then copies and pastes the signature into their email client. Easy as pie. No IT involvement needed. Unlike some of the other signature generators out there, signature.email doesn\u2019t have per employee pricing. So it ends up being much more affordable than some of the other available options. ",
