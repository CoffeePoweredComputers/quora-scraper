            "answer_text": "The major factor to convince a property owner to develop his property in partnership with you is to show him the financial prospect of such venture. First you need to let him know that this will come at no cost to him and that all outcomes will be profitable to him. Most importantly, you must prove to him that getting in this project in partnership with you will lead higher profits after sale that simply having him sell the property as is. Your homework starts by defining the cost of \u2018square meter of air\u2019 that is the zoning of the property distributed over how many share meters of built up area that is sellable. Then you define your overall cost of construction including municipal and other fees and of course final fees of subdivision and utilities connectivities. The property owner does not care about your interest rate and you bank charges, that is something for you to evaluate. While you will be counting on income from sales as you are still under-construction, try to avoid mentioning this to the property owner. I am assuming he is an entrepreneur as well and giving valuable ideas to him will drive him to take the project by himself without you. It is important to show some history of your previous experience in this field if you sense that he is hesitating. Never ever lay all your weapons up front. Don\u2019t loose focus on your objective. Your main strategy is to show him the potentials of profits and that going in partnership with you is certainly more lucrative than selling the property as is. As you enter into the convincing stage you might refer to you experience, to your financial capacity ONLY if necessary. Because all of these words will become commitments. Show him your selling strategy but don\u2019t expose your intention to use the income from early sales as source of construction. Be very specific in numbers and always go for the lower estimations. The numbers are your best friend. A final advice, don\u2019t be chauvinistic and be down to earth as possible while showing full confidence in your proposal. This could be achieved by explicitly and repetitively explaining how he has nothing to loose, only to profit, while you are investing into the construction and sales. That going in this project will put the burden on you alone and it is your many at stake not his. I invite you to visit couple of my project in Lebanon: House Sale in Lebanon - Adma 236 and 2872 Mansourieh ",

            "answer_text": "What quantity of land ? Zoning ? Location and features/issues? Ownership characteristics: individual v. group; business v. family, etc\u2026 Your proposal must be specific to the situation - as well as the audience. At a minimum your business proposal / prospectus must address the following: 1- Why will the property owner be better off with your participation ? 2- What prior experience / expertise do you bring from similar projects? Who will you be bringing to the projects as associates and/or subcontractors ? 3- What references - land owners; development partners; bankers; legal & accounting can you provide ? 4- How will you handle entitlements, approvals, permits, agencies & inspectors ? 5- How will you fund your idea and what contingencies do you have in place if things cost more, take longer or don\u2019t go as planned ? 6- How will you protect the equity and position of the land owner during the different stages of development ? Why will the landowner\u2019s attorney agree with your structure and protections ? There are many more details - but answering these essentials in your proposal will start the conversation. ",
