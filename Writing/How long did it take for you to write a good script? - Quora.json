            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve seen all kinds of nonsense about the time it should take to write a screenplay. This is, I believe, largely as a result of the urban legend that anyone can write a screenplay because everyone has been watching TV, so how hard can it be, right? And then there\u2019s the big payday all the lazy screenwriters get because money just falls on them from studios and networks once you\u2019re on the inside, so all you gotta do is figure out how to do a screenplay and sell one. Just one and you\u2019re in. Go to Amazon and you will find missives that can teach you how to write a screenplay that will sell in 90 days, 60 days or 21 days, if you\u2019re not into that whole rounding to nearest zero thingie \u2014 apparently that 21st day is doosey. But, if it\u2019s the money you\u2019re interested in, save yourself a lot of work and just play the lotto. Not the big Powerball kind but the smaller State ones where the odds are only 7 million to one. The odds are even better on the scratch offs. My point is you have better odds of winning something with the lottery than you do of writing a screenplay in a set period of time and then selling it, which I assume is what you are asking about because if you\u2019d done one before, you\u2019d know it\u2019s not something you can pick up over a long weekend. There are writing \u201ccoaches\u201d or \u201cmentors\u201d charge to teach you how to write, but you gotta ask yourself what is their motive to teach you well and quickly given you are paying them. Caveat emptor on anyone/thing/product that says you can write a commercially viable piece in XX period of time. There\u2019s no standard time period to write it, no particular genre to write it in, no favored plot, no topical subject, no nothing you can count on to sell a screenplay. Except the writing, your original voice, the compelling characters and their sizzling dialogue. And in the final analysis, none of that comes from anyone else. Don\u2019t ask me how long it takes, I\u2019m not writing your screenplay. You are writing your screenplay. Ask yourself. And then do it. ",

            "answer_text": " If you mean career-wise, it took about 3 years before I \u201cgot it\u201d & was able to write awards-friendly & production-ready scripts. If you mean start-to-finish, I wrote my first feature contest winner in 48 hours at a retreat with other screenwriters. We were at the haunted hotel where Stephen King wrote The Shining. The location inspired me to write my first & only horror. Two out of ten of us completed our scripts, & I went on to do a few tweaks, submitted it to StoryPros International to get feedback & was shocked to learn it won grand prize. It is currently under option. Most of the time I can eke out a first draft in anywhere from a couple weeks to a few months, but getting it \u201cgood\u201d takes a lot longer. Sometimes months. Often years. There is no \u201cright\u201d timeline whether for your career or your specific script. The best way to ensure you keep moving forward is to build early momentum. Puke out that first putrid draft as fast as you can. 48 hours, days, weeks, months. Whatever it takes. Then rewrite-revise-rewrite to spin it the vomit into gold. ",
