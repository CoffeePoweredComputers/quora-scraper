            "answer_text": "Reading articles to improve your RC skills for the GRE is a great idea! However, you have to choose your articles wisely. :) First some reading suggestions:  1. Vocabulary in Context: The New York Times, The Economist, The Atlantic Monthly, and the New Yorker2. If you're interested in reading longer books, and not just articles: GRE Vocabulary Books: Recommended Fiction and Non-Fiction  Now, to make sure you're getting the most out of each article, you should consider a few things when choosing what to read:  1. Subject Matter: the more esoteric the better--this will give the most \"GRE-style\" prose. The Arts/Literature/Essays and Science sections will be a good start.  2. Length: since the GRE requires you to pay attention for almost 4 hours (!!), you need to work on your concentration. One way to do this is to choose long, rather than short, articles.  3. Analysis: you want an article that offers an opinion or a viewpoint, like many of the GRE RC passages do.  4. Density: try to find articles that are relatively dense (ie, use long sentences, complicated sentence structures, big words, etc).  Hope that helps! ",
