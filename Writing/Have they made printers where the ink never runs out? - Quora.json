            "answer_text": "There have been a few. One common type is in most cash registers: thermal printing. No ink, it prints by causing a chemical reaction in the special paper. Downsides: expensive paper, the image fades over time. You could also use a laser cutter to print by burning into wood. No ink used, just loads of electricity. There have also been photo printers that used polaroid film. Disadvantage: limited size, expensive \u2018paper', potential chemical residue. It turns out that inkjets and laser printers are economical and practical ways to print without a big up front cost. Laser printers are generally more economical in the long run. You do need to buy replacement ink or toner periodically, but you can minimize the cost by researching ahead of time. ",

            "answer_text": "I bought my first printer in 1983. It used no ink whatsoever. It used thermal printer paper. These are still in use today in some adding machines and receipt printers. There are also impact printers, which use a different type of paper that changes color when impacted by the print head. These are also common for printing receipts. ",
