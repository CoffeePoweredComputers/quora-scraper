            "answer_text": "OVERSHADOWING The plot should not be overpowering your characters. There should be a basic conflict between the main characters. The major/basic story conflict is what you want your audience to focus on. Whether your plot is drama, comedy or adventure. Usually the basic conflict is good vs evil. There is also the grey area where the anti-heroes operate. Your characters should be developed enough to let the audience know which side they are on. Keeping the amount of conflicts to a minimum. You will have to make the decision about the correct number of conflicts. Too many conflicts will overpower your characters. Be careful: plots can become filled with contrivances. (The basic plot has backed you into a corner and there is an addition of implausible plot points). This could destroy and overpower your characters\u2019 credibility. Everything should be subordinate to the development of your major and supporting characters. Too many conflicts will overpower the actions of your protagonists. Things might become confusing. There should be just enough conflicts to give the viewers a break from the main plot conflict. ",

            "answer_text": "The trick to character development is knowing that it doesn't come out of backstory or dialogue so much as behavior specific to that character. Find moments and opportunities for that character to act in ways only she or he would act. With fresh, unique, and compelling moments in which that character acts and pushes the plot forward, your character will never be over-shadowed by the plot. Behavior is character development. Backstory and dialogue only support it. For more information on writing, I can recommend my book, LATERAL SCREENWRITING, because it is not a \"My way or the highway\" type of book, and it has LOTS of Hollywood stories that can fill in the gaps in your understanding. After it is over, you should have a good place to start from. Also, I just published THE LAST REVEAL - Movies, Screenwriting, and the Decline of Western Cinemazation. ",
