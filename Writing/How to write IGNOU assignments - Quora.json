            "answer_text": "Here it goes, I strongly oppose copying the ready-made assignments because at times, answers aren\u2019t right. So, if you want to copy, use your mind before doing so.To write assignments, either you use rule sheets or A4 size sheets. Because assignments need to be hand-written.Before start writing assignments, go through the questions and try to find the answers in textbooks. You\u2019re likely to get most of the answers from them.Make use of online resources as certain topics are better explained in online resources compare to text books.If you writing in continuation, leave some space before writing next question. Or you can start a next answer from fresh page. It\u2019ll leave no space for doubts or ignorance.If a question seeking explanation, include conclusion in your answer under the head \u201cConclusion\u201d.Highlight important lines or points in your answers.If you\u2019re working professional and pursuing course from IGNOU, then make a goal to write one answer daily. This way you can write assignments easily and without any pressure. If you able to write couple of answers a day, then it is better for you. It\u2019ll help you to avoid last minute run.Insert page numbers and mention the total page numbers for an assignment on cover page. In case, somehow the officials lose couple of pages, then it would be their responsibility and you\u2019ll get benefit of it.Submit assignments properly. The sheets must be stapled properly. And, submit it in report file instead of stick file to avoid the situation of misplace by the officials.A note: Writing assignments on your own actually help you for examination. Because it force you to study the topics in a subject and allow you to have an idea about the topics. So, try to write it on your own rather than asking someone else to write it for you. ",

            "answer_text": "I haven't studied from IGNOU but made assignments of my gf. So you can understand that ignou never verifies who is writing the Assignments actually. You must write the assignments and not print. Hand-written work is must. I gave approximately 6pages per Question which is fair enough. Never write less than 3 pages as it creates a bad impression.In the first page, staple or attach the printed page containing the centre code, enrolment no. and paper code.You will generally get all the answers from book itself. If you don't get, then google is there.Don't try to copy pase the ready made answers given in YouTube or Google by passed out students. Most of the students do this thing and that's why answers look same. These students don't get good marks for the same reason.Always begin a new Question from a new page. I did that and have also kept one blank page before every question's answer with some decoration.50% is the pass marks for Assignments and about 35% for theory papers. (These vary from subject to subject). However, weightage from Assignments is only 30% and from theory paper it's 70%. Example: Let's say you got 60 out of 100 in an assignment (50 is the pass mark). For the same paper, you got 40 out of 100 in theory (35 is the pass mark). So your total % of this paper will be calculated as (0.3*60 + 0.7*40 = 18+28 = 46%.Write with good handwriting. Prefer A-4 pages. You can even write in simple white pages of standard quality. I did the same for my gf. Though the paper quality was bad, but it's ok as I had a lot of white pages. So we didn't have to buy A-4 pages (1 question taking 6 pages means one Assignment taking approximately 30 pages. So 4 Assignments will take about 120 A-4 sheets).Highlight important lines with black pen if you are writing with blue pen and vice versa. This is important as examiners don't read all lines. So they must know that the student is aware of the concept.",
