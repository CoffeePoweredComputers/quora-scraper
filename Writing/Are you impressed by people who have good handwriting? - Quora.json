            "answer_text": "Absolutely yes! I find it fascinating, that some people are comfortable writing fast and still maintain a beautiful, clear and neat written expression on the paper, which makes it easy to the read to read and understand clearly and accurately the text. It is a rather impressive ability and such people, in my honest opinion are inherently gifted. I rarely find myself looking at their scripts and reading them with such careful attention, that I fully block all distractions around me and my conscious awareness. It very much shows someone who has a creative personality and someone who seems to be an organised and balanced person in life. Even past studies have proven that people who have a neat writing are well-organised and balanced personalities (unfortunately I can't locate the study on the internet, as I forgot the authors and publisher). I personally have a messy written expression that I'm not very fussed about, as I perceive writing in my life as something practical. I write, because I have to complete University notes, I write shopping lists or I write my personal thoughts in my diary. Therefore, I'm happy with my messy writing, since I'm the one who understands it. I've also tried improving it before, but it didn't work. I guess I was determined to have this particular writing style and I don't want to change it at all! It's messy, and cursive at times. And to give a conclusion, I'd like to mention that I read somewhere that it is the individuals with messy writing who are the most smartest and creative in life. Apparently, this individual difference is reflected on either one of the two hemispheres it in parts of the brain structure regions. (Have to find this study as well). ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, yes. I think there are two types of good handwriting: neat and character. Neat, because it shows how you treat yourself and around you, how neat is it? how\u2019s your planning? how\u2019s your hygiene? how\u2019s your home? are you a perfectionist? neater your handwriting, more readable, better. Character, the style of your handwriting shows your character, how is the curve? how is the slope? how high and low? what about creativity? how is the emotion? How artsy? more stylist your handwriting, more character you have, better. Until now, yes. However, 'impressed' maybe only when we saw the writing. We don't know for sure that the writer is the person we are thinking about. Still, we must be wise in judging others. Impressed or not is our choice. But to 'shape' others as we think is not justified. Individually, they can be better or worse, than we think. So, I suggest just being \"impressed\" with the writing. To know someone real, we need to meet, right? That is all. thank you ",
