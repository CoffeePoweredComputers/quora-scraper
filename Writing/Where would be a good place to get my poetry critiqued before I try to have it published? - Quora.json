            "answer_text": "Where would be a good place to get my poetry critiqued before I try to have it published? There are various places on the internet where this might happen, such as Writing Forums (there must be others). However, such places tend to have rules in place to deter drive-by critique seekers. In the example above you have to make ten reasonably substantive posts (or pay a small charge) before becoming a full member, and you are not allowed to directly request critique (it\u2019s assumed you want this by the very fact of posting the work). Also, in the example above, there is a workshop area that is hidden from search engines, allowing your work to be regarded as unpublished (though you may wish to discuss this with a potential publisher). Yet other forums have a fairly strict reciprocal arrangement where you must supply critique too - there might even be a strict ratio system (e.g. supply three critiques to have one of your own works critiqued). Of course, there are no guarantees about the quality or accuracy of such critique. You must use your own judgement as to which critique you would act on. Of course, you could seek out someone in the real world who is versed in such matters. This would possibly mean having to pay. Even then it\u2019s one person\u2019s opinion, though it\u2019s fair to say that some opinions are more valid than others. Apart from all this, supplying critique can make you a better writer too, so you can actually take a bit by giving. ",
