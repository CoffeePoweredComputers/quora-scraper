            "answer_text": "Well, there are descriptions to set the scene so we know a bit about the reflective or meditative study this is, somewhat like a thanksgiving poem, or a count-your-blessings poem. Even so, I can see there is a most basic approach happening that is acceptable if that was what you were going for. I had to question the ending as the initial reference was about cloudy and about rain. I wondered if you really meant to end with these words instead: It may shower soon. The sky remains above us yet it is the changing of the scenery that makes this poetry represent something if you meant, It is cloudy and with clouds floating far away as if going to gather one another together. Your phrasing is too basic and doesn\u2019t join the jigsaw together well. The sudden shift to the bird seems at first to be just a common sight not really that interesting, but then you identify it as being beautiful and singing. I didn\u2019t fully appreciate the phrase singing at flowers going to remind the day. I didn\u2019t know if you referred to the bird or the flowers at that moment in time. So I would give more substance to the theme in this example::SIGNS ABOVE, SIGNS BELOW:I can\u2019t help but look at the sky.Cloudy yet with clouds floating far away,Perhaps gathering themselves closer together.Perhaps it will rain soon.But then I look at the beauty of a little bird nearby,Singing away merrily to the flowersThat bide their time greeting a new day.Reminding one and all that it has come again.Perhaps they know that a shower is coming soon\u2026:The thought stirs me to stand up and to return home.A sudden shower can dampen my spirits so easily.I didn\u2019t always heed the signs above.But today I will and if I make it safely home,I\u2019ll have a big smile on my face if it does rain.You didn\u2019t catch me out today!My clothes are as dry as I first left the house.My hair is still neat and tidy\u2026And I got out of the gardening as well\u2026:Denis Martindale May 2020.:The ending of the first verse isn\u2019t really enough to leave much of an impact. Yes, it\u2019s wistful, gentle, serene, but without impact. So I would continue with the second verse to provide that with the lines that followed\u2026: ",
