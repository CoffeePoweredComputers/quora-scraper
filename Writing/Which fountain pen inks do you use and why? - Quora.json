            "answer_text": "Several factors drive my preferences for my everyday use inks: I have the luxury of both not having a need for water resistance and being able to do most of my writing on fairly fountain-pen friendly paper. Thus, I use relatively wet inks, chosen mostly for nice flow and lubrication. Most also feature quite extensive shading. At the very least, a nice, solid color (not necessarily intense) is a must in my book.I generally acquire a new pens weekly, so it's nice to have a few staple inks at hand to use as a basis for comparison when inking up a pen for the first time. Coupled with the fact that I rotate pens pens frequently, I like to have something that generally has good and consistent writing characteristics and is fairly easy to clean, without risk of staining. My more heavily saturated or stain-prone inks I rotate in on an occasional basis.As far as color goes, I generally like to keep within arm's length at least one burgundy or purple for the occasional letter or personal note; a couple solid blues or blue-blacks for note-taking and more formal writing; and a few other \"fun\" colors to try out.When it comes to flow, lubrication, and shading, it's quite hard to beat most inks from the Pilot Iroshizuku line. I also find several J. Herbin inks also quite conductive to good flow. My most commonly used inks are probably Iroshizuku Asa-Gao (for more formal writing) and Iroshizuku Kon-Peki (a more lively color with great shading for doodling, journaling note-taking, and some personal notes). For blue-black, I use occasionally Pelikan Blue-Black (for sentimental reasons) and sometimes also J. Herbin Blue Nuit and Iroshizuku Shin-Kai (not the best color ever, frankly, but I really like the way it dries from a beautiful true blue-black to a subtle, bluish-gray). For burgundy and purple, I've always liked Iroshizuku Yama-Budo (some of the most intense shading I've seen in an ink, with a subtle sheen; it's surprisingly easy to clean for a reddish ink as well) and J. Herbin Poussiere de Lune. I also usually keep my Lamy 2000 inked up with J. Herbin Lie de The, which is a nice solid brown with good lubrication. It slightly widens the sweet spot and makes the extra fine nib feel buttery smooth. I do somewhere between two-thirds and three-fourths of my writing with the aforementioned inks. The \"fun\" colors cycle through quite a wide selection of inks. I tend to try a bit of everything (I've already acquired more than a lifetime's supply of ink), although there are a few brands I tend to avoid on a consistent basis for various reasons. This week, I happen also to be using a vintage Carter's Blue-Black, Iroshizuku Momiji (a red-pink), Diamine Autumn Oak, J. Herbin Emerald of Chivor (one of the least fountain-pen friendly inks, so I'm using it in a cheap Lamy), and the discontinued Caran d'Ache Blue Sky. But that'll likely change in a few days! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the pen. I have a lot of old vintage Sheaffers, Parkers and Waterman pens. They frequently get Waterman  Waterman Bleu S\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9  (Florida Blue was the old name, same ink, I have used gallons of it) also Pilot Blue. Why? These inks are safe to use, will not damage your pen or melt your ink sacs, wont't clog and are easy to clean out and Waterman Florida blue has a reputation as a reliable safe standard ink. Lots of pen repair folks will test their pens with it (also Pelikan inks). Pilot Blue does not have this reputation but perhaps it should as I have used a lot of this ink over the years and never had a single problem with it.  Generally, inks by pen maufacturers tend to be safe for any pen. Pen companies do not want to have to repair a lot of pens so generally test their inks vigorously. So Pelikan, Montblanc, Pilot, Aurora, Sailor (personal favorite), Waterman all tend to be safe dependable inks that will not stain pens, clog or melt sacs. Most Inks are formulated with dyes, combined with surfactants and humectants to control the color, saturation, flow, surface tension, and slickness of the ink. Color is a matter of taste but the more saturated an ink is the more likely you are to have problems with it. Not all high chroma inks are problematic but if you use them in pens with sacs you might find the sacs do not last as long.  Otherwise you pick an ink based on how it performs and that depends on the pen and paper you are going to use. A dry pen can benefit from a more free flowing ink (Say, Diamine Midnight) and a wet pen might benefit from a drier ink (Pelikan, MB). It all depends. Vintage? Modern? Ebonite feed? Plastic Feed? etc.  Personally I use a lot of: Aurora Black (a slick free flowing black and my black of choice, Also like Herbin Perle Noire)  Waterman Bleu S\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9 Pilot Blue and Pilot Iroshizuku Asa-Gao Sailor Jentle inks (particularly the 4 Seasons inks) MB Royal Blue, Toffee Brown, Corn Poppy Red, JFK Navy Blue Visconti Blue  Some inks are Iron Gall (a whole other topic) but those are more permanent and good  to use on paper with not a lot of sizing (they resist feathering) but will be drier so require a pen with good flow. They also require more frequent pen cleaning. I rarely use IG inks but when I do I like Platinum Blue Black. Some inks are pigment or carbon inks and not dyes and have some of the same properties as Iron Gall inks. Good on bad paper, water-resistent, will require more frequent and vigorous cleanings. Carbon inks use particles and not dye and so you also might have to shake the bottle. However some Carbon inks are VERY slick and some dry to to a matte finish (Sailor Nano Black for example). Great for addressing Envelopes, etc. Big topic. You learn over time which inks have which properties and what works in which pen.   ",
