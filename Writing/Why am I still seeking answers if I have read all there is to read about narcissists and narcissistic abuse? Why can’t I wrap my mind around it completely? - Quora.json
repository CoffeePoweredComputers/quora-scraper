            "answer_text": "You can\u2019t wrap your mind around narcissism because it\u2019s so strange and harmful. Why would anyone be so completely self-absorbed that they can\u2019t feel empathy for others? Why are children or spouses of the narcissist held hostage to their constant need to be admired and built up? I know. My mother was a narcissist and I struggled for many years to come to terms with her illness. She had no friends. We (five kids and a long-suffering husband) were the sum total of her relationships. We five grown kids became adroit at getting around her infantile need to always be the center of attention. For example, If I came to visit, I\u2019d tell my mom that I would arrive on Wednesday, but I\u2019d actually fly in on Monday so I could spend time with one or more of my siblings without her knowing. Then, on Wednesday I\u2019d arrive at her doorstep, ready to be at her beck and call. The best that I can think of to explain this sad mental illness is that your narcissist person is a three year old child: At three you (the narcissist) think the whole world revolves around you. You want what you want when you want it. Nothing and no one matters but what you want. You\u2019re actually a frightened and out-of- control child, but you want everyone to think you\u2019re god-like, because it\u2019s the only way you can live inside yourself. To think of yourself as god-like is the supreme goal, and anything that threatens this self-perception must be destroyed. You live in a three-year-old fantasy world where lying is telling your own kind of truth. And no one dares argue with your \u201ctruth.\u201d A narcissist is an empty, needy, deeply insecure shell of a person. She has no emotional strength in and of herself. He uses others like a tick, to gain emotional sustenance. It\u2019s absolutely miserable for the people who have to live with or near this person. The worst thing about narcissism is almost none of these poor ill people ever go for therapy. To do so would mean that he or she realizes and regrets their behavior. You can choose two options: leave, or learn to manage the narcissist by setting up firm boundaries and then following through when he or she crosses the line. I wish you grace, peace, and wisdom. ",

            "answer_text": "After a year+ of digging through every possible nugget of information on narcissism, the answer comes down to two main areas: WHY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE? The \u2018good\u2019 people are the abused. Let\u2019s define good people as simply: those who do not intentionally hurt others. Many of the abused have unknowingly hurt others or even acted selfishly in fit of anger, BUT good people say sorry and resolve conflicts. We make amends for any pain we caused. We are not perfect. Everyone is fallible and guilt is a very healthy feeling because it\u2019s that red light in our heads that says, \u201cYou made a mistake. Let\u2019s fix it.\u201d A narcissist is not good. They INTENTIONALLY act selfishly for their needs and have no concerns for others\u2019 pain. I am not saying they want to hurt others (some of them do) but a lot of narcissists are morally fine with you getting hurt if they get what they want. It is centered on their WANTS - nothing else. The abused struggle to understand WHY this happened. We loved the narcissist. We compromised ourselves because that is expected in a mutually loving relationship. We agreed to be exclusive. The narcissist agreed and went over the top with love bombs. We stopped dating other people. We stopped flirting. The narcissist never stopped. They continued to look for other supply. They lied to us. They stole from us. They gaslighted us. They manipulated us. SO\u2026.we keep seeking ANSWERS to why us? What mistake did we make? Why did we believe the narcissist? Why were we manipulated? What was wrong with us? We feel stupid. We start thinking we deserved the abuse (the narcissist favorite outcome - you to shred yourself apart from the inside). WHY DO BAD PEOPLE NOT SUFFER LIKE GOOD PEOPLE? Here is the mindf*ck side that destroys the abused. Why do they walk away free of any torment or angst? Why are they with another man or woman in a week and acting like you never existed? How the hell do they not suffer? This, to me, is why the abused cannot find peace. There is no real redemption. The narcissist just moves on like cancer. No remorse, no apology, no love, no care. We seek and seek to find a balance, justification, a coping mechanism for the hurt. So, we keep seeking\u2026.. Do you see the issue? We can\u2019t balance the equation. The riddle is unsolvable. Stop buying books and stop letting others profit off your pain on y-tube. There is a large segment on the internet and y-tube that wants you suspended in pain and anger. Face the truth, we got taken by our narcissist. We unknowingly played a dangerous game and we lost big. We trusted an untrustworthy person. We loved a person that didn\u2019t love back. ACCEPT IT! The education value of Quora is awesome. Satisfy your need to understand who they are and then, accept it. I know this may seem cold and I apologize for that, but they got us. No amount of meditation, or self-care, or new diets, or exercise will turn the clock back. Yes, these methods and practices are good for YOU and your future, but they will not heal your past. The only way to heal your past is to ACCEPT what happened and throw it away. Oddly, you have to do something your narcissist did naturally - DISCARD your past. LET IT GO. If you have kids with them or are broke or suffer chronic conditions, start appreciating and planning what you can do going forward. The narcissist took pieces of us that never return. You will never trust the same way again. I promise you. So, SEEK until you can throw away the books and delete all the links. Start building your new life. You will feel good again. You won\u2019t be the same as before the narcissist, but change is part of life. Thanks for reading and I wish all of us the best. ",
