            "answer_text": "Hi there! Before you pick up any book that claims to teach you how to write, I recommend that you first decide what genre you want to write for. To do so, read top listed authors from as many genres as you can.  The reason for this is so you can find which really 'sings' to you.  I was given this little gem of advice from, of all people, a science teacher!  I was at a complete loss in the beginning of my writing journey, because I didn't have a clue what audience I wanted to reach. then I remembered what my science teacher told me.  You almost always hear: 'Write what you know!' Okaay.....but what if you don't know how to write about what you know?  And what if you don't want to write about what you know?  Quandaries like this effect even the most successful of authors. This is why it is so important to find out what fiction you relate to - for me it was Young Adult Fiction. I love the freedom writing for this audience gives me - and I can totally ignore 'trendy' fiction such as vampires, werewolves, strange things that go bump in the night, wherever I can.  A word of warning though: if you want to break into the writing business, try not to step too far from what is currently circulating with great success on the bookshelves.  Make what you want to write different, certainly, but keep at the top of your mind that you can be different and still fall into a specific category. I scour the bookshelves in my favorite stores so I can see which books are actually bought my people and who those people are.  You'll be surprised at the diversity of readers when you do this little exercise. While eBooks are taking over the much-loved book stores, I know of many people that prefer to buy actual books - I take full advantage of that to further my understanding and knowledge of what these people are buying the most of. Also, by watching who buys what and when, you can fathom the types of people who'd be receptive to your writing style and stories. I visit publishers' websites to track trends, I keep up to date on what best sellers are topping the charts, so to speak (The New York Times is perfect for this.) Before you do anything else in your adventure into writing, do these exercises: take four words (random words, that don't relate at all to the others), and write a maximum of two paragraphs using one or all four, even just two or three of them. Imagine that you're dropping these paragraphs into the middle of a book. I found this very helpful! The more I practiced this method, the better my writing became. You can create just a dialogue e.g.:  \"Harry!\" \"What!\" \"Can you see anything?\" \"Of course I can.\" \"Well, what's happening, tell me.\" \"I'm not sure...I think the sword is - well, it's glowing.\" \"Tell me you didn't just say that.\" In this dialogue I have used the words Harry, see, happening and sword. Now think about what you imagined the moment you read this particular dialogue. Now, imagine how this dialogue opens the reader's imagination in that you've  created great curiosity through just seven lines of dialogue. He/she will want to know who Harry is, who the unnamed character is that started the dialogue - and what are they actually looking at? Where are they? And why are they there??? And the list goes on. It really is a great form of getting to grips with all the aspects of writing fiction.  That being said, there are two sites I found to be helpful - no matter what level of writing I'm attempting. Have a look at: Where the Writers Go to Write  The Write Life - Helping writers create, connect and earn  Let me know if you need any further help, or you just want to share some of the obstacles you're experiencing.

            "answer_text": "It depends upon the topic you want to write upon. Technical books- if you\u2019re writing upon something that is particular to a field of study you need an in-depth knowledge. You must read the books written by the main writers of that particular field.Suspense / Thriller- Read short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, Dan Brown. Reading these authors will help you to understand the different types of techniques they have used and the way they weave story. Though there is no point mentioning Gillian Flynn after writing about the big names of crime fiction. But his one particular book (not the movie) is amazing- \u2018Gone Girl\u2019 so read that too, it is all about mind games and psycho-thriller.Fantasy- Read Lewis Carroll\u2019s \u2018Alice in Wonderland\u2019 and \u2018Through the Looking Glass\u2019. While reading it look for the references that he makes throughout the book. You\u2019ll be amazed to see what all his writing has in store for you. It talks about politics, human nature, mathematics and science. Read J.K. Rowling and Rick Riordan. Read \u2018Herland\u2019 by Charlotte Gilman for books related to utopia and George Orwell\u2019s \u20181984\u2019 for books related to dystopic world; you can also read Margaret Atwood\u2019s works. Must read- \u2018Frankenstein\u2019 by Mary Shelly and \u2018Sexing the Cherry\u2019 by Jeanette Winterson, simply brilliant.World War/ Tragedy and existential crisis- Read Kafka\u2019s \u2018Metamorphosis\u2019, Sylvia Plath\u2019s \u2018Bell Jar\u2019; \u2018Mrs. Dalloway\u2019 by Woolf (it deals with the World War and PTSD). You can also read books that have a background of slave narratives like Toni Morrison\u2019s \u2018Beloved\u2019; \u2018Twelve Years a Slave\u2019 by Solomon Northup.Romance- I can\u2019t recommend anything because I haven\u2019t read it much, just Nicholas Sparks.I believe that not only books but brilliant movies/ TV series/ Anime can help you because the main idea is to see/ read something that will help you grow as a writer and imagination is a major aspect of that. So look for different art forms that might help you to understand and thereby represent art in your own way. Hope this helps! I guess I\u2019m forgetting the names of few great books. I\u2019ll add it as soon as possible. ",
