            "answer_text": "There are many writers who relish the sheer joy of naming things and parts of things, but not always to the best effect. The key is not just including the details, but making those details do the work of telling the story. Here's a description from \"A Rose for Emily\" by William Faulkner, where every detail adds to the picture:  They rose when she entered--a small, fat woman in black, with a thin gold chain descending to her waist and vanishing into her belt, leaning on an ebony cane with a tarnished gold head. Her skeleton was small and spare; perhaps that was why what would have been merely plumpness in another was obesity in her. She looked bloated, like a body long submerged in motionless water, and of that pallid hue. Her eyes, lost in the fatty ridges of her face, looked like two small pieces of coal pressed into a lump of dough as they moved from one face to another while the visitors stated their errand. Here's another, from John Updike's novel Terrorist, told from the perspective of a teacher paying a visit to the mother of student:  Her maternal side is a sensitive side; her beryl-green eyes bulge out at him between colorless lashes that must get mascara from time to time, but not today or yesterday. The hair at her hairline is a lighter, softer tint than the metallic red on top. The set of her lips, the plump upper one lifted a bit as with someone listening hard, tells him that he has used up her initial gush of friendliness. Vladimir Nabokov in \"Signs and Symbols\" uses details as a way of striking a contrast between two aged women: note how the gaudiness of Mrs. Sol makes the other woman seem not just plainer, but sadder:  Her drab gray hair was pinned up carelessly. She wore cheap black dresses. Unlike other women of her age (such as Mrs. Sol, their next-door neighbor, whose face was all pink and mauve with paint and whose hat was a cluster of brookside flowers), she presented a naked white countenance to the faultfinding light of spring.  In the opening pages of Bleak House, Charles Dickens uses telling details to show the effect of fog on a city. A lesser writer might say \"It was really, really foggy, and you could barely see,\" but Dickens turns fog into a character:  Fog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city. Fog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping into the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and hovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient Greenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper, down in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of his shivering little 'prentice boy on deck. Chance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog all round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the misty clouds. Other great novels and stories from writers who really know how to use detail: Nathanael Hawthorne, The Scarlet LetterHerman Melville, Moby-DickEdith Wharton, The Age of InnocenceVladimir Nabokov, LolitaJohn Cheever, \"The Country Husband\" ",

            "answer_text": "Books with a lot of details may irk some and may be appealing to some. I personally never liked books with a lot of details until I started reading Jhumpa Lahiri's Unaccustomed Earth. Jhumpa Lahiri is a very detail oriented writer. She writes about intricate emotions, those that you can relate to yourself. She writes about the minute details and explanation behind each detail which helps you picture the whole scene with every piece in its place with no missing details. The best thing about her writing is that it is so clear and lucid that you will keep wanting to turn the pages. I still have 60 pages of the book left and I can surely say that the 300 pages of the book have been a pure enjoyment. You should definitely read Jhumpa Lahiri's novels. They are a treat for the mind and the details make the reading all the more worthwhile.  Happy Reading. :) ",
