            "answer_text": "Fine Motor Skills. There are people who have a condition known as \u201cimmature hand.\u201d The muscles in their hands don\u2019t have the fine control needed for writing or other activities that require fine finger coordination. (There is physical therapy for this with children, but it\u2019s rarely diagnosed and remedied.) The condition can lead to giving up on having legible handwriting at a very early age. These days, that\u2019s less of a disadvantage than it used to be. Typing skills employ hand muscles in a different way, so many people with immature hand don\u2019t need to be able to write legibly once they\u2019re out of school. Their signatures are usually scribbles, though. Careful Writing. At the other extreme are people who\u2019s handwriting is so legible, so consistently printed or written, that you\u2019d almost think they\u2019d used a type font. It\u2019s not possible to achieve this just by having dexterity. It requires slowing down a bit. In this case, the highly legible handwriting does indicate something about the person: They place a high value on being able to read what they\u2019ve written and about whether others will be able to read what\u2019s been written. They may even feel that their handwriting \u201crepresents\u201d them and they want to make a positive impression. (Back in the 1800s, when gold miners went to California, many of them were illiterate. But you can find their signatures carved in rock\u2014 beautiful signatures. Yes, some of them signed documents with an X, but others had a sense that their signatures represented them, so they practiced until they perfected their signatures.) The Joy of Writing. I have unusually legible handwriting (and I\u2019m left-handed). I love writing with a fountain pen on good quality stationery. It\u2019s a wonderful sensory experience that\u2019s difficult to describe. But I also take notes during working sessions (or meetings). Writing internalizes the information for me (kinesthetic learning) while giving me the ability to ask questions about information that\u2019s been covered during the session, knowing that I can rely on what notes I\u2019ve taken (which I can definitely read). Consequences of Handwriting. Recently, a clerk thanked me profusely for filling out a form legibly. She said that, in her job, not being able to read the information correctly can lead to serious problems. A few days ago, I received a contractor\u2019s proposal for work his company could do for me. He printed his name and phone number on the proposal. A day later, I had a couple of questions, but I could not read three digits of his phone number. I made a few guesses, which were not correct. So, his company didn\u2019t get the job: I couldn\u2019t reach him. ",

I still use a pen or pencil for handwriting tasks when it is appropriate and especially for research. I also spend a lot of time doodling and making lists too. I was very good at art and manual work during high school. Yet I am a very neat and tidy person. I always prefer to be organised and methodical. I will make plans or goals before I head off somewhere and I am never spontaneous and frivolous. My younger sister has excellent handwriting skills yet she is not that smart or intellectual. She knows how to cook a great meal and look after her children. She doesn\u2019t understand complex issues or abstract ideas preferring to socialise and chit chat all day long. My GP has terrible handwriting and I can never understand what she wrote on the prescriptions yet she is a highly professional person. ",

Yep, I\u2019m biased. I admit. I don\u2019t think that the person is not intelligent, or not smart. Just vision them as lazy even when I do not believe they are lazy. I explain this to myself by thinking that the person believes he/she has too many other more important things to do than to take a few more seconds to make a neat (readable) signature. ",
