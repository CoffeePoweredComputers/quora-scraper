            "answer_text": "I can inspire you immensely with this great story written below. Just be with me. It\u2019s a little lengthy but worth the effort. :-) Once upon a time in a small village lived two brothers. The younger one was seven years old and the elder one was nine. The kids used to spend most of their time playing with each other in the forest. One such evening while playing hide and seek, the elder brother ventured into the dark forest. His brother tried finding him everywhere but he could not. Afraid and reluctant, he eventually entered the forest to look for his brother. After many hours of ordeal, he finally spotted his elder brother trapped in a deep dry well screaming for help. The kid looked around to seek help from someone but there was no sign of any human in the vicinity. They were all alone there! Alarmed, he ran to the well where his brother was trapped to help him out. By now both of them had realized that they were completely on their own. The younger brother started looking around the well and found a piece of worn out rope. Without wasting another minute, he quickly dropped the rope inside the well and asked his brother to tie it around his waist. His elder brother did as he said, and the kid started pulling him up. Despite his full strength, the kid was hardly able to lift him off the bottom of the pit. His strength started wavering off pretty soon. After all he was just a 7-year-old kid. Exhausted, the kid looked around again. It was pitch dark. There was no one around to help him out. He closed his eyes and decided to persevere as he had no choice. Then he started pulling the rope with all his strength. This time the rope moved a little. Motivated, this time he tried a little harder. Slowly his efforts and patience started paying off. After an hour of this taxing ordeal, he was finally able to rescue his brother. Since it was already dark, both the boys immediately ran towards the village. They met their folks in the village, who had already started looking for them. When they narrated their story to the gathering, everyone was astonished. Each and every villager said, \u201cHow can a 7-year-old do that? It is just not possible.\u201d No one trusted their version of the story, and grew suspicious of their account. Finally, it was unanimously decided to take up the matter with the village elder - a wise old man, whom villagers used to approach for guidance and advice. The old man listened to story and smiled. A guy from the gathering shouted - \u201cYou only tell us how can a small boy of 7 years do that?\u201d To this, the old wise man retorted - \u201cHe could do that because you were not there to tell him that he cannot do it.\u201d Anything is possible through sustained efforts! The power lies within you! All you need to do is believe in yourself. Just don\u2019t give up! Perseverance is the key to success. I hope the story inspired you!

            "answer_text": "There are many ways I could inspire you. I could tell you a story like many others have. Or, I could talk to you and make you feel better by my words. I could even relate your situation to my own and tell you how I overcame it. Would that help you? Probably, yes! But that\u2019s not the right question to ask. Would that help you in the long run? Maybe not! Certainly not. Wanna bet that you\u2019ll be back to this situation soon again? I\u2019m sure you will. What are you gonna do then? Ask another question to get inspired? Or, read these answers again? Why don\u2019t you ask for something which will keep you inspired forever? Wouldn\u2019t that act as a permanent cure? It sure will! But before I tell you, I\u2019d need to know what\u2019s making you sad? Is it the people around who are the cause behind your sadness? Did someone hurt you? Is it related to your career? Are your efforts not paying off? Do you think life has been unfair to you? Whatever it is, what are you going to do about it? I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t know. But do you think you can do something about it? Hell, yeah! The very people you\u2019re asking this question, they need inspiration too. Inspite of writing something to inspire you, they too feel sad and depressed at times. So how can someone, who can be depressed themselves, inspite of having such amazing stories to share, inspire you? They cannot! Then who can? Its you! Yes! Only you can inspire yourself. Whatever stories there are, none of them would have any effect unless you let them affect you. Whatever I write, blabber, shout is going to mean shit to you, unless you want to feel good yourself. So what are you waiting for? That opportunity can knock on that bloody door forever, but it won\u2019t enter unless you get up and open the damn door. No one else is going to do that for you. Your dream will remain a dream for a lifetime unless you motivate yourself to do something about it. Just tell yourself that \u201cEnough is enough, I\u2019m not going to stay sad like this.\u201d If someone has left you, or said something which hurt you, then stop worrying about it. Go and make new friends. Find new people who are worth being part of your life. Don\u2019t stay depressed for the ones who are either gone or are bringing you down. Worrying about all this will make you miss out on a lot in the meantime. You can inspire a thousand people once you learn to inspire yourself. And how will that happen? By setting yourself an example. By being that example. Just stop being sad and start being awesome. Life is nothing but your perception about everything. Change your perception and it will take a second to realize your situations is not all that gloomy. Once you learn to inspire yourself, you won\u2019t have to depend on anyone else for that. Ever! Because the next time you need an example to uplift yourself, all you need to do is look in the mirror. ",
