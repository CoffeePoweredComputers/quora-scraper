            "answer_text": "I've been familiar with the word \"googol\" since the 1960s, when I first read a book called MATHEMATICS AND THE IMAGINATION, by Edward Kasner and James Newman. I still have my late-1960s-era trade paperback of that book (it was first published in 1940). If you start reading the book at the beginning, you'll come to the first chapter, titled \"New Names For Old.\" Here is the relevant passage about the invention of the words \"googol\" and \"googolplex\": \"Words of wisdom are spoken by children at least as often as by scientists. The name 'googol' was invented by a child (Dr. Kasner's nine-year-old nephew) who was asked to think up a name for a very big number, namely, 1 with a hundred zeros after it. He was very certain this number was not infinite, and therefore equal certain that it had to have a name. At the same time he that he suggested 'googol' he gave a name for a still larger number: 'Googolplex.' A googolplex is much larger than a googol, but is still finite, as the inventor of the name was quick to point out. It was first suggested that a googolplex should be 1, followed by writing zeros until you got tired. This is a description of what would happen if one actually tried to write a googolplex, but different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have Carnera a better mathematician than Dr. Einstein, simply because he had more endurance. The googolplex then, is a specific finite number, with so many zeros after the 1 that the number of zeros is a googol. A googolplex is much bigger than a googol, much bigger even than a googol times a googol. A googol times a googol would be 1 with 200 zeros, whereas a googolplex is 1 with a googol of zeros. You will got some idea of the size of this very large but finite number from the fact that there would not be enough room to write it, if you went to the farthest star, touring all the nebulae and putting down more zeros every inch of the way.\" --MATHEMATICS AND THE IMAGINATION, Kasner and Newman, page 23.

            "answer_text": "Google is a misspelling of a real-life mathematical term, googol. Back sometime in the late 90\u2019s Larry Page and Sergey Brin were two graduate students at Stanford. They had been working on a search engine and had given it the name BackRub. Fortunately, they were smart enough to realize that BackRub was the worst tech company name in the history of tech companies, and that they needed to find something a little more appropriate. During yet another name brainstorming session, their friend Sean, a fellow graduate student, suggested the word googolplex. Googolplex is the name for 10 to the power of googol. Googol is the name used by mathematicians to reference 10 to the power of 100, or: 10,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000,\u00ad000 That\u2019s 1 plus 100 zeros. When Sean suggested googolplex, Larry responded that he liked the smaller term googol, but felt like the term in general was a great fit for what they were trying to do: index an unfathomable number of Internet web pages. Sean, not realizing googol was spelled with an ol at the end, searched the Internet to see if the domain Google was available. Larry liked the new word Sean had accidentally come up with. And Google was named.  ",
