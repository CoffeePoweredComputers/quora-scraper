            "answer_text": "Rifle Team Match Dickinson College vs Penn State, 1963\u201364 season Location: U.S. Army War College, Carlisle Barracks, Carlisle, PA I was preparing to go to the firing line, checking my equipment one last time. My Anschutz .22 caliber match rifle was in perfect condition, its hooked butt plate adjusted for the prone position, sling attached, palm rest in my bag, ammo neatly arranged in the holder to ensure I fired exactly ten rounds, no more, no less, at the first targets. Now it was time to prepare myself, slipping into the meditative state that would lower my resting pulse rate to 55 beats per minute. I sat down, breathing slowly and evenly. \u201cHamilton, lets talk outside!\u201d Crap! It was Sergeant Greenwalt, breaking my concentration\u2026 I exited onto the front step. \u201cO.K., We have never beaten Penn State. Ever. But today we have a chance. Reid is firing on this relay, and he\u2019s smokin\u2019! We\u2019re only down a few points and we can make them up in the final relay, but you\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do my best, Sergeant!\u201d \u201cI know you\u2019ll shoot your best, but you've gotta do one more thing for me. I\u2019ve put you in the final relay, in Lane One. I\u2019ve put Penn State\u2019s number one shooter in Lane Ten. \u201cI want you to shoot him in the leg.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cRemember that accident Gerow had last week?\u201d I remembered it very well. Gerow was warming his rifle up, as all the shooters did before sighting in. We would fire the first ten or twelve rounds as fast as we could into the backstop. They would ricochet safely downward into the dirt, Those first shots would heat the rifle barrel, distorting it slightly. We would then sight in with a warm barrel, accommodating the distortion. Without that, we would not have the necessary pin-point accuracy. Well, Gerow didn\u2019t control his rifle while warming up. While firing randomly into the backstop, he allowed the muzzle to drift to the right. He was firing from Lane One, but his rounds were impacting around Lane Four. No problem so far\u2026. He also let his muzzle drift upward, so instead of shooting horizontally into the lower backstop, he shot high, hitting near the top. Problem\u2026! When he pulled the trigger his shot hit high and right at lane Four, then deflected low and right. hitting the shooter on Lane Ten in the left thigh. \u201cOww! I\u2019ve been shot\u201d \u201cCease fire, cease fire! We checked him out. No real damage done that time. We were firing standard velocity match grade .22 ammunition. The soft bullet lost considerable speed during the ricochet, and hit a denim-covered leg. We found the spent round on the floor next to Anderson, the shooter on Ten. A bruise, but no penetration. It was easy to reconstruct the accident. The backstop had recently been painted, and the new paint had a clear chip taken out. The physics were clear. We laid down a sandbag on Ten, and I re-enacted the shot. Bullseye! \u201cI want you to shoot him in the leg. Shake him up! Get him off his game! Mess up his score! Can you do that?\u201d I grinned. \u201cYes sir! \u201cJust remember; time your shots. Shoot when the Penn State guy beside you shoots and you won\u2019t be identified as the source.\u201d I knew that\u2026. Sgt. Greenwalt and I were both country boys. We were raised with guns, and knew how to use them as tools as well as weapons. We had also tested our limits as kids and young adults. He trusted me to take the shot and I was confident I could do it. We never even considered the potential downside. My rotation was called. I took my place on Lane One. \u201cReady on the right! Ready on the left! Ready on the firing line!\u201d \u201cCommence firing!\u201d Bang! Bang! Bang! \u201cShit!\u201d Bang! \u201cCease fire!\u201d The Penn State shooter was grabbing at his leg. \u201cI\u2019ve been stung by a bee!\u201d he shouted to his coach. \u201cNo you haven\u2019t, Son,\u201d the coach replied, picking up a spent round from the floor. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hit!\u201d There was a brief discussion; no blood, no foul. The coaches agreed it was a freak accident. \u201cReady on the right! Ready on the left! Ready on the firing line!\u201d \u201cCommence firing!\u201d Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! \u201cShit!\u201d \u201cCease fire!\u201d Another spent round on the floor. Another bruise. Another discussion. \u201cCommence firing!\u201d Three minutes passed. The sound of firing became sporadic, as shooters concentrated on their aim. Then\u2026 Bang! Bang! \u201cDammit again!\u201d I just had to get in that last ding. I really felt that I was messing up his score. If two were good, three would be better. ***** My score that day was good\u2026 one of my best for the season. The Penn State guy in Lane Ten\u2026 a personal best! He truly had nerves of steel. The final score for the match? I don\u2019t remember the exact numbers, but we lost by the smallest margin of the season. Afterword: As a late adolescent male, I returned to campus feeling very full of myself. What I had just done felt like the ultimate \u201ccops and robbers\u201d game (I guess today\u2019s analogy would be to a video game). I had done something considered taboo, but with the consent (suggestion) of my coach. I felt good! I met my girlfriend for dinner at the Student Center\u2026 couldn\u2019t wait to tell her all about my \u201cheroics.\u201d She set me straight. Very straight. Wouldn\u2019t even talk to me for two weeks. But first, she said all the things my mother would have said (including \u201cYou could have shot his eye out!.\u201d) but I listened to her. If you ask me now, I\u2019ll tell you it was a stupid idea. But using the judgement of a college age male\u2026. ",
