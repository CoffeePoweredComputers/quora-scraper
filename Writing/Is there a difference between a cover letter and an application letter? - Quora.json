            "answer_text": "Cover Letter Versus Application Letter Content A cover letter is a teaser. Its intent is to capture the reader's attention enough to make the recruiter or hiring manager want to review the resume. The cover letter should contain just enough information that it doesn't give away everything about the applicant. An application letter, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive document. It describes the applicant's educational background, certifications and licenses, and in some cases, salary history for job postings that require it. When to Use an Application Letter When an employer specifically requires a cover letter and resume, that's what the job seeker should submit. It's relatively rare that an employer will accept an application letter in lieu of a cover letter and resume. The two approaches are different and employers use application letters infrequently when compared to how they use cover letters and resumes. An application letter is more appropriate for unsolicited interest, or when there isn't a job posting. For example, an application letter could be mailed to several employers that aren't advertising specific jobs vacancies as a way to provide a more extensive introduction to prospective employers. Uses of Cover Letters and Application Letters A cover letter is almost always used to express interest in employment. An application letter can be used for employment purposes; however, it can also be used for applying for a place in an academic program or an internship program. Employers don't always require a cover letter, but it's always a good idea to use a cover letter. On the other hand, an application letter might be the only requirement sought by schools or employers \u2013 with an application letter, it may not always be necessary to include a resume. ",

            "answer_text": "Cover letters and application letters have separate functions.  A cover letter usually accompanies resumes or applications and summarizes the jobseekers' experience relevant to the position they are applying for. The jobseeker may also highlight how she came to learn about the position and why she especially wants to be employed with that particular organization.  An application letter stands on its own. It is a substitute for an employment application and is sent to an employer one would like to work for. It is usually crafted to emphasize the jobseekers' skills and experience within the industry of the employer.  Cover letters are usually about 3 paragraphs long and should be kept to one page. An applications letter may be longer; 2 pages are permissible.  ",
