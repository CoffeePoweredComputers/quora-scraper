            "answer_text": "I think it depends on what you are looking for when you approach fantasy. If you want interesting world building, unique magic systems and 'good triumphs over evil' kind of themes, Sanderson is the way to go. If you want realistic, gritty characters, convoluted plots and morally grey motifs, George R.R. Martin is the natural choice. Both writers have their own advantages and limitations. For instance, I find that reading any one Sanderson novel is the same as reading all of them. While he goes to great lengths to build interesting worlds and different magic systems, his primary set of important characters retain the same qualities- the men are all impossibly honourable and the women are all impossibly \u2018witty\u2019( are they though? I mean Sanderson writes a lot of things well, but wit isn't one of them). For example, I find the characterization of Raoden and Sarene from Elantris to be painfully similar to Kaladin and Shallan from The Stormlight Archives. But I suppose the worlds that Sanderson builds are by themselves not as brutal or barbaric as Martin's, so you could allow him to get away with idealistic heroes. The thing that I absolutely adore about Sanderson's books are how insanely epic they can be. I always have rollicking fun when I read them. He writes fantastic action sequences and despite the initially slow pace, the stories gain significant momentum as they progress. Also it's just astounding the number of different magic systems the man has come up with- Aondor, allomancy, biochromatic breath, Stormlight investiture, to name but a few. A few, like the Biochromatic breath ( a huge favourite of mine) are so innovative that I am quite awed by how he comes up with them. I think that Sanderson's greatest strength is his ability to deliver incredibly engaging stories even while clinging to established fantasy tropes, especially in the post Martin era. Martin singlehandedly redefined fantasy- he writes what I think of as character driven plots while Sanderson writes predominantly magic driven plots. Martin's greatest asset is his ability to make the reader root for the morally grey characters- there is hardly anyone who dislikes Jaime Lannister despite the fact that he cripples a young boy by pushing him off a tower. He also writes fantastic women characters- his women are gritty and brave and not just in a sword-wielding, throat-slitting way. Catelyn, Sansa, Dany and of course Cersei, each represent a kind of courage and resolve quite refreshingly different from the usual 'i can fight like a man' kind of courage fantasy deals with. This is where Martin is even better than other grimdark fantasy writers like Joe Abercrombie. This is also an area where Sanderson completely and utterly fails. His women are as bland as unsalted cheese and I find all of his women characters highly annoying ( yes that includes Vin as well). The thing that makes me despair about Martin is the number of threads he handles ( and he keeps introducing new povs in every book). But here's me hoping that he will somehow bring them all together in the next two books ( if they ever do get published that is). Also, after the red wedding, the story just refuses to pick up and the last two books were despondently slow, and even if you discount the inane chest thumping Iron Men, it just didn't introduce any additional characters with important merit to the overarching plot. In conclusion, I like both the authors- they both write different kinds of worlds and focus on different aspects of storytelling. But I will always like Martin more for the simple reason that he wrote such an incredibly realistic kind of fantasy with complex characters and bittersweet endings. ",

            "answer_text": "Like many things, it's down to personal preference. Many will say they prefer Martin for the simple fact that his world is gritty and brutal and mostly lacks magical elements and so is more \"real.\" My opinion (and again, this is just my opinion) is that that's all well and good on paper, but that his writing also happens to be incredibly emotionally manipulative and shallow. He kills characters purely for shock value. There's no lead up, no meaning behind it. It's purely to get the reader's goat. He might as well jump out of the book and yell, \"surprise! Gotcha, huh?\" He puts characters in the same location and has them miss each other by a breath just to f*&# with you. It all comes across as if he doesn't know how to touch his readers emotionally in any other (better) way. In writing, death shouldn't be the ultimate consequence. It's boring, and it's cheap. It's not as if he makes up for it, either. When has anybody ever cried at Game of Thrones because somebody displayed amazing kindness, or love? When has anybody fallen in love with a character because of their complex inner self? Sure, maybe there are tiny nuggets of that here and there, but never enough to make up the difference. Shock deaths and violence pretty much define his entire repertoire.  A much more interesting consequence than death is wondering if you're doing the right thing, making the right decision, being the good person you want to be, disappointing those you care about, etc. Jim Butcher handles this well in his Dresden Files series. It's a pretty action-packed series, and Harry Dresden is constantly in mortal danger, but undue emphasis is never placed on that fact, because of course he's not going to actually die. The real consequences are more subtle than that. He wonders for a good long while if he's actually a good guy anymore. He gets corrupted by a fallen angel at one point, and now he's permanently indentured to one of the more evil characters in the series. Is it even possible to remain \"the good guy\" in that situation? He likes to hope so. That's powerful writing.  Anyway, Sanderson works with all those ideas just as well as Butcher and then some. One of the main character's core conflicts is a lack of faith in his own leadership skills, another's is the fact that, despite being perhaps the most powerful human alive, the problem she faces can't be solved with her fists, and meanwhile people are looking up to her as a religious figure and expecting her to save everyone from the apocalypse that is slowly eating the world around them. Yet another's is that he is part of a group of people that collected religious teachings throughout time, to protect them from being exterminated by the ruler of the day. After someone close to him dies, he turns on the religions he used to find joy in, and denounces them all as pointless and worthless.  The series is a heist novel, followed by a siege novel, followed by a mystery novel. That's versatility, and that's creativity, and that's much more impressive than anything Martin has done. When a character dies in Sanderson's books (which is rather rare in comparison), you see it coming from a mile away, as if it was meant to be. And they always die for something or someone, always. They go down fighting. Any amateur can just randomly decide to kill off their characters. It's an order of magnitude harder to have a character die a satisfying and \"fair\" death. If I wanted to read about completely purposeless violence and death, I'd read the news. Martin is nothing but a depressing bore. ",
