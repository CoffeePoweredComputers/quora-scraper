            "answer_text": "I disagree with the previous answer. Both are correct. Both give the impression of the same thing, you are tired of waiting. But the second sentence leads the reader to feel sorry for you. You want to add more details in your next sentence. Example: I\u2019ve been waiting for so long! My feet are aching from standing in line! (It is NOT a fragment. It just needs more explanation after.) ",

The second (\u201cI have been waiting for so long\u201d), though it reflects popular colloquial usage, is strictly speaking a sentence fragment. \u201cSo\u201d is, in this sentence construction, a comparative adverb that calls for a new dependent clause introduced by \u201cthat.\u201d Without that clause completing the thought, the sentence is elliptical\u2014i.e., technically a sentence fragment.
