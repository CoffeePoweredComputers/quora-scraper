            "answer_text": "The 15% number strikes me as high. From what I can see the number appears to be closer to 3 or 4%. I found a few rough estimates that may shed some light on this.  From a  USDA report (Major Uses of Land in the United States, 2007) [1] -   About 60 percent of the land in the United States is privately owned (table 12). The Federal Government owns 29 percent of the land base, mostly in the West. State and local governments own nearly 9 percent, and Indian trust land accounts for about 2 percent.    This gets us to about 2% of the land which is managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  Additionally, if we investigate privately owned land you can see that a majority of this is rural and agricultural land. A slightly dated study from 1999 [2] tells us that the percentage of private agricultural land owned by Native Americans is just 0.4%. (Categories included here are cropland, pastureland and woodland among others.) If you add these two categories together you still have a number that is just over 3%.    Note that I have ignored the category 'special, urban and  miscellaneous land' from the first table both because I was unable to locate a further breakdown of numbers and because the total land area is comparatively small. Privately owned non-governmental urban land accounts for about 6% based on the numbers above. I don't believe the numbers in this caterogy are significant enough to raise the total percentage of Native American land ownership drastically. The numbers above are estimates based on what I could locate and there are bound to be some omissions. However, if you see any glaring errors please let me know.

            "answer_text": "The real answer is very near zero. Reservations are Federal lands, and the land is legally owned by the Federal government. American Indians living on Indian reservations cannot take mortgages out on their homes, for instance, because banks know that American Indians don't own the land; the Federal government does. This is one of the reasons why Indians try to get off \"the 'Rez\"; they can own their own land. Since American Indians as a population percentage are small, and the exact percentage of American Indians living off-reservation is a hard figure to accurately determine for a few important reasons, an answer is unclear.
