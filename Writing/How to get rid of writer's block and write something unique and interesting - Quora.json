Every moment, every person, every everything is unique and interesting\u2026 so think outside of yourself\u2026 (and what you might see as goal of perfection). Thinking of \u201csomething clever\u201d keeps you within yourself. Start by describing: it can be washing the dishes, a sunset, the smell of fried chicken, a remark overheard, a shout in the street- a car honking -the way the light hits a tree\u2026. anything\u2014-you do not have to start big\u2026 just write every day and something might pique your interest and want you to go further - suddenly a story happening. \u2026 a person slouching\u2026 ask - why? a kind of laugh, the way a dog follows you - or runs away \u2026. What are those things outside of yourself? Observe. Take a story - a tale\u2026. and ask what happened to those characters 20 years later. or 3 years before\u2026.Who were they then? How did they get there? Make a list of words and write about one or two of them\u2026.or do they begin to make a sequence? find or make up a person\u2019s name (or an animal\u2019s)- can be silly or pompous or - bland, etc\u2026\u2026.and write a profile, story or situation about the person with that name\u2026 from third person or from the person\u2019s point of view there are all sorts of ways to begin to get out of writer\u2019s block. Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t focus on writing a story; that can be daunting when you have writer\u2019s block. Instead, jot occasional notes of interest which maybe, just maybe\u2026 someday might be included in a future story. Those notes could be a sentence or two of a scene, a character sketch, some strange situation, an interesting facet of a world\u2026 anything goes! You are planting seeds and you don't know which ones may sprout or what they may yield. But as long as you are writing, even the little notes, you are a writer and being productive. I have written stories from \u2018seeds\u2019 planted several years earlier. A paragraph written in isolation can be embedded in a new narrative. Some notes are still unused, but that\u2019s fine. (BTW, I am an indie writer and my books are at Home - Unexpected Books) ",
