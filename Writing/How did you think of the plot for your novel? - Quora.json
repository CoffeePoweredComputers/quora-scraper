            "answer_text": "Now this is a question I\u2019d love to answer not only for you, but also for myself. I\u2019ve been creating my fictional world and planning out my novel passively since around 2011 and actively since 2014/15. I have never been much of a bookworm, I always ended up being uninterested or unsatisfied by what most people of my age read. When I started taking notes, I was convinced that my novel could be created without inspiration, and I was determined to do so. I created so many things from scratch, not just continents, history and a language, but also physics, teology, biology. However, as time passed, more and more things that I wanted to use but were already used in another stories rose up. My elder brother, who started studying literature analytics at the University of Kent in 2015 convinced me that I couldn\u2019t write a story without inspiration. So I inspired myself. Very vaguely. By video games. I always had a talent for finding meaning in things without meaning. I often looked up what a fantasy videogame is about, just the main plot, not the detailed lore/storyline, and I made up everything else. That\u2019s right, I inspired myself by my own\u2026 fanfiction, I guess? Or rather by my expectations of the video game story? Anyway, the story I made up in my mind was usually way better than the real one, obviously\u2026 *cough* Anyway, there are a few straightforward similarities, but it\u2019s usually just little things. My battle scenes are inspired by my swordfighting experiences and tournaments. So, finally, realistic sword fights in a book! What a wonderful age to live in. The main plot of my novel came out of the mist just last year. Originally, the novel (initially meant to consist of 21 volumes!) was just a bunch of correlated storylines of characters that I related with during different parts of my teenage years. Every 6\u201312 months, I thought of a new character which fitted my new ideals better. But I didn\u2019t erase the old characters. That way, the story got more and more complex, but it lacked a backbone. Something which it all orbits around. Sure, there was a historical storyline, I knew what would happen, how it would happen, but I didn\u2019t know why it would happen. So I added a giant plot twist. I\u2019m not sure if I should tell you. It\u2019s something which turns all the little stories of the little characters into one giant, meaningful, hard-to-process lump of mind-blowingness. Or at least I hope it\u2019s like that\u2026 *cough* I compressed it into one book consisting of three volumes called (in English): Litevale, Belevalia and Folfjord, the names of regions where the story takes place. When I told my brother how I write it, I mean the style of my writing, he was pretty happy, and frankly, he\u2019s not easy to satisfy. It\u2019s original. It\u2019s different. It could be interesting to read. It\u2019s not chronological, it\u2019s not retrospective, it\u2019s not episodic, it\u2019s a mix of everything. It\u2019s not a novel nor a saga, it\u2019s both. I don\u2019t narrate in typical third-person, I use the \u201cEye of the Camera\u201d storytelling, but personalized, significantly different. It\u2019s not realistic fantasy, it\u2019s not high fantasy, I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s fantasy at all. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I love it. I hated my novel for years. I thought I could do better, that it lacked something, that it\u2019s written terribly. And now, after thousands of hours of hard work, I can finally say: \u201cI love my novel. I believe it\u2019ll be perfect.\u201d  EDIT: \u201cSO WHAT THE HELL IS THIS NOVEL?!\u201d It\u2019s a story describing lifes of distant relatives living in different parts of a continent named Gezes, or Timeworld in Gisoinic (the ground language). Every 3\u201325 pages, the point of view changes, but usually in an unchronological manner, meaning the reader constantly jumps back and forth in time. The main plot of Litevale orbits around the Feluminic invasion, appearance of an unknown race from the East and around the Grand Tournament of Belevalia (swordfights!). The main plot of Belevalia orbits around an event called \u201cThe Purge of Nations\u201d and the main plot of Folfjord orbits around the \u201cFall of Veashe\u201d. I\u2019m not gonna explain those, it would spoil the story. It\u2019s all a symbolism of the constant fight between ignorance and knowledge, so no, there\u2019s no good vs evil. As I mentioned above, most of the story is inspired by my teenage experiences, and done so in an extremely symbolistic, epicized and brutalized manner. It also theorizes about the true definition of a soul, afterlife and the ultimate truth about the universe, dimensions, infinity and stuff like that. So\u2026 something for everyone, I guess? ",
