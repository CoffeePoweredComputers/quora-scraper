            "answer_text": "What a fun - and funny - question! Thanks for it. I\u2019m going to be old and boring and put your question in more academic terms: what is it in a character that excites a reader to engage in speculation about her relationships with others? The answer is in the way I\u2019ve phrased your question. Characters who engage us emotionally draw us into their lives. We want to know more about them. We speculate about the parts of their lives we don\u2019t yet understand. We project our lives into theirs. We re-cast them in the drams we invent for them. So, the simplest and most amazing answer is that, when writers give us characters whom we genuinely like, we can\u2019t help but ship them, imagine them, engage with them in every way. If you are a writer, that\u2019s a great goal. If you\u2019re an avid reader, enjoy that passion you have for the characters you follow. ",
