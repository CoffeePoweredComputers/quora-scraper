            "answer_text": "They can be, depending on the context. Fragments don\u2019t have an complete subject/predicate combination usually required to express a complete thought, but there are some cases in which that is allowed. For one, interjections followed by an exclamation point are not complete sentences in themselves, but aren\u2019t grammatically incorrect. For example, \u201cDarn! I wish I had thought of that!\u201d is perfectly acceptable. Also, when you are directly answering a question, a sentence fragment can often be an acceptable response. It is not necessary to reiterate information contained in the question itself. For example, if you are asked \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d, you might answer: \u201cTo the store.\u201d You could answer \u201cHe went to the store,\u201d but you don\u2019t have to. The preceding question makes it clear who the subject is (\u2018he\u2019) and what the action was (\u2018going\u2019). ",

            "answer_text": "Contrary to the way such things are generally taught, there are three forms \u2014 Sentences Minor sentences Fragments The \u201csense\u201d in sentence does not refer to meaning; to semantics. t refers to syntax; that is, to word-order. Does it sound right? \u201cIt landed\u201d is a sentence. Why? Because it sounds like a sentence even though, out of context, we do not know what \u2018it\u2019 refers to. A fragment is a group of words that does not sound \u201cnatural.\u201d There are two types of minor sentences: Independent - these are groups of words that are not true sentences but can stand on their own. The most obvious are things like Wow! and Hello? There are a host of others. Dependent - these are groups of words that need the previous or next sentence for clarification. For example, notice the difference: I bought a boat for my brother, which was a waste of money. But let\u2019s say that you want more emphasis. You break the sentence into a sentence and a minor sentence: I bought a boat for my brother. Which was a waste of money. Professional writers use minor sentences all the time. But with students, it\u2019s more of an advanced technique. If students do it naturally, fine. But if you teach it, then many students will try using the concept \u2014 sometimes with disastrous results. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure! But it depends on the context, and the type of communication. My initial answer (\u201cSure!\u201d) is officially a fragment, but due to the context as an answer to a question, it communicates exactly what I want to say - so it is OK. One might call it \u201can abbreviated sentence\u201d - it is the sentence \u201cSurely sentence fragments are OK!\u201d with the unnecessary parts omitted. In a different context, this would not work. If we met in the street and my first words were \u201cSure!\u201d or even \u201cYes; they are\u201d, it would not make sense; it would not communicate anything useful. In formal writing, sentence fragments are not often used - they can seem too \u2018slangy\u2019 or colloqial for the style of the text. ",

A sentence fragment can be used for emphasis. Just don't use too many or they will give an uncomfortably ignorant or breathless effect.
