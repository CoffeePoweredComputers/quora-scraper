I would write it in the following neutral way knowing it is only a formality and I already discussed by leave of absence with my manager: Dear Mr./Mrs. {name of your manager}, I would like to inform you regarding my absence from the office {period}. I would be going for a vacation in order to avail of my annual leave allowance. I have sufficient hours accumulated to cover this time off. I am leaving on {date} and returning on {date}. In the meantime, I have discussed my request with my direct colleagues and my tasks will be taken care of by {name} in my absence. I am available on my phone, in case you need to contact me for important questions. I hope you will consider my request and grant me leave for the above-mentioned period. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me directly. Looking forward to your approval. Yours sincerely, {name} source: bizzlibrary.com ",

            "answer_text": "I generally handled this verbally and gave students Incompletes. I have never had a written request for leave from a student but, if I were to get one, I would like the following points to be addressed.1. Reason for the request - personal or family illness or obligations, financial hardship - weekend vacation to Aruba with boy/girlfriend probably not a good reason but be honest. Include how this might fit in with your coursework. For example - if you want to take off a month to work on a service project overseas, explain how this might advance your career/knowledge.2. How long will you be gone - specific dates if possible - how you will keep them up on changes in plans.3. Plans to make up any work/exams you will miss4. Administrative issues - do you want an Incomplete or Drop from the course. Are you asking for leave from all your classes or just this one? Most courses have some sort of tuition. Do you expect a refund or will you eat the loss? Not knowing your grade level or institution it is difficult to provide specifics. Some instructors are pompous jerks who seem to delight in power trips while others are compassionate and find it difficult to ignore students personal lives. I think I was in the latter most of the time although there were times I was a jerk. I was surprised at the things I could get through the system on behalf of my students. ",

            "answer_text": "A letter of leave is a request for an absence. It primarily asks permission to be absent. Emergencies do not require permission and are primarily announcing your required absence to deal with an unplanned, unexpected event beyond your control. Anything else: personal matters (which are personal) sickness, home affairs,.. require permission through your announcement and request for leave. If you are open, honest and sincere in your request most leave recipients will accept-especially if this is not a common reoccurrence -another \u201cfake time off grab.\u201d But they do have a right to be suspicious, in charge, and ask for verification. The key components are a respectful request for leave that is open, honest and sincere. Avoid offering to much information but do offer to recompense-make up, if necessary or possible, as well as offering to provide additional information as requested. Illnesses can be supported by doctor\u2019s letters. It is often more harmful to try to work or study when sick as others can also be sickened; but you cannot just do as you like or assume. Permission requests for leave are polite, proper and beneficial to writer and recipient. Teachers and bosses would rather cancel class or work if too many request leave, and would prefer the sick stay home to not create a bigger issue than one person on leave can cause. ",
