            "answer_text": "Finish it first. Read what exists and do better. For academic research\u2026. You can read bad fantasy, that are essentially, drafts, on Amazon for a few dollars. \u201cA Dragon\u2019s Love.\u201d Or \u201cDraconic Scion.\u201d etc like that. Tropey as hell Plots with bullet points like: Orphan girl, dad fucked off, mom died in childbirth. Maybe she has a ring on a chain or a dagger with a house symbol that hints at nobility. Girl hates her life as a tavern wench. Much scrubbing floors and ass pinching. Slaps to those who call her a whore, or offer her money to have sex. She gets a day off. She walks into the woods and is so tired she falls asleep or gets lost. She meets a hot guy. Typically naked in a warm pond, or naked, sunning himself on a flat rock. Embarrasment ensues, followed by sexual feelings. They get jiggy. Multiple times he is so hot. He is a real toe-curler. She is spent and sweaty. She falls asleep. Weird, surreal lizard sex dream. It is never explained why he is in the woods, or\u2026 He is a simple lonely woodcutter, or ranger. She hooks up with him. A lot. Like fold the corner to mark the pages of the best scenes nicholas sparks hot. It is mandatory that she drops a glass, or a tray of food, at work, thinking about her dalliances with hot woods guy. Girl gets Pregnant. Her skin changes color, just a bit\u2026 to green or blue or red, but never brown, or black. Because, that would be racist. Her lover reveals he is a true dragon. He is sorry. He gives her magic or jewelry, or magical jewelry. He tslls a story of her great, great grandfather, a hero, a dragon rider, when he was a young dragon, he remembers, before the magic war that blew the cities to hell. She is nobility. She is above the wench job. Live in the forest. He will protect her from dragon haters. She goes to live in the forest with him, in a tricked out 2 story treehouse, with a huge winding staircase with lights on poles that the dragon built for her\u2026 \u2026and it is in fact, the treehouse that is the featured, hand drawn or 3D sketchup cover art scene of the novel. Surprise! A Half dragon is about to be born. Live, but she knows they cannot trust anyone to assist. Her screams of labor makes birds fly up, miles away, risking their discovery. She bites the cord, and ties it off with a stocking. There is no egg. It is born live, and drinks painful blood from her proferred breast. P.S. Fuck anything like the potential genetics involved here. All of this shit is powered by magic baby, get with the program. Girl lives with Dragon, who professes his true love for her, (broke ass serving wench that she is/was) and their lone Dragon kid in the forest, learning magic. Happy. Boring or maybe mundane chapters of teaching the dragon kid to breathe fire, and fly. And hunt rabbits. The kid grows, and makes a mistake and goes to town. He is seen and tracked to the lair. Torchlit mob comes. The Dragon is noble.. buys time for his weird family and does not incinerate them all. He talks a good game. Offers treasure. Promises to leave. The peasants say fuck that\u2026 \u2026 and kill him with a shot through the heart with the one ballistae they have. The dragon makes a bloody speech about forgiveness, and dies. Mom and Dragon kid fly away together. He is told to escape, to one day tell the story. Tearful hug goodbye. Her son must be a brave dragon man now. Girl dies in magical battle with opressors of dragons, using dragon treasure magic, blaming the world. But she sees her son, free, flying into sunlight, as she dies. ",

            "answer_text": "That does not work like that my friend. If you \u201cpitch\u201d meaning trying to sell something not written, not finished just forget about it. Does not worth try pitch ideas. Give another example from my perspective as a software engineer. These days are several guys trying to milk the mobile application market because they are stupid enough to think that you only need a good idea and the money will come. That\u2019s not work like that. First your app needs to be designed, your concept put on trial, programmers need to do their magic with engines and you must hire good designers who are not programmers, they just draw and model things! That costs you money. In the end, your app can be canceled or the idea just tossed away because your concept does not work like a game, the app is not appealing enough and can be boring to play, the mechanics are no good etc. Now back to the book idea. The idea its just the idea, a plot, you need to create the environment, characters, put some original content on them, they will need souls and a voice. They need to react the circumstances etc. Your idea is put on trial and can or cannot be good enough for execution. That\u2019s why first, you need to write the book around that idea you have, if its good its good and will remain, if not, you just toss away and create another idea or a bunch of ideas. You can\u2019t be sure that some that resembles a very good concept will work without writing it, none can. ",
