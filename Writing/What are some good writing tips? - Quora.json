            "answer_text": "Formatting1. Do not enter two letter spaces between sentences. Use of two spaces is an obsolete convention based on typewriter technology and will mark you as out of touch. If editors or other potential employers or clients notice that you don\u2019t know this simple fact, they may be skeptical about your writing skills before you\u2019ve had a chance to impress them. 2. Take care that paragraphs are of varying reasonable length. Unusually short or long paragraphs are appropriate in moderation, but allowing a series of choppy paragraphs or laboriously long ones to remain in a final draft is unprofessional. 3. If you\u2019re submitting a manuscript or other content for publication, do not format it with various fonts and other style features. Editors want to read good writing, not enjoy aesthetically pleasing (or not) manuscripts; efforts to prettify a file are a distraction. Style4. Do not, in r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or in other text, get carried away with capitalization. You didn\u2019t earn a Master\u2019s Degree; you earned a master\u2019s degree. You didn\u2019t study Biology; you studied biology. You weren\u2019t Project Manager; you were project manager. (Search the Daily Writing Tips website for \u201ccapitalization\u201d to find numerous articles on the subject.) 5. Become familiar with the rules for styling numbers and apply them rationally. 6. Know the principles of punctuation, especially regarding consistency in insertion or omission of the serial comma, avoidance of the comma splice, and use of semi-colon.And if you write in American English and you routinely place a period after the closing quotation mark at the end of a sentence rather than before it, go back to square one and try again. 7. Hyphenation is important. In other breaking news, life isn\u2019t fair. Don\u2019t count on editors to cure your hyphenation hiccups for you; become your own expert consultant. 8. Avoid \u201cscare quotes.\u201d A term does not need to be called out by quotation marks around it unless you must clarify that the unusual usage is not intended to be read literally, or when they are employed for \u201ccomic\u201d effect. (In this case, the implication is that the comic effect is patently unamusing.) Usage9. For all intensive purposes, know your idioms. (That should be \u201cfor all intents and purposes,\u201d but you should also just omit such superfluous phrases.) On a related note, avoid clich\u00e9s like the plague \u2014 except when you don\u2019t. They\u2019re useful, but generous use is the sign of a lazy writer. Spelling10. Don\u2019t rely on spellchecking programs to do your spelling work for you, and always verify spelling (and wording) of proper nouns. Hope it helped! Source: Dailywritingtips ",

            "answer_text": "Updated: In fact you can skip all of the below and just read my Quora post on the tips for improving general writing skills in How on earth do I write this? by The Naked Listener on Quora. In any kind of writing, your \"indoctrination\" right at the outset is always this: The wretched thing will always need rewrites and edits, regardless of how fantastic your writing abilities might be. The first \"rule\" then follows: Write the wretched thing (1st draft) to completeness or near-complete form first, regardless of phraseology, grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc. Without the thing in near-complete form, you (and your editor, reviewer, etc) won't ever been in any meaningful position to think about the overall improvements to be made. Of course, that doesn't mean you avoid tweaking things along the way, but the primary aim is to write the damn thing up first. The second \"rule\" kicks in once you have a near-complete 1st draft: Get your main point up front and early! Truth is, nobody likes to read anything if they can help it. It's even truer in a business setting, in my experience over the years. Now, the first \"trick\" comes into play -- it tends to work most of the time, especially for stuff that involves descriptions (or writing that aims to evoke some kind of feeling or thinking in the reader): If your eyes could speak, what would they say? This, I think, tends to work slightly better than the \"Show, don't tell\" advice. I got this \"eyes\" tip early in my editorial career when I went into the publishing business in the late 1970s. The second \"trick\" are actually mechanistic 'operational' guidelines, and you'll have to obey or suspend them according to your taste or judgment: - Write mainly with verbs and nouns at first.- Add in adjectives if they add to the sentence's overall meaning.- Add in adverbs, ditto.- 20 to 25 words per sentence.- 2 to 4 sentences per paragraph. - Keep main points relatively together.- Keep facts relatively together.- Keep issues relatively together.- Keep examples relatively together.- Keep opinions relatively together and relatively neutral-sounding. - Conclusions are your opinions, judgments, assessments, etc, and this part usually turns out to be the biggest portion of your writing. You know your grammar already. You know your spellings already. I need not explain those here. Use your own best judgment for those. Everybody writes differently. Make things readable, rather than to flex your literary muscle (which will come naturally if things are readable). Not saying that the above will always work -- but they will tend to work more times than not. ",
