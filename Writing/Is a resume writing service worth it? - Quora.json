            "answer_text": "A well-written resume is a basic requirement for any job seeker. You start better professional writing services to make sure you get the right job. Having a great presentation of your credentials is still one of the best and most effective methods, whether that presentation is a profile on a networking site, a resume, a CV, or an executive bio. Here, then, are the top 5 reasons (and there are many more) why using a professional resume writer will be well worth the investment and will give you that competitive advantage:  1. Looks matter: The very first impression you give may be your only one if you do not appear to meet the employer\u2019s needs and expectations. Executive-level resumes should have a polished, professional appearance that is free of errors and clearly displays your most important and compelling information. 2. Save Yourself Time: We frequently hear from job seekers who spent weeks and even months fine-tuning their resume. Instead of delaying the start of your job search AND the start of a new job, hire a pro to help you in preparing the best product in a reasonable timeframe. 3. Times Change: Just because you\u2019ve always done it that way doesn\u2019t mean your old resume style will still work. Resume writers keep current on the state of their art through certifications, professional affiliations, and ongoing training. You\u2019ve kept up-to-date on your industry and so have we. 4. Save Money: Let\u2019s face it, the job search process costs money to conduct in addition to the lost income while you are out of work or underemployed Paying a resume service may seem like more money going out the door; however, this is definitely a worthwhile investment. We hear almost daily from clients who have found jobs that were professionally and financially rewarding. If you compare the salary lost from a prolonged job search with the cost of job search documents that will expedite the process, you will find yourself financially far ahead. 5. Identifying Your Value: Quite often we undervalue what we have done in our jobs. We think that everyone does that \u2013 no big deal. Resume writers will solicit the necessary details of your career in order to craft an accomplishment/outcome-based document that demonstrates your past and future value to a company. ",

            "answer_text": "If you pick the right offer, hiring a resume writing service can absolutely be worth it! Not everyone has the time or skill to write an effective resume. I wrote a blog post about this a few months ago (Hiring a Resume Writing Service | Is it Worth the Money?) but here are the highlights. These days, your resume has to jump through all these hoops before it can achieve its goal: earning you an interview (or at least a screening phone call). Here is what you may not know your resume is up against: An ATS scan, which is part of more than 90% of company\u2019s hiring processes today250 other resumes (on average\u2014but it\u2019s likely more given the current U.S. job market)A recruiter or HR professional, who may or may not be the person deciding if you get hiredThe decision-maker, who decides if you get the job and how much you\u2019re worthA resume writing service can help you with all of these challenges. In fact, the best resumes will: Pass the ATS test and the 6-second cursory review with flying colorsHave a great format that caters to the ATS and appeals to hiring managersHave exactly the right keywords for your industry and job targetPresent your work experience in the most compelling way (without lying)Shorten your job search\u2014especially if you\u2019re looking for a high-level position [1]Earn you a higher salary offer [2]Sounds pretty good, right? The $200 average of a professional resume writing service is probably worth it if you need help with any one of these items. What you want to do is pick the right kind of service. In general, you want to avoid resume mills and template services. Both are likely to generate a low-quality resume that won\u2019t help you with any of the issues I mentioned above. Instead, look for certified professional resume writers, examples of their work, and a physical address and phone number for the company/service before you buy. Freelancers and national companies alike often have reviews on third-party sites, which can help you make the right decision.
