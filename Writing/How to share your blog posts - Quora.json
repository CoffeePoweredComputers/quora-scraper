            "answer_text": "Like this! [1] Twitter You should already have more than one Twitter profile. You have one for yourself, another for your brand or business, and you could still have more related to your industry. Create audiences on twitter with varied profiles related to what you\u2019re doing. Use your favorite scheduling tool and schedule MANY tweets about your article. MANY. The headline and link, of course A quote from yourself A quote you featured from someone else Provocative thoughts Schedule out the sharing of your content on ALL of your Twitter profiles. Schedule tweets more than once. No one sits on Twitter and reads everything so you absolutely can (and should) tweet something more than once \u2013 so followers who didn\u2019t see it previously might still see it. Here\u2019s the trick: ALWAYS @tag others. It gets their attention. Tag people you quoted. Tag someone who might have interest. Tag a friend who might enjoy your article. Heck, tag me, I\u2019m @seobrien; you\u2019ll see how I get informed of what you\u2019ve tweeted. Share this and tag me  LinkedIn A few ways to appreciate LinkedIn so let\u2019s break them down. Your own profile, from which you can post something or write an article Your business page, from which you can post something A group be that one you created or one in which you belong, to which you can post something Let me touch on writing an article in a moment. First, let\u2019s keep this simple and focus on just posting your article. Write a blurb that\u2019s compelling and interesting. Tag (just like Twitter, @[someone\u2019s name]) people associated with your article. Add your link. And post it in varied ways as YOURSELF, your BUSINESS, and in GROUPs. Appreciate, you shouldn\u2019t post the exact same thing in every context. Should you instead write an article?? Considering you already have, on your site, it would be easy to recreate the article on LinkedIn would it not? POST when it\u2019s just something you want to share with your LinkedIn connections and followers. Instead take the article you wrote and publish it AGAIN as an article on your personal profile IF it\u2019s an article you forever want associated with your LinkedIn profile. Note though, if you want to republish your article in full on LinkedIn, add a link in that article back to the original article written. This is pretty important for some SEO reasons we\u2019ll not get into here. Just remember: when you republish an article somewhere else, link back to the original! Medium Speaking of republishing the article, Medium is a great place to do so. Again, you want to make sure you link BACK to the original source; Medium makes it easy to do so. Start here: Join Medium. Use that Import Feature to paste the web address of your original article and import the content into Medium. This ensures that the article uses what\u2019s called a \u201cCanonical URL\u201d (an SEO thing) and at the end of the the article will appear a link to the original. It\u2019s a great idea to do this because Medium is a wonderful site through which you can (and should) build a distinct audience of followers who want to read what you write. And it\u2019s here that our reason for this article should become most clear \u2013 Medium, as an example, is a place where you can write and develop an audience; but why would you only do so there? Create your wholly owned foundation of content, your portfolio, and then syndicate it to places like Medium. Facebook Luckily, as we move forward in our list, we can get more concise. Facebook: your personal profile, your business page, and groups. A lot like LinkedIn. And, like Twitter and LinkedIn, be sure to tag people! Post that you wrote this article yourself to share it with friends. Post differently on your business or brand page that the company has shared this perspective (and tag yourself as the author!). Post a few times in different Groups related to your topic. Footnotes[1] Creating Content that Impacts",
