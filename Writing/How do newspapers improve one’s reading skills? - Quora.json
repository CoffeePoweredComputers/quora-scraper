            "answer_text": "Before I answer this question, I want to say that I do not have the habit of reading newspapers regularly or even rarely. But my answer for this question is going to be positive. And here\u2019s why. Reading English newspapers for a person whose native language isn\u2019t English is quite a challenge. One thing I have experienced by reading newspapers is that I will ultimately understand the context of the article, but fail to actually comprehend every part of it. The standard of language used in papers is so over the top that I would sometimes read a sentence multiple times to try and get to understand the meaning of it, nonetheless I would fail to most of the times. That\u2019s when I actually realized the power of words and my level of comprehension. Now of course, while one skims through papers in a rush before heading to work, they would indeed get to know the worldly affairs collectively. But how far they understand or appreciate the professional, effective delivery of information, you never know until you check them out yourself. It\u2019s the most efficient way to learn how to render an information professionally. Reading novels or books will of course help you improve your reading skills. But you would have to be reading a dozen of them before you actually feel a difference in your skill. However, that\u2019s not the case with newspapers. You pick a paper, fold it up, skim through it, and if you ever understand all parts of it perfectly, you know you\u2019re a pro. There is so much to learn in those few pages each day. You will also inculcate a higher level of vocabulary skill that you might actually not learn that soon through any other resource. After giving such an elaborate response, I find myself thinking why I don\u2019t read them then. A good thought. Let me get it cleared, while you readers keep reading. ",
