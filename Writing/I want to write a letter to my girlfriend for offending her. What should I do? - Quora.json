Explain how you will consider things in the future. Let her know how much you appreciated being called out on your behavior. Now that you have addressed yourself leave the letter alone for a few hours! Read what you wrote again. Decide if you want her to know everything you've written and write another letter. Second letter is what to consider giving to her. Rewrite that puppy if necessary. Please don't text or call right now. Reactionary conversations tend to create more chaos. The handwritten note reflects your message. Reading it allows time for feedback. Be willing to hear what she says. You might not like her response but you'll know what she expects from you. Best part of writing it down\u2026.not blurting something out you don't mean! Calling yourself out on your own crap is growth. Learn from your mistakes and make better choices moving forward. For me, I got letters to write myself. Time for me to practice what I've been preaching. xoxo ps we got this \ud83e\udd70 ",

            "answer_text": "I'm going to give my opinion, that's all it is. So I'm sorry if, by doing so just bugs you. Anyhow, I'm not sure you should apologize. I mean if you know for sure she was offended, and you were just way outta line. That for no reason you were blatantly offensive. Then don't write here a letter. As soon as you possibly can, buy her the nicest bouquet of flowers that the florist tells you best expresses an ass kissing, and tell her. \" Baby I am so sorry for being an ass. I have no excuse cause there is no excuse, I just had a bad moment, and worse I waited this long to tell you, I'm sorry. I made a mistake, and a mistake is a learning tool. So baby I want you to know, I've learned from this, and I wont make the same mistake twice\". Then take her out to buy something nice, do something fun, and end the night with romance. If, on the otherhand you didn't mean to be offensive, then you probably weren't. Tell her to get over it, she's being sensitive. Either way you've done your part, in the fight against a raging problem our society has developed with passive aggressive behavior. Good luck, (( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\ua35f\u2124 ",
