            "answer_text": "Pay close attention. I can\u2019t believe nobody\u2019s telling you this. There is no such thing as a good hobby for you to put on your resume. Every inch of your resume is valuable space. You have to use it to successfully convey the professional attributes that make you a good candidate. If your hobbies have no tangible value to your career search, they do no good on your resume besides giving you a nice, happy feeling that people give a damn. They don\u2019t. If they ask about your hobbies in the interview, of course you should be honest about it. But unless your hobby is specifically job-related, you\u2019re wasting space and time putting it anywhere on your resume. Instead, use that space to quantify what sets you apart. ",
