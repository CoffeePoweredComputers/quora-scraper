            "answer_text": "I also agree with Charles Cornaire. But, I followed a different strategy to get my first job. As a fresher, it\u2019s a little bit tough to get a job. You know most of the freelancers in upwork are Top rated and maintain top class quality. Among those, some are charging the same rate what you are charging as a fresher. So, I think it would be better to avoid those jobs where a client a huge spent and high review.  This is an ideal client for all. From top rated to worst rated, fresher to expert, all (including you) won\u2019t hesitate to a proposal here. As this client has enough budget to invest, so you have almost zero probability to get this job. As a fresher, stay away from this kind of clients. So, it would be better to make a proposal to clients like this.  You have no need to worried about the payment method. Upwork will take care of this. From my personal experience, I didn\u2019t find any fraud yet. So, do a classified list to make a proposal and then start to make a proposal. Best wishes for your job search ",

            "answer_text": "Without seeing your proposals it is difficult to say, but these pointers should help you. When I first started using Upwork I was utilizing ALL of my connects each month. In other terms, you have to be sending a lot of proposals initially for just a few hits. If you haven't secured any jobs yet, you may need to look outside of your niche in order to secure your first 5 star rating. This is crucial. My first 5 stars were for posting a review on Amazon for $5, but it opened the door for other opportunities once I had a rating. You may have to start out with a lower hourly rate than you are used to as well which can then be slowly increased as you land more jobs. Goodluck! ",
