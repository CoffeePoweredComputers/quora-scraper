            "answer_text": "The first character is the surname / family name. The second character is typically the generational name. This means that all offspring within the same generation would share the same generational name. Depending on the family\u2019s practice, the generational name may be different between boys and girls. The third character is typically what Westerners would call the given name. The reason I say \u2018typically\u2019 is because in some cases, the positions of the generational and given names are swapped around. So, to cite a simple example, a Mr. & Mrs. Lee Thiam Wee \u674e\u6dfb\u5049 could have two sons Lee Kian Beng \u674e\u5efa\u660e and Lee Kian Seng \u674e\u5efa\u6210 (where Kian \u5efa is the boys\u2019 generational name), and two daughters Lee Poh Chu \u674e\u5bf6\u73e0 and Lee Poh Gek \u674e\u5bf6\u7389 (where Poh \u5bf6 is the girls\u2019 generational name). One classic example is the Khoo \u90b1 clan of Penang (Malaysia). To this day, the Khoo\u2019s maintain the tradition of giving names to their offspring based on a 40-character genealogy chart below (Source: Leong San Tong Khoo Kongsi). This is not limited to just one Khoo \u90b1 family, but the entire Khoo \u90b1 clan (cousins, second and third cousins, and way beyond).  What this means is that a Mr. Khoo Soo Teck \u90b1\u601d\u5fb7 could bump into a total stranger called Mr. Khoo Soo Jit \u90b1\u601d\u65e5, and they could both identify themselves as probably very distant cousins belonging to the 20th generation of the Khoo \u90b1 clan, calculated from the time of the progenitor of the Khoo \u90b1 clan. Due to large age differences amplified over successive generations, it may even be that Mr. Khoo Soo Teck \u90b1\u601d\u5fb7 and Mr. Khoo Soo Jit \u90b1\u601d\u65e5 could have an age difference of thirty to forty years! At the time of writing, the Khoo\u2019s have reached more or less the 27th generation (i.e. Kar \u5bb6). Once they reach the 40th generation, the poem is expected to repeat itself from the beginning. (By the way, for Mandarin speakers who are baffled by my seemingly-alien choice of phonetics above, I am using the Hokkien \u798f\u5efa or Minnan \u95a9\u5357 dialect for pronouncing the Chinese characters.) In cases where a Chinese name comprises only two characters instead of three, it implies that the parents of the person have chosen to drop the generational name (not uncommon among single-child families), or that the person himself/herself has opted to drop his generational name for convenience (a common practice among lone first-generation migrants from China - my own great-grandfather was an example).

            "answer_text": "Good question. It\u2019s rather confusing when one or two of the three character could be the last name \u59d3 and one or two characters could be the first name \u540d. First thing is to know which one is which. It was not always that first name first and last name last. When I was a kid, I love watching the 007 series when Sean Connery said: \u201cMy name is Bond, James Bond\u201d. Classic and left a long lasting impression for me to start introduce myself that way. The name is Wong, Joseph Wong. My name pronounce as Wang E Tzu \u738b \u4e00 \u67f1 in Mandarin (high tone) or Wong Yah Qu in Cantonese (low tone). E or Yah \u4e00 means ONE in English and \u67f1Tzu or Qu means post. \u738b Wang is Mandarin and Wong is Cantonese for the same last name which means king, the family surname. I was also known by friends as \u9ed1 Huck means black in Cantonese for coming out of the oven (womb) like a charcoal. There are over thousands of family surnames with most commonly known last names listed in a book called \u767e\u5bb6\u59d3 \u201cThe Hundred Family Surnames\u201d. See here Chinese surname - Wikipedia You can also see additional details about last names in Wei Zhen\u2019s answer. Legend has it that the surnames were collected during Ming Dynasty in the manner that has no rhyme or reason other than the author\u2019s will and/or who\u2019s in charge. The first family surname in the book is \u8d99 Chao which happen to be last name of the first Ming Emperor. Second is \u9322 Cheng, which means money. Third is \u5b6b Sun, means grandson. Followed by \u674e Li; which could mean plum or \u5341\u516b\u5b50 the eighteen\u2019s son. My family surname is \u738b Wong/Wang, landed the number eight spot in the book. If the last name only contains one character then the other one or two characters usually are the first name and middle name. People with \u8907\u59d3 double characters for last name sometimes ended up with four character names if middle name was included. \u53f8\u99ac Si-Ma, \u6b50\u967d Au-Yang, \u6155\u5bb9 Moo-Yung are common two character surnames. What\u2019s in a name but how you are being remembered by others. Is it really that a rose by any other name is a rose? Not to the Chinese, educated people would never name their kids \u82b1 Hua, \u725b New, \u8c6c Ju, \u72d7 Go, but they are common names for folks came from \u9115\u4e0b country villages. \u660e Ming means bright, \u5c71 Shan means mountain, Nell \u9ce5 (bird) is rare but \u9df9 Ying (eagle) is popular clearly showing size does matters. \u59ba \u6885 Mei could be or means \u59b9 little sister or \u6885 Chinese Blossom. Chinese is not like the show \u201cName that tune\u201d\u3002 It\u2019s rather difficult to provide you Chinese name meanings because they are being used phonetically. When introduced; people would explain to you what their name means and that\u2019s the best way to find what what\u2019s what and who\u2019s who. By the way, do you know what John and Mary means? When I name my son Douglas; I didn\u2019t know it meant from dark waters and my daughter\u2019s name Sheena was just like Jane in England. Go figure. ",
