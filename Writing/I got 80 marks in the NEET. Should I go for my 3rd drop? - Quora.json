            "answer_text": "Absolutely not..but u can try if u think it's ur area of interest..but before that ask ur inner self that if u can do it finally or not..if u r not able to increase ur score then it's better not to waste ur precious years..u should have self realization of this..as u know MBBS itself is a course of 5 year and this is not enough for u to practice on ur own..as u will need a MD or MS degree for ur own private practice..so it's really a long journey. Although it's a beautiful journey but u need a lot of patience.. U should ask urself that what u are best at..cuz at this much marks nothing is going to happen and also it's ur 2nd attempt marks then u should surely not take another attempt..it would be much better for u.. Think wisely and decide wisely\u2026may be u got such low marks due to ur insincerity and lack of direction..if any of these two are the reason for ur low grades then I think u should ask some medico for guidance and u should give a sincere stroke for one more time..but u have to give ur 200% this tym mind that..and if after doing all these also ur grades don't improve then u must not try this again..I hope it may help u to take wise decision..

Am i able to crack it ? Am i able to study that hard day and night ? And then evaluate your answer honestly. It's may be yes or no . It's mostly times depends on you that what you select to choose . Forget the past it has nothing to do with your present and future.Accept your weaknesses that why you scored only 80 marks.Set your goalsAnd start today \u2026\u2026..No one can motivate you untill you want to get select .No one will make your selection untill you want to get selected .THANK for reading All the best ",
