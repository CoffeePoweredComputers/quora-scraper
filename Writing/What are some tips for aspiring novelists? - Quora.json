            "answer_text": "The reason you give up is because you don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re doing. Things take time. If you wanted to fly a plane, what would you do? You'd find a ground school and take lessons. If you wanted to play the piano, what would you do? You'd find a piano teacher and take classes. What makes writing any different? Writing is an art, but it\u2019s a learned art. To ask someone how to write a story is like asking \u201cHow do I climb a mountain?\u201d You don\u2019t, unless you\u2019ve had the training. And no, it\u2019s not rocket science, but writing is something that needs to be studied and practiced. Anybody can sit down and write crap. You see it all the time in self pubbed books. Most people will tell you to just start writing, and keep writing, but I don't agree. It's not enough to just write every day if you don't know what you're doing or how to improve something. That just means days and weeks and months of useless writing. It's like not knowing how to knit so you just keep making loops with the yarn. You can't get better, you can't turn that into a scarf ... you have the desire, but you don't know how. I'm going to give you my stock answer that I give everyone who asks me this question. I'm going to give you some good advice on how to learn the craft, and give you a place to send in some of your work when you're ready. In order to write stories that people want to read you will need to understand how to put one together. There is a definite pattern and rhythm to it. And there are certain expectations from the editors and publishing houses as to how your story is laid out. Take classes in writing; grammar and punctuation (very important... lots of self published books are swimming in glaring errors and typos), character building, dialogue, plotting, pacing, point of view (POV), inner and outer conflicts, subplots, scenes and sequels, genres, story boards, twists, chapter hooks, suspense, killer opening lines, and satisfying endings. If you're going to write sci-fi you will need to take classes in world building. Each genre of book has its own set of expectations from the reader that you will need to fulfill. For example a murder mystery must have clues for the reader to try and solve. A romance needs a happen ever after ending, known to writers as an HEA. A thriller needs fast pacing and danger. There are classes in short story writing. Where to find these classes? Local community colleges often offer writing classes. My local library has classes seasonally. Best of all there are hundreds of classes you can take on-line. They run about $25-$35 each and range from 2 to 4 weeks. Google on-line writing classes and you will get lots of sites. Try www.oirwa.com or www.savvyauthors.com. Just because a class might be about writing romances, writing is writing; many of the same principles apply to other genres. So don\u2019t hesitate to take a course on character building or writing scenes just because the site caters to romance. There are sites that offer expensive classes, so be careful. I\u2019d recommend starting with a few less expensive ones to see if you really like writing and want to continue. IMO it is not necessary to have a degree or to take an expensive course to write well. Read a lot. Get a feel for how a story is told; how it starts, how it progresses through the story to a satisfying end. See how your favorite author keeps you interested. I don't know your age, but when you are able join some writing groups, even online groups are helpful. Oftentimes these groups offer lectures and classes in writing. They share their work and critique each other. Once you start taking classes and get a good feel for how to put a story together, write some short stories (800 - 1500 words). The more you write, the better you will become. You will make new writer mistakes, we all did. But that's how you learn. I say start with short stories because they are, well short, and don't take years to complete like a novel does. You can share your stories with others and get feedback. Take the feedback and use what you feel is constructive for you and ignore the others. Some people don't give good feedback, or there is a motive behind their negative comments. You have to learn which ones to take and learn from and which ones to disregard. And when you are reading and critiquing other's stories, be kind, give good feedback, and find something positive to say to them. It's hard to hear harsh things about your writing. It's tough love. But it works when you get it and understand why the comment was made and you go and make your piece better because of it. Submitting to contests is another way to get good feedback because the judges are usually editors and agents who have their finger on the pulse of good writing that sells. Once you feel you have written a great short story, be brave and submit it to a magazine that publishes fiction in the genre you wrote. Don't worry about rejections. They will come. Oftentimes it's not because your story is not good, it's because the story doesn't fit their needs. They are running a business after all, and they pick the stories that they feel will best entertain their readers. All authors get rejections. It's part of the 'hunt'. Here\u2019s a place to start submitting. Check out their guidelines carefully. FLASH FICTION ONLINE http://flashfictiononline.com/main/submission-guidelines/ We publish stories from 500 to 1,000 words in length. They\u2019re very short, but they are still stories. That means the best ones have strong, interesting characters, plots, and (to some extent, at least) settings. We\u2019re not that concerned about genre. Many of us have a fondness for science fiction and fantasy, but we also like literary fiction; and in any case, great flash stories aren\u2019t always easily classified. If you wrote it, and you love it, then submit it. No erotica, porn, graphic sex, or violence. Pays $60 per story. Buys reprints at two cents/word. Once you are good enough to sell a few short stories, then you will have the skills to think about plotting out a whole book. \u0002 ",

            "answer_text": "There's a ton of great advice from wonderful people, both successful authors and others in the publishing business, on Quora. Take some time to browse through the Breaking in as a New Author or Novelist topic and you can learn a ton. I work as an editor with novelists, both successfully published ones and first-time writers. This isn't a complete list, but it's the advice I would give you if you were my client. Come up with an original idea. If I have to read another story about vampires falling in love, a plucky poor boy from the wrong side of the tracks making good, or soldiers fighting zombie aliens after the apocalypse, I might break a pencil or two. If your basic plot has already been done to death, you're going to have to work really hard to make it interesting to your readers, and that will make it a much harder sell no matter how well you write. Write the story that you not only need to write, but that your audience wants to read. This has two parts: First, you write what you have to write. There's a story within you, and you should go with that. This sounds like the opposite of my first advice, but it's not. I only mean if you feel like you should be writing erotic fiction, don't try to write children's lit because you think it will sell better. Follow your passion, it will make life easier. The second part means this: Know your audience and give them a story that they will find interesting. I don't care that you devoted 3 years and 400 pages to painfully writing the memoir of your breakup with your ex-girlfriend. It's monumental to you, but unless you're a Kardashian, no one else is going to care. A first draft is a first draft. And first drafts suck. They're important, because without them nothing would ever get written. But for the love of all that's holy, don't send that first draft to anyone, especially not anyone is a professional capacity! Put it aside for a while and then use it to build your second draft. At a bare, bare minimum, please read it over and check for glaring errors. Don't make me cry. Related: Be a professional. You will not get treated like a professional in this business unless you act like one, so start acting like one. Have business cards. Have a LinkedIn page and website. Make contacts. Know what the standards and norms are for your field and genre. Attend conferences. Don't write COPYRIGHT all over your manuscript. Make sure you spell agent's and publisher's names correctly and adhere flawlessly to their specs when querying or submitting. Have someone else to join the fray with you. Whether it's your editor, your writing group, or just a really helpful spouse, your work will be so much better if you have another set of eyes (or ten) that can help you guide it into the world. Other people will always be able to see flaws that you can't. Other people will support you when you need it. Finally, just keep going. Don't get discouraged. The world is chock full of people who are 'going to write a book someday.' If you can actually do it, you're already better than 99% of them. If you want to be an author then let's get it done! Now is a great time. I wish you the best. ",
