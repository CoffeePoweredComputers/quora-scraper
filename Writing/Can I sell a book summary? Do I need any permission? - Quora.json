            "answer_text": "First, whether the summaries will be sold or not has no bearing on whether or not you would need permission or whether or not you would be infringing if you did not obtain permission.  Whether your intent is commercial gain is just one of several factors considered in determining if you have a fair use defense to infringement.  A summary can fall anywhere along a spectrum of obviously fair use to obviously infringement.  There is no clear line.  If your summary includes your own thoughts and is more of a critique or review, you are probably fine, unless you quote/copy more from the original work than you reasonably need to. If you are copying verbatim a lot of the material, but just removing what you deem less important in order to create a summary, you are probably infringing without a fair use defense. Chances are, you are doing something in the middle.  In that case, there's no way to answer your question without examining your summary and the original work.  But if you consider what courts deem relevant when determining fair use, you can probably make a good guess. See this Wikipedia article: Fair use Of course, if you are really concerned about it, talk to an attorney about your specific set of facts. If you decide to seek permission, start with the author.  If there is clearly a publisher of the work, check with them too.  The entity you need to obtain permission from depends on the agreement (assignment or license) that the author and publisher have.
