            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been a couple of decades since I read Scarlet Letter\u2026 I used to give it to my student teachers to teach :) As I recall, however, Chillingworth essentially shrivels up and dies when Dimmesdale escapes his clutches by dying before he actually can confess\u2014 regardless of what he may or may not have displayed on his breast after the sermon\u2014 he calls himself a sinner but does *not* state the sin. What else is he to do with his filthy lucre, as it cannot buy him his revenge (Dimmesdale has \u201cescaped me\u201d he says!). If he does not leave it to Pearl, then the state can seize it\u2014 the government would get it all, as he has no other heirs. And legally, I think Pearl may be his heir since she was born in wedlock, even if not by him? I believe English common law of the time defined illegitmacy only as those children born out of wedlock. Perhaps it was simply Hawthorne tying up a loose end? :) ",

He try to persuade Dimesdale to convince his crime ad expose himself as the real father of Pearl and dies. Chillingworth\u2019s only purpose of living appears to be punishing his rival. Being a doctor he forgets his moral duty of his profession and persuade Dimesdale to move towards death. He feels guilty after fulfilling his wish and to REDEEM himself of his sin of committing sin against the principles of a doctor and dies leaving his property to Pearl. ",
