            "answer_text": "This is almost correct! The correct way to say this is: It\u2019s been a year since I met you. I think you are confusing the verb \u2018to know\u2019 with \u2018to meet\u2019. It is \u2018since I met you\u2019 because you are talking about that specific action at that time. You wouldn\u2019t say \u2018today I know Charles\u2019, you would say \u2018today I met Charles\u2019. You would use the verb \u2018to know\u2019 if you wanted to talk about the whole length of the time: \u2018I have known you for a year\u2019. This takes every single day that they have know each other for into account. On the other hand, \u2018It\u2019s been a year since I met you\u2019 focuses on that specific day that the two people met. I hope that makes sense. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably not. When you use \u201cknew\u201d it means something that you used to know but don't any longer. The sentence in its present form means I stopped knowing you a year ago. So it might be correct in the context of something that you might say to a close friend or lover that you have grown apart from during the last year. I think what you mean is something like: \u201cI have known you for a year.\u201d If you want a contrived sentence that has a similar form you can say \u201cit has been a year since I first got to know you.\u201d ",
