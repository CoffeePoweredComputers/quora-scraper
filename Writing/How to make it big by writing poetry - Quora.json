            "answer_text": "Making money as a writer in any genre is very difficult.  That said, I've been a writer for over two decades and made more income from of my poetry last year than anything else.  I did it by choosing the, \"author-prenuer\" path instead of submitting my work to literary journals or publishers.   The best way to make money as an author these days is to think like an entrepreneur.  Start a blog, create social media pages, create a website that is integrated with Mail Chimp and start building your mailing list.   Learn to create multiple incomes streams from the same product.  For example, I sell individual printed original poems, a personalized poetry service where people can hire me to write a custom poem, sell my poetry in book form, and produce hand-made, limited print run poetry chapbooks a few times per year.  The chapbooks are a very good money maker but the most profitable of them all is the personalized poetry.  Although the literary establishment will tell you different, you really don't need a professional publisher in today's world. In fact, you may do better without one.   Best of luck to you!    ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think writing poetry solely for the purpose of 'getting big' should be your primary motive. Poetry is an art, different to paintings but just as good at expressing its message. There have been many poets in the past who have written pieces that one would assume would've 'got big' but that's not really the case. See William Blake's 'The Garden of Love' - it's been interpreted as being a poem going against the establishment of the Church and encourages people to think differently, appealing to all branches of society - not just the intelligentsia of the time period. Sure, you have the Cavalier poets such as Richard Lovelace who were actually rich prior to their writing so there was more meaning to what they write about (even though they had little regard for women and would show off their poems to their friends showcasing their works)> What I'm trying to get at here is, don't go into writing poetry solely for the money. Write good pieces of work and your poets will do all the work for you and develop a fanbase. ",
