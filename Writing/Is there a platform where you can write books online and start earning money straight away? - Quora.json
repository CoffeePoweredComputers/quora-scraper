            "answer_text": "One of the easiest ways to sell ebooks is to work through a third-party site like Amazon. You may have ordered products, even books, from Amazon in the past. But this is a whole different side to this massive e-commerce site. The big benefit of working through Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, even though they charge you a commission on your sales, is their reach. Around 89 million Americans are said to be active ebook readers. That\u2019s your potential audience, all those people visiting this site and browsing for a new book. It could be your book they find when searching for a related keyword. 38 percent of daily sales of ebooks on Amazon go to self-published titles. While you may not make as much money as you would selling directly on your site, you'll have the opportunity to reach an audience that you wouldn't otherwise have access to. The process of selling your ebook on Kindle is straightforward. You sign up, then upload your ebook. They take care of converting it to their proprietary format. Then you\u2019re ready to sell and grow your business through Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more. ",

            "answer_text": "You can write books on several platforms \u2014 Amazon, Smashwords, Barnes and Noble, Kobo, Google Play. Most pay 60 days after the end of a month, into a bank account. The exception is Smashwords, which deposits funds into PayPal. As you likely know, income is not automatic. You need to write a good book on a topic that interests a lot of people, and you need to promote it. If you write a how-to publication, sometimes that generates income faster. People \u201cneed\u201d the information. Though I write primarily fiction, no one \u201cneeds\u201d to buy fiction. You can check out my blog for some ideas on publishing and marketing \u2014 there is an index. Good luck! Elaine L. Orr http://elaineorr.blogspot.com ",

You have to get readers the hard way. Nobody is going to walk up and ask to be your fan. You can, of course, get paid upfront publishing stories with some magazines, but the publications that will actually pay you are rare and hard to find these days and I wouldn\u2019t call them a platform, and the content they want usually isn\u2019t as long as a \u201cbook\u201d. Please be aware of scams where people try to get you to sign away your intellectual property for pennies. And then, after you have signed it away, you find out that you still have to get readers the hard way, same as anybody else. Watch out especially for startup platforms. Read the terms of service. ",

            "answer_text": "Can you start earning money immediately by self-publishing your books? I\u2019ve seen some good answers to this question, and the best of them all boil down to: no. If you could do so, everyone would quickly follow suit. And, I\u2019m not sure you understand the logistics involved here, but if everyone followed suit, no one would be able to find your book to buy. It would be awash in a proverbial sea of literature. The bottom line is this: If you want to be a writer, take the time to learn how to do it right and be a writer. That means months, years, or even decades of learning, practicing, publishing, building a following, failing, and succeeding. If you want to be an entrepreneur, don\u2019t turn to writing for your salvation. Can you be a writer and an entrepreneur? Possibly. At least some people have shown an ability to write books and market them effectively. But that begs the question: Which are they? Writers or marketers? Artists or entrepreneurs? I\u2019ll leave that to you to answer. Hope this helps. ",

Let's be clear. You will have to work to get readers to your book and it will take time. Webnovel will only give you a contract to start earning when you hit the one million and above reads bar. If not, your book is free for all. Tapas allows for you to get paid for adverts. But, your book has to be popular first. When you hit a certain range, you can start receiving money for ads placed on your work. There is even feature to have readers pay using the site money that can be translate to real cash for you. But, you must own a PayPal account that can receive money or you'll be paid in amazon gift cards I think... So useless if you ask me. Moboreaders is different. You can get a contract with them right from the start. They assign you an account manager that always answers your questions and solve issues really fast. I love this about them. You can host free chapters to gain interest for your work, then start locking chapter later. All these you can have them arrange it. Readers pay to read locked chapters and you recieve monthly payments to an account of your choice. (you will state this account in the contract.) Good luck ",
