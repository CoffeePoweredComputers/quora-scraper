            "answer_text": "If these clothes have been washed a few times, chances are the stains are forever.  If oil stains have oxidized with age, even more doubtful.  Dry cleaning removes grease stains, but not if the clothing has gone thru the aforementioned detriments.  Dry cleaners can sometimes remove ink stains by hand and then clean them but see the if, ands, and buts on the grease stains. No guarantees on this next paragraph! Home remedy you might try, assuming the ink spots are small is to soak them with Spray and Wash and then put some after shave lotion or cologne on the ink spot.  Rub the spot with something blunt like the back end of a key or spoon.  If you see any success add more cologne and continue while also adding more Spray and Wash to keep the ink from spreading.  Wash the garment before the spotted area dries.  The grease may also respond to the same method. Good luck! ",
