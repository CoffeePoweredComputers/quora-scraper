            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between having 200 million and 1 Billion?\u201d I see lots of answers saying 800 million. While that\u2019s materially correct, I think it doesn\u2019t answer the question. I guess the intended question was: \u201cdoes one feel different with 200 million and with one billion?\u201d I guess it shouldn\u2019t make much difference. But maybe it does when you have 200 million and your neighbour has one billion, a larger house, a larger ship, a larger swimming pool, a faster private jet\u2026, and lots of other useless things. ",
