Instead of changing one of the \u201cas if\u201ds to an \u201cas though,\u201d I\u2019d scrap the sentence and rewrite it. He felt a subliminal presence, something not quite tangible, trying to warn him. He felt something trying to warn him\u2014something like a presence, without form or shape. He felt a warning from the air, as if from some unseen presence hovering just at the edge of his awareness. ",
