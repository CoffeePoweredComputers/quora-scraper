            "answer_text": "It seems most of the concern around credibility is related to news stories and politics these days. I have found this media bias chart helpful, as it shows both political bias and credibility and it is regularly updated, so that the surveying is ongoing. Note that the major news networks, (ABC, NBC, CBS, NPR, PBS) and sources, (AP, Bloomberg, Reuters) are near top and center, so neutral and factual reporting. Notice CNN gets to left leaning opinion, and FOX gets down to right wing bias and propaganda. I also refer to Snopes on particular stories and find this helpful. For the story listed above, I did not find the source, Euronews, on the chart. Snopes had a few stories, but not the one mentioned above  ",

            "answer_text": "Semi-credible. What is true is that the girl saw somebody, reported that to the police and fled Germany. Those are the things both sides agree on. The differences come in the details. The German police says that they were not able to find the person she reported and that she has not been available for questioning. She claims that German police told her that, since the man was refugee, they could do nothing and that they have refused to talk with her. The truth is most likely somewhere in there. ",
