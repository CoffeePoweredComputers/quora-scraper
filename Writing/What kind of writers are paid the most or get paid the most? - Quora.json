            "answer_text": "Having worked in book and magazine publishing, public relations, advertising and direct response, I have a rule of thumb for writer remuneration: The more directly your writing impacts your client's bottom line, the more money you make. Let's face it: 99.9% of us will never become Hollywood screenwriters or celebrity authors writing for projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars. One of the next best things - at least financially speaking - is to become a direct response copywriter. They typically earn a lot more than other writers because their value proposition is the promise of higher conversions, and hence more money for the client. A direct response copywriter is also one of the only types of writers who can command a commission for every product sold as a result of his/her writing. Write a high converting sales letter for the right product at the right time, and you could theoretically become an overnight millionaire. On the flip side of that is, say, an average magazine writer: the kind of writer whose work exists primarily to fill up white space in a publication that makes the bulk of its money from advertising. (Yes, one can argue that good writing sells magazines. But in my experience, publishers perceive their ad sales department as the primary moneymaker - not editorial.) ",

Or, putting it more obviously, the more your prospects value your content, the more they'll be willing to pay you for it. For example, I started freelance writing over at WarriorForum. Most of the prospects over there are the type who \u2013 even after 3 years of Google slaps \u2013 still squirm at the thought of paying more than a penny per word. Content is just the space around SEO keywords. I've now learned that the writers who get paid the most are the ones who put themselves in front of the deepest pockets. Fortune 500 companies pay more than small business owners who pay more than struggling entrepreneurs who pay more than outsourcing firms. To be fair, I found many of my now-favorite clients through WarriorForum, but they were and still are the exception, not the rule. ",
