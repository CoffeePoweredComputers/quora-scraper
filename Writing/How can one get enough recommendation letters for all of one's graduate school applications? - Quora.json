Or in more words \u2014 your recommenders are expecting to send substantially the same letter for recommendation to each school. So pick your best three recommenders and ask them if it would be a burden if you\u2019re going to be applying to a dozen schools or so. ",

            "answer_text": "Quality recommendations are what count, and arguably the best course of action is to narrow down your list of prospective recommenders to those who can and will say wonderful and insightful things about you.  You might then ask this small group of quality recommenders to handle all of your recommendations, and thank them repeatedly for taking the time to do so. Hope that helps . . . ",
