            "answer_text": "While there are many instances of words used as names in English (Hope, Faith, etc.) and Japanese (Hikaru \u5149/to shine, Megumi \u6075/blessing, etc.) alike, usually 4+ syllable words like nagareru or utsukushii are not considered for names. The reason is that verbs and adjectives have okurigana attached to them to complete the word\u2019s meaning, kind of like how the \u201cst\u201d in \u201c1st\u201d lets you know that it\u2019s \u201cfirst\u201d not \u201conest.\u201d In \u6d41\u308c\u308b, the kanji is \u201cnaga\u201d and tells you the meaning \u201cto flow.\u201d The \u201creru\u201d in hiragana completes the actual word for \u201cto flow.\u201d In \u7f8e\u3057\u3044, \u201cutsuku\u201d is the kanji reading and alerts you to the meaning \u201cbeautiful\u201d, and \u201cshii\u201d in hiragana completes the actual word for \u201cbeautiful.\u201d That said, there are instances of verbs and adjectives as names. Obviously, they\u2019re written without the hiragana at the end. Examples are Mamoru \u5b88 (to protect, written \u5b88\u308b as a regular word), Shizuka \u9759 (quiet, written \u9759\u304b as a regular word), and Hikaru \u5149 (to shine, written \u5149\u308b as a regular word). This is possible because the okurigana is only one character. However, there are plenty of names that use the kanji for \u201cflow\u201d \u6d41, where it\u2019s read as ryuu, ru, or nagaru. For example, \u7e8f\u6d41\u5b50 (Ryuko Matoi), or Haruhi Suzumiya creator \u8c37\u5ddd\u6d41 (Nagaru Tanigawa). The kanji is used alone as Tanigawa\u2019s first name, but it\u2019s a special reading reserved for names. The kanji for \u201cbeautiful\u201d \u7f8e is also very common in names, especially female names. It\u2019s most commonly read as \u201cmi\u201d and can appear at the beginning, middle or end of a name. Examples are \u7f8e\u667a\u5b50 (Michiko), \u7559\u7f8e\u5b50 (Rumiko), \u6075\u7f8e (Emi). Fun fact: Michiko is the name of the retired empress, Rumiko is the name of the creator of Inuyasha, and Emi makes use of an alternate reading to the Megumi kanji I showed you at the top. You could even be creative and read \u6075\u7f8e as Megumi! The actual word \u201cblessing\u201d is written \u6075\u307f. In short, I hope this answers your question. If you have other questions, let me know. ",

            "answer_text": "The whole word \u201cNagareru\u201d or \u201cUtsukushi\u201d, I have never heard any name like that and I am pretty sure that it would sound little bit odd to Japanese people. Instead, you can partially use Kanji of the word \u6d41\u308c\u308b(Nagareru) / \u7f8e\u3057\u3044 (Utsukushi) and make it different. For example.. \u6625\u6d41(Haru / \u6625-Spring \u6d41-Current) \u7f8e\u6d41(Miryu/ \u7f8e-beauty \u6d41-Current) \u7f8e\u9234(Misuzu/ \u7f8e-beauty \u9234-bell) You can make so many combination with kanjis, I hope it helps :) ",
