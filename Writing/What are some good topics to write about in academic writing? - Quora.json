            "answer_text": "So, given that you haven\u2019t mentioned a discipline or area of interest I can\u2019t be of much help. So I\u2019m gonna give you some tips on how to find a good topic and hopefully you\u2019ll find this useful. The number 1 problem people have when trying to write an academic paper is scope. Students normally go for too wide a scope; a smaller group of students tend to go too narrow. When is your scope too wide? Often when you try to settle a big debate, answer a big question, discover a great mystery all on your own. Students are often taught the \u201cbig minds\u201d portrayal of academia, where one scientist/philosopher/etc makes the next major discoveries. The thing is, academic knowledge is often settle through a big collective effort. Someone proposes a theory, and many many papers and debates are had to determine its validity. Knowledge is a large collection of smaller contributions. When is your scope too narrow? When you\u2019re basically settling just one issue/answering one very specific question. When your scope is too narrow, there\u2019s no nuance to your argument. If your arguments can be debated, refuted, disagreed with, you actually hit a good topic. If your argument can\u2019t be debated, then you\u2019ve either an amazing argument (which is very rare) or you\u2019re just saying something that\u2019s not as insightful. The other thing that will help you is find an ongoing debate. This is actually not that difficult. I thought it would be when I started my first research paper but it\u2019s very simple when you know where to look. This is where having help from your professors, advisors, and peers is key. So there are many ways to go about this, this is how I do it: Begin to narrow down. So I studied Literature so I\u2019m gonna go with this example. What\u2019s a field in Literature? Romantic era. What\u2019s a field in the Romantic era? Romantic poetry. What\u2019s a field in Romantic poetry? First Generation Romantic Poets. What are some notable first generation romantic poets? Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge. What are Blake\u2019s major works? Jerusalem, Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Songs of Innocence and Experience. What do literary critics have to say about Jerusalem? I could go on and on. You see what I mean about narrowing it down? A beginner will usually say \u201cI\u2019ll write a research paper about the Romantic Era. Done.\u201d Well that student has a hell of a ways to go before even having a topic.Read secondary literature. Normally once you have a topic, you\u2019ll have some primary sources in mind. Going with the Blake example, I have chosen to look at his work Jerusalem. I\u2019ve read it, but I don\u2019t know what the academic consensus on the work is. This is where you begin researching secondary sources.Go down the rabbit hole. Trust me, academics are very good at disagreeing with each other. They are also really good at building upon previous knowledge. This is the whole point of academia. Find a good recent secondary source. And see what it cites. You want a recent source because the more recent it is the more recent articles it will cite. You want to be up to date on the issue. You don\u2019t want to respond to a 1960 article that has already been responded to for years. Secondary literature is usually really good at noting who says what. \u201cFrank Kermode poses the probing idea that bla bla bla which I agree with\u201d You see they mentioned Frank Kermode. Look him up! See what he has to say. That\u2019s the rabbit hole.Find what\u2019s still in contention. What things about the debate so far do you disagree with. Do you think this debate is going in the wrong direction? Is there something the critics have said that you think is relevant? Can you bring another primary source to the argument? Lets go back to Jerusalem. Lets say that the critical community has finally arrived at some form of consensus on Jerusalem. But I think that considering Songs of Innocence and Experience may shed new light on our understanding of Jerusalem. That right there, is a paper!So I know I was specific with the Literature example, but this is the process I\u2019ve used to write every research paper in the humanities, social sciences, and sciences (hoooray liberal arts education!) Trust me it works. Hone your topic, find relevant secondary sources, and find a place to make a little contribution. The great academics don\u2019t drop mind blowing articles every time. They build legacies of contributions. Some big, but most of them smaller. Don\u2019t cut yourself short but don\u2019t be over ambitious. Hope you find this helpful! ",
