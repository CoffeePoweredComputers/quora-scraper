            "answer_text": "You have just left college so you will probably not going to be applying for very advanced jobs requring those specific skills.  Ironically the issues that you raise are very similar to those in England: either you are too young, and do not have experieince, or alternatively at the other extreme you are \"over qualified\" , which reallly means \"too old\".    You face the same double jepoardy; either you are not skilled enough or have enjoyed your childhood and not been drilled in to the deck before you are 18. I can recall applying for jobs in the 1980s and being told that I did not have high enough qualifications.  I left school at 16 years old with four \"O\" Levels and two lower standing certificates. These were a reasonable educational exit level for someone entering the employment market at that age.  I went in to banking and stayed there for about four years ( I got bored)  before travelling for a year.  That gave me experience, but I would not have been able to afford it where it not the fact that my father was the Master of a cargo ship, and in effect got my travel free. Officially I was singed on as a member of the crew at the lowest level, but nothing of note.  However being dropped of at ports down the West African Coast (even in those days unstable politics) and told the schedule of his arrival and departures from those ports meant that I had to get to those points within 24 hours of the ship leaving the quay, which was a challange.    The business sector I have worked in since I came back from my escapades in West Africa is Credit Management, something I fell in to as opposed to intending to do it.  See if you can join something on the lines of the Naval Reserves or similar armed forces operation.  Also make enquiries with your labour exchange and local employment agencies to see if they have any courses or businesses taking on apprenticies.    Resumes (CVs) have only become a requirement for all applicants since the 1990s; prior to that they were only expected from those applying for middle and senior management up to Director level. Now even a sixteen year old is expected to have a resume showing their qualifications and where they went to school and their extra curricular activities.   Most jobs aimed at school leavers up to the age of 21 only required that they fill in a basic application form.  Quite why this fixation with CVs has come about is open to debate; but I would suggest partly due to the fact that companies prefer not have the cost of sending out application forms, or reading them. I would also suggest that the advent of the internet and on-line applications has lead to the increase in the use of CVs as they are easier to attach and  read more quickly than an application form to an e-mail.  Also you do not have to have an Acrobat reader on your computer. However in the UK there are still a number of companies who ask you to down-load an application form off their web-site.  Regrettably there is also a general assumption that everyone has access to the internet, which is not true.   Yes, there are internet cafes, but in my view I do not see them as secure places to send sensitive information, even if you are using your own internet address.  The temporary memory still holds a virtual image of your attachment even if it has come from a secure memory stick, and a reasonable hacker can get in to the temporary files and likely to find your details.  Further a memory stick can become corrupted with these machines where viral infection risk is high due to the number of people using the system.  The internet is a good place for research, but certainly in the UK there are a lot of duplicated jobs on various job-search sites and in turn clog up you in box.  Also many of the jobs do not really exist they are there to get you to contact the agency.  Further many of the volounteer jobs advertised are usually charities, and even if they do provide a reference it is unlikely to be on headed paper and really of no value other than an oral reference.  See if you can contact professional bodies who may be able to find you work within their organisation, this is particularly useful if you have a career path in mind.   Finally does your Government employment operations and centres have a career advisor who could evaluate your skills base and point you in the direction?  They may be able to help you.  Regrettably the ones of the UK are a pain in the neck and on the whole I have not found them useful.  Do not talk yourself in to a corner, and get out of the house and mix with other people at informal clubs which do not require a joing fee, and therefore may find work through them. Further it will stop you from becomming introverted and depressed.  Best of luck for the future and stay positive; I have been and now back in to your situation again so can sympathise with your position.  Kind regards Chris R ",

            "answer_text": " You need a job to get experience, but also you need experience to get a job. What a conundrum! The situation is not easy and you can feel a bit frustrated, but don\u2019t lose heart. There\u2019s a starting point \u2014 your resume. Which is great news, actually. Follow our guide to craft a powerful resume with no work experience that will make your recruiter sit up and take notice Open up with a personal statement. Think of it as your resume elevator pitch that sums up who you are professionally and what you can do for the given employer. The personal statement should also address some of the crucial requirements and skills listed in the job posting. Make sure to place it at the top of your resume, right after the header. Also, remember to keep it as short and simple as possible. Here\u2019s a good example: Recent graduate with Master of Science in Finance and excellent research, time management and problem-solving skills. Able to manage multiple projects and meet deadlines on time. Seeking a position where I can use my expertise to communicate with potential clients and increase project efficiency.Now choose a suitable resume format. For a job seeker with little or no experience, functional \u2014 or hybrid \u2014 resume is definitely the best option. Functional (skill-based) resume focuses on your skills, accomplishments, job traits and personal characteristics that employers expect future employees to have.Hybrid resume contains elements of both the chronological and functional styles of resumes by including your relevant skills and accomplishments first and then describing your employment and education in chronological order.Think smart and turn your disadvantage into an asset. In other words, don\u2019t get hung up on where you fall short. You need to specify what you can bring to the table. In lieu of work experience, it\u2019s best to focus on your education and skills you\u2019ve developed during college and expand these two sections on your resume. Take stock of your achievements and activities. Did you organise an on-campus event, present a paper at a conference, volunteer for a good cause or write an article for the school magazine? These are kinds of accomplishments that deserve a place in the Achievements section in your resume. Treat your internships and extracurricular activities as regular jobs. Despite being unpaid, these activities can showcase your soft skills and help recruiters gauge your professional aptitude. Each one of them should come with a few points that detail the responsibilities you had. Add some personality. Have you run a marathon? Won an unusual award? Skydived in the Alps? These unusual and surprising things deserve to be in your resume. There\u2019s no shortcut to experience. But once you decide to walk that extra mile, you\u2019re on the fastest way to become a true professional. Good luck with that! ",
