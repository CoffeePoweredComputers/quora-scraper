            "answer_text": "Welllll\u2026 Netero was around in strength or maybe a bit weaker than Pitou. Netero, despite not really having more raw strength than Pitou, basically brushed her off as soon as they met and gave Meruem a run for his money. Kid Gon in adult form basically man handled Pitou with ease. And that is a true statement. Her headless body sneak attacking him when his back was turned and guard down does not equate to him being unable to handle her with ease. She was the only one who could possibly do that, and it would be unreasonable to assume that Gon would have had trouble against anyone else who was comparable in strength to Pitou. It\u2019s my opinion that adult Gon as in the person kid Gon grew into, would be much stronger than kid Gon in a forced adult body such as what we saw in the show. In this case, I believe adult Gon \u2192 Meruem is roughly equivalent to Meruem \u2192 Netero. The Ants biggest weakness against hunters was experience and lack of knowledge of the versatility of hunter abilities. This was shown by many ant characters, most prominently with Cheetah vs Smoker guy. If Gon grew into his adult form, Meruem, being a genius, would use that time where kid Gon grows into an adult, to become an expert on his powers, and explore their fullest depths. However when the fight does come around, adult Gon is probably going to have substantially more raw power than Meruem, as indicated by the fact that forced adult Gon handled Pitou with far more ease than Netero could have if he had tried to have a real fight with her as opposed to just sending her away so that he did not have to waste energy on her. I mean when he was actually focused on her and trying- he didn\u2019t even put effort into it. So Meruem would be more intelligent with his power, Gon would just have way more power. If Meruem beat Netero, then adult Gon should be able to handle Meruem. ",

            "answer_text": "The only chance that Gon can defeat Meruem is when we only consider Meruem state when he is fighting againt Netero. I dont even consider Meruem post-miniature rose bacause he is basically a god at that point. Meruem We only see Meruem fighting using his physical strength & probably with assistance of Basic to Advance Nen ability as we never seen him use any form of hatsu during his fight with Netero. But even without using Hatsu which is the pinacle of Nen ability. Meruem has already max out at every stat. His Strength, Agility, Durability, Stamina, Aura & Inteligence is off the chart. He is also has insane level of pain tolerance & poison resistance. At the beginning of the fight with Netero, Meruem is absolutely dominated by Netero Hatsu the 100 type guanyin bodhisattva. He cant do anything againt this technique but we also saw that he basicaly tank all the damage that Netero can possibly throw at him. He even tank a direct hit of Netero greatest technique that even consume his remaining life force just for him to unleash it.  He even survive the initial explosion of Miniature Rose. Those who survive the initial explosion will suffer internal damage caused by rapid uptake of a deadly poison. The poison catalyzes the production and emission of new poison, propagating a vast chain reaction of victims. The poison is potent enough to kill two weakened Royal Guards in less than an hour, & eventually kill Meruem himself. However from this we can see that Meruem poison resistance is probably beyond any human. Gon Gon talent & potential is undisputed. Just by witnessing his forced adult self, we can already see how powerful his peak potential is. Gon adult form raw power & Nen aura is basicaly off the chart, to a point that even rival Meruem. Pitou herself acknowledge this, while she may not be as genius as Meruem is, she is also not as Naive & her acknowledgement is enough to tell us about Gon full potential.  While what we saw in HxH is only a glimps of that power because let face it Gon has never got enough time to fully develop his Nen ability & usage. However Gon is never known to be a genius. He might be smart at fighting as we see him learn fast by fighting strong apponent but his application of Nen abilty fall short behind the like of Killua & Kurapica. Frankly no matter how good Gon potential are, if his ability to tap into that potential is not as great he would still fall short in front of something like Meruem. Thankfully as an enhancer Gon doesnt need to be a genius to make full use of his potential. It is noted that enhancer doesnt need complicated Nen ability & usage to grow in power. In fact the simpler the concept of Nen use by enhancer, the stronger they are. So in the case of Gon, what he truly need is experience. We know he can be great but that greatness need to be tempered by experience. He need to fight more, understanding himself & what he capable of, sharpen his battle sense & he need to be more decisive. So if we just rely on forced adult Gon vs Meruem he may be able to land a blow or two but i sincerely doubt Gon to defeat Meruem. Meruem adaptability is just beyond anything any human are capable of. The only way to even have a chance to defeat Meruem is to be decicive & defeat him with absolute power. Never give him a chance to adapt. Overwhelm him & do damage that he cannot recover from. The best outcome would be to knock him out within 3 move or less, anything more & Gon will lose. This is just for the case of adult Gon vs Meruem. The truth is Nen fight can be really unpredictable. Beside we never see how broken Nen ability can really be. Cause even with 140+ episode of HxH. I still feel that we barely scratch the surface. ",
