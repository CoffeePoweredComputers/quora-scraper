            "answer_text": "In American English, the rule is always to put the punctuation inside the quotation marks. British punctuation (also known, tellingly, as logical punctuation) gives you a choice. If the quotation is a complete sentence or a major part of one, you should put the punctuation inside the quotation, just as in American English. If it\u2019s just a word or a short phrase, it\u2019s usually prefereable to put the punctuation outside the quotation marks. Jane said she was \u201cfed up.\u201d (US)Jane said she was \u201cfed up\u201d. (UK)If the punctuation influences the meaning or impact of the sentence, like a question mark or exclamation mark, do whatever gives you the meaning you want. There is a difference between Jane said \u201cI\u2019m fed up!\u201dJane said \u201cI\u2019m fed up\u201d!",
