            "answer_text": "While I have only been through the UCLA program I have friends who went through the USC program.  The two are vastly different but both are extremely good programs.  UCLA focuses on getting that first draft out as quick and as good as possible.  The rewrite part of it is up to you and is not focused on as much in the school.  From what my friend told me about USC is that you come out with less scripts but a polished script.  USC has incorporated rewriting into its curriculum.   All that being said the programs are also ever evolving.  UCLA used to focus a lot on features and has recently turned its head towards TV.  USC it seems has also turned towards interactive (gaming) writing as well. ",
