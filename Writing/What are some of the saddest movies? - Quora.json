            "answer_text": "Going to the movies is a great experience. Sometimes you\u2019ll laugh, sometimes you\u2019ll jump out of your seat\u2026 and sometimes you\u2019ll cry. This is a list of ten movies with the saddest endings ever made. Obviously there are spoilers here, so be careful! #1 -Philadelphia  This Oscar-winning 1993 movie stars Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, and Antonio Banderas. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it tells the tale of Andrew Beckett\u2019s (Hanks) legal battle against the company that fired him for being gay and having AIDS. Of course, a movie about AIDS in the early 90\u2019s was unlikely to have a happy ending. After Beckett finally succumbs to his condition, the movie ends with the uplifting and devastating footage of his funeral, full of family and friends celebrating his life. As the camera slowly pans into home videos of Beckett as a child playing on the beach, you would need a heart of stone not to cry. Scored by Neil Young, this scene is the most powerful and beautiful ending you can imagine to a film about a legal battle. #2 \u2013 United 93  In 2006, director Paul Greengrass released this film about a plane hijacked on 9/11. United 93 was the only flight not to reach its intended target thanks to the bravery of its passengers, who worked together to defeat the terrorists. The plane crashed in Pennsylvania, and countless lives were saved by their sacrifice. United 93 was shot in real time, and ends with the plane crashing to the ground. The fact it really happened makes this movie very painful, but very meaningful, to watch. It is dedicated to the memory of those who died that day. #3 \u2013 The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas  Based on a novel by John Boyne, this 2008 film is set in Poland during the Holocaust. Main character Bruno, the son of a concentration camp Commandant, befriends Shmuel, the titular boy in a striped uniform who lives behind a barbed wire fence. After a disagreement with his father, Bruno sneaks into the camp and finds Shmuel, who gives him a uniform to help him blend in. Along with a group of inmates, Bruno and Shmuel are ushered into the \u201cshowers\u201d by a guard. By the time Bruno\u2019s family discover he is missing, it is too late. In addition to the horror of the camps and the fact that this was the fate of millions of innocent people, some sadness comes from the fact that Bruno\u2019s simple desire to play with his friend led to his death. This is one of the bleakest endings in movie history. #4 \u2013 The Green Mile  This 1999 movie, based on a book by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont, follows a group of Death Row (the titular Green Mile) guards led by Paul Edgcomb (Hanks again, and later Dabbs Greer) and their time with John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) before his execution for murder. Coffey, as it turns out, is a miracle worker who can heal the sick and dying; he is also innocent. Tragically, Paul and his colleagues have no choice but to execute him anyway. Many years later, Paul tells a friend that Coffey once healed him and as a result he has lived to be 108 years old. Since Coffey also healed a mouse that lived over 60 years, how long is Paul doomed to watch the people he loves die? Even worse, Paul sees this as a fitting punishment for his role in the execution. He longs for death, but does not know how long his own Green Mile will be. #5 \u2013 Requiem for a Dream  Based on a book by Hubert Selby Jr., Darren Aronovsky\u2019s 2000 movie follows heroin addicts Harry and Tyrone (Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans) as they try to pull off a huge drug deal. Also in the picture are Harry\u2019s girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) who longs for fame and fortune, and his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) who wants nothing more than to lose weight and fit into her beloved red dress so she can be on a game show. The movie beautifully deconstructs how destructive hopeless dreams can be. It ends with Marion prostituting herself for heroin, Sara in a mental hospital after overdosing on weight-loss amphetamines, and Harry and Tyrone in jail for possession. Harry has also lost an arm to an infected injection site, and has given up hope of Marion ever loving him again thanks to his actions. This movie is not recommended when you\u2019re feeling sad. #6 \u2013 A.I. Artificial Intelligence  Stephen Spielberg released this take on the Pinocchio story in 2001. David (Haley Joel Osment) is an advanced robot boy capable of love. Rejected by his family when their human son returns to them, David is fated to be destroyed. Instead, his \u201cmother\u201d Monica (Frances O\u2019Connor) releases him. David then goes on a quest to become a \u201creal boy\u201d, so she will love him. After waiting patiently for two thousand years, he finally gets his wish. Advanced robots, all that is left of humanity, can manipulate time and human DNA to bring his mother back \u2013 but only for one day. After the happiest day of David\u2019s life, Monica tells him she loves him and goes to sleep, never to awaken. Finally happy, David shuts down for good. If you can watch the end of their last wonderful day together without crying, you may just be a robot yourself. #7 \u2013 One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest  Jack Nicholson\u2019s breakout role was as mental institution inmate R.P. McMurphy in Milos Forman\u2019s classic 1975 film (based on the book by Ken Kesey). McMurphy, with the help of the Chief (Will Sampson) overcame the terrifying Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and taught the oppressed patients how to stand up for themselves. Tragically, his victory doesn\u2019t last long. After the suicide of a particularly fragile inmate, McMurphy goes off the rails and, despite being perfectly sane by modern standards, is lobotomised. He is left a shell of his former self until the Chief, in an act of kindness, smothers him with a pillow (allowing him to \u201cescape\u201d) before breaking out of the institution. Is this movie uplifting, and does it ultimately convey a message about freedom? Yes. Is it cheerful? No. #8 \u2013 Million Dollar Baby  Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood shine in this tale of Maggie (Swank), a young girl from a poor family who rises to the top of the women\u2019s boxing world with the help of cantankerous coach Frankie (Eastwood). Tragically, just as Maggie reaches her peak at her first title fight, a sore loser punches her from behind. Maggie breaks her neck on a corner stool and is left paralysed from the neck down. After months of torment, poor treatment by her grasping family and the eventual loss of her leg due to poor circulation, Maggie begs Frankie to end her suffering. He does, injecting her with an adrenaline overdose before disappearing into the night. Directed by Eastwood, this film was released in 2004 to critical acclaim and received four Oscars. The ending is devastating, but it is a great story. #9 \u2013 The Notebook  This 2004 romantic drama is based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks and directed by Nick Cassavetes. It tells the story of Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachel McAdams) and their struggle to eventually be together. The tale is told by Duke (James Garner) to another resident in his nursing home (Gena Rowlands). At the end, we find out they are Noah and Allie: her devastating Alzheimer\u2019s has robbed her of her memories, but Noah reads her their story every day in the hope she will remember him. When she does, their time together is all too brief before, heartbreakingly, she forgets him again and begins to panic. Duke himself has a heart attack. An unknown time later, Duke slips into her room at the home. She is lucid, and they talk about their love. The next morning a nurse finds them in bed, holding hands, having peacefully passed away together. This is why The Notebook is known as a weepie. #10 \u2013 Seven Pounds  Gabriele Muccino directed Will Smith in this fantastic 2008 drama. Tim (Smith) tests people to see if they are good before donating organs to them. He donates bone marrow, a lung lobe, part of his liver, and a kidney to different people before giving his house to a struggling woman. Finally, he chooses the last two candidates before committing suicide by climbing into a bath of ice with a lethal box jellyfish. Why would he do this? Through flashbacks we discover that two years previously, Tim caused a car accident which killed his fianc\u00e9e and six other people. Wracked with guilt, all of Tim\u2019s actions since have been part of a mission of atonement. Smith\u2019s performance is outstanding, and Tim\u2019s suicide is heartbreaking. The final scene reveals the man who received Tim\u2019s corneas meeting the woman who received his heart. The mixture of joy and sadness in this moment will make you cry. P.S-This question has been answered numerous times and popular movies like se7en , Pursuit Of happiness and Grave of fireflies have been mentioned a ton times, therefore I have inculcated these somewhat lesser known films .

            "answer_text": "This is a movie that can destroy your happiness.  The Green Mile is a long walk full of heartbreak and sadness. It\u2019s a movie that tells a story of how innocence is punished with cruelty and ignorance. Turn back now if you cry easily or don\u2019t want to hear spoilers.  The Green Mile is the story of John Coffey (above), imprisoned in 1930s America for the rape and murder of two little girls. Now he is awaiting his execution in death row, the titular \u201cGreen Mile\u201d being the green painted hallway the condemned must walk to get to their execution. The Electric Chair.  Only he didn\u2019t do it. John is innocent. The movie reveals John, despite his huge figure, is an extremely gentle and caring soul who was just at the wrong place and the wrong time. The truth it turns out is worse. John has the ability to heal people. It\u2019s this strange power he has. He is able to sense when others are in distress and then seeks them out to \u201ctake away\u201d whatever condition they have, such as when he cures a man\u2019s wife of her terminal illness.  This is unfortunately how he was condemned. John was nearby when he sensed two little girls being murdered by the person that really did it. A disgusting lunatic named Wild Bill Wharton.  Only by the time John arrived on the scene, the girls were dead and Wharton had fled. John was caught and convicted because he was TRYING TO REVIVE the two little girls. Unfortunately, no one else saw it that way and John was imprisoned and sentenced to death. Just because he tried to do the right thing. And that\u2019s just the setup for the movie. This movie is sprinkled with various sub plots and scenes that jerk the heart strings. Eduard Delacroix\u2019s execution. Eduard Delacroix is a convicted murderer imprisoned alongside Coffey. Before John goes, Delacroix has to walk \u201cThe Green Mile\u201d to the chair that will see him off the face of the Earth. Despite being clearly afraid of death (and genuinely sorry for the crimes he committed), Delacroix faces his death with some degree of dignity. Only it turns out the execution was botched last minute by one of the prison guards. The chair is supposed to deliver a powerful of electricity straight to the brain after a wet sponge is put on the prisoner\u2019s head. Only a sadistic guard, Percy, decides to leave the sponge dry just out of curiosity. Delacroix dies slowly in absolute agony. He dies screaming and begging for mercy as he is literally baked alive. It\u2019s a tough scene to watch and though Percy gets justice later, it\u2019s far too late for Delacroix.  I'm tired of people being ugly to each other. As John\u2019s execution looms, most of the Prison Guards realize he is innocent and try to save him. Paul Edgecomb, the guard closest to John even confronts him and outright offers to allow Coffey to escape the prison. The extremely religious Paul is convinced John is a \u201cMiracle of God\u201d and is aghast at the idea that such a beautiful soul is to be executed for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. He all but begs John to escape, asking him\u2026 \u201cOn the day of my judgment, when I stand before God and He asks me why did I kill one of his true miracles, what am I gonna say? That it was my job? My job?\u201d Coffey then reveals the heartbreaking truth. He wants to die. His powers have only brought him suffering and he is tormented by the darkness he sees in the world. \u201cI'm tired of people being ugly to each other. I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world everyday. There's too much of it. It's like pieces of glass in my head all the time. Can you understand?\u201d Reluctantly, Paul agrees to allow Coffey to die, though before he must walk the Green Mile he grants Paul\u2019s last request. To watch a movie and experience some joy before he leaves the world.  Coffey\u2019s Execution There\u2019s no escape. Death comes for John Coffey like it does for everyone. It is a mercy, but a hollow one. John had enormous potential to help so many people but was suffocated by the hate and evil in the world. As he is executed before jeering citizens and weeping prison guards, Coffey faces his death without fear or remorse. Just a sad relief that his torment is done. A good man is dies for nothing.  The End. The movie ends with Paul Edgecomb, now ancient and aged decades later, relaying Coffey\u2019s story to his friend Elaine. Paul reveals that he is cursed from contact with Coffey. Coffey had cured Paul of a bladder infection while in prison and this had the side effect of dramatically increasing his life span later on. Paul has lived so long that he has essentially outlived himself. His wife, children, loved ones and friends are all dead. His life is over but he\u2019s still here. Paul isn\u2019t bitter but he now sees his existence as a punishment. In Paul\u2019s mind he deserves this fate for letting John Coffey \u201cride the lightning\u201d. It\u2019s his atonement for killing a \u201cMiracle of God\u201d. Pauls acknowledges he is not immortal. He will die one day for sure, but for now, it is his curse to carry on for who knows how long. The film ends with him pondering how long he will stay alive and how long it will take before he reaches the end of his own Green Mile.  This movie rams sandess in your face and makes you ponder on it for a long time afterwards. It\u2019s not sad in the way that makes you weep. It\u2019s sad in the way that makes you think. ",
