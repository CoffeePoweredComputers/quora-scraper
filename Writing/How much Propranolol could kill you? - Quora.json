            "answer_text": "Propranolol[1] , a beta blocker, has a fatal dose as described below[2] , of anywhere from 1.6 grams to an average of 5.85 grams. Propranolol toxicity shows individual variations which may be due to an underlying cardiac disease, to the ingestion of other cardiotoxic drugs and to variations in first-pass metabolism The toxic dose is about 1 g. In 104 cases reported in literature the mean toxic (but non lethal) dose was 1.75 g (Gross 1991) although survival has been reported after ingestion of 5 to 8 g (Lagerfeldt & Matell, 1982; Tynan et al., 1981). Khan & Miller (1985) reported survival of a 28-year-old man following ingestion of 3 g. The minimal lethal dose reported was 1.6 g in a 57-year-old man (Auzepy et al., 1983). The mean lethal dose in 17 cases reported in the literature was 5.85 g although there is wide interindividual variation (Gross, 1991). Footnotes[1] Propranolol - Wikipedia[2] Propranolol (PIM 441)",

            "answer_text": "Since I am not a nurse or a doctor, propranolol is all likelihood a narcotic derivative, is my personal guess. Like anything else, only medical professionals could give you an accurate answer. Any drug when given over the maximum requisite prescription amount can cause suffering and damage, and likewise death. Anyone out there who's familiar with propranolol you'd may want to consider asking this question to. Sorry can't give you a honest answer, can't give you medical advice, not a physician. ",
