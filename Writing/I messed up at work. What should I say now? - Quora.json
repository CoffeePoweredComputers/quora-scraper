            "answer_text": "I'm a student. I decided I don't want to continue doing my new part time job. I started in May, the first shifts were something like \"trials\" so they told me we can sign a contract later, in June. But after some shifts (5) I decided I dont want to work there anymore. It's a cat caffe. It has 2 owners, its 2 sisters and the shift was always only one employee+ one of the sisters. We were serving the drinks and they were cooking+taking payments from customers(so we dont keep tips lol). Both of them were very very unpleasant. They looked like the type of person that hates people. What an irony to have a cafe. Well they acted like they hated me. I felt very bad there even though I knew how to do my job. I have checked the reviews and even many customers said they didnt feel welcome.They hated children especially for touching the cats. When a family came to the cafe, the owners were behaving very bad from the start. It was a total discrimination. I like the cats so I wanted to keep coming. I should have a shift on Thursday and Saturday. On Monday I was thinking about telling them I don't want to come anymore. But then I changed my mind and decided I wanted to at least get the payment from May so I will go. But guys on Thursday noon I really didn't feel like it even though I knew I wouldn't get paid a cent. And that was a huge mistake. I didn't know what to say so I didn't let them know and I just didn't come. They were calling me but I wasn't picking up the phone. They were calling me since then every day at least once. (at least I still hadn't signed the contract). Well I was thinking they wouldn't care since they don't have to pay me now and replace me with someone else but I realised that they know where I live and the owners live in the same neighberhoood, they even know my parents. I am scared that they will come to my place if I won't say anything. First of all they are very strong women you don't want to have problem with and second they can think something has happened to me and it would be a huge emberassment if my parents knew I didn't even text them sice they see me as a responsible person. I think I should let them know but WHAT DO I SAY THEM AFTER 4 DAY OF IGNORING THEM ? I am kinda scared and I know I completely messed up.I hate myself for it, but now I have no other choice than to samehow deal with it. I learnt my lesson, I dont have a clean conscience now. Please help me to create some text messaage I could use. ",

Accept your mistake and let anyone know who will be negatively effected by it. You don\u2019t have to advertise your failings, that is pathological. But you must own up to that which effects others.
