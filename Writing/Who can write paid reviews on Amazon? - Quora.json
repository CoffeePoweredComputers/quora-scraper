            "answer_text": "With all the recent changes in Amazon\u2019s ToS, it\u2019s time to revisit our reviews strategy and learn how to get Amazon reviews using ManyChat. Sellers at all levels understand the significance of customer reviews and the challenges they face while experimenting with different ways in creating channels to collect the maximum number. Our goal is to target the past customers and request them for a review in a manner that doesn\u2019t violate Amazon\u2019s Terms also doesn\u2019t reveal your desperation levels. You might have already tried conventional methods like: Sending follow up emails.Sending messages to customers on Amazon.Placing a paper card insert in your product package for a review.Giving away a free product on Facebook groups in exchange for a review.The effectiveness of these approaches is decreasing by day and this can be validated by thousands of reviews vanished recently. We need to be creative and replace these by developing better mechanisms like the ones we are about to share. Let\u2019s Talk Basics ManyChat is an easy and fast way to create a Facebook messenger bot. It is an automated messaging service created within your Facebook messenger app which pops up whenever there is a visitor on a page. You might have already been greeted and warmly welcomed by one when you clicked on a page. Though this is typically used by online marketers to generate conventional auto-responses, we are going to use this for our advantage now. Please bear in mind this is not a typical Amazon-related product and we are going to establish its link with Amazon. Here\u2019s How It Works? In a nutshell, you have to use a combination of 4 platforms, Zonpages, Amazon, Facebook, and ManyChat. We are assuming that you are already familiar with Amazon Seller Central and Facebook Ad Campaigns so we will keep our focus on Zonpages and ManyChat. ",

            "answer_text": "Amazon doesn\u2019t like Review Manipulation and there is a risk on buying reviews for your products. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you cannot do it. There are some of the ways that you can try. You can search so many forums about Amazon reviews and they will offer the services. Such as it cost you $5 to hire a freelancer to write reviews for you. You can try to find so many Facebook groups which connect buyers and sellers. Sellers will post their items on the group and send message to buyers who want the item and agree on writing reviews.
