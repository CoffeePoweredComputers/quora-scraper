            "answer_text": "It might be correct, but there are other alternatives. To describe or modify the noun \u201csleep\u201d a qualifier is needed. this can be supplied with an Adverb which modifies sleep. I would communicate the idea this way, were I composing the sentence. \u201cHe slept soundly.\u201d See the Interchange: Verb = to sleep Noun = \u201ca sleep \u201c or \u201cthe sleep\u201d (when the verb form and noun form are spelled the same, the part of speech is called a Heteronym. Example: Construct (verb) and Construct (noun, as in\u2026 \u201cthe construct\u201d or \u201ca construct\u201d) We can always tell the difference between the verb and noun, by seeing if it is preceded by \u201ca,\u201d or \u201can,\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d. That shows us that a noun form is used. If there is no \u201cthe\u201d or \u201ca\u201d or \u201can,\u201d the heteronym is a verb. Adjective = sleepy Adverb = sleepily \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ If you begin to study words with their Interchange Forms, you will find that you have greater freedom to express your ideas and feelings. Look for the Verb and see if it has a Noun Form, an Adjective Form, or an Adverb Form. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s grammatically correct, yes, but the use of the indefinite article weakens the description; if you\u2019re going to use this, as a writer, you\u2019ll do better to be more focused on the nature of that sound sleep, rather than leaving it to the reader to decide which of the possible \u2018sound sleeps\u2019 they should pick, given the indefinite article, \u2018a\u2019. Aim for a more specific \u2018sound sleep\u2019 \u2014 \u2018he slept the sound sleep of a well-fed infant draped over the top of the family pet.\u2019 Don\u2019t leave it up to the reader to figure out which sound sleep the character was sleeping. Paint them the picture as you go; draw them into the scene, don\u2019t make them do all the work. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Is the sentence \"he slept a sound sleep\" grammatically correct? Yes, it is. It will be even more correct if you use a capital \u2018H\u2019 for \u2018he\u2019 and a full stop at the end: He slept a sound sleep. It is unusual to use \u2018sleep\u2019 transitively, but it is by no means unknown. \u2018He slept the sleep of the dead\u2019 is a very common expression, meaning \u2018He slept as deeply as if he were dead\u2019. Your sentence is correct, and the alliteration with the three \u2018s\u2019s is pleasing to the ear. It may be poetic, it may be simply creative writing of some kind. It is FINE. ",

It's true that \u201csleep\u201d is usually an intransitive verb, so it's not clear whether this idiom (and others like it) is an exception to that -- or merely a fossilized form of some ancient Anglo-Saxon instrumental construction. Either way, yes, this is correct and even literary English. ",
