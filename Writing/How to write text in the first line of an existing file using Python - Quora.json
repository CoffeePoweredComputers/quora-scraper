            "answer_text": "Ahh, other answers made me write this one. Also, for an approach, I would suggest using stack overflow instead of quora for technical queries. Quora is not yet ready for technical write-ups Here we go. with open(\"yourfile.txt\") as f:\u00a0    lines = f.readlines() #read\u00a0\u00a0#modify\u00a0lines[0] = \"Your new line.\\n\" #you can replace zero with any line number.\u00a0\u00a0with open(\"yourfile.txt\", \"w\") as f:\u00a0    f.writelines(lines) #write back\u00a0Tips: Always use  with  when doing file operations. You dont want other processes to mess up with your file while you working on it. A good practice. And, save some time and ask suck stuff on Stack overflow if you are actually serious about stuff.

            "answer_text": "there are two ways: You create a new file, write your new first line, and then copy the rest of the old file line by line into the new file. you then close the files, and either delete (Or rename) the old file and rename the new one so it has the old name.If you are very very luck and all of your lines in your file have exactly the same number of characters and you never need them any longer, then you can open the file do a seek(0) onto the file and then write the data. It is very very rare that all lines in a text file will be exactly the same length.",
