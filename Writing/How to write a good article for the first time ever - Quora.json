            "answer_text": "If I were undertaking the task of writing an article for the first time, I would go about accomplishing the task the following way: First, I would touch base with the editor or point of contact for the blog, magazine, or newspaper to discuss in detail the topic and general direction for the article, its length and final due date. This simple act prevents you from submitting an article on \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 when an article on \u2018The Wonders of Woman\u2019 is what was really desired. In these situations, clarity is priceless. You won\u2019t get a second chance to make a great first impression. Next, I would do my \u201cdue diligence\u201d and get a hold of past publication issues either online or in print to help familiarize myself with the audience and its writers. Believe it or not, this step right here is going to make the difference between delivering an \u201cokay\u201d piece or an outstanding article. Looking over past issues is going to key you into the tone of the publication, the standard structure of their articles, feedback from subscribers as to what they like, don\u2019t like, or would like to see more of, and so much more. It\u2019s a virtual goldmine of data. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t even attempt to write an article without doing this research first. Once I have a feel for the publication, its audience and their needs, I would began structuring my article. I\u2019d start with a simple mind map[1] to generate possible ideas.[2] When a sufficient number of ideas have been generated, I would then organize them into an outline consisting of an introduction, three main points and a conclusion. Set that aside. Here\u2019s where I deviate from other writers. Instead of typing out your first draft or writing it freehand, grab a smart phone or simple voice recorder and talk it out.[3] Utilize the following apps, if your phone doesn\u2019t have a built in voice recorder.[4] [5] What talking your article out is going to do for you is give your piece a conversational feel to it. Sure, you could generate this affect by playing with word combinations and sentences but it would consume too much time. Once you\u2019ve talked the first draft of your article out, replay and transcribe it. Now go back and tighten it up. Remove over used words, expressions, and choppy sentences. Reread it out loud to see how it sounds. Keep tweaking it until it flows from beginning to end. If you need to add statistics, quotes, references or anecdotes make sure you research and verify them before adding to your article. Once the new information is in place, continue read and revise. Finally, take your completed article and have it edited by someone other than yourself. I would suggest hiring someone on fiverr[6] or utilizing one of the automated writing-enhancement platforms.[7] [8] Best of luck with your writing. *** About Me:[9] Footnotes[1] How To Create A Mind Map[2] Rules for Mind Mapping[3] Olympus VN721PC 2GB Digital Voice Recorder[4] Audio Recorder - Android Apps on Google Play[5] Just Press Record on the App Store[6] Proofreading & Editing Services For Hire Online | Fiverr[7] Write your best with Grammarly.[8] Grammar Checking & Manuscript Editing Software[9] How the US Marine Corps Prepared me for a Career in Self-Publishing",

            "answer_text": "These are some key points I learned when I was in school and writing more often. What is your lead? This is how you get a magazine reader to read an article that would be longer than a normal newspaper story. It should not be more than 15\u201317 words.Read feature articles in similar magazines about similar topics. Think about what those writers did well. Look at the ones from that magazine and how they are written. Some magazines adhere to a certain style. The most common is AP Style. (This is a link to a pretty useful guide.) Ask the editors about this ahead of time, it will save them time if they need to edit your article to a certain style.While the inverted pyramid structure applies more to news stories, structure an article so that the most interesting things come first, things that inspire someone to read further.No long sentences or paragraphs. Make sure it is simple but not so much that it reads as though you expect the people who are reading it to be 7, unless that\u2019s the intended audience.Finally, think about your article as canned goods, as opposed to the fresh fruit that are news stories. A magazine needs articles that have staying power; articles that will stay relevant and don\u2019t seem like they have out of date information in them. Your article needs to be able to be read for at least a month after the issue goes to press which can be a few weeks after you get the article to the magazine staff.I hope these tips help you in your article.
