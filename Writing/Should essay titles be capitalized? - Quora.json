            "answer_text": "Yes, essay titles should be capitalized. The rules to capitalize the title varies by the style you select. There are 6 prominent capitalization styles: APA, AP, MLA, Chicago, NY Times, and Wikipedia. Chicago, MLA, and APA are academic styles, whereas AP, New York Times, and Wikipedia are journalistic. Most styles have similar rules. For example, capitalizing the first word, capitalizing nouns, verbs, etc. However, there are nuances between different capitalization styles. For example, only the APA style does not require capitalizing the last word of the title. Also, different styles have different rules for prepositions, hyphenated compounds, etc. Here is a simple tool that automatically capitalizes the titles based on the detailed rules for each of the major styles.
