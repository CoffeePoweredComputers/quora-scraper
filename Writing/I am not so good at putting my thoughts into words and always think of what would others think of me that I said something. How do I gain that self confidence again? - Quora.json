            "answer_text": "First, let me tell you that your state of mind indicate social anxiousness which is not an integral part of introversion at all. I can only see that you're dramatically lacking self-confidence and your worries speak in support of this opinion.You do not give any hint about your age and occupation, so I can give only generic advice like *what I would do if I faced similar problem*.1/I would start extensive practicing of sports. It helps. Seriously. But only if you practice on regular basis and at least several times in a week.  I can contemplate on this recommendation for hours, but to put it in nutshell \u2013 better physical shape tends to boost self-esteem.2/ I would analyze my environment and pick 1 or 2 people whose opinion about me matters most of all, who I would love to have as close friend and write down what features in them are most attractive to me. That would be my sketch of a role model to follow.3/ I would challenge myself to do at least one small challenging deed per day. 4/ Do things that bring you out of your comfort zone. Easiness will come along eventually. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Nice question , First of all start believing in yourself ! Thats really very important given the situation . Once you do that you will stop caring a little about your presentation to people because you will be confident by then . Now , when it comes to changing from being a introvert to extrovert I.e thoughty to talky guy ; you need to be careful at first . Try to talk to your best (close ) friend(s) first. You don't want people making fun of you at this point because it can damage your immediate scenarios quite a bit. So , to sum up start with introspection (knowing yourself deeply) , then personal talks with best friend , then close circles and thn a sensible group !  (Social media like fb , whtsapp chatting can also help in initial stages ) Hope you got your answer , let me know in comments \u263a Good luck ",
