            "answer_text": "Useless is a very strong word. And applying it to a majority of the books ever written is reckless and pointless even, unless you're courting controversy. Even if you completely ignore the entertainment factor of fiction (which has also spawned most other entertainment mediums like television shows or movies), there's still so much to learn from the world of books. Yes, even fiction. Authors pour in years of experience and research as well as precious insight into their books. They paint a picture of a life different from yours with words. Books allow you to travel to different places, even different worlds. Reading about different characters and perspectives broadens your mind and makes you a better person. Personally, I owe a big portion of who I am to fiction. To reading it, and to writing it. That has taught me more than structured education or nonfiction reading. It made me articulate, it helped me understand foreign cultures, motivated me to learn foreign languages, helped me become a global citizen who could travel anywhere and blend in. As for the word \u2018useless\u2019, it's quite useless. Even the appendix has been discovered to still have some function as a storehouse for good bacteria that contributes to body immunity. Don't use that word so lightly lest it prevents you from experiencing things that could make you more useful. ",

            "answer_text": "Is any movie other than a documentary useless? If the answer to that question is yes, from your perspective, then, to you, fiction as a genre is useless. However, owing to reading fiction; my writing style has improved, it allowed me to \u2018see\u2019 a lot of places I have not been to in real life, learn about police procedurals, cultural practices of several ethnicities (most of whom I haven\u2019t met in real life), historical aspects of several countries, etc. (depending on whatever genre of fiction you read). A story is not all about the fictitious aspects of it, there are a lot of anecdotes which are real or are inspired through a real incident and you tend to remember something better especially if it was said so in a book that you really enjoy.
