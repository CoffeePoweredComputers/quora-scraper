            "answer_text": "There are many standards and they should be followed, if for no other reason, ridicule for trying to change things because \u201cyou do things your own way\u201d as a recent person told me on Facebook when I tried to explain that a Dedication is just a couple lines and not several pages, and that an Acknowledgement is where most of their Dedication should be placed\u2014to which the reply was, they \u201chave a whole Acknowledgement at the back of the book.\u201d Now the reason I bring this is up is I was giving this person some sound and free advice and it is poo-pooed out of outright arrogance and unwillingness to learn. At any rate, you should take a dozen novels, or so, and study them as to the way they are constructed. You will basically follow the same sort of pattern in the format. Now what you should do next is research cliches and see whether what you will be wanting to write is a cliche or actually something that can be seen as new. Don\u2019t worry if it is cliche. Do something new with it. Now comes the part that you think you can just sit and do a free-flow thought on paper or a computer and given enough time you will have a story that can be considered a novel\u2014number of chapters and pages. However, you might be a genius and not have continuity issues or have your characters meander like a river in their behavior. It is much better to design your book, When you design your characters pick the perfect names whose meaning is something that reflect the character the best. Too many people pick a name because they like it or it is popular and the reader is left not feeling the character because it was not thought out in its fullest detail. This includes gender and ethnicity because the dynamics of the story will run in a certain direction depending on the time and setting you choose. Keep track of everything even if you don\u2019t use it in the story. Your goal is to be god and creating a whole world but unlike god, you don\u2019t want to make obvious errors along the pathway of your story. Learn the meanings of colors and significances of sound. Learn some psychology so that your characters are real and can only behave according to the people that they are\u2014and if they deviate from that, you have a crux to explore why they changed. You will design every aspect of the story right down to what will be contained within each chapter as well as how many chapters. Before you set one word of your story to paper, you will already have the full vision of your book, and all the notes you will use to guide your telling smoothly and with as little continuity problems as possible. If you work on a computer do not worry about spelling, grammar or format until you get the novel finished. When done, you will discover what font and font size would be the best used. You may have a title already, but you may discover an even better one during the writing. Too many people fix thing on-the-go, and format, as they write then they suddenly find they are bored at what they are doing and may not finish their work for several years. If you plan to self publish all this design will help you in knowing how the entire work will be as a finished product. If you plan to approach a publisher then contact them prior to writing and discover that they expect. If you cannot take advice, criticism, or editorial changes (which could amount to a total re-write of every single thing in your story) then no publisher or professional editor will want to work with you. If you go and do things 100% your own way, and refuse to change things, the reader will notice it. No reader wants to feel that they have wasted their time and money on anything, and since readers are fewer than even a dozen years ago, we need every single person still interested in books not to turn their backs on us. For now this is all I can tell you. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, there is no standards to write a novel, except a few guidelines to be followed. Plot : Plot is essential for writing your novel. Every novel out there is drawn upon a specific idea or plot which drives the entire story. So get ready to write if you are sure of the idea/plot you are going to write.Characters: Your novel should contain characters which should be believable and should be correlated to the readers when they are reading. It should satisfy your readers, so please do some justification to your characters.Style: The style depends upon your writing, but take in account of grammar, punctuation and sentence formation. These are essential of giving a produced model of output to the publishers. They like to see a script well formatted and edited. So be sure of these things before you submit.Drafts: Your first draft is nasty. Second is slightly better, third one makes you little good. But be sure of having at least five drafts before submitting. Re-write as much you can and take time to keep aside of your script for sometime. After your write-up take time to keep the script aside for sometime and re-open it again to edit it. Fresh ideas will flow.Proofread: Give your finished novel to few people and take comments from them. Ask them to proofread your novel and incorporate the things which needed to be done in your novel.At last, once this process is over, you are ready to send your manuscript for submission to the publishers/agents. Happy writing ! ",
