            "answer_text": "I can't really be subjective for you over here since I don't really know exactly know where you are facing problems. I have neither seen the problems you face nor have you described them in your question description. But, these things are quite with a number of young people. I can tell you a few ways to try and perfect your free hand drawing. Straight Lines: Place your pencil from where you want to start your construct. Determine a point where you want to end your construct( the straight line) in your head. Look at that second point. Draw the line with one stroke . Don't look anywhere else . Just look at that second end point while drawing. Practice this way and you will be able to draw straight lines. Circles: Ok, I know of two ways for this. 1. This will probably take more time in practice. Take a paper and pencil. Hold on he pencil with your hand and place it's tip on paper. Don't touch the paper with the hand holding the pencil. With the other hand holding the paper firmly. Draw the circle in one stroke. It won't looking like a proper circle at first but with enough practice, it will. 2. This one is probably easier. With one hand, hold the paper firmly. Pivot the other hand on the paper. Pencil and your wrist touches the paper.{ A third class lever} Now draw the circle like you would do with a compass. Keep the paper rotating against the pencil, if that helps you. I provide you with some videos and urge you to watch more. YouTube is a very good place. Hope this helped .   ",

It\u2019s debatable whether it is possible to draw a perfect line or circle at all, and Plato would have you believe that the essence of a perfect shape exists only on a different plane (get it?) of existence. But basically it\u2019s just a really hard thing to do. ",
