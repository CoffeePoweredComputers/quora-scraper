            "answer_text": "There is two different stories that come to mind with this question. The first, which is a Pok\u00e9mon fanfiction, is Saphroneth\u2019s \u2018Ashes of the Past\u2019. Basically a story where, whilst Ash was in Unova, Cyrus and Team Galactic (in Sinnoh) end the world, so Arceus sends Ash back in time with his memories to redo everything, and for his pokemon and friends, he can restore their memories. It has over 200 chapters, with lots of characters, and has literally just reached the Sinnoh point in his journey. I like it because it is not only long (which is a must for me), well written and quite fun to read, but it also clears up all the plot holes and issues with Pok\u00e9mon, such as some pokedex descriptions, some things said in the video game and anime, and stuff like Ash\u2019s age. I do seriously recommend it. (note, as far as I\u2019m aware, it is only on Fanfiction.net) Ashes of the Past Chapter 1: Prologue: Laid out in Black and White, a pok\u00e9mon fanfic The second one isn\u2019t just one fic, but a whole series. Lumendea\u2019s Guardians of the Universe series, which is Doctor Who/Torchwood/Sarah Jane Adventures fic which actually mixes it all into one story. Guardians of the Universe Basically, the White Guardian and the Black Guardian (from classic Doctor Who) slightly change Rose Tyler\u2019s past so the Sarah Jane Adventure\u2019s episode \u2018Curse of the Pied Piper\u2019 happens when she is really young (somewhere between 8\u201311). Rose, with help from the Ninth Doctor, defeat him, and this creates a ripple effect which changes the timeline. Rose goes down a different path, goes to University, and becomes a hero in her own right. She has a romance with 9, 10, 11, 12 etc, which in classical Doctor Who style is a bit out of synch, but a lot of fun to read. In the first few \u2018books\u2019, it\u2019s mostly Sarah Jane Adventure\u2019s episodes that are rewritten, with Sarah Jane herself eventually joining in (as well as a whole host of old Doctor Who companions). Eventually, you get Doctor Who episode rewrites, alongside one or two Torchwood rewrites. So far, the DW episodes featured, and rewritten, are: RoseThe End of the WorldThe Unquiet DeadAliens of London/World War ThreeDalekBoomtownThe Christmas InvasionSchool Reunion (which features Donna Noble)Turn Left (sort of, the author explained this was mixed in with the plot of the episode \u2018Whatever happened to Sarah Jane Smith?\u2019)The Beast BelowA Good Man Goes to WarNow, many of these episodes are vastly different. Some of them are different plots, one has Donna Noble, another is very different, some don\u2019t even have The Doctor present (instead, Rose is being her own hero), and some are done by a different incarnation of the Doctor and Rose. Not only that, but there are many episodes the author has written themselves which are not rewrites at all, and are part of her expanded universe. If you want an action and romance filled adventure with lots of fun and excitement, then this is for you. the stories, in order: The Blonde GirlDefender of EarthThe Companion ConnectionTime and the TricksterThe Tyler FactorUnder the Mistletoe MoonChild of EarthTravels in Time and SpaceThere are two others, one of which is just random moments and missing scenes from the series: The Bits in Betweenand the other is looking into the future, more to do with the 12, and the recently announced 13th Doctor. Glimpses of TimeI do seriously recommend you check these all out :) ",

            "answer_text": "Well, there are lots of different fanfictions in different fandoms I've read. So this will be quite a long answer. BleachProtector of the Fairies, written by Takei Daloui. This is one of the best fanfictions I've ever read. It's a crossover of Bleach and Fairy Tail. There are 235 chapters currently and the updates come almost every week. The story is gripping and has all the good parts of Fairy Tail mixed with Bleach. The character development is good and proper. Each and every character has loads of development to their powers, abilities, personality and backstory. The pacing of the story is extremely good. And there is quite a bit of tragedy as well. Each and every chapter covers a good part of the story and doesn't waste time with useless sidestories.The story is set in Fairy Tail world and the timeline for Bleach events is a bit different. Bleach characters are incorporated nicely into the story.Give this story a try, you won't regret it.It's a personal recommendation, first on my list.A Protector's Pride, written by NeoRyu777.This fanfiction is a pure Bleach fanfiction. It is set after the Soul Society arc, with Ichigo starting to become more mature and actually training to fight against Aizen. He trains not just in controlling his Hollow but also trains in the arts of the Shinigami. It is an interesting read, consisting of 84 chapters.The character development is good.

It's set before the Turn Back the Pendulum Arc of Bleach. At the same time, Ragnarok Connection was completed by Charles and Marianne.It's a good read and contains various characters, including spinoffs like Akito the Exiled and the games as well, as well as Nightmare of Nunnally.It's one of my personal recommendations, second on my list.Black Joker, written by dragonliege242.It's a crossover of Bleach and Highschool DxD.Takes place after Ichigo loses his powers after the Final Getsuga Tensho.Ichigo awakens True Longinus, and becomes a member of the Church.It's quite an interesting read and has a good plot.It has 10 chapters, pretty easy to finish.Naberius Heir, written by Liam G.Another crossover of Bleach and Highschool DxD.
