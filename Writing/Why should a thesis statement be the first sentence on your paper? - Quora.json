            "answer_text": "The thing is, it doesn\u2019t have to. Sure, you may be taught that it MUST be the first sentence of your paper during middle school - and even high school - Language Arts/Writing classes, but it doesn\u2019t have to. There are many different options for you to choose from when writing a paper. In fact, it is much more practical to open your paper with a hook (Something which \u201chooks\u201d the reader\u2019s attention - drawing them in) and close the first paragraph with a thesis. In fact, you don\u2019t even have to write to incorporate the staple of a three pronged thesis. It is much more creative and scholarly to have an open thesis, which is basically a thesis you do not directly state in the standard fashion. It could span over a few sentences or even the entire first paragraph. There are countless ways you could construct the first sentence, and the first paragraph, of your essay. But - to answer the original question - in schools that DEMAND that the thesis be placed first in the paper, it is most likely for one of two reasons (Although this is not to say that there are plenty of other literary decisions made by the brilliant teachers - said with not a hint of sarcasm - in the world which lead to this decision). 1) It is a way that standardized writing tests expect students to write. They look for it, and want the student to grasp the simple idea of the thesis - something which teachers can best express through a strict regimen such as putting it first in the essay. 2) Some teachers solely believe in writing papers that way as a means to a) make grading papers easier and b) create conformity and avoid confusion to make for more equal grading.

            "answer_text": "Technically, a thesis can be put anywhere, as long as it\u2019s in the introduction paragraph. However, putting a thesis statement first is like going down a water slide with no water flowing beneath you. To answer your question, having your thesis statement as the opening line might be helpful: It puts your stance out immediately.It doesn\u2019t keep the reader curious.A flaw in that also would be that the rest of your paper may be more predictable, and the reader may feel less of an incentive to get through your introduction paragraph (or the rest of your essay)You would need to be a very skilled writer, and even then it still may be hard to keep up the energyThe reader may have a clearer idea of where you\u2019re goingAlthough a thesis is best served as dessert rather than the appetizerOverall, I wouldn\u2019t suggest having your thesis as the first sentence of your essay.
