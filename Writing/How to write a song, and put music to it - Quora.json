            "answer_text": "Well don't really get how your approach to asking this question goes but one thing that works for me is getting a theme first. What message/vibe do you want the lyrics to be about. Once that is down then we try out natural melodies that come to our heads. It's advisable not to force it, you can take a walk, chill in a bathtub, smoke some herbs (what ever gets you going) and just feel your natural energy take control. Once a melody is in place then you can start your lyric scrabble and put words together. Using this method I also find it easy to cook up an instrumental to the lyrics and most times I get a hit. :) ",
