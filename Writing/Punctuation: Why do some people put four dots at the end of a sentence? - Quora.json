            "answer_text": "The first three dots are a single punctuation mark called an ellipsis (\u2026). The fourth is a full stop (aka period). An ellipsis in the middle of a sentence can be used to indicate that something has been left out. Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth \u2026 a new nation \u2026 dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. In speech, it can indicate a pause: But why would Imperial troops slaughter Jawas? If they traced the droids here, they may have learned who they sold them to and that would lead them back... home! But at the end of a sentence, an ellipsis usually indicates that a speaker trailed off or that the writer expects the reader to reach the obvious conclusion. Some people think that the ellipsis on its own is a suitable mark for ending a sentence. And the rest is history\u2026 Others add a full stop as well to indicate that the sentence has ended. And the rest is history\u2026. ",

When you use an ellipsis at the end of a sentence, or if you omit more a whole sentence or more, a fourth period follows as end punctuation. Ex: \"Well,\" said Martha, \"If you really want to know....\" Many people overuse ellipses rather than punctuate properly. http://www.kentlaw.edu/academics/lrw/grinker/LwtaEllipses.htm http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/ellipsis.htm ",
