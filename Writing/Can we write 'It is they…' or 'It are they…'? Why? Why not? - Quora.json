            "answer_text": "In nearly every language, the verb to be is irregular. A typical sentence has the word order subject-verb-object. The object is normally in the accusative, which is because the object is having something done to it. So if I say The boy spoke to the teacher. then teacher is the object. It\u2019s difficult because the accusative in English is rare. Pronouns do take the accusative, so it would be correct to write The boy spoke to him (not The boy spoke to he). This is all true except for the verb to be, which doesn\u2019t take the accusative. So it\u2019s correct to say: It is I (not It is me) I am she (not I am her) This is she (not This is her) It is they (not It is them) It was we (not It was us) But! It\u2019s fine to say It is you (in both singular and plural you). You will have recognised that everyday colloquial speech basically ignores this rule. On answering the phone, who says Hey, it\u2019s I? But in formal English that is the correct usage. It would always be wrong to say It are they, though it would technically be correct to say They are they, and even We are they. This sounds very clumsy, and I struggle to think of examples where this could occur. Who were the bravest soldiers in that battle? We were they! ",

My mother could tell where any sentence was wrong, so too my best English teachers through out my life. What they all taught me was to understand why we care about these things, not just some rule. I took Latin, and no one really cares about how that is spoken, right? It was purely about learning a language. Does that mean that \u201co s t mus tis nt\u201d should be all you care about? No, Latin is the base of so many languages and structures that learning it the BEST foundation for language. I will not answer the question. The reason is, learn it yourself. ",
