You have to know how a person manipulates, how one could observe, focus on the character\u2019s personality and how the character reacts to different situations. Give emphasis on his emotion, his thinking, his thoughts. Pushing your characters into difficult situations wherein there is no win could also make a great suspense. Focus on details. great psychological thrillers focus mostly on the details of every character. What are their fears, likes, beliefs. Use that to your advantage, you could use it against your character, or use it as your character\u2019s strength. Know how a psychologist thinks. They always pay attention to a person\u2019s tone, their expression. Now, you can also add and sprinkle in some characters with mental issues and or trauma, and fit them into the picture. It should set in the whole mood. Now, you also need to have a good plot line and a great antagonist. Formulate your ideas. Create three dimensional characters. Don\u2019t look at your characters as characters, instead, see them as real people. As if you\u2019re writing down the events that happened in their life. Good day. :) ",
