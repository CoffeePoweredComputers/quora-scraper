            "answer_text": "My biggest goal is to have a copy of my book laid out in front of me. I don't want a finished copy with glossy cover art and critical acclimations. Or even a first edition binding ready to send out to beta readers. All I want is my story fully complete. From start to finish. No gaps in the plot line, no holes for the reader to slip through. Printed from my own printer, bound together with either some old yarn or if I'm lucky, some new bright white kite string. I want to see that ream of paper hopefully as fat as a new notebook at least, but I'm aiming for closer to four or five, maybe even six. I just want it all together\u2026finally finished. With nothing more to dress it than a plain black and white title page, my pen name nestled beneath it. It seems simple and even a bit silly but it will mean that after all these years- these stories bouncing around my head with no one to hear them but me, will finally get a chance to be heard. ",

            "answer_text": "I had always considered writing as just another hobby when I was younger. I used to put down whatever thoughts came to me or whatever inspired me but that happened may be once a month or may be once in three months. However recently I have taken up writing regularly and my current goal is to make writing a discipline rather than just another hobby. I have set shorter goals like writing everyday may be on Quora or may be writing a diary entry or answering student queries about IELTS exam, because I have realized it is fun that way and keeps me coming back to this activity everyday. Today I am writing because I love it, neither because I want to get some recognition out of it nor because it is a hobby I pursue when I have free time. I feel that these smaller goals have helped stay motivated to write and also fall in love with writing. This process is definitely working me and I am going to pursue writing goals, one day at a time. ",
