            "answer_text": "Native speakers learn \u201cgrammar\u201d in two ways. The first way is a natural way. The second way is by the same kind of book study in school that foreign students have to learn English grammar. The study of grammar is not the best way to learn English. However, if you know some English and some grammar, it helps in the study of vocabulary. Before the native speaker ever learns grammar, songs and poems and nursery rhymes have been learned. These develop memory in the mind about the way sentences are made. That is why speaking is a \u201cnatural\u201d process. Here is The Shadow Method. It is referred to as a \u201cshadow\u201d because the person practicing with the students says a word or phrase out loud, and the students repeat the word or phrase. By practicing the same lesson every day, and repeating the words or a few words at a time, the students learn how to read and recognize the words. Of course, the children must be given a paper with all of the lesson on it. Like this one: \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \u201cHickory dickory dock. The mouse ran up the clock. The clock struck one. The mouse ran down. Hickory dickory dock.\u201d  The native speaker knows how words \u201csound\u201d even before learning what the words actually mean. Hickory is a kind of tree, but dickory, and dock, are not actual words that mean something. They are nonsense sounds. They are silly sounds. They are there because the sounds are \u201cfun\u201d to say. Before the native speaker knows anything about grammar at all, they memorize the pattern of: \u201cThe clock struck one.\u201d Which is the pattern of (Definite Article + Noun + Verb + Number) (Number or some other qualifier such as big, small, good, bad, and so forth and so on.) The pattern is memorized. Watch the pattern. 1 The clock struck one. 2 The mouse ran down. 3 The way is long. 4 The way is short. 5 The words are short. 6 The words are long. 7 The words are big. 8 The words are small. 9 The nouns are hard. 10 The nouns are easy. 11 The verbs are hard. 12 The verbs are easy. 13 The room is big. 14 The room is small. 15 The teacher is mad. 16 The teacher is nice. 17 The food is good. 18 The food is bad. 19 The book is here. 20 The pencil is there. The native speaker knows this, without ever studying any grammar at all. In a similar way, the native speaker learns to form questions and answer them, without studying grammar. Example: 21 Where is my shoe? 22 Where is my coat? 23 Where is my hat? 24 Where are we going? 25 Are we going there? 26 How are we going there? 27 Why are we going there? 28 What is there? 29 Why are we leaving here? 30 Do we have to go there? 31 Why do we have to go there? 32 What is there? 33 I do not want to go there. 34 Why do I have to do that? 35 Why are you doing that? 36 How are you doing that? 37 How do they do that? 38 I do not want to do that. 39 No! I am not going to do that! 40 Yes! I am going to do that. 41 You cannot do that. 42 Yes you can do that. 43 You have to do that. 44 You have to do it. 45 You should never do that. 46 Do you want some of mine? 47 Give me yours. 48 Show me yours. 49 I want some water. 50 I want something to eat. 51 I want something to drink. 52 Do it this way. 53 Do it that way. 53 What is the right way? 55 What is the wrong way? 56 Which is the right way? 57 Which is the wrong way? 58 Who is that? 59 Who is he? 60 Who is she? 61 Who are they? 62 Why are we going? 63 Can we stay? 64 I want to stay. 65 Make some for me. 66 Why can I not have some?. 67 I want it now. 68 I don\u2019t want it later. 69 I want it now. 70 You have to give it to me now. 71 You have to do it this way. 72 You have to do it that way. 73 Which is the right way? 74 Which is the wrong way? 75 You cannot have mine. 76 You can have mine. 77 Why don\u2019t you take his? 78 You can have hers. 79 Where does this go? 80 Where does that go? 81 Put it here. 82 Put it there. 83 Lift it up. 84 Put it down. 85 Leave me alone! 86 Come with me. 87 Come play with me. 88 Let\u2019s go over there. 89 Let\u2019s stay here. 90 Make some for me. 91 I can make some for you. 92 Say it for me. 93 Talk to me. 94 Let\u2019s play together. 95 You play over there and I will play over here. 96 Let\u2019s play army. 97 Let\u2019s play war. 98 Let\u2019s play doctor. 99 Let\u2019s play nurse. 100 Pretend you are hurt. 101 Pretend you are a doctor. 102 Pretend you are better now. 103 Pretend you are sick. 104 Pretend you are all better again. 105 Show me how you did it. 106 Show me how you did that. 107 Show me! 108 Show me where it is. 109 Show me what it is. 110 Show me how to do it. 111 Tell me why you did that. 112 You have to show me. 113 I will you show you . 114 Can you show me? 115 Will you show me? 116 Would you show me? 117 I cannot show you because I do not know. 118 I will show you because you are my friend. 119 I know I said I did not like you but that was before. 120 Now I like you. 121 Now we can be friends. 122 I can tell you how to do it. 123 I can show everyone how to do it. 124 Let us be friends, okay? 125 It is not easy to do. 126 Some things can be hard to do. 127 There are different ways of doing things. 128 There are good things and there are bad things. 129 Do you like doing this? 130 I like doing this. 131 All of us like doing this. 132 Think about this. 133 Think about that. 134 Find this. 134 Find that. 135 Find the answer. 136 Find the problem. 137 Find the solution. 138 Find the Verbs. 139 Find the Nouns. 140 Discover the secret. 141 Discover the sentences that will help. 142 Discover the sentences that will teach. 143 Discover the sentences that we can speak. 144 Discover the sentences that develop our ability. 145 I have the ability to speak. 146 You have the ability to speak. 147 We have the ability to write. 148 I can write words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, and books. 149 Look at the words. 150 Look at the parts of speech. 152 Look at the Verbs. 153 The Verbs are important to know. 154 I want to know the important things. 155 You want to know the important things. 156 We need to know the important things. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 By the time the native speaker gets in school, they have learned a basic vocabulary, without ever hearing or seeing anything at all about grammar. It is also why repetition is emphasized for students of English. The native speaker usually does not have to \u201cthink\u201d about what they say. They say what they want to say because of the memory of the way sentences are formed. When certain kinds of songs are learned, such as the slow ballads and so forth, the memory of the rising and falling tones is used in an automatic way, without \u201cthought\u201d. By the time a native speaker studies grammar in school, they have confidence in speaking, even though they have only a limited knowledge about the Parts of Speech or the knowledge about phrases, clauses, and tenses in grammar. Those only become necessary as knowledge, when the native speaker needs to write things for school, or college. Not every person will require an advanced vocabulary. Only a few people are going to find it necessary to use English in a matter consistent with the composition of nonfiction communication. Speaking the language for everyday use, is a very easy thing to do. Writing the language to communicate ideas is a skill that some can show in their high school studies. Writing is done on a more advanced level in college. This however, requires skill in the form of developing what is called an academic vocabulary. [See: Academic Word List] The foreign student can struggle with both spoken and written English. Why is that so often the case? Sometimes, I think it is for the very reason that they are taught English as a study in grammar. Study by repetition and memory is different. When a person studies grammar, they are required to \u201cthink\u201d. It is also true that they are required to think about an \u201cabstract concept\u201d.  And so there is a difficulty when a foreign student seeks to improve their speaking and writing ability by getting help or advice from a native speakers. If the only way to learn the language, is thought of as the study of grammar, the foreign student will think; \u201cI need help with grammar.\u201d They will ask frequently. \u201cHow can I learn grammar?\u201d \u201cWhat is the best way to learn grammar?\u201d \u201cCan a native speaker give me tips on learning grammar?\u201d  When someone tries to help the foreign student by suggesting that they learn the English language by different methods, there can be a wall of misunderstanding, and this wall is that the foreign student rejects all such help, because \u2026they have learned that one learns English by the study of grammar. The result is that the foreign student speaks with difficulty, and writes with an even greater difficulty. So the student goes to websites on the Internet, and they ask for help. Obviously, the grammar lessons are only helpful to a certain point. The student asks for help, thinking that the difficulty is solved easily. They think like this: \u201cThe native speakers will understand my difficulty. They will advise me and help me to know what I should do.\u201d What happens then, is that the native speakers either repeat what they have learned. They tell the student to \u201clearn grammar\u201d. Sometimes they tell the student to; \u201cRead Everything!\u201d Almost as bad is the advice to \u201cRead Novels.\u201d All of which shows that in the advice given, the foreign student is shown that the native speaker, actually does not know how to teach the study of the language. If I tell a student, \u201cRead everything,\u201d; I am basically saying; \u201cGo find everything out for yourself, and do it the hard way, because I do not know how to teach you.\u201d  Review: What I have written is that: (a) Native speakers do not learn their language by the study of grammar. (b) Native speakers do learn their language by repetition. (c) Native speakers learn to write their language at an advanced or academic level by using synonyms for the Most Common Words and these synonyms can be found in the Academic Word lists as either the Noun form of a Verb, or the Verb Form of a Noun. (d) Foreign students of English think that if they study grammar more and more and more and more and more, they will finally speak well and write well. It is not true. Students can be victimized again and again. Worse, they can be charged money for doing it. See Phonogram Page | Daily Phonics Practice WORD FORMATION ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest, we don\u2019t learn grammar, at least not the way ESL students do. We can easily graduate high school and go to university, earn any number of degrees, and never once hear the term \u201cphrasal verb,\u201d \u201cconditional,\u201d or discuss any names of verb tenses or expressions beyond irregular past tenses and past participles. Focus is on punctuation, capitalization, some basic parts of speech, and spelling, spelling, spelling. It\u2019s even its very own subject in elementary school. In high school we\u2019re taught to \u201ctighten\u201d writing which is to minimize words. English can become very \u201ccluttered.\u201d Even though, we don\u2019t learn about phrasal verbs, we\u2019re taught not to use \u201ccommon\u201d verbs or end sentences with prepositions unless we absolutely must. Latin and French based terms are considered more refined or academic. Germanic words we do not even bother discussing. Fire, happiness, bad\u2014boring. Flame, joy, horrible\u2014-much prettier. Inferno, felicity, malevolent\u2014intense. We try to avoid run-on sentences, learn to clarify with parallel structure, and place words as close to their modifiers as possible. All of this is if we\u2019re lucky. As an affectation, many native speakers will try to sound like they possess good grammar skills by using adverb forms when adjectives are better, and \u201cI\u201d instead of \u201cme,\u201d even in the predicate. Even people with Master\u2019s degrees would probably think this sentence is fine: \u201cThe gardener keeps the roses beautifully for my husband and I to enjoy.\u201d But under even the smallest amount of scrutiny it needs two crucial corrections: \u201cThe gardener keeps the roses beautiful for my husband and me to enjoy.\u201d People don\u2019t learn about the nature of linking verbs, and how they connect the subject to descriptors in the predicate. Even how subject and object pronouns work is a lost cause. People think that descriptors in the predicate can never go with the subject, and that saying \u201cme\u201d is always incorrect, even rude, in conjunction with another noun or pronoun. Would anyone really describe any of the methods of \u201ckeeping\u201d a garden as \"beautiful?\u201d Is shoveling dirt, spreading fertilizer, squatting down, or sweating in a hothouse able to be done \u201cbeautifully?\u201d Clearly, the writer wants to comment on the garden being beautiful. \u201cKeep\u201d allows this by linking the subject to the predicate. Would anyone ever say \u201cThe gardener keeps the roses beautifully for I to enjoy?\u201d No person in the world would ever say this sentence. Yet, somehow adding \"my husband\u201d makes this sound correct. I have read sentences through internal correspondence in top media companies, proofread it out of press releases, and heard it straight from the mouths of university professors. ",
