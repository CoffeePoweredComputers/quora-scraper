            "answer_text": "It wasn't a knock on the door but an unexpected phone call. My 16-year-old son had a 14-year-old girlfriend\u2026and it was a bit of a troubled relationship. Her parents were drug addicts and lived with whomever would take them. Due to their life style, the relationship really bothered me because I could not keep the two of them separated. Knowing that, at that age, stopping it would only lead to trouble, I tried to monitor the situation as best as I could and would not let him go anywhere with her. However, for some reason, as I later found out, the other mother was arranging for them to be together to have sex. (remember, she was a crack addict). Although we didn\u2019t really understand it at the time, but the mother wanted her daughter pregnant, which eventually did happen. My life changed forever after that. In an effort to help, knowing the baby was my gr-child, I offered to let the girl live with us, because we wanted her off the streets. We did this partly because the mother had previously and unexpectedly dropped her 14-year-old daughter at our house and drove to another state\u2026left her behind. So, we decided to take her in\u2026figuring the mother would be okay. AS you can guess, the mother was more than happy about it\u2026but we only did that if we could have legal guardianship. She agreed. Within a month or so, the drugs started coming under my roof\u2026 by my son and his girlfriend. I found out later that the other mother (mother of the 14-year-old) had introduced them both to crack and even supplied it to them. I was in a dilemma, and eventually sent the girlfriend back to her mother. My son went off the deep end, kept running away, mother kept helping him\u2026and on and on. It was a nightmare and only stopped with intervention by the police and the DA\u2019s office (long crazy story\u2026too long to even discuss here). Finally on June 29th, 1995, the baby was born, also living on the streets. I knew I had to somehow get that baby but also knew I had to be careful. Here was when the unexpected phone call came in. We received a call from the Oregon State Police (we lived in Cali) and asked if my son was home. I said no, he was with his friends. The officer asked if I knew the 14-year-old (by this time she was 15) and stated her name. I told him yes, but asked why all the questions. He said he was calling me because she had been killed that morning and our address was listed as her residence (remember, she had lived with us for a few months\u2026probably the only solid address she had.) I was in shock\u2026and had to break the news to my son. The baby was in ICU in the hospital, but survived. The mother\u2026or her boyfriend who had a suspended license\u2026had been driving (we never did know the truth) and supposedly did something that caused a semi-truck to run over them. The car went down an embankment and flipped 4\u20135 times, instantly killing my son's girlfriend. To avoid a lengthy story, I will summarize the ending. I had to go to a court trial regarding the death of their daughter\u2026and acted as a witness to their behavior and actions. Then after 2\u20133 years of civil court, attorneys, etc., we got full custody of the baby, a little girl. She is now 24 and has a child of her own. The other grandmother (addict mom of the girlfriend) was allowed supervised visitation ONLY if she provided us a clean UA and evidence that she went to a drug rehab. Needless to say, the visitation never happened\u2026so that tells you how successful she and her boyfriend were. \u2026\u2026\u2026..Hello all\u2026..well first, I received an edit request from a Mr. Taylor. He red lined my story as if I were doing a school assignment. To that person, please understand that this is not an English lesson. I wrote it quickly while I was on my way out and my intent was to tell the story, not to get red marks on the use of words. Therefore, I will not waste my time. If it was not acceptable, give an F and go on your way. This story was hard enough to deal with, without someone red lining everything. Secondly, to all the others regarding my son. As I write this, he is now 41 years old. No, in answer to your question, he is not doing well. He is now an alcoholic and his life is not good. I have been dealing with this for over 20 years, while raising his daughter and trying to get him on a good path. It has not worked. Today, I spoke with him and he is once again homeless and drinking. I cannot help but believe that this other mother (of his 15 year old g-friend) helped to create this years ago\u2026.and he has never recovered from it. The death of his girlfriend was bad enough but he had become an addict by that time. There are many parts to this story\u2026.but one of them was that the other mother took him out of state twice and hid him\u2026..all while giving him drugs. Twice, we had to pull him out of the place he was at\u2026..and try to rehabilitate him. That is the reason we ended up with custody. He was too young and there was no way he was able to care for her. Thank you for the well wishes. HIs daughter? Fortunately, we were able to get her out before her life was destroyed\u2026..and we put away a large annuity on her behalf. Here is another edit\u2026.(when i refer to mother or grandmother, I am referring to the mother of the 15 year old) I had posted this below but put it in the wrong area. Some are asking how my son is doing. This is long I had to make it long in order to make sense out of it\u2026.. This ended up in probate, as a result of the baby\u2026.who was the only heir of the 15 year old. During the court hearings, there was one time we had to appeal a decision regarding the estate of my sons g-friend (which had nothing\u2026other than a pending lawsuit in her name and on behalf of the baby) . The appeal is on the internet, here is the link. In that appeal, the other gr-mother did a number of things to hide her drug use, any past use and any current involvement. She had a boyfriend that was just as bad. Fortunately, since it was a deep pocket accident with a major trucking company, she had attorneys beating her door down to take the case. Her attorney set her up with an apartment, got her off the streets and tried to make her look squeaky clean. That only lasts for a short time\u2026.but ended up costing us a lot more of our savings. As I learned, insurance companies will low-ball addicts, knowing they will take anything. Courts will do everything to keep family together\u2026.and we had to prove her previous existence. There was a relative (of the addict morther) who had been contacting me secretly, letting me know some details of what went on that night. That person wanted us to get the baby, feeling as though she would not otherwise survive. I learned a lot about that night\u2026.and part of it was that there was a discussion about intentionally causing an accident. We will never know the true story about what went on inside the car\u2026.but enough to know that there were drugs involved, it wasn't their car, and the baby was found without clothing on at the scene of the accident. The drug kit found in the other mothers purse\u2026..had apparently rolled in the purse during the accident. She had no idea how it got there. (eye roll) The police were so intent on investigating the truck driver, that much of the fault of the other g-mother was missed. She got away with things that she should have been prosecuted for. My story was only the tip of the iceberg in what all transpired. All I can say is that the other grandmother was a manipulating drug addict who changed our lives in a way that was hard to recover from. They stalked us, took my son twice, drugged him, and used him as a runner. They were horrible people and a nightmare that will always be there. To this day, my sons life is not what it should be. He has never been what he used to be, a happy loving person and child . He probably should have had counseling but we were so involved with getting custody of his child, he was overlooked. Although my husband and I had no criminal history or drug use, it became a court battle. The other mother wanted the baby and was going after a settlement on her behalf\u2026no money for the baby. As I learned, insurance companies will low-ball addicts, knowing they will take anything. The mother was getting 30k directly to her, and was attempting to settle quickly. We all knew it would go up her nose. We won our appeal and managed to get a settlement that would be more in line for the baby\u2019s benefit. After many months, thousands of dollars, and a home study of the other grandmother, we were given immediate custody on an emergency order. By that time, the damage was done financially and emotionally. The baby had been living a horrible existence during this whole court battle\u2026\u2026and that was the reason there was the emergency order. We had spent our retirement and my son was destroyed emotionally. To this day, I regret many of our decisions and feel helpless in our ability to help my son. I had wanted to write a book aobut it, feeling as though it would be good therapy\u2026.but I never have. Maybe, someday I will. Thank you so much everyone for your kind comments to me.

            "answer_text": "When I was a teenager, I answered the door of my parents house to a late-20s lady standing there. She introduced herself as my cousin. I had no idea who she was, but that was just the way my mother was - very secretive, cut off from various parts of the family, and always hiding things. Fortunately as I became an adult, I found all my extended family, and made up for lost time. But I got an even bigger shock around 6 years ago. Short story: My friend died. His wife & 2 kids did it tough. We helped out and were very close. They were taken away in witness protection. Over a decade later one of the kids is on my doorstep, all grown up. Long story: I had a good friend in the 1990s. At the time they had just started a family. and his 2 sons were 1 & 3 years old. One night he had a fight with his wife about picking him up from a pub (bar). He didn\u2019t want to drive home because he was blind drunk. He was only supposed to stop in there for a beer with his brother on the way home after work, some 8 hours earlier, and one beer led to another. She understandably didn\u2019t want to get the kids out of bed at 1am on a Saturday morning\u2026..and that\u2019s how the fight started. So he called me, and I did what any friend would do - crawled out of bed, picked him up, and dropped him home. As we got close to his house, the drunken banter and hero stories turned to a very serious note. I can\u2019t remember exactly what was said before it, but the important words were \u201cif anything ever happens to me, can you make sure my kids are OK and looked after.\u201d 2\u20133 weeks later he died in his sleep from a brain aneurysm. He was only 31. He had his own business, and it was doing well enough that she didn\u2019t have to work. But now suddenly that all changed. The business was sold, and that money kept her going for a while, but was eventually going to run out. She started doing courses to become a teacher\u2019s aid, with a view to becoming a school teacher - perfect for a single mother when the boys hit school age, eliminating before & after school car issues. But she eventually had to sell the house, and invest the equity to give her an income stream. She couldn\u2019t afford to rent in a good area, but they made do. I was never comfortable parking my car there to visit, and the neigbourhood kids were not real nice. Not having kids of our own, we used to take the boys pretty much every 2nd weekend to give her some time to study, and have a rest from being a 24/7 mum and a mature-aged student. We\u2019d often go away with the boys to the beach, or up the mountains for 1\u20132 nights. The boys looked forward to these adventures, and saw us as a 2nd set of parents. They got to do so much more and explore areas that were not possible for a single mother to afford to do. Plus we also enjoyed it - and would do similar trips anyway, with or without the boys. She moved several times over the next 4 years - trying to get one step better each time, but was still struggling to protect herself & the boys from the rough neigbourhoods that were all she could afford. We weren\u2019t in a position to help, and being an orphan herself, she had no family to lean on either - just friends like us, but they had their own families & bills. She had just qualified as a teacher, and was doing her placements (like an internship) and things were looking up. We had planned to go away with the boys over the Easter break, and went around to her place on the Friday to pick the boys up as planned. No answer at the door. No car. No plastic chairs on the porch. I looked in through a window and the place was empty. I rang her mobile, and got the \u201cdisconnected\u201d message. It\u2019s like they\u2019d vanished. The various neighbours who were outside all glared at me, and made me feel very uncomfortable. Not unusual, but worse this time. All sorts of things went through my head. Where would they be? She wouldn\u2019t move without telling us? I even went past the school pick-up line to look for her car - a car that I had bought & fixed up for them - it was a regular fixture as she was placed at that school, but no sign of the car. About 6 months later I got a call from her. She was at a Police station, and had begged to contact us. She explained that they were basically in witness protection, and had been relocated interstate (couldn\u2019t tell me which state). Without going into too much detail, there was a very violent crime committed near where she lived, involving a crime group connected to well-known people in high positions, and she became a key witness. One of the boys endured a failed kidnap attempt at the school, and that was the final straw. I wasn\u2019t allowed to know where she\u2019d been moved to, nor get any contact details until after the case was over. I didn\u2019t even know what state they went to. It dragged on for years, and even made the newspapers. We completely lost contact with them, because they weren\u2019t allowed to contact anyone from their past. In that time I\u2019d also moved house, and we didn\u2019t have listed numbers, so the chances of her finding us again were also slim. We still thought about them a lot, and spoke occasionally about the good memories. Imagine my surprise when an 18 year old version of my old friend knocked on the door one day - it was the younger of the 2 boys, all grown up. He\u2019d actually gone to my old house, and the people living there told him my current address (10 years since we\u2019d moved!) I couldn\u2019t believe it. He managed to find us that easily! The whole story came out - where they were moved to, what went on etc. Apparently they had to wait until the \u201chead\u201d of the crime group passed away (from natural causes, ironically), and various key figures were jailed, before they could return to the area. And now they were back, and looking at houses to rent, so they could move back and he could go to uni. We were able to reconnect, and it\u2019s been great being a part of their life again over the last 6-7 years. It\u2019s sad that we missed a good 12 or so years of their life, but they have spent plenty of time filling us in on all the years we missed. The boys still remember some of the adventures we took them on, and have fond memories of our weekends away. I never realised at the time how important those adventures would be to them. Both are now very successful in their studies and careers, which is all my mate ever wanted for his boys. I\u2019m glad we had the opportunity spend time with them and do stuff that has been fondly remembered, and has stayed in their memory for life. I figure I kept up my promise, within my capacity. One of the boys is getting married soon, and has asked us to be there as family, alongside his mum. His brother is going to be the best man. I reckon I\u2019ll have to come up with a few \u201cdad jokes\u201d for the speech, in honour of my mate, their dad. Sometimes I think back to that night when he was drunk, and wonder if he knew he wasn\u2019t going to be around much longer for his sons. ",
