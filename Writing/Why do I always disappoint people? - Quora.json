            "answer_text": "I have 3 things to say: No human is perfect.People always, everyone; have a negatively biasing side as an intellect.No human can be perfect.Humans do wrongs, provided you repent for the mistake, build a trust inside others over time and you aren't making the same sin/mistake again. I have 3 more things to say: To err is human, to forgive is divine. Everyone has the tendency to forgive, depending on individual, time varies.You can't expect gold from a gold fish and be disappointed. Find the right people, accept criticisms, they are like power ups.Chisel yourself from your mistakes. Failures are a stepping stone to success.If you feel you disappoint people, first you yourself realized that you haven't been the way others expected. That is realization. You have realized your fault in your star. So now, you mend it and amend it. Peace! ",
