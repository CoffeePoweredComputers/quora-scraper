            "answer_text": "No. And, even if they did, they wouldn\u2019t care. Your essay should represent who you are, your passions, your goals, your experiences and how they shaped you, and similar. That doesn\u2019t change, so why should the way in which you present yourself in your essay change? That said, you should be sure you\u2019re answering the question that is being asked and that your answer is aimed at the goals you have at that institution and with that application. In other words, you can and should use content from one application in another application (and that should be your best written work), but you will need to edit it for each. Here\u2019s a suggested process for this: Create a list of all the application essay questions you\u2019ll need to answer for all the schools, majors, and programs to which you plan to apply. Group them into categories and write an essay for each category. Then, edit each essay for each application, based on the school or program, the specific question being asked, and your goals. All the best in your educational endeavors! ",

            "answer_text": "No, it\u2019s highly unlikely for colleges to know that you use the same essay for different schools. These admissions officers at different institutions are competing with each other to attract the most applicants, drive down their acceptance rates, and drive up their rankings on US News. Unless if these admissions officers know each other personally, it\u2019s unlikely that they will know you use the same essays. Keep in mind the 650 word common application essay is sent out to every single school, so that one is the same any way. ",
