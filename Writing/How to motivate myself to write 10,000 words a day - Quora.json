            "answer_text": "I have often hit the 10,000 mark. Generally, it\u2019s not worth it. The quality degrades (for me) after about 7,000 words, and in order to keep my brain working, I find a realistic writing level is about 5,000 words. Then I have time to walk the dogs, enjoy the children and have a bit of a life. However, if you want to hit it again, I\u2019d recommend my approach. I reckon to write 1,000 words in 50 minutes. I do that, then take a break and work out what the next scene will be (I tend to stick to scenes of 1,000 words, which will be edited down or up, depending on the story). In that way I can easily write for three hours in the morning and two in the afternoon, with some editing of the day\u2019s work in the evening. Motivation isn\u2019t probably your issue, though. It\u2019s interruptions. If you want to do this, when you get to your computer, turn off ALL notifications on the phone, and stop emails, Facebook, iChat or any other social media. Just use the computer as a glorified word processor. The worst distraction and destroyer of work is access to the internet! Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "You did it once for a week. After that, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s motivation you lost as much as you just exhausted yourself. Think of writing as a marathon instead of a sprint. Should you could burn out all your energy and run full-out at the start of the marathon, but that\u2019s not sustainable. Likewise, if you shoot for 10,000 a day, you might be able to do it for a certain amount of time, but after that, it will tire you out. You need to find a target that you can hit consistently day after day, week after week. After a few months of hitting that goal, then try bumping it up a little higher if you feel like you can do more. If you find increasing your word count is too difficult, then drop it back down. My personal daily goal is 2000 words. It was 1000 for a while, but about a year or two ago, I found I could comfortably increase it, so I did. I suggest try starting out with something small like that, shoot for 1000\u20132000 a day and keep it going for a month or two. After that, see if you can bump it up higher. If you try to shoot for unrealistic goals, then you\u2019re going to lose a lot of motivation. Keep your goals manageable and sustainable. ",
