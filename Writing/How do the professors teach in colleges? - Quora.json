            "answer_text": "It varies, because there is a great deal of professional leeway in how to teach courses. Some do the traditional lecture, standing in front of a class and talking. Some do discussion-based courses, in which ideas are batted around the class from student to student. Some use \u201cold school\u201d tech, jotting down stuff on whiteboards or even chalkboards. Others may incorporate smart boards and video, and have student use their cell phones to respond to surveys during the class. Some take students in laboratories and tinker with chemicals or scientific equipment. Some take students into the rare books section of the school library to look at medieval manuscripts. Some may take students into computer labs to edit video in real time for film editing classes. Some teach in art studios, and students will have easels set up with paintings in progress, and the teacher will walk around and say, \u201cmore blue\u201d or stop to illustrate painting techniques by hand. Some are formal and refer to students as \u201cMr. Smith\u201d and \u201cMs. Lee\u201d and prefer to be called \u201cProfessor Jones.\u201d Others are informal, and prefer first-names all around. Some are entirely physical, with little available online besides a syllabus. Others do a great deal of work with online materials, having students take tests and turn in homework electronically on a course management system like Blackboard. Most of us do some mix of the above, the exact ratio depending on how big the class is and how well the material lends itself to one approach or another. ",
