            "answer_text": "For starters, let\u2019s try and get the product out. The novel. Writing a novel can be a daunting prospect. Simply visualising all the steps needed to reach the end can be demoralising at first. Different writers approach this in different ways, so it\u2019s important to choose the way that works best for you. For example, some people might benefit from making a mind map of the whole book, connecting the dots and plot points so that they are laying the groundwork in early chapters for things that might happen much later. Others may prefer to let the writing flow and allow the characters to dictate where the story goes (it is very important to know your characters well if you want to be able to do this effectively). There is no right or wrong here, but the two things I would keep in mind are: Careful of plot holes. As a writer, you need to know the story in an out. If a new plot idea/ twist comes to mind, you should instantly know all the other plot points that would need to change in order to accommodate thisPace yourself. You might find that you are in such a hurry to finish the book that you run through a potentially 100,000-word novel in 40,000 words. In such a case, going back and filling gaps or adding matter can be messy and even break the flow too much for it to remain a smooth read. Try and have a beginning and an ending in your mind for each chapter and set a word count for that chapter that you feel comfortable with. This way you avoid spilling into the rest of your story too soon. I always feel it\u2019s better to write too much and then edit it down to make the writing crisper than to go the other way around.Once you are done with the first draft, the boring work begins. You would need to re-read the book at least 5\u20136 times to weed out plot holes, add key details and breadcrumbs, and even smooth out the language. Writing depends a lot on your state of mind. You might find the stuff you wrote early in the morning is more fluid and richer than stuff you wrote at the end of the day (this is perfectly natural). Reviewing your work allows you to iron all this out so your style stays even. Check for typos and look for writing ticks. Ticks are unavoidable, especially if you are writing in flow and don\u2019t want to stop and keep checking your work. Words will be repeated, as will phrases. It may be useful to use a writing software to check for repeat words and also aid you with grammatical mistakes and typos. Finally, take the time to write the acknowledgements and, if needed, a bibliography. If your novel involves research, you will be surprised how much you retain while writing the book that you later forget after a few months. A well-structured bibliography not only tells a publisher you have done your homework but allows you to go back and refer to the research when an editor asks you to make changes (which they most certainly will). The boring stuff is important because you want to be able to send a book to a publisher in as polished a form as possible. They may still ask you to rework on large chunks of the book, but nothing annoys an editor more that reading something with multiple typos and obvious writing ticks. Happy writing! ",

Thank you Evans Marvin for the A2A \ud83d\ude0a I am royally unqualified to write this - I've not made the leap from being an amateur to a published one, but here goes nothing :) ValueApart from scrawling drafts, hacking them down, cleaning them and finally pitching our cool New York Bestseller-to-be, the most important factor that most of us rookie writers overlook is 'value'. What is that? Value is - Why should anyone read my book? For a long time all I ever thought was 'I need to finish this book and get this whole publication thing over with.\u2019 Family and friends read any trash write because they love you. It's your job to convert the average Joe and make his nose bleed between the pages of your book. MarketingThis is outward expression of value. Who is your target audience?What makes your book stand out from the competition?Genre - is your book a wacky genre-bending blend of dystopian fiction + your weird paranormal experiences + doomed romance? Publishers will struggle to find a category to shelve it under.How experienced are you? Do you know your way around the writing and publishing world?Do you have an established fan base?Writers need to embrace all aspects of our craft wholeheartedly - from designing the book cover, page layouts, typesetting, building a resume and landing a well deserved deal.
