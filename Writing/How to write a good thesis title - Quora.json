            "answer_text": "Let us discuss the most basic and important aspect of a research paper\u2014the title. Writing a research paper title may seem a simple task, but it requires some serious thought. Readers come across research paper titles in searches through databases and reference sections of research papers. They deduce what a paper is about and its relevance to them based on the title. Considering this, it is clear that the title of your paper is the most important determinant of how many people will read it. A good research paper title: Condenses the paper\u2019s content in a few wordsCaptures the readers\u2019 attentionDifferentiates the paper from other papers of the same subject areaSo here are three basic tips to keep in mind while writing a title: 1] Keep it simple, brief and attractive: The primary function of a title is to provide a precise summary of the paper\u2019s content. So keep the title brief and clear. Use active verbs instead of complex noun-based phrases, and avoid unnecessary details. Moreover, a good title for a research paper is typically around 10 to 12 words long. A lengthy title may seem unfocused and take the readers\u2019 attention away from an important point. 2] Use appropriate descriptive words: A good research paper title should contain key words used in the manuscript and should define the nature of the study. Think about terms people would use to search for your study and include them in your title. Avoid: Effects of drug A on schizophrenia patients: study of a multicenter mixed group Better: Psychosocial effects of drug A on schizophrenia patients: a multicenter randomized controlled trial 3] Avoid abbreviations and jargon: Known abbreviations such as AIDS, NATO, and so on can be used in the title. However, other lesser-known or specific abbreviations and jargon that would not be immediately familiar to the readers should be left out. ",

            "answer_text": "Your best bet is to leave it till last. The first thing you want to do is come up with a concept for your thesis. When you have that concept you can form that into a title. It depends on the subject but this first title is just a place holder.  I shall show you two examples from my time at University. My undergraduate Dissertation title was: An exploration of the cultural influences upon the Danubian Frontier forces of the Byzantine Empire, during the sixth century AD. My Masters Dissertation title was: The experimentation of medieval cloth armours to expand a format for further testing within the field of medieval armour. Special attention is given to the lower classes and the dates surrounding the first crusade. As you can see dissertation titles are snappy and to the point. In all seriousness though the titles I have shown were good enough but not exceptional. remember the content is the key here. The content of these dissertations was the important bit. The title was just a short hand description.   So my undergraduate title: An exploration of the cultural influences upon the Danubian Frontier forces of the Byzantine Empire, during the sixth century AD. It was an exploration. This is a discussion topic. It is almost a review in nature and tells the reader that there is a broad scope and that there is not going to be brand new ground breaking scientific evidence inside. It is a focus on compare and contrast.'Cultural influences' that right there is the topic bracket. I was looking at culture and cultural markers. It specifies that explicitly so you know what you are getting into. 'Danubian Frontier forces of the Byzantine Empire' That is the who. Once you have the topic and the how laid out you need to know the who, the subjects for your study. This also handily includes the where.'during the sixth century AD.' That is the when. This tells people that I was focusing on a specific set of years so I would be discounting evidence from outside that bracket unless it was vitally important.That is the breakdown of the Title. I did spend some time on it but if I write it again now I would likely jazz it up a little. Perhaps adding in a question if I were to publish it. (I will talk about questions a little later). it lays out the important information in clear logical steps which are: Format of the workTopicThe who and whereThe whenWhat you will notice is that I added the date on the end. That was part of the process. I was looking at the group, I narrowed the group down because it was too broad. I then narrowed the time down as again there was too much to fit in. If we now take my masters title (which was a pretty shoddy one, I cringe when I read bits of it, that's another topic though. I actually wanted to call the thing touching cloth) The experimentation of medieval cloth armours to expand a format for further testing within the field of medieval armour. Special attention is given to the lower classes and the dates surrounding the first crusade. This title is slightly different as there was original scientific experimentation (in the loosest possible terms). So on to the number system It is an experiment so there will be results and conclusions. so tick there.The topic. Well its about cloth armour as an example of the field of armour research. Again a tick but it is not as clear as the undergraduate one. The who and where. Well yes they are explicitly stated so another tick.The when. That is the last two words of the title. Now interestingly enough I hit all of the points I needed to. The issue with this title was how it grew. As I delved into the topic I discovered due to a lack of time to do experiments, lack of finances for equipment, and quite frankly the paucity of existing literature that the topic was too broad. What I should have done is put more effort into the background of the original proposal. A more realistic time frame etc. What that would have achieved would have been a tighter title to describe what was inside. As the final title comes at the end once you know what the thesis contains it will quickly show you if you haven't focused enough. It is a clear indicator of what is inside so if the content isn't particularly good neither is the title. Panicking yet?  Well don't it isn't that hard when you lay it out. The first thing to do is do a background study on existing literature. You will now have a few key points or questions that you know need answering (It's a thesis, it is supposed to further humanity in the field of study it is written for). You will also be writing an extensive bibliography. Categorise these books under the questions. If the core book list for the topic exceeds 20ish (arbitrary I know but the undergraduate dissertation above has a bibliography of close to 100 books, that is only the ones that I included, there were tonnes I just didn't get round to) then it's already been done or your topic is too broad Narrow it down and see if you can make some of those books less essential. So in the masters one above I narrowed my focus to exclusively cloth armour (I wasted some time at the start tarting around with maille to find out I couldn't do that bit justice).  Questions I said above I'd get to this. Your initial title, the one only you have and look at, should be a question. This will keep you focused. you need to answer that question. It will define your arguments and the literature you use. Now the final title can include a question but this can be frowned upon. A good way to check if it is acceptable is to look at previous dissertations and articles on the subject. See no question marks? then don't use a question. You will notice neither of the above titles were questions. That was because they were written after I knew the answer.  In summary follow the four points from above about the content. Try and make it snappy but don't stress if you can't. Do be precise and explicit in the statement. As above in mine I explicitly state what it is about. If the title is clear and has all of those factors then you are there.  Thanks for the A2A, you can find some more of my work here: History of the World Blog  ",
