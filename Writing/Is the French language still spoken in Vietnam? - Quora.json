            "answer_text": "This answer is off the subject, but involves French and Vietnam in 1966\u201367. I was a Marine in Vietnam 1966\u20131967 and stationed up north, just down from the DMZ. Dong Ha, Cam Lo, Con Thien, Rockpile, Camp JJ Carroll. Studied French in high school but wasn\u2019t worth a shit but the kind teacher passed me anyway. I knew that the French had occupied Vietnam for some time and would at times speak the language to some civilian Vietnamese, when we were around a ville. I could not speak Vietnamese and them no English, but we both could talk in French. Only dumb things, like \u201cwhat time is it\u201d or \u201cwhat color is that\u201d. And \u201chow are you\u201d. Nonetheless, it was really cool and it made the torturous French class much better. There were many bad things happening in Vietnam, but this was a nice thing . Now, spring ahead many years and my barber is a former Vietnamese Marine and very pro American and loves the USMC. No bullshit haircut. Sit down, shut up, and a Marine Corps haircut is on the way. He had a Vietnamese name, of course, but went by Long. I knew he was born in 1942 and asked him about speaking French and made the mistake to speak to him in French. He immediately reamed my ass, for my poor pronunciation, then told me he was required to speak French and spoke it to me and I swear he was a native, he was so good. Then he told me about the Japanese in WW2 and how he hated them, because they were in Vietnam. We both agreed that America was over there, to try and stop the commies. Everyone seems to forget that now. He was so kind, that if a serviceman came in and had no money, he would cut their hair for free. Unfortunately, I had to find a regular barber shop that had more than one barber. I would call before but with a one man shop, sometimes he was at lunch or the bank and it became a burden. He hung up his scissors when the coronavirus hit. I hope you enjoyed my ramblings! ",

            "answer_text": "I wasn\u2019t going to write an answer but accidentally read ridiculously hateful answers on this matter so I think I should provide my pov. Geez, people, chill! French is not largely spoken in Vietnam nowadays. It\u2019s a fact. I have my University major in French but rarely use the language for work, mostly it was English. But it\u2019s not necessary to say that French speaking people are rare in Vietnam. Not mention anymore of the \u2018old French speaking generation\u2019 which some people wrote about (my grandparents belong to this group, they were born in 20s-30s), there are many French speaking people from other generations actively use that language till this day. Just because of its own characteristics, French mostly learned today in Vietnam by people that work in History, Medicine, Architecture, Fine Arts, some in Engineering and Nature Sciences, or Social Sciences Studies\u2026ect Including alumni in other fields who studied in France or other French speaking countries. English, Japanese & Korean have more of their exposure in economic factors so it\u2019s easier to meet people know these languages in your working environment. Otherwise, I meet many French speaking people in cultural events, since the France institutes in Hanoi and Saigon are still two of the most active cultural spaces in Vietnam. Just my 50cent. I\u2019m from Hanoi by the way. ",

            "answer_text": "French is a foreign language in contemporary Vietnam, it plays no special role, it is not spoken natively by Vietnamese in Vietnam, it is a school subject that is learned by some students as a foreign language, but probably far more learn English than French. Ethnologue does not even mention French among the languages spoken in Vietnam. The website you\u2019ve linked to is targeted at French speaking expats and French speakers around the world, I don\u2019t know if it is government backed or independent media, but it is definitely not the primary source of information for any Vietnamese (unless someone is a Frenchman of Vietnamese descent and does not speak Vietnamese at all). Many countries have such websites, magazines, so it\u2019s nothing special. I know that some people still entertain the idea that \u201cVietnam is some sort of ex-French country where you could get by if you speak French\u201d, but Vietnam is not like West Africa, where French is the language of administration and inter-ethnic communication, higher education, etc. Vietnam is a nation state with its own national language that is used as primary language in all areas of public life, including business. Of course you will find many educated Vietnamese who are fluent in foreign languages, mostly English, some other European languages including French, but also German, etc. and even speakers of Mandarin or Japanese. But those speakers owe their skills to foreign language education, studies abroad or family background (emigration to the West), not to the colonial period of Vietnam. ",

But his english was much better (he had also worked with the Americans) Even during the colonial time, not many Vietnamese were speaking french. The colonization ended in the 50\u2019s and there has been almost no french presence since that. However, during the war and for several years after, english was banned from schools (at least in the North) and french made a return in favor. I have indeed done business with several people born after the independence who had learned french. Especially in the North. Very difficult pronunciation because no use of the language. But nowadays, english has come back as the top foreign language and very few Vietnamese speak french. ",

About French language, although Vietnam is a member of the Francophone, it is symbolic only. You cannot see a better position of French in daily life than German for example (a country with no historic relationship with Vietnam). However these days, Vietnamese still hold a positive view on France and French language and culture. ",

However French is not as popular anymore because English, Japanese, Chinese and increasingly Korean are become more popular. There is heavy Japanese investment into Vietnam now so Vietnamese prioritise learning Japanese more than French. The same goes for Chinese and Korean. Of course everyone learns English. ",

I have asked why so few people know the French language but the answer was that they were not taught and that it is not the lingua franca in the country. A couple of shops displayed French Names; that is all. I believe it was the French which helped codify the Vietnamese language. ",

The French of course have influenced Vietnamese culture through the occupation and colonization, though considerably less in chronological influence as the Chinese.

This makes the sound-letter or pronunciation and formal writing much easier to comprehend, and obviates a great learning curve in the language as it is represented in writing. We do have foreign languages as required and influencing Vietnamese culture in the present.
