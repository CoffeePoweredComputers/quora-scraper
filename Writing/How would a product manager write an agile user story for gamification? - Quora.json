            "answer_text": "You probably wouldn\u2019t write a single user story to cover all manner of gamification in your application\u2026you\u2019d probably write different user stories to cover the main cases in which you want to gamify your product. For example: As a new user, I want to receive a badge when I complete the tutorial, so that I can display my achievements to other users.As a commenter, I want to receive a badge when my comment gets upvoted by the community, so that I can be rewarded for my contributions.Acceptance Criteria:10 Votes = Badge 120 Votes = Badge 230 Votes = Badge 3Or something like that. Each story should be individually deliverable by the team within an iteration and be something that can be clearly demonstrated to meet the acceptance criteria. ",
