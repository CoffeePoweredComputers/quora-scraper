            "answer_text": "You shouldn't. Here's what you can and should do for first-class mail and parcels. (Note: Toss \u201cjunk mail\u201d, that is, mail with a bulk mail, non-profit, or standard mail stamp or endorsement in the trash or recycling bin unless it contains the text \u201caddress correction requested \u201c. \u201cStandard\u201d rate mail will contain the abbreviation \u201cPRSRT STD\u201d or some expansion of that) If the addressee has moved, put a diagonal slash through the address and write \u201cmoved\u201d. If the name is not familiar to anyone who lives there, again put a diagonal slash through the address, but write \u201cunknown\u201d on the envelope. If the item is a package with merchandise, you can write \u201crefused\u201d\u2026 but be aware that many companies have procedures for returns (i.e., requiring an RMA or return merchandise authorization) in order for it to be credited to you). DO NOT use any of these endorsements for mail addressed to people who do live there. A \u201creturn to sender\u201d endorsement (or any of the others) may cause the carrier to hold all mail for that person pending a change of address form; with no COA on file, mail will be returned to sender after a week or so. Side note: as often happens, the pop song from the 60s, \u201cReturn to sender, address unknown\u201d gets it wrong. The address was known and the mail delivered. Correct would be, \u201c\u2026 addressee unknown\u201d, if the letter was addressed to someone who didn't live there. For emphasis\u2019 sake: if you start \u201creturning\u201d or \u201cunknowning\u201d your mail, you'll soon enough start to see none of your mail delivered. ",

If the address is right but not yours write forward on it. If it's addressed right and you don't want it write refused on it. That's is it. It does no good to write all over a letter \u201c has not lived here for 15 years. Stop deliving this!\u201d. All that does is piss off your carrier. Your carrier may be new to your route and doesn't know you have lived there for 10 years. Sometimes your carrier isn't perfect and makes a mistake. Unless you are perfect don't make it worse. The carrier knows they screwed up. You have no idea the pressures put on new carriers so if you are patient you will get great service. ",
