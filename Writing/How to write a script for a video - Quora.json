            "answer_text": "Writing a video script can be a tough challenge.  Follow these steps to come up with a stellar video script template: STEP 1: Ask the Right Questions Before you dive into creating a video script, find answers to the following questions: 1. WHAT\u2019S THE GOAL OF YOUR VIDEO? It\u2019s vital to know why you\u2019re investing your time and resources to create this video. Will this video be used to increase traffic to your website? Is it going to improve conversions on your landing page? 2. WHO\u2019S THE TARGET AUDIENCE? If you know who is going to watch your video, it becomes easier to write a video script that guides the viewer to complete the goal of the video. STEP 2: Determine a Flow The first thing you\u2019ll have to pick for your video is a title. This is important since the title, thumbnail, and the description (on social media) of your video will influence whether a viewer clicks play or scrolls past it. THE INTRO SCENE This is perhaps the most important part of your video. The intro scene determines if someone is going to watch your video completely and influences the viewer to complete the goal of the video. VIDEO CONTENT Now that your viewer is engaged, it\u2019s time to highlight the goal of your video passively. The approach has to be subtle and not intimidating. You wouldn\u2019t want to show the product straight away and push the viewer to buy or lure them with a discount. Keep this for the end. THE OUTRO SCENE This is your final chance to push the viewer to perform an action that aligns with the goal of your video. STEP 3: Review Your Video Script Once you\u2019ve created the perfect video script, it is time to enact it. Read the narration parts out loud, and you will realize a few words do not quite fit when spoken, even though they seem fine when read. ",

            "answer_text": "When you decided to make the use of explainer video for your business promotions, then the script of the video is the only source to intimate the client. If you intend to write a script, then it is completely different from text writing. It requires exceptional writing skills to capture the attentiveness of the customer. There may be several obstacles in writing a script for a video that can be easily resolved by following the procedures listed down. #Devise a plan for your script A creative video should be planned at the earlier stage of scriptwriting itself because if you want to make any changes in the script, then it is easy to carry out. So planning your script enables you to eliminate the additional cost incurred in a project. The plan of the script should collect valuable information such as product features, target audience, the key message to the viewers, story style telling, and visual style. There is a traditional formula for an explainer video, which helps you to understand the scriptwriting. Step 1: Address the pain points of the customer through the existing infrastructure. Step 2: Introduce the product such that it serves the needs of the customer and how it resolves their problem. Step 3: List the benefits of the product and how it is different from the other competitor product. Step 4: The final call to action comprising the email addresses and the contact numbers of the product that triggers the customer to place the order over the product. #Make it concise Speaking about a product is easy, but writing a script is a little bit tough with the restrictions of the duration of the video and where it serves the audience. Your battle towards the concentration of the customer lies greatly in explaining a product in a short period. #Prepare a rough draft for your script Video script created with the two-column format where one column gives the script and the other column addresses the visual elements added to the video. The script tone should follow a conversational format to maintain a naturalism in the script. It is also a good practice to read out loudly the script, which helps you to identify the errors in the script. #Determine the Feedback After completing the script process, you should get feedback from your colleagues and friends.
