            "answer_text": "I disagree with others here who rigidly assert \u201cfun is not an adjective\u201d. I looked out references when a teacher corrected \u201cso fun\u201d in my daughter\u2019s homework (at the age of 5 or 6); If I recall correctly I found good literary uses of fun as an adjective, up to 2 centuries old.No, you probably wouldn\u2019t say \u201cfunner\u201d in a literary work, but would you object to \u201cmore fun\u201d - the performance was more fun than last week\u2019s\u201d? Now when you say that, either you\u2019re mentally seeing fun-marks on a scale (adjective) or you\u2019re seeing a bucket of fun (noun) with someone adding another cupful. I suggest the former image is more likely.Yes, I admit \u201cvery fun\u201d sounds slightly odd (though not, I think something that can be confidently pronounced incorrect); but \u201cfun is not an adjective\u201d is not the explanation for that. \u201cVery\u201d is a strange word: why can you say \u201cI like you very much\u201d but not \u201cI like you much\u201d? Just custom, really.Language changes and I\u2019m sure \u201cvery fun\u201d will sound less odd with time. There\u2019s no real logical reason for avoiding it. UPDATE: I just remembered, back in March 2016 I got a little survey form from Facebook (see attached pic). If anyone knows how to speak good American English, it\u2019s Facebook :) and they definitely approve of \u201cvery fun\u201d. Also \u201csomewhat fun\u201d & \u201cslightly fun\u201d. At the time, though, in airing this survey via Twitter, I did suggest noun alternatives:\u201cA metric sh*t-tonne of funA lot of funSome funA little bit of funNo fun at all\u201d. You are welcome to use these, if you\u2019re unhappy with the adjectival forms.  ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not sure that one can't say 'very fun'. I hear it said - That's a very fun idea. I'd certainly agree that fun can function as an adjective - \"That's a fun task\" - that's not a fun task.'Very good' is a common expression with several different uses. Very good can mean agreement or acceptance or even \"I understand\". I don't hear 'very fun' but I do hear 'so fun!' and 'great fun!' and if 'very fun' means much the same as those - it would be understood if one said it even if it's not commonly said. ",
