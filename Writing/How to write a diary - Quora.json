            "answer_text": "Write in a diary that makes you feel excited in writing in. I first generally used diaries with simple black covers. But later I discovered colors make you happy ;}Learnt from my mistakes never use gel, fountain, glitter, or sketch pens for writing in because if you accidentally spill water on it you will regret it. Nor use a pencil because your handwriting gets smudged. Better use a ball pen.Always write the date so that when you ever read your diary you will remember when the event took place in your diary.Give your diary a name. This is optional but you can give your diary a name and it would feel like you\u2019re talking to a real person. But don\u2019t talk a lot to him or her because after years if you read your diary it wouldn\u2019t be fun to read something like \u201cDear diary today I ate butterscotch ice-cream\u201d.Your diary is your century if nothing exciting happens to you in the day then you can even write the things that pass through your mind like scream into the pages about that strict teacher, cry your heart through the words that describe it, likes, dislikes, stories, poetries or even the lyrics that pass through your mind.It is a person whom you can share anything with. Fill it with movie tickets, bills, some envelop with real money. Anything would be fine.Find a place that is comfortable to write in your diary. It should be quite, silent and peaceful so that you can flow the words out of your mind easily.Lastly if you forget writing for a long time with a cause then just write it on a paper and stick it on the paper of your diary and continue writing from the current date. If you try to catch up daily to write in then you might probably lose interest in writing in.ENJOY WRITING :) ",

            "answer_text": "I started my diary when I was twelve years old. It was my sister\u2019s idea and it was part of the many things that we\u2019d do together. Every day we\u2019d write our entries and then we\u2019d read them out to each other. My sister was behind almost all of my creative efforts as a child - she would direct plays in which my brother and I starred and was the cohesive force that kept us going back to these tasks. When she grew a bit older she removed herself a bit and then my diary became something else: no longer was it a game or a conversation with my sister, but it became instead a conversation with myself. When I was a teenager there was a touch of vanity in this conversation, a desire to make my thoughts sound novelistic or to model them on other diaries that I had read, most notably the diary of Anne Frank. As I got older my diary merely became an outpouring of emotion written anywhere - on scraps of paper, on Word documents, in the midst of other things that I was doing. They don\u2019t always make sense, they aren\u2019t always fair on the people who feature in them and they don\u2019t always reflect my \u2018true\u2019 feelings about something. They do help me to come to terms with things though, to talk myself through things or even to write away unreal fears. If you need motivation to start writing a diary then having someone with whom you can share this experience would really help, especially as it will get you into the habit of talking to someone, which is really what a diary is - a personal conversation with yourself throughout the years. The style of your diary will change with you and with the needs that it serves. The most important thing is to write wherever and whenever the thought strikes you: if you are a person who frequently needs to blow off steam, it can be pretty therapeutic. ",
