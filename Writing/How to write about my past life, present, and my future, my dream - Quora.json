            "answer_text": "I can only tell you how I wrote about my past lives and how that information helped me in the present. The future depends on what you do in the present, as you make your own future with your thoughts, words and deeds. Write down you goals for the future and follow them. I have seem myself in many different past lives in dreams and in visions. I sat down and wrote everything I remembered about each life. Then I went to the history books and found information that gave me background for each life. For example in a dream I saw myself as a knight, with a certain type of clothing on, with a broad sword, fighting in a battle. My squire was standing at my back as we fought hand to hand with the enemy. This was the dream. It was very realistic and in color! When I woke up I wrote everything down that I could remember, with every detail. I even drew the way the cross looked on my tunic. With research I found out that the knights of the crusade came from different areas of Europe. The cross on my tunic was one worn by the knights following Godfrey of Bouillon. I was killed in the battle for Antioch with a sword thrust in my back. My squire of that time, I recognized as a friend of mine in this lifetime now living in Tucson Arizona. In this life I have a weakness in my back right where the sward entered. I have seen my past lives in the temple of Atlantis, and in Egypt. I was a Mayan nobleman, a Chinese war lord\u2019s concubine, I worked in a monastery as a scribe, and I was murdered by a group of men because I was a Catholic priest. I escaped being burnt at the stake in France because of my religion. I was a Native American living in the woods before the colonies were settled, a shaman for the tribe, and in another life a slave,on a plantation in the southern U.S., before the American Civil War. I was a countess in 14th century Italy. My husband of this life time was the Duke. I learned of my life there when my husband was USAF stationed in Italy in 1981\u20131983, and we visited his former home of Urbino. There is much more to this story but there is not enough room here to write it all. I have lived as a member in all races. I have been both man and a woman in different life times through the ages, I have written my story in a book and now I am actively looking for a publisher. The book is called \u201cThrough the Eyes of Time, Memories of a Soul\u201d. ",
