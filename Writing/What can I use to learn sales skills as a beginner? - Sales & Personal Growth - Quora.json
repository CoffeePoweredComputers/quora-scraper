The best approaches are to either search for the answer along side them or request they allow you time to research the information and get back to them on their question.Always, follow up. This is especially critical if you said you would. Many times in the sales process, we all desire to move on to the next sale.

            "answer_text": "As a beginner, you shall learn effective communication first. Regardless of language, the way we communicate decides the fate of the sales. After communication, it is the approach that matters. Customers/ clients are always to be considered priority. Approach them in their convenient time, place and way. Break the ice by speaking something that he maybe interested in so that both of you get comfortable and then sales approach can be made. For example, if the client has lots of pictures of god in office, talk about the temple or if client uses a mac, talk about its features and new models. This out of context words can help you in sales. ",
