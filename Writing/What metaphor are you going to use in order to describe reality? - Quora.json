            "answer_text": "For the reality of human existence, I like the metaphor and interpretation of the ancient Greek legend by the French/Algerian existentialist writer Albert Camus. Camus maintains that the condemnation of King Sisyphus by the Gods to spend all eternity rolling a huge boulder to the top of a mountain only to slip at the summit and the boulder rolls to the bottom of the mountain again and again, is a metaphor for humanity. Sisyphus can\u2019t help himself to repeat this absurd task over and over forever. Camus says this is a metaphor for the absurd reality of human existence. However, as Camus suggests, Sisyphus was too smart for the Gods, because Sisyphus enjoyed it!! Camus is suggesting that we humans should do the same as Sisyphus, enjoy our absurd reality rather than commit suicide because of our, perhaps, pointless reality. johnrossmcglade.wordpress.com  johnrossmcglade.wordpress.com ",

Its similar to how images are warped and distorted when seen in a \u201cHouse of mirrors.\u201d ",
