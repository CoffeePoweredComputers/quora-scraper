            "answer_text": "Being an author is not related to your education, but rather to unique viewpoints and skill. Develop your own perspective on matters that other people are interested in and project it as your own loud and clear. Be definitive and prolific. No one cares if you write. They care if you have something new to say. Build a platform based on your new perspectives on existing subjects. Years later people will ask you where you learned it all and went to school. Start with some good outlines and research to make sure that you are inventing your own wheel. Then practice your pace of writing 3,000\u20135,000 words per day. Polish them as you go or revisiting them later. Throw away the first book that you finish or at least shelve it to revisit ten years later. Make your second book the first one that you reveal to the world. Always follow all submission instructions and find publishers who are producing work like your own and would be logically interested in what you are doing. ",

            "answer_text": "Back in the day it was rare for people to go on to college and many published writers among them Herman Melville - a well-published author to say the least- never went to college. Shakespeare is not known to have attended college. Even in these modern times there have been writers who didn't attend college. Ray Bradbury, Truman Capote, Agatha Christie, Doris Lessing (2007 Nobel Prize winner in literature) If we expand the list to those who dropped out of college and went to become well-published writers, the list gets longer.

            "answer_text": "Yes, absolutely. If you\u2019re wanting to write a high-brow literary work of art like Dickens or Shakespeare, then people probably won\u2019t give you due credit b/c you don\u2019t have an MFA. But the rest of the world (that makes up the large majority of readers just wanting entertainment) - Heck yes, absolutely! You do not need a college education to write a book. What you do need: a good bookan editor to edit the pacing, grammar, plot holes, etc.a resilience to keep on going even if you get rejections or if you don\u2019t feel like writingGood luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Those are two different and largely unconnected things. While most authors tend to have a college/university education, one doesn\u2019t lead to the other. The author becomes successful by the stuff he/she writes about, not because of having or not having a college education. In short, it\u2019s having a tellable story to write about that makes or breaks a writer. I have worked with quite a number of successful authors in my 35+ years in publishing, and some have nothing than junior secondary-school qualifications. I\u2019ve worked with one author (successful too) who was a janitor, with no school-leaving certificates. You do what you can to write out your \u2018story.\u2019 You use your current educational level to maximise the possibilities and quality of writeup as best you can. ",

            "answer_text": "No one \u201cneeds\u201d a college education to become a published writer. It would be literally throwing your money away to make that a prerequisite. Anne Rice never went to college (to my knowledge- I\u2019ve read her statements about her background which emphasized her beginning as a waitress). I myself have no college degree and did not take writing -related college courses but every short story I\u2019ve written has been published. I took one writing seminar which was just to get to meet some famous writers who gave us some evaluations and advice. It was fun - but not in any way essential or necessary. Writing is just a lot of work but it\u2019s also just goddam fun and an enjoyable challenge if you\u2019re up to it. The other side of this same coin: some of the most worthless, snobbish people I know \u201cpretend\u201d to be writers and intellectuals just because they have college degrees. The idea that you need a college education to \u201cqualify\u201d is pure bull shit educational propaganda. ",

Many people succeed at many things without a college education. Read books: The Writer\u2019s Journey by Christopher Vogler, Techniques of the Selling Writer by Dwight Swain, Writing Dialogue by Charles Chiarella are a good start. And/or take classes at writer\u2019s conferences, at your local community college\u2026 and read, read, read books in the genre you want to write in! ",
