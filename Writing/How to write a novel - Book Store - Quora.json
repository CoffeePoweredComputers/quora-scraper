            "answer_text": "Find what works for you. I know that isn\u2019t a very elaborate answer but it\u2019s really important that instead of trying to follow guidelines and do things in a systematic way, you focus on developing the story in a way that allows you to be your most creative, passionate self and grow as a writer. Plotting out the story and coming up with an outline beforehand can work for some writers but I find that it can actually cause me to become sidetracked to stress over every little detail, rather than free-writing and letting the ideas come naturally. I hope this helped and good luck with your novel(s). Providing feedback to others helps me too so feel free to reach out to me if you need any more help or have any more questions. ",
