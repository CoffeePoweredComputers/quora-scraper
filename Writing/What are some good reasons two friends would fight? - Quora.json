            "answer_text": "Hello Austin, thank you for the A2A. QUESTION: \u201cWhat are some good reasons two friends would fight.\u201d SHORT ANSWER: I can\u2019t think of a genuinely good reason two friends would fight, if you\u2019re talking about adults. If you are talking about children or adolescents, they could fight because they lack emotional maturity, insight into their behavior, have not yet developed empathy. etc. EXPLANATION: When two adults are genuinely friends\u2026meaning that they genuinely want the best for one another and have each other\u2019s best interest at heart\u2026there is no good reason to fight. Emotionally mature adults are entirely capable of talking through misunderstandings and misperceptions, apologizing, and forgiving their friend\u2019s shortcomings (as we all have them, and emotionally mature people know and accept this), etc. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you will see grown men and women, well into their 50s, physically fight with one another. However, when that occurs, it is my opinion that either one or both of them are deceiving themselves if they believe they are genuinely friends. I don\u2019t care who it is\u2026lover, family, friend, stranger\u2026if someone does something so egregious that I have to use physical force of any kind with them, that relationship is going to end\u2026right then and there. I\u2019m a logical, rational, reasonable person, and I see using physical force as a sign of weakness and a possible inability to communicate maturely. However, sometimes you can be a logical, rational adult who thinks like that and encounter another adult who cannot/will not regulate their emotions, and you have to protect yourself. That\u2019s a sad fact of life, even for adults. Fortunately, not every adult will find themselves in that situation. I suppose there could be instances where alcohol is involved, and that might lessen one or both people\u2019s inhibitions, however I don\u2019t think people get a pass for being intoxicated. Unless they are completely blacked out, people know what they are doing, they just don\u2019t care as much when intoxicated. Another instance could be in cases of mental illness, an imbalance in their hormones, a reaction to prescription medication, or personality disorder. You have to very carefully evaluated these situations, and educate yourself thoroughly, as it\u2019s one thing for someone\u2019s personality to change due to a reaction to a prescribed medication that comes from a pharmacy, and another altogether when someone regularly goes off their psychiatric medication because they decide they no longer need them, or regularly behaves in an abusive manner due to a lack of empathy and a characterological disorder (aka personality disorder). In most situations, there is no need for a fight when you are dealing with an emotionally mature person. Emotionally intelligent people talk things out, calmly, rationally, and they also are capable of listening and accepting that not everyone thinks as they do. Just something to keep in mind. Best wishes to you~ ",

Personally, I can\u2019t think of \u201cgood\u201d reasons because my friends and I are not interested in fighting with each other. I would think thought that fights between friends occur because of misunderstandings. ",
