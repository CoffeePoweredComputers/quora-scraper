            "answer_text": "Well its difficult to choose just one ,but gun to my head, I would choose the grim darkness of the Warhammer 40000 universe. For those uninitiated in the glories of this setting, Warhammer 40k such an extremely dystopian science fantasy universe that it inspired the word grimdark to describe it. Though humanity has built an empire of a million star systems, united under the harsh but glorious rule of the God emperor of Mankind, it is beset on all sides of vicious aliens, deranged heretics, foul daemons and genocidal undead robots.  The lore is deep and mesmerizing and the books and games are just a pure adrenaline rush. But at the end of the day its really about ordinary Humans standing up to a harsh and uncaring universe and standing your ground despite all the odds being stacked against you. I think their tagline explains it best. \"It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor of Mankind has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the vast Imperium of Man for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day so that he may never truly die.Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in His name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat to humanity from aliens, heretics, mutants -- and far, far worse. To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be relearned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.\"  ",

            "answer_text": "The world of Roshar from the Stormlight Archive has been mentioned, but I felt like I should add some detail.  Map of Roshar Roshar is not quite like your typical fantasy world, though I guess that could be said about a lot of the answers here. The largest difference is the existence of Highstorms, which are hurricane-force storms that pummel the entire planet every couple of weeks. Humanity builds citys in the clefts and ridges, where the storms don't hit as hard. Because of this frequent destructive force, most of the flora and fauna are adapted to a continuously damp, harsh, rocky terrain. For example, the grass grows out of small holes in the rock, and retreats underneath when a storm comes. Trees either relax their roots to lay flat in the wind, or are short and stocky, with leaves that retract directly into the trunk. Shalebark is a type of giant lichen that is cultivated in gardens and can grow over head-height. Cultivated grain grows in Rockbuds, small pods that cling to the rock. The animals are similarly adapted, and are mostly arthropods. A commonly domesticated animal is the Chull, a type of giant hermit crab with a heavy shell. Other animals include Axehounds (crablike dogs), Whitespines (wild predators), and Santhids (giant, passive ocean-dwellers). Most impressively are the Greatshells, in particular Chasmfiends, colossal beasts that are hunted for the large gemstones they contain.  Drawing of a Chasmfiend Besides affecting the local life, Highstorms also bring with them Stormlight, a magic light that fills gemstones left out in the storm, causing them to glow. This light can be used by Fabrials, magic devices that can do things like change an object\u2019s material or absorb or give off heat. Stormlight can also be absorbed for use in magic by Surgebinders, but the practice has been dead for thousands of years. Another unique aspect of the world are the Spren. Spren are small spirits that inhabit everything and are attracted by specific emotions or aspects of the world. For example, a person in great pain can attract painspren, which appear as twisty orange shapes coming out of the ground. Small, teardrop shaped rainspren may appear in puddles when it rains. Flamespren dance around candles and fires. I have one more thing I\u2019d like to mention, and that\u2019s Shardbearers. Shardbearers are warriors (usually nobility) that possess a set of Shardplate and/or a Shardblade. Shardplate is a nearly-indestructible suit of armor that grants increased strength and agility to the wearer. Shardblades are huge, lightweight swords that cut easily through solid stone and everything else, except other shardblades and Shardplate. When cutting through living things, they phase through the flesh but slice through the soul, leaving the body intact but killing the limb or person they cut through. Obviously a Shardbearer is a force to be reckoned with in battle, and because the technology of Shard creation has been lost, there is only a fixed number in the world.  Full Shardbearers, with plate and blade Here in this answer I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of this world. I haven't even mentioned the parshendi or other races, or delved into the multi-thousand year history of the planet, but I\u2019ll stop there. Suffice it to say, it's an awesome setting that I could read about all day, even without a story accompanying. But the best part? The fact that there are still eight books on the way. Brandon Sanderson has written two, with plans for a ten-book series. The third should come out sometime next year. ",
