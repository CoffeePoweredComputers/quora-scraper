            "answer_text": "Coca-Cola in Mexico and other parts of latin America, as I understand it, uses real cane sugar, Coca-Cola in the United States doesn\u2019t. Corn sweetener, or high-fructose corn sugar, replaced cane sugar sometime back in the 1980s. (though I can\u2019t say this with authority, or certainty) As a result, fans of cane-sugar sweetened Coke can find imported bottles of Coke, in some locations, including Latin markets, and certain restaurants. I used to enjoy the Cokes in Mexican restaurants, when I lived in the U.S., if bottled Coca Cola from Mexico was available. Coca-Cola in Japan is pretty amazing, there is more variety and experimentation, things that aren\u2019t available in the U.S., or are tested here first, then introduced in the U.S. As a result, Japan has a rather colorful variety of Coke products, both in their speciality flavors, and packeting and labeling innovations. More artistic, inventive, and fun. I used to post updates about Japan\u2019s Coke varieties, bottle and can designs, on my Asian-centric blog. motto.media - search results for \u201ccoca cola\u201d  Note that Coca Cola has bottling plants all over the world, and different regions have slightly different levels of, and types of, sugar. There are lots of other differences, too, this is just one I\u2019m aware of. The significant differences in sugar content alone is an interesting example of how soft drink recipes \u2014- for the same brands \u2014 are different around the world. How much sugar is there in a fizzy drink? It depends where you buy it  ",

            "answer_text": "I would say no. My reasoning is that water is the main ingredient. The water in the Midwest is different from the water in the southwest. \u2018What ever gets in to water, never fully comes back out.\u2019 Talk with anyone in the food and beverage world, and you will hear that water makes the difference. For example, Chicago are is host to many places that offer \u2018Beef Sandwiches\u2019. They try to expand to other regions, and have a hard time because of the water. A friend of mine is a water specialist. The quote above is from him. He makes his living from precise advice on water. Some of the best brewers I have sold labels to, know the mineral composition of their water intimately. They always say \u2018Water is the main ingredient.\u2019 If you start with good water, the beer of being a good beer. Water counts. Water is different by region. Since it is expensive to ship liquids, a beverage made in two geographies is bound to be different. Consider why what you consume in a Coca Cola can seem the same. Caramel is a powerful flavor. Powerful flavors are used to mask bad tasting medicines. Which is why you have \u2018Cherry\u2019, \u2018Berry\u2019, and other flavored cough medicines. So people can choke it down and feel relief. The game to copy Coca Cola is pointless. You are better just making a good product and giving it a great name. When you are drinking a Coca Cola, you are drinking the brand. It is one of the most recognizable brands on the planet. The Coca Cola from region to region could be the same. But I would bet it is made with different water. So it's a different drink. Same brand, but a different drink product. ",
