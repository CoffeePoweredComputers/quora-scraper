In this letter you will tell her that you have stolen a can of pringles from her house. And she will fall in love with you if she ever wants these Pringles back in one piece \u2026.? Or\u202652 pieces\u2026not like a soggy ball of pringles...i think thats how they make Bri Cheese- No\u2026cows\u2026oh, the cow chews the pringles\u2026so stupid. They're still watching you dude. Make it count...theyre invested now. Tell her if she doesnt want her Pringles crushed\u2026she will find you of adequate suitor type as well. Look little homie\u2026all I know is no chick is gonna allow a whole can of pringles to turn to crumbs. Its failproof Ok I'll be honest\u2026I'm kinda phoning it in here. 600 questions answered\u2026I needed to play. All work and no play\u2026ah nm thats way before you. Ok\u2026litterally be honest\u2026be vauge, leave alittle room for interpretation both to weasle away if you need and to not have your letter become a post on Facebook if it turns out shes an ice queen. If you make it short, its got more running time. Time for her to think on and ponder\u2026change her mind..be all in and crushin on you too. Thats the ultimate happy is when you write heart and love responds. You dont tell her about your inflated visions of how you see her, no dreaming about her nightly, definately nothing else nightly in her thought.\u2026but its acceptable to leave a couple compliments and an \u201con the nose\u201d over-statement if you can make it funny. Do not tell her shes the only one. You should think of this in two letters b. Try one letter expressing intrest.. And that you think shes beautiful...and since you would memorize everything they say, go ahead and say your intrested in getting to know her. You wanna be knowledgable this goes either really really well, kinda awkward, or sorta bad. Now if your an adult and this is for the misses\u2026let us know. I'll write the same thing at 3 different grades to suite closest to yalls dialect or overtly the attic and whimsical ",

If you are bit nervous to express than have a couple of discussions on some other world topics (weather,movies,any kind of books) than you ask him about the love and than you express yours whether he has a good or bad opinion on love .your presentation is important than his feelings so that he should say me too\u2026 ",
