            "answer_text": "When you write in first person, you are an unreliable narrator. You can only write what your character knows, thinks or guesses. You can\u2019t tell the reader what any other character knows. And as you are writing first person, it\u2019s pretty much stream of consciousness. Just as you don\u2019t think, \u201cI\u2019m going to meet Jenny, who I first met when we were in first grade and I liked her lunch box and she pulled my braids\u201d you can\u2019t write it. Your first person character can only think the sort of thing you would think, which is likely to be, \u201cI hope Jenny remembers that tenner she owes me.\u201d Writing first person is actually a great tool to avoid infodumps and exposition. Make the most of it. ",

If you are writing fiction from a first person perspective of a character then you can write only what the character has experienced or heard or been told. ",
