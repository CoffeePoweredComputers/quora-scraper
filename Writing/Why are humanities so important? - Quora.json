            "answer_text": "In May 2017, experts, think tank leaders, academics, political leaders, Nobel laureates and young global changers met at an international summit, organized by the Global Solutions Think 20 group in Berlin, to discuss global policies in view of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals within common narrative. I was there as a young global changer representing my country. On the second day, when one of the panels finished, I found my way across the crowd of faceless red and yellow tags to the stage. A group of people had already gathered around one of the speakers. Everyone wanted a minute of his time. I waited until the crowd of curious young changers started to spread to ask my question. But the speaker was on a hurry, so I offered to accompany him on the way out. We were walking in the hallway. To the left, informative boards described policy briefs and recommendations for the G20. \u201cIn your opinion, how could we advance education to face 21st century challenges?\u201d I asked. His answer left no room for uncertainty. He said with a deep confident voice: \u201cBring back the humanities, the Ancient Greek Literature, the Renaissance, the expressionism\u2026\u201d Earlier on the panel, he deplored the loss of heroism in the educational system. In the hallway, he underlined a solution: humanities. The speaker defended the importance of reading to get inspired: it is by reading books and being curious and engaging in discoveries that youth can recreate idols and values. It is in the humanities that they can find the inspiration to face 21st century challenges. The person\u2019s name is Edmund Phelps. He is the winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. His seminal work is about information imbalance in employment determination and price-wage dynamics. And yet, what he finds as life-saving for our educational system is human sciences, and most importantly, their power to inspire and drive change. ",

            "answer_text": "Humanities is one of the most underrated streams of all. It is a common myth, well circulated among the Indian psyche, that the Arts/Humanities (though these both are different sections but yet some Indian sentiments prefer it to consider alike or same) streams is for students who are \u201cnot smart enough\u201d for studying either Science or Commerce. Meaning of Humanities: Defining humanities is a difficult task. However, it can be said in a few words that it is an academic discipline which deals with the study of the \u2018Human Condition\u2019, utilizing methodologies that are usually analytical, critical or speculative. The wide range of subjects that come under the umbrella term of Humanities range from history, languages, literature, law, philosophy, religion, performing arts, anthropology, communication, sociology, psychology and many more. Choosing the Humanities stream after Class 10 would enable a student to choose a career from a range spanning a wide area. Subjects that are available for study in the CBSE class 11 syllabus are History, Geography, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, English, Hindi and Sanskrit. Humanities help us understand others through their languages, histories and cultures. They foster social justice and equality. And they reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual and intellectual sense of the world. The humanities teach empathy. They teach us to deal critically and logically with subjective, complex, imperfect information. And they teach us to weigh evidence skeptically and consider more than one side of every question. Humanities students build skills in writing and critical reading. It also encourage us to think creatively. They teach us to reason about being human and to ask questions about our world. The humanities develop informed and critical citizens. Without the humanities, democracy could not flourish. I hope, this is enough for your search for a worth an answer :). Thank you ! ",
