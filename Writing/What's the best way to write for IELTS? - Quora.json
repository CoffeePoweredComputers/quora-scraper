Many children find the subject of science less inspiring and relevant to their lives as they move from primary to secondary school. How do you think they can be encouraged to study science? The need to foster scientific literacy among young children is driven by a multitude of factors ranging from the growing understanding and recognition of the power of children\u2019s early thinking and learning to its potential to build a basis for future scientific understanding. In my opinion, advertising on the media and school programmes would be ideal in developing a keen interest for the study of science among young people. To begin with, television is an effective medium of mass communication that can be harnessed to instill a sense of interest among the young population to study science. If the television gave more importance to scientists who dedicated their lives to research and discovery of resources that improved our living standards instead of focusing on the lives of movie or sports stars, it would definitely change the direction of their attention to the mysteries of science. Similarly, schools can invest more time in conducing practical classes with experimental activities. This wold make the science courses much more appealing to all the students. Engaging in these practical sessions will not only be an outlet for relieving the stress of student life but fire their imagination improving the likelihood of further exploration and innovation on their own. To summarise, it is undoubtedly important to encourage young people to develop a curiosity about life around them from an early age. There is no more effective way to achieve this than to educate young people about the work of a scientist and how important his contributions to the world are. (252 words)  ",

            "answer_text": "The essay type questions for are usually asking about some general thing in society. The topic could be education, health, age, gender roles, the youth, the environment... basically anything. Therefore, you cannot learn an amazing sentence that you can insert into an essay, as it is very unlikely that you will be able to use it in your specific question that you have on the day of your test. However, there is a system to use that gives you a great balanced structure which will help you get a good mark for answering the question... which is after all the whole point of this task - answer the question! Lots of IELTS candidates do not actually do this, as they are trying to impress the examiner with big posh words and forget to focus on actually giving a point of view and supporting that opinion with good examples and clear thought. STEP 1: INTRODUCTION Repeat the question in your own words In the essay introduction, you should start by repeating the question. This does NOT mean that you should COPY the question. You should say the question again, but using different words that mean the same thing (synonyms). For example, if your question was something like: Some people believe that capital punishment should never be used. Others believe that it could be used for the most serious crimes. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Then the opening sentence of your introduction should use synonyms to say the question again in your own words. for example: It is a commonly held belief that the death penalty is a Draconian penalty and not appropriate in modern society. However, there is also an argument that the most despicable crimes should have this most severe of punishments. Now, don't worry about the high level of the example sentences above. I am a native English speaker and I am an English teacher, so the sentences should be good, shouldn't they? But, from the example, you can see that it is possible to re-write the question using completely different vocabulary and still retain the original meaning and 'flavour' of the original question. Give your opinion As soon as you have restated the question, then give your opinion on the subject. This gives the examiner an overview of what is to come in your essay. It is important to note that it does not matter what your opinion is! There is no right or wrong answer to an IELTS essay question. You do NOT have to try and think \"What will the examiner think is the right answer here\". The examiner is only interested in the level of your English. So just give your first instinct opinion and don't try to out-think yourself. STEP 2: Support your opinion Now that you have given your opinion, you need to back it up. The best way to do this is to give examples. You can begin this paragraph with phrases like: Personally, I believe that...From my point of view...I am convinced that...In my opinion...In my view...So, if your opinion was that you are against capital punishment, then as an example you could write about situations where people have been jailed for life for murder and then decades later they have been released as they were proven to be innocent. The relevant vocabulary here is \"a miscarriage of justice\". Your argument would be that when a miscarriage of justice occurs, the prisoner would most likely have faced the death penalty and would have been killed even though they were innocent. Another example could be that many murders are committed in 'hot blood' and often as an 'act of passion'.. This means that the murder was so angry about something that they were not thinking properly STEP 3: Give the other side of the argument In your next paragraph, you should look at the question from the opposite viewpoint to yours. This shows the examiner that you have balance in your writing and it is a sign of a good essay. You can start this paragraph with phrases such as: It can also be argued that...Someone who held the opposing view would say that...However, there is also another side to this discussion.In contrast, some people hold the view that...STEP 4: Conclusion - Summarise your opinion To finish off your IELTS task 2 essay, you need to summarise your whole argument as a conclusion. Essentially, this means that you give your opinion again that you stated in the introduction. To prove to the IELTS examiner that you have a good command of English vocabulary you should try again to use synonyms and not just copy your previous sentence. Now, you can add your expanded arguments (from step 2) into your opinion. A conclusion that weighs up the arguments already mentioned is a really good opportunity to use a conditional sentence. ",
