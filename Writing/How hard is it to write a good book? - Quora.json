            "answer_text": "There\u2019s an unwritten rule that published authors are supposed to encourage everyone who dreams of it to finally go for it and write that book! Except that\u2019s just not true. Many of the people who want to write a book\u2026should not. Why not? Is their idea that bad? Well\u2026sometimes their book idea is really bad, yes, but just as often the idea is pretty brilliant. And sometimes an idea many people think is really stupid turns out to be brilliant to a lot of other people (e.g. 50 Shades of Grey sold 100 million copies and I thought it was unreadable). It\u2019s not about the idea for the book. It\u2019s about the motivation behind the book. People should not write a book if they\u2019re doing it for the wrong reasons. When someone asks me if they should write a book, I always ask these questions: \u201cWhy do you want to write a book? What are you hoping to get from it?\u201d There are many good answers to that question. Some examples: \u201cI think it would help other people.\u201d \u201cI want to establish myself as an authority in this subject, and raise my visibility.\u201d \u201cI am starting a business around this topic and want to generate interest and clients.\u201d \u201cI really care about this and want to get the word out to other people.\u201d \u201cI want to switch careers and this will help me.\u201d If I hear anything close to that, I encourage them to move forward. There are so many great reasons to record and share your ideas with the world through a book, I wish more people did that (in fact, I believe so much in books that I started a company to help people easily turn their ideas into books). So what are the wrong reasons to write a book? Bad Reason #1: \u201cI want to sell millions of books and make a lot of money.\u201d I hate to be the one to crush your dreams, but the odds that it will sell even a 100,000 copies are so vanishingly small they are essentially zero. Last year, there were about 300,000 books published\u2013just in America. According to BookScan, only about 200 books per year reach a 100,000 copies sold. That means you have, statistically, about a 0.07% chance of selling one-tenth of a million, much less a million. The number that reach 1 million sold is even fewer, probably close to 10. And virtually no book does more than that. In fact, the list of books that have sold 10 million copies in history is so small there is a Wikipedia page about them. The return on time invested for authors is horrendous when you measure it in terms of the expected value of book sales. It\u2019s basically the same thing as saying that your retirement strategy is to \u201cplay the lottery.\u201d Yeah, someone has to win the lottery, but your lifetime ROI on that investment strategy is probably going to be negative. In fact, your odds of winning most lotteries are better than selling a million books. You are not going to sell millions of copies and get rich from book sales, and if you write a book for that reason, you\u2019ll be disappointed. That\u2019s the bad news. What\u2019s The Better Version Of This Goal? The good news is that a book can make you a money, if you look at it from a totally different perspective. Instead of trying to get rich by selling millions of copies, if you look at a book as a way to generate attention for your other endeavors, then the path to profit can become wide and smooth. For example, if you have some skill or knowledge that is very valuable to people, the best way to build a consultancy and sell that knowledge is by writing a book that shows what you know. This establishes you as an authority and gives you credibility to sell your services (and charge a premium), as well as giving you a consistent pipeline of people looking for the exact type of skill and experience you offer. This is using a book to make money, but doing it an indirect way. It\u2019s using the book as a platform to promote something else, especially something expensive and profitable (and usually hard to promote, like consulting skills). You can think of the book as a business card, or general marketing material. The fact is, books not only possess a credibility that very few marketing materials do, they are a great way to differentiate yourself in crowded fields, and a great way to find people who have the exact problems that you can solve, and connect with them. How does that happen? Well, one way: Amazon is the 3rd largest search engine in the world, and the largest search engine for professionals. Think about it\u2013how many times have you had a problem, and tried to solve it by finding a book about it? Well, what if you were the person who wrote the book on how to solve that problem? Then you\u2019re going to get all those people coming to you. This doesn\u2019t work for everyone, but does work really well for companies, entrepreneurs, coaches, consultants, and even certain types of executives (here\u2019s a really good example of this). Bad Reason #2: \u201cI want to be a famous, bestselling author.\u201d Everyone wants to be famous, and some people think a book will make them famous. I\u2019ve already explained why rich won\u2019t happen (except indirectly), and the worse news is that a book is even less likely to make you famous than rich. Yes, yes, there are famous authors. But far fewer than you think. In fact, there are only about 15 or 20 (living) people who are famous ONLY for writing (and nothing else). Malcolm Gladwell is one. J.K. Rowling is another. You can probably name 5 more. But probably not 10 more, and definitely not 20 more. Start naming famous writers, and you\u2019ll realize quickly that 80% or more of your list are dead (Hemingway, Twain, Lee, Tolkien, etc). The fact is, writers are just not celebrities in America anymore. In fact, it goes the other way around in most cases; people get famous for something else first, THEN they write a book that becomes a bestseller. Being famous is usually why their book sells; they don\u2019t get famous from their book. Here\u2019s the worst part of getting fame from books: hitting a best seller list does NOT mean you will become famous. Just like having the line \u201cThese pretzels are making me thirsty\u201d in a small indie movie isn\u2019t putting you on the cover of People, having a book that spends a week or two on the New York TimesBestseller list does not mean you\u2019re famous. It barely gets you any attention at all. Here\u2019s a fun game that shows this: What\u2019re your three favorite books? Were any of those books bestsellers? When I ask this of people, there\u2019s usually a stunned silence, and then the inevitable answer, \u201cWow. Yeah\u2026I have no idea.\u201d Because being a bestseller has virtually no bearing on the fame or impact of a book! There are thousands of books that hit the bestseller list for a week and no one reads or hears about them again, and yet many of the most impactful books in the world have never been bestsellers (e.g. Man\u2019s Search For Meaninghas sold 10 million copies, and was never on a best seller list). It\u2019s true; not only do books almost never make you famous, even having a bestselling book won\u2019t make you famous! [And this is not even getting to the issue that most \u201cbestselling author\u201d claims are meaningless.] What\u2019s The Better Version Of This Goal? Ask yourself: why do you care if your book is a bestseller? If it\u2019s just for the status\u200a\u2014\u200ajust so you can brag to people at parties\u200a\u2014\u200athen you need to re-examine your goal. You\u2019re only doing this for ego reasons, and nothing else, and quite frankly, there are much easier, cheaper ways to get an ego boost than spending a year writing a book and then a ton of time and money promoting it. But, if all you want is the recognition and validation that comes from making a contribution to the world, that is TOTALLY doable, and a book is a great way to both give to the world AND get recognized for that giving. The problem comes with the thinking that being a bestselling author is the measure of your book\u2019s contribution to the world. If you reframe your goal from, \u201cI want to be a famous bestselling author,\u201d to something that is closer to what you actually want, like, \u201cI want my book to make an impact on lives and get some recognition for that,\u201d then it does two things: It makes the goal very achievable, andIt actually helps you to write a better book.How does it make the book better? Because if your goal is just to help people and be recognized for that, you can almost always teach something to at least a few thousand people that greatly impacts their lives. Doing that might not sell enough copies to be a bestseller, but it will help those people, and they will thank you and recognize you for it. And isn\u2019t that the point? Bad Reason #3: \u201cI want to live the writer\u2019s life.\u201d I think this is summed up perfectly by Hugh Macleod, the awesome cartoonist and author: \u201cA successful book agent I know tells me that at least half the people he meets who are writing their first book, are doing so not because they have anything particularly interesting to say, but because the idea of \u201cthe writer\u2019s life\u201d appeals to them. Tweed jackets, smoking a pipe, sitting out in the gazebo and getting sloshed on Mint Juleps, pensively typing away at an old black Remington. Bantering wittily at all the right parties. Or whatever. Anybody who wants to write books for this reason deserves to suffer. And happily, many of them do.\u201d Doesn\u2019t this seem like so many other things? We all say we want to be rich, lose weight, start a business, etc. But it\u2019s the idea of being rich or skinny or an entrepreneur that\u2019s more appealing than actually doing it. The idea sounds glamorous, and we want glamour. But we don\u2019t get glamour by \u201cliving the writer\u2019s life,\u201d just like we don\u2019t get in shape by wearing the best gym clothes, or get rich by playing the \u201cstartup game.\u201d Glamour is the RESULT of hard work and doing something that other people find valuable. Notice what\u2019s missing when people say that? Actual writing. What\u2019s The Better Version Of This Goal? This is about identity. Who do you want to be? \u201cLiving the writer\u2019s life\u201d is fine, if that\u2019s who you are. But you probably aren\u2019t. Instead, don\u2019t go looking for an identity. Either embrace the identity you have, or work REALLY hard to create the identity you want. This is a long way of saying there is no way to have the privileges and glamour and status of an identity, without doing the work necessary to get that identity. And with a book, this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cliving a writer\u2019s life.\u201d It means authoring a book that other people actually want to read. Bad Reason #4: \u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone thinks, I\u2019m just writing this for myself.\u201d This type of \u201cbook\u201d has a name already: a diary. If this is your goal\u200a\u2014\u200ayes, many people have said this to me, and yes, it\u2019s a perfectly valid goal\u200a\u2014\u200athen consider that all you need to do is write it, but not release it. I\u2019m serious. I have several friends who write just for themselves, and they didn\u2019t do anything with the writing at all. This is perfectly fine. But there\u2019s no reason to publish it. Or even talk about it. If it\u2019s just for you, let it just be for you. You don\u2019t need to do anything else. The point is, this statement is usually a lie authors tell themselves to protect against failure. Many people who say this, then go on to not only publish their writing that was \u201cjust for them\u201d but also make huge efforts to promote it. Why, if it\u2019s just for them? What\u2019s The Better Version Of This Goal? There is none. Just go write it for the reasons you want, and leave it in a drawer, and you\u2019re good. Or, recognize that you DO want recognition for you book, and then focus on writing a book that will be appealing and helpful to other people. Conclusion I fully understand how ironic it is that you\u2019re hearing this advice from an author who actually sold millions of books and got famous from his writing. I did two of the exact two things I\u2019m telling you are almost impossible. But part of the reason I\u2019m telling you this is because I\u2019ve seen both sides, and as much as I would like to think I accomplished those things because I\u2019m special\u2013I\u2019m not. It\u2019s almost certain that I was far more lucky than special. Since my books came out, my agent estimates he\u2019s had 10,000 people pitch him something similar to my writing, \u201cthe new Tucker Max,\u201d \u201cthe black Tucker Max\u201d \u201cthe monk Tucker Max\u201d\u2013the list goes on and on\u2013and never once have any of the books worked or sold anything. The fact is, there was a temporary market for my style of writing, and I just happened to come along at the right time, with the right message, and be the first person to nail what the market was looking for. I was the one person who won that lottery. It\u2019s not like the tens of thousands of other people trying to imitate me have nothing to say. But the reason no one cared about their writing was because they were just chasing my success, instead of saying the unique thing they had to say and focusing on the unique impact of their unique. I hope this didn\u2019t come off as mean. I\u2019m not telling you to not write a book. I\u2019m telling you that if your reason for writing a book is one of these four reasons, you need to stop and really examine what it is you are trying to get, and then re-evaluate what your actual goal is. Because here\u2019s the thing about books: most people don\u2019t want to write a book. They want what they think writing a book will get them. So be clear with yourself about what you want, because a book can get you a lot of great things\u2013but probably not what\u2019s on this list. If you want to get positive results for yourself and your business, you should seriously consider publishing a book. Have you stalled writing your book? You have plenty of ideas you want to put into your book, but can\u2019t find the time. Or maybe you\u2019re frustrated with the writing process. When you seek advice, people tell you, \u201cIt\u2019s all about discipline.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t help you actually write your book. So you never finish your book, and the community you seek to impact never gets the benefits of your wisdom, and you don\u2019t get the benefits of being a published author. ",
