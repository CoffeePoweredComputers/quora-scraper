            "answer_text": "I have a number of ways Including finding professional help and going no contact first of all.While I was healing I identified a number of healing techniques some of them were simple, like walking in the woods, and some of them were spiritual like meditation or yoga, and some of them helped to clear the energy from my body of the negativity from the relationship and the ensuing anxiety that I felt. I\u2019ve listed them elsewhere but I\u2019ll just say that some of them for me were paying attention to my cat, mindfulness, exercise, taking frequent showers and letting go of all the negativity down the drain, self-care, various ways of showing self-love such as taking myself out to dinner, having treats at home, doing something nice for myself like a pedicure or massage, and to get all your emotions out, the love letter technique that I mentioned in my work which is listed under my profile,Is based on John Gray\u2019s book which helps you get out all the emotions and you list everything you\u2019re angry about, everything you\u2019re sad about, basically you just go through the whole relationship and list everything that you\u2019re upset about. It\u2019s very cathartic. I also used the tapping technique or emotional freedom technique which helped me with insomnia, pain, and anxiety.I have a number of such healing techniques and they worked for me. ",
