            "answer_text": "No, it is not normal. I am assuming the kind of paper you are chewing while studying is the one with rulings. Therefore, you are also chewing some ink with the paper and if not ink, then some fillers like talc, clay or calcium carbonate. Although they are not harmful but still, I believe that replacing paper with a chewing gum could be a more sensible option. ",
