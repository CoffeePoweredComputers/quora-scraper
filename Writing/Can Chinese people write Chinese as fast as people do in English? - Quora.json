            "answer_text": "I like this question. First, I\u2019d point out that the need for speedy handwriting has virtually disappeared from most Chinese people\u2019s everyday life - at least, Chinese people of my generation. With rare exceptions, typing on a keyboard or a mobile device is how we need to put something into \u201cwriting\u201d nowadays. When we do need to write, the answer to this question depends on HOW you write. The short answer is that, writing out each character the exact way you see it in print is very slow, but most people don\u2019t do it that way. There are three styles of Chinese writing that are commonly learned and used by Chinese when we hand-write.  (1) \u6977\u4e66 (k\u01cei sh\u016b), or standard style. This is what everyone learns as pupils of the language. It takes about four to six years of formal schooling to master the first 3000 or so characters, at which point one is considered literate. Up to this point, you only learn to write in this style. Although it helps with the mastery of radicals and formations of each character, it is painfully slow! You can\u2019t possibly write fast because each stroke is separate from another. This means you lift the tip of your pen when you finish one stroke, and move it to a new stroke, something very time-consuming no matter how proficient you are. The sentence in the picture above, \u6211\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba (I am a Chinese), has five characters containing 31 strokes. (2) \u884c\u4e66 (x\u00edng sh\u016b), or walking style. This is a much faster, and much better-looking style in my opinion. It allows for much smoother transitions between stokes because the tip of the pen doesn\u2019t necessarily leave the paper between strokes. Most people use some variation of the walking style. It speeds up the writing, but the writing would be still legible for the most part. (3) \u8349\u4e66 (c\u01ceo sh\u016b), or running style. If you have to read others\u2019 writing every day (I hate it when I have to), this is your nightmare. It is faster than the walking style, but if poorly written, the characters can be extremely difficult to identify. In the spirit of scientific experiment, I just did some quick tests on myself. When I type Chinese using Sogou Pinyin (\u641c\u72d7\u62fc\u97f3) input method, I can be up to 90 characters per minute. The test I used was \u5728\u7ebf\u6253\u5b57\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08dazi.kukuw.com\uff09 On a smartphone, I guess my speed would be roughly 40 to 60 words per minute (didn\u2019t do an experiment to test this one though). Our typing speed also depends on the material: clear sentence structures and basic vocabulary would allow for more accurate predictions of characters, saving the time otherwise spent on manually selecting characters. I then tried hand-writing the same text in the walking style, and finished exactly 40 characters in one minute. Not bad! But given how ugly it looks, it\u2019s probably not something that I\u2019m comfortable submitting to my boss. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh Yes, when Chinese writes in cursive simplified Chinese and uses Chinese idiom, it can be a lot faster than writing in English. Chinese can be simplified both in writing and in meaning. Take the ancient Chinese literature \u201cThe Art of War\u201d by Sun Tzu for example: The Art of War only has 6074 Chinese Characters in total. When translated into English, the book is usually over 200 pages, which means at least over 60,000 words in English. \u6253\u8349\u60ca\u86c7; Stomp the grass to scare the snake; Do something unaimed, but spectacular (\"hitting the grass\") to provoke a response of the enemy (\"startle the snake\"), thereby giving away his plans or position, or just taunt him. Do something unusual, strange, and unexpected as this will arouse the enemy's suspicion and disrupt his thinking. More widely used as \"[Do not] startle the snake by hitting the grass\". An imprudent act will give your position or intentions away to the enemy. \u4ee5\u9038\u5f85\u52b3; Wait at leisure while the enemy labors; It is an advantage to choose the time and place for battle. In this way you know when and where the battle will take place, while your enemy does not. Encourage your enemy to expend his energy in futile quests while you conserve your strength. When he is exhausted and confused, you attack with energy and purpose. The idea is to have your troops well-prepared for battle, in the same time that the enemy is rushing to fight against you. This will give your troops a huge advantage in the upcoming battle, of which you will get to select the time and place. \u8d81\u706b\u6253\u52ab; Loot a burning house; When a country is beset by internal conflicts, when disease and famine ravage the population, when corruption and crime are rampant, then it will be unable to deal with an outside threat. This is the time to attack. Keep gathering internal information about an enemy. If the enemy is currently in its weakest state ever, attack it without mercy and totally destroy it to prevent future troubles. Chinese Idiom; 4 Chinese characters can take up to a paragraph of English to translate. An average Chinese knows 500 Common Chinese Idioms. ",

            "answer_text": "I feel like Chinese (characters) is \u201czipped/encoded\u201d information. A lot of information is passed by assuming reader and writer know the context of the express (zip/unzip method). e.g. Chinese history, Chinese idiom, or populate things happening now. English also have some zipped expression, but not frequently used as Chinese. (may have bias due to limited knowledge of English) So simply comparing the writing speed to express same information may be somehow unfair for English. Communicate in Chinese is like zip information (use brain/cpu), write it (hand/IO), read it (eye/IO), and unzip (use brain/cpu) it. Maybe the limit of IO (human writing speed) is similar. The total time spend on passing zipped data (Chinese) will be quicker then passing raw data (English). The disadvantage of Chinese is the zip/unzip need prerequisite knowledge: generally feeling about characters (zip/unzip method) and context knowledge like idiom or newly coined word (expression mapping). If the context (expression mapping) is unknown for a particular expression, it will take extra time to learn it (load it in to the mapping table) at the first time and next time will pick it up from memory (cache). If prerequisite knowledge is not available, Chinese will try to interpret it with generic feeling and existing knowledge, and sometime it could be wrong. e.g. \u201c\u7a7a\u7a74\u6765\u98ce\u201d(kongxuelaifeng, lit. wind from an empty cave.) It means something have a reason, or is real. the context is \u201cwind can be felt near cave/tunnel since the wind is be strengthen by it, so the cave is the reason of the wind\u201d. but if people interpret it with generic feeling, \u201cempty cave\u201d, \u201cwind\u201d will interpret it as rumor, something not real. Interestingly, even if it\u2019s miss used people usually still can understand the writer\u2019s meaning according to context. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very good question which could be easily expanded in to a full-length study of the cost/efficiency analysis on the hand movement in order to express the same amount of information in different languages. And it could also be considered as some kind of study on the coding efficiency. But back to the original question, there is a criteria which is very blurry: On what standard would you consider that the speed of the writing are the same? And they are writing what kind of manuscripts? Since if you just give some random single word or very simple sentences, then the two languages are almost the same when comparing the writing speed, providing that those who take the tests have the equivalent language training and same amount of schooling in their own languages. However, if we are talking about \u201cexpressing the same idea with their own language\u201d, then the harder and more complicated the idea is, the more advantage the Chinese kid has. Since the rules to combine Chinese single characters or short words to forming new words in order to express very complicated ideas are far more flexible and easier than the English can manage. And here is a very amusing piece of evidence to prove my point: Blizzard Permanently Banned 1572 players in China. \u2022 /r/Overwatch the simple sum up of this post is: \"User names can only be 6-12 characters long\" Chinese: Alright, time to write a story. So even when the writing speed of a single word/character could be the same, when it comes to complicated manuscripts, the Chinese language would easily dominate the speed competition. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I can as can many other native Chinese. I\u2019ve been writing Chinese words for um\u2026 15 years or so. So you know, I am a Chinese. You might not know that a Chinese character can not be considered equivalent to an English character. For example, \u201c\u8d70\u201d is one of the simplified-Chinese characters, which means \u201cgo\u201d. Found it? When Chinese mention a Chinese character, they exactly refer to a \u201cword\u201d, which is capable of describing plenty of things and which can be combined with another character to mean something more specific. Whereas when you ask someone for an English character, he may give you an English alphabet! Characters such as \u201ca\u201d, \u201cb\u201d, \u201cc\u201d can singly mean nothing compared to characters like \u201c\u5565\u201d,\u201d\u6765\u201d,\u201d\u53bb\u201d. That\u2019s the difference. You cannot imagine how fast a fluent-Chinese-writer can do without being a Chinese since that results from practice and practice! BTW.. I don\u2019t think it a good idea to compare the Chinese and English versions of poems originally written in Chinese. When you try to translate a language and fully express the origin meaning of that one, you may find that the translated version seems much longer in length or greater in pages, which is normal! When I try to translate an English article into my mother language, Chinese, I meet the same problem. I saw Kelly Li translate the sentences below into these: \"Happiness is the fulfillment of every tiny wish in life. There's food when you want to eat, there's someone to love you when you want to be loved.\"  However, in English, there is another simpler version which means the same: \u201cHappiness is when all your dreams come true, when you never get hungry and when you get all the love you want.\u201d ",

The \u5b8b\u4f53 typeface, the standard typeface in printing, is probably the Chinese characters you have seen, but this typeface is only used in printing, never in handwriting. Therefore it is not a script. It is only a typeface. The \u6977\u4e66 script, the regular script, is the official standard handwritten script. It is not used not only in handwriting, but also in printing. However, almost only Chinese kids write like this. Chinese adults hardly ever write like this, because it is too time-consuming. Some calligraphers may also write like this, as an art of calligraphy. The \u884c\u4e66 script, the semi-cursive script, is widely used by Chinese adults. I also write like this. Almost every native Chinese speaker can understand this script. The \u8349\u4e66 script, the cursive script, is sometimes used by shorthand. [Note: \u8349 means \u6f66\u8349 (scribbled) here, not \u201cgrass\u201d.] Some calligraphers may also write like this as an art of calligraphy. It is written really fast and therefore very few people can understand this scribble. As a native Chinese speaker, I have great difficulty in understanding this script. ",

Especially not compared to what I've seen people do when they write Arabic for example. And I have seen people really rocking it in Japanese so I think Chinese will do too. I also believe this is not only because the sentences need fewer characters, but more because writing is a crucial part of education in China and Japan AFAIK, while it is being treated with less and less attention in Europe with each passing generation. My great grandmother could write very fast and use a very complicated and beautiful font, sort of like this:  source: Neudoerffer Fraktur That was taught at school back then and they had to master it to pass. Mind you she was using quill and ink, so was limited by the speed of the medium, but still was quicker than I am today with a ball pen! My mother had an exquisite handwriting and used to write quickly because she too had her writing marked at school. She didn't have a separate class just for it as my great grandmother did, though. I, on the other hand, went through school with barely touching the subject. As long as my handwriting was legible to the teacher it was a pass. I write slower and my writing is horrid compared to my ancestors. Of course, the same is gradually happening in China too; in the era of computers, handwriting is losing its appeal. But we, in Europe, had this happening for generations, so compared it doesn't surprise me to find that we\u2019d be slower. We are just not well trained to write by hand. ",

            "answer_text": "Stroke wise, yes, it\u2019s not slower or faster. Pretty much the same. Wordwise, well\u2026 maybe you can write longer and more words in english than an average person does in chinese. But then again because of the nature of Chinese language, usually it will take around 50 or 60% less characters to finish the same sentence. As in, 140 characters in a tweet might suffice for a short sentence or two, whereas 140 chinese characters can tell you a short story (or maybe 2!). The summarizing power of chinese characters is amazing. So, concerning each letter, well, yeah, of course it usually takes longer write a hanzi than to write an \u201ca\u201d, a \u201cb\u201d or a \u201cC\u201d, but if you count the total number of strokes in a sentence you\u2019ll be amazed that using the same stroke speed for both languages, it\u2019s faster in chinese. Compare: I\u2019m hungry *(Roughly 15 strokes, depending on how you write it) \u201d with chinese \u201c\u6211\u997f\u4e86\u201d 19 strokes. Again, strokewise similar, but 3 characters vs 10 in english. And another one:\u897f\u4e1c\u5357\u5317 = 4 chars, 25 strokes West East South North = 21 chars (spaces DO count), around 30 strokes (again, depends on how you tipe, cursive or not, caps or not. But you get the idea. So yeah, usually writing in chinese it\u2019s a bit faster, you save space, and you can compress your thoughts and take notes or jot down stuff as fast as any other language. In traditional chinese the tradeoff is not as-effective, but still, when we write for ourselves, we simplify strokes and draw lines faster, so it becomes even faster. ",

Take the sentence \"I want some instant noodle\" for example. \u6211\u60f3\u8981\u5403\u4e00\u9ede\u6ce1\u9eb5\u3002 \u6211\u60f3\u8981\u5403\u4e00\u70b9\u65b9\u4fbf\u9762\u3002 Notice the third character and the last one (we use different terms for instant noodle, \u6ce1\u9eb5 for TC and \u65b9\u4fbf\u9762 for SC), and even with one more character in SC, you can see how SC users might be able to write just as fast in Chinese. I do know how to write some of the characters in SC, and use them frequently in informal writing, but even if I'm a skilled SC user, I still don't see how I can write Chinese as fast as English. Both type of Chinese characters requires more precise strokes, you can speed up but only this much before the words becomes difficult to decipher (the main reason why most of my notes taken in a rush are a mixture of TC, SC and English. Lol) And it took years\u2014did I say years? Sorry, by years I meant more than a decade, before I could write at a reasonable speed (my handwriting also improved a lot overtime), so don't beat yourself up if you think you're writing too slow\u2014I can assure you, native users have it worse, it's just that people often overlook the ridiculous amount of time we spent over \"practicing every freaking single character\".  (Edited) I scrolled through some answers and realized that many people took \"phrasing\" and \"the time spent on organizing words\" and \" how often you write in Chinese versus English\" etc. into consideration. I can't really answer on that point , though. My native language is, indeed, Chinese (/Mandarin), but began to learn English at a very young age, around five I guess, and if I have to classify myself, I'd say I'm bilingual. I also write a lot in English (when I write down fic ideas or fanfic drabbles with pen, I prefer English; simply because it's faster and the logic behind English is more direct. Plus creative writing is all about 'the flow': the faster you get things down the more natural they sound), which probably explains why I can write fast\u2014very fast with English. I can fill up a A5 notebook in five minutes at top speed. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, a few Chinese words can speak a line(s) of English. By design, there are tens of thousands of Chinese words and thousands that are commonly used, even now. A lot of answers here have elaborated on this point. That means, we don\u2019t have to be fast, Chinese are inherently faster in some cases, if not all. Secondly, Chinese characters typing can be terribly fast. That means in cyber world, we are even faster. For example, pinyin uses at most 6 characters per word and Cangjie input method takes at most 5 characters per word. As Hong-Kongers, we do use Traditional Chinese(\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587). It is even more complicated than/ Simplified Chinese that most Westerners recognize as \u201cChinese Language\u201d (in fact it isn\u2019t that simple). And when you have some backgrounds of both Western and Chinese/Japanese Calligraphy(\u66f8\u6cd5/\u66f8\u9053), you will find Chinese writing extremely practical and fast in a lot of cases, just like other answers. I don\u2019t repeat answers regarding Simplified Chinese because most of Quora users come from backgrounds with Simplified Chinese as their mother language (don\u2019t get confused with the concept of mother tongue) Back to the topic, Chinese scripting can be as fast as English scripting to convey the same message, even when we are using the complicated, Traditional Chinese, in many cases. Last but not least, Chinese is a completely different language system that has little intersection with Western languages, you may find it a bit difficult to understand the answers. ",

This is also the essencial reason that doctors are required to write fast on the patient\u2019s document cuz it makes a barrier for the bad guys to offense others privacy. To teachers, if they encounter some paper work with terrible characters, they directly give poor marks. If we meet some characters written fast which is cursive and hard to understand, we try to skip them hahha or straight up ask the writer. Many Chinese people will make a judgement of a stranger he hasnt known much in his heart from ones characters. Supposing that I write good-looking characters. When people who dont know me see my characters, most probably they think i am good girl, maybe having a pretty face, maybe kind or nice, maybe elegant. This is the first impression i left them on the first place. Sadness is, i am not as good as what they think even i do write good-looking characters. Well it makes sense always. So keep practising write good-looking characters hahha. ",

            "answer_text": "I can write and text much faster in Chinese than I can in English. This is because I am able to use IME (Input Method Editors) to input Pinyin leading consonants for frequently used phrases. For example, \u201czmy\u201d can be entered to get \u600e\u4e48\u6837. (zen3 me5 yang4), which means \u201chow about that?\u201d or similar. A common phrase that takes 4 keystrokes maximum, three typically, because I can simply go on to the next word if the offered Chinese characters are the ones I want. Usually that is true. When not true, I have to select a number, typically between 1 and 8, which is the set of Chinese characters I want. Another example, after doing some tree trimming, I wanted to write the characters \u780d\u6811 (kan3 shu4), which means trim the tree. However, \u201cks\u201d will almost always offer \u770b\u4e66 first (kan4 shu1, to read a book), a much more common expression. So, that was three touches instead of 2. Still, these are faster than typing out the English equivalent. Chinese characters may look complicated, but once you understand the structure and usage and typical usage norms, the day to day utility is amazingly high. It *is* an efficient language. ",

We were talking about the conciseness of Chinese versus English. In Chinese, things can be said (and written!) more compactly. In face, by one study, Chinese is the most compact language in the world. Of course, this is not my study so don\u2019t interrogate me on that. It does make sense though, since the grammar is simple and many Chinese use concise idioms to express their meaning. My Chinese friends also write in quick, \u201ccursive\u201d Chinese that is much faster than the formal writing process they learn in school. I\u2019m not there yet, but hope to be one day! My written Chinese has come a long way since I began the process. Writing in Chinese takes dedication, but learning the pattern and structure of strokes is more intuitive than I thought. I\u2019m still not anywhere near as able to write as quickly as I can in English. However, I met a few foreign learners in China who said that their written Chinese was catching up to their English. Apparently, due to its structure, Chinese is a bit easier on the hand as well, and my foreign friends reported discomfort when switching back to written English. Interesting!  ",

I am fan of Chinese traditional culture and I believe I am proficient in calligraphy. \u2018You should believe me, that is the truth! that is the truth! \u2019, something like the Trump\u2019s words, ha-ha. All right, let me answer your question seriously. For many Chinese especially who use pen to write for too long years rather than the keyboard, they can write as quickly as someone say a sentence. I have met a person who was engaged in secretary and I was surprised at his writing speed. He can write down any thing you said. All I said above is my answer, thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you define \u2018fast\u2019. Do you mean the time used writing the same number of words (characters in Chinese)? Or do you mean expressing the same idea(s) regardless of word count? Ancient Chinese poems could use 20 characters to express meaning that may take more than 200 English words to do the same. Speaking of writing itself, there is an interesting fact. Same as English, as early as in the Han Dynasty (206 BC\u2013220 AD) the ancient Chinese invented \u2018cursive\u2019 forms (as shown in the picture below) of writing to improve the speed of writing. If you can learn to write in these, you can go pretty fast. But unfortunately, most modern Chinese people don\u2019t know how to write like this unless they are calligraphers. And what\u2019s happening in the world is happening in China as well - young people\u2019s handwriting skills are getting worse and worse when they type way more than they write.

            "answer_text": "A lot of answers here are excellent already. I'm just here to summarize: - It's true that Chinese characters can be more cumbersome to write, than English. - But the Chinese language can be written in a staggeringly concise manner, hence makes up for the disadvantage. For example, compare the length of the two sentences: EN vs CN: English words have fewer strokes per word, but Chinese characters pack more information per character, making them shorter. \u82f1\u8bed\u5355\u8bcd\u6bcf\u8bcd\u7b14\u753b\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u6587\u6c49\u5b57\u6bcf\u5b57\u5305\u542b\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u66f4\u77ed\u3002 Get it? Chinese sentences are often shorter, and more dense. It compensates for the complexity of writing individual characters. So, I'd say, Chinese and English in handwriting are more or less equally effective. It sounds reasonable, no?  The sad truth is that, if you type on a modernized digital device, with some (a lot of) help from the input method: Chinese language efficiency would have butchered English language efficiency, by a large margin.  Imagine trying to write those characters using a pen on paper. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a native Chinese, and I don't agree with most of the answers so far. Generally, if your English is good enough, even compare with CAOSHU( sloppy writing in Chinese), writing in English is faster. And there is also a special English writing, kind of like sloppy writing. I've seen my American friends taking notes with such fast writing style. And I just did a simple experiment. I wrote \u201ceconomy, culture, politics\u201d and \u201c\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff0c\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u653f\u6cbb\u201d as fast as I can, separately. I took about 6s in English version and 7s in Chinese version. You can argue that my experiment is objective and probably stupid, so please try it yourself. And try some simple words. The beauty of Chinese is not at its easy-writing, but its structure and meaning. In conclusion, writing English is faster, although I cannot give you a precise statistic research. If anyone needs it, I can google some papers to prove my point. ",

There is a partically kind of writing called cursive writting\u2014\u2014 a chinese calligraphy where characters executed swiftly and with strokes flowing together. this simplylization in writing helpe us to save a lot of time. There is another that Chinese character are rich in content. This is pretty much clearly that if you write down a passage in both Chinese and English with exactly the same meaning. The Chinese content are more likely to be the shorter one. HERE is a vivid example about The Star-Spangled Banner and its modern chinese version: Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof thru the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? \u54e6\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u770b\u89c1\uff0c\u900f\u8fc7\u4e00\u7ebf\u66d9\u5149\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u7740\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u53d1\u51fa\u6b22\u547c\u7684\u58f0\u6d6a\uff1f \u8c01\u7684\u9614\u6761\u660e\u661f\uff0c\u5192\u7740\u4e00\u591c\u70ae\u706b\uff0c\u4f9d\u7136\u8fce\u98ce\u62db\u5c55\uff0c\u5728\u6211\u519b\u7889\u5821\u4e0a\uff1f \u706b\u70ae\u95ea\u95ea\u53d1\u5149\uff0c\u70b8\u5f39\u8f70\u8f70\u4f5c\u54cd\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u90fd\u662f\u89c1\u8bc1\uff0c\u56fd\u65d7\u5b89\u7136\u65e0\u6059\u3002 \u4f60\u770b\u661f\u6761\u65d7\u4e0d\u662f\u8fd8\u9ad8\u9ad8\u98d8\u626c\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u81ea\u7531\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u52c7\u58eb\u7684\u5bb6\u4e61\uff1f ",

            "answer_text": "Well, from my point of view, we can definitely write as soon as you write English, and even faster. First, we are accustomed to the Chinese letters. We write them everyday since we were children. Second, the Chinese students have a lot of homework every day, and even during the holidays. Let me set an example, I am a 10 grader in Shanghai. And in the last year, when I was a 9 grader, I have to take a entrance examination for senior high schools. The higher scores we get, the better schools we can study in. So the parents in China pay high attention on it. And how can we get higher scores? In China, by finishing papers. In the last year, we finish papers every day. And every Tuesday and Thursday from 12.00 to 19.00, there are plenty of papers waiting for us to finish. If we want to go home earlier, we have to finish them as soon as possible. And in the daily life of students, we have plenty of homework. The sooner we finish them, the earlier we can sleep or watch TV. Under such pressure, we can write very fast. ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to disagree with most answers that say Chinese is faster. Firstly, most of the answers are comparing Simplified Chinese to English vocabulary of Latin and French decent. Most of us forget that English is a Germanic language, whose lexicon is much more simple. Also, in Chinese, some simple concepts are written in complex characters. For instance, the Chinese of I is \u6211. The Chinese of leave is \u96e2\u958b. The Chinese of Math is \u6578\u5b78. Secondly, not only Chinese has idioms. Being this is the internet, a lot of answers are written by Chinese people with English as an second language. Of course they know the Chinese idioms but not the English one. For instance, the Chinese of \"smoking gun\" is \u9435\u8b49. The Chinese of \"get over\" is \u6e21\u904e. To be fair, English and Chinese is similar in speed. Every language has some words that are shorter than the same meaning in another language. ",

How fast can I write? I have to finish this punishment from 12:00 to 14:00, or I\u2019d be punished by my Chinese teacher again. She used to slap our face for making nosie in the classroom. (Actually only one of two kids talked on that day. She was good at teaching, so we forgave her ruthless behaviors) In order not to face my teacher in her office, I exerted myself to writing this without going to the washroom or having anything to eat just before the deadline. 1000 chinese characters in 2 hours. Now you can calculate the speed. I found this pic from the Internet. Sorry for the ad on it.  ",

            "answer_text": "There are already so many good answers which i haven\u2019t had time to go through one by one. I hope my answer won\u2019t overlap. Someone here mentions the contrast between the length of nouns in English and Chinese. In that answer, Chinese seems shorter and more simplified. Here I have some other examples to prove the opposite. NBA: \u5168\u7f8e\u7bee\u7403\u534f\u4f1a NASA: \u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u5c40 DNA: \u8131\u6c27\u6838\u7cd6\u6838\u9178 PRC: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd DPRK\uff1a \u671d\u9c9c\u6c11\u4e3b\u4e3b\u4e49\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd So the clincher is, for the abbreviation, both English and Chinese have ways to deal with it. It is just because we deal with this issue in different ways. English uses the initial letters of each word whereas Chinese uses several symbolic characters, such as \u9ad8\u8003 for \u666e\u901a\u9ad8\u7b49\u5b66\u6821\u62db\u751f\u5168\u56fd\u7edf\u4e00\u8003\u8bd5. As for the writing speed, i think it varies from person to person. It is fairly generalistic to argue which one is faster. ",

It include a English version and a Chinese version. I will write this paragraph with English and Chinese separately and record the time they cost. 1.  English Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheek,red  lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will,a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.  1 minute and 43 seconds to wirte this paragraph. 2.  Chinese \u9752\u6625\u4e0d\u662f\u5e74\u534e\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5fc3\u6001\uff1b\u9752\u6625\u4e0d\u662f\u7c89\u9762\u3001\u7ea2\u5507\u3001\u67d4\u671f\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u575a\u5f3a\u7684\u610f\u5fd7\uff0c\u6062\u5f18\u7684\u60f3\u8c61\uff0c\u7099\u70ed\u7684\u604b\u60c5\uff1b\u9752\u6625\u662f\u751f\u547d\u6df1\u6cc9\u7684\u81ea\u5728\u5954\u6d41\u3002  1 mintue and 27 seconds to write this paragraph. The result is obvious that chinese can be written as fast as english and even faster. However, considering that i\u2019am a chinese so the native english may write faster than i have done. Is there any person would like to wtrite this paragraph again? ",

If you have seen an educated Chinese writes characters, you may wonder : why their characters looks different from I've learnt? Oh dear, you should know there is not only one Chinese font. The standard font is \u6b63\u6977. It is tidy and formal, but in daily life we rarely write in \u6b63\u6977. We usually use \u884c\u6977, a kind of font transformed from \u6b63\u6977.\u884c\u6977 writes more quickly and frequently. Examples:(please turn your phone or head)  If we always write in \u6b63\u6977, we must have been dog-tired! ",

I'm not sure if you can call te way one writes a \u201cfont\u201d, but these writing styles are legitimate calligraphy styles of Chinese) such as \u201cXing Kai\u201d(\u201c\u884c\u6977\u201d) and \u201cCao Shu\u201d(\u201c\u8349\u4e66\u201d) which other answers have well explained. Although writing English words may seem a lot easier, English words are made of multiple characters, and Chinese usually has a single character (or two) for the exact same meaning. So on the whole, one single Chinese character may be more complicated than one single English character - or letter - Chinese usually require less characters to express a certain meaning. So if you are used to writing in Chinese, you can actually write faster in Chinese than in English to get a point across. ",

Chinese characters look complicated compared to English, but one must realise that in Chinese, each character represents a word. Multiple characters get put together to make more complex words. When what I\u2019ve written above is translated into Chinese, it will take up less space on the page: \u4e2d\u6587\u53ef\u4ee5\u5199\u5f97\u50cf\u82f1\u6587\u4e00\u6837\u5feb\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u5199\u5f97\u66f4\u5feb\u3002 \u548c\u82f1\u6587\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e2d\u6587\u7684\u6c49\u5b57\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u66f4\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e5f\u5fc5\u987b\u8bf4\u660e\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4e2d\u6587\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u6c49\u5b57\u4ee3\u8868\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u6c47\u3002\u591a\u4e2a\u6c49\u5b57\u7ec4\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u542b\u4e49\u3002 You can see the characters are more complex to write, but you don\u2019t need to use as many as you do English letters to write a composition. Language nerds will probably point out that the comparison is more complex than I\u2019ve made out, but it\u2019s basically true in my experience of learning Chinese. ",

According to List Of All English Words Database Software, most English words have (about) 8 letters.Simplifed Chinese characters have, on average, 10.3 strokes.My translation experience, as confirmed by some veteran Chinese-English translators, says that to express the same idea, 1.8 Chinese characters are needed for 1 English words. The conversion rate is NOT genre-specific.Idioms, in Chinese and English, are common, and the their bearing on the numbers of words or characters are included in the conversion at 1.8:1 (CN vs EN).Writing styles (in the sense of fonts) for both languages, are in direct relation to writing speed, which however is ultimately decided by individual users of the language(s).Typing does lower the fluency of writing English words AND Chinese characters.Correct spellings for English words and accuracy of strokes (which can be acceptedly and dramatically reduced by certain styles of writing) for Chinese are variables that may OR may not be included in the comparison and cause different results.Personally, I hand-write two languages at about the same speed.",

I\u2019m a Chinese and attended a public Chinese high school, NOT international centers. When teachers write on the blackboard, they sometimes prefer to write in English if it is not in Chinese class. Consider: \u5e74\u9f84 takes longer time to write than \u201cage\u201d, and \u201c\u7ec6\u80de\u201d takes longer time to write than \u201ccells\u201d. When I take notes, I also prefer to use English, even if I\u2019m not so good in English. But after all, being able to write Chinese seems not so magic, as a billion people can do it. (China has 1.4 billion population, and at least 75% of people are literate, right?) ",

The first thing I want to share is that when a Chinese student starts to write, he/ she may write step by step. After some years, he/she may write quicker and more smooth. when we start to learn to write, we write like this  then like this  some people may write like this  yes, we can write quick I want to point out that Chinese sentence is usually shorter than English with the same meaning.

Go check UN report : \u8054\u5408\u56fd\u6b63\u5f0f\u6587\u4ef6 Choose different languages, and you will see the differences. Among all the six official languages, Chinese version has the shortest pages, 13. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me answer from another perspective, I learnt Chinese caligraphy in the past and \u8349\u4e66 (close equivalent to cursive handwriting) is considered one of the hardest scripts. Most people can't read \u8349\u4e66 because it's way too abstract with very few strokes to represent the character. Where as if you look at English calligraphy, the opposite is true. It's gets really really complicated with many curves and strokes. So the point is, Chinese writing strives to be minimal and abstract, whereas English writing strives to be sophisticated and elegant. So yes, Chinese can be written and expressed much faster. ",

The inefficiencies in Chinese characters don\u2019t lie in writing speeds but in things like looking up words in dictionaries or learning new terms, seeing a new phrase and knowing how to pronounce it or looking it up in a dictionary when you have to figure out the base radical and look it up via that. knowing or hearing a new spoken word but being unsure how to write it or for that matter how to go about looking it up.

Because even simplified chineese doesnt have an alphabet consisting of curtain number of letters, instead the characters used for it called hanzi are about 60 k as far as i know. it requires an incredible photographic memory and writing practice to learn them. another obstacle for foreigners is to learn pinyin versions (chineese written in latin alphabet). For insance water in pinyin:shui \u6c34 in hanzi. Another barrier is tones. Chineese have 4 tones. Same pronouncation actualy same word in pinyin may refer to several different meanings if u cant distinguish tones. But i have to admit grammar is fairly easy compared to other languages. \u0130 respect china a and chineese people but for foreigners it takes x4 time to learn chineese than another language. \u5728\u89c1!

            "answer_text": "Yes probably, due to familiarity. I heard this from my dad, who used to think the roman alphabet that we are used to must have been the \u201ceasiest\u201d to write and marvelled at how the other races with very fanciful script must have had a harder time writing. Then he said he saw this one guy who could write so quickly in what he considered, very complex flowery script in his native language that he was surprised to see the same person printing the script using roman-alphabets slowly, very much like how a child would write. It\u2019s no where as elegant as how he wrote his own language. So it seemed to suggest that familiarity makes it all easier and that English isn\u2019t necessarily a piece of cake to write for those who aren\u2019t used to writing them. ",

Now it's clear .All the people aren't as the translator like Wenyuan Xu(a professor from one of the most famous universities in China who ever said if he die no Chinese could translate Chinese ancient pome to English).Most of people will use more word to express their feelings.If the expression is not so long like \u201cI'm thirsty \u201c,it might be shorter than Chinese, but the documents in the UN were written in Chinese are always thinner .

            "answer_text": "Depends on how you time the speed and compare in English. Do you consider the time needed to express a meaning/ phrase in english/ chinese? Or do you consider the average time to write a chinese character and then compared with alphabet or a word? It is difficult to compare english and chinese writing speed directly. But in general, for traditiinal chinese, I think it is more effort than English (my hands feel quite sore after writing in Chinese than English). You can scribble easily in English once you learnt to write in cursive (just 26 letters) for chinese due to different characteristics in chinese words, it is harder to develop a general way to write in \u201ccursive\u201d, that being said, people who often write in Chinese can develop a kind a cursive like penmanship.

While the chinese characters being more complex to write down than alphabets in english, generally it uses less words to express the same meanning that's written in english. The problem is that nowadays most of chinese people are too used to pinyin for computer input, that they kind of got unfamiliar with pen writing. I mean you could partially forget how to write with pen if you use pinyin input on computer too much, especially for some characters that's not commonly used. It did happen to me quite a lot of times. ",

A Chinese page can be translated to at least 2 pages in English.

You need other letters to write out the whole word but in languages like Chinese you are already there at \u5b89.
