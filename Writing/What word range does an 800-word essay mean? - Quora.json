The word \u201crange\u201d normally implies something in between an upper and lower limit; it could be 790 or it could be 810 which is fine and allowable in most cases. Hence, in this case I would recommend that you stick to an essay of exactly 800 words using a 12 or 14-point Times New Roman Font with 1.5 or double spacing or as preferred by your supervisor. Consider the following: Capitalize the titleWrite a clear thesis statementAvoid contractionsWrite in proper grammarIndent the beginning of each paragraph (1/2 an inch)Be specific and to the pointAvoid the over-use of the personal pronouns unless necessaryUse the right punctuation marksDo not complicate things. Be simple in writing; simplicity is the soul of witBest of luck! M. ",
