            "answer_text": "The general rule is that the numbers one through nine are written in letters. Beyond that, there is little agreement. So, \u201cthree-page letter\u201d is the preferred style. Numbers tend to look better when they are written out in letters. Exceptions are when the numbers get large and then writing them out gets too long, though some writers will prefer to write all numbers out in letters. My own rule is that if a number requires two words and a hyphen, too, it is already too long. I will probably write the number 53, rather than fifty three. Fifty is fine and a hundred is fine, but not 101. Of course, too, you want your reader to pick up on that number if it has an importance to your writing. If \u201cfifty three\u201d is easier to grasp than \u201c53,\u201d then go for it. Your publisher might also have a preference, so it is wise to check with them. ",

The cutoff is at about the number 10. Different style guides may give you different points at which to switch to numerals, but they should all have the same general rule. ",

The standard practice was . . . numbers 1 to 10 = spell them out. 11 and more, use numbers. So I would have to write three-page letter. Hope this helps, Paul ",
