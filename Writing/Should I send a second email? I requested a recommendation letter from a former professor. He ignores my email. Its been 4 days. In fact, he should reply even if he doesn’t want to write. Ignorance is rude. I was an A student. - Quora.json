            "answer_text": "[A2A] First, the professor does not owe you a recommendation letter, and they certainly do not owe you a response in less than four days. They could be overwhelmed by other more immediate teaching, research, and service tasks, or by a family/legal/financial/political crisis. They could be traveling, or sick, or depressed, or retired, or dead. They could have a policy of only considering requests for recommendation letters that are made in person, or by students who made an A+, or by students who have done more with them than take one class. Your email could have been classified as spam, perhaps because you sent it from a non-university email address. They might be doing their own background research, in parallel with all their other work, before deciding how to respond. They might have seen that you didn\u2019t include important details in your request, like where you\u2019re applying and why, and written you off as not serious. They might have objected to the tone of your request and written you off as a jerk. Or they might just have a hard time telling people no. If the professor still hasn\u2019t answered within a week or so, it would be reasonable to send a second request, or better yet, to stop by their office in person and ask them (or their assistant) for an appointment to discuss your request in person. If they still don\u2019t reply, take the hint. Ask someone else. ",

If you want a busy professional to take time to do something important for you, be humble and have some gratitude. Contact the front desk administrator to find out when the professor is free, ideally you aren\u2019t asking at midterms, during finals or over break. Ask permission to speak to the professor. See the professor when they allow it. If they don\u2019t show any interest in your request because your classes with them were a number of years ago, move on. Provide all the necessary information needed to write this letter, craft a rough draft for them. Provide enough time for them to give it consideration and return it to you. Less than two weeks time is pushing it. Thank them for their assistance, and listening to your request. Tell them you appreciate their time and efforts to help you. In the future you make this arrangement before class finalizes and have chance to ask them face to face. Sending a gimmee gimmee email is lame. ",

But, I\u2019m going to answer your question honestly, despite it\u2019s obvious problems. Yes, you should follow up. Unless you are one of my current students who get very quick responses, I may or may not answer your email within four days depending on what was going on at the time, whether I remembered you and for what reasons, whether I was interrupted the moment I was about to click reply, and so on. It\u2019s not personal, but it\u2019s the reality of the situation. Not only am I busy like everyone else, I don\u2019t expect that anyone I\u2019m not currently involved with in a class, a project, or some other timely business to have urgent requests. If you wrote a polite follow-up four or five days later, it would remind me that your email is there, that it likely got buried in my inbox, and that it mattered to you. Maybe I didn\u2019t even see it to begin with, which is rare but happens. If I got that follow-up email, I\u2019d respond within the next day or two. If I didn\u2019t, it meant that something really important is happening or that I was pointedly ignoring you because I can (also both rare occurrences, but happens). My response would be the standard, here are my terms for writing letters of recommendation, etc., which is worth pointing out that I\u2019m never required to do and places a substantial burden on my time because my letters are highly personalized to be effective. I write letters of recommendation for deserving students who demonstrate significant potential *and* who make my job as a letter writer as easy as possible, not students who get As. These letters always speak directly to the character, attitude, and emotional maturity of the candidate in addition to their intellectual potential and professional work. You want to make it easy for me to write great things. ",

Your attitude is rude and condescending. The word ignorance is used incorrectly. So, you may not be as grand as you see yourself. Professors usually like to write letters of recommendations for students who are appreciative and make them look good. If you handle most situations with the same self absorbed arrogance that you displayed in this question, you probably are not that student. A professors ONLY obligation to his students is to provide and opportunity to learn which you obviously did if you actually earned and A. Congratulations. If he actually does write you an.letter if recommendation, try being thankful. Graciousness goes a long way in life. ",

He has professional obligations (teaching) and, perhaps, a family. How did you make your request? Did you include a current resume and the exact name and address of the person to whom the letter should be addressed? Is this for a job? Did you include the job posting? Have you had an in-person conversation with your professor about why you want the job and how your class work supports your request? Is this for grad school? Does the professor understand why you are interested in the particular program? Have you EVER met with this professor? If all that he knows about you is that you got an A, the letter will be thin. Transparently thin. I suggest that you call the professor\u2019s secretary to make sure that he is all right, and not in the middle of a family or medical emergency, which might make your tantrum even more embarrassing. I hope, also, that you weren\u2019t in need of a 24-hour turnaround on this request. There are very few circumstances under which a letter of recommendation request is reasonable on the same sort of timeline as Instant Rice. ",

Yes, you may want to follow up with a polite e-mail to your professor, but don\u2019t expect any response.
