            "answer_text": "Hi. Great question. Quick answer = no. To prepare a quality speech that will be broadcast throughout the world requires hours of preparation. There are hundreds of reporters and journalists who would love to have a scoop - \u2018\u201dThe Queen is wrong! She said this!\u201d So everything she says as a public speech is vetted by several people before it is said or published. The Queen does not have time for all this preparation and checking and so she employs a speechwriter. The Queen can have input and final say, but the basic speech is prepared by someone else. Hope this helps, Paul ",

The answer is yes and no. Like all heads of state, a speech will have inpout from a number of sources. But it will also depend on the subject matter and circumstance. Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s recent address to the UK and The Commonwealth shows all the hallmarks of having been largely personally written. After all, this is someone with almost 70 decades of giving speeches and statesmanship and who is pareticularly well-informed. ",
