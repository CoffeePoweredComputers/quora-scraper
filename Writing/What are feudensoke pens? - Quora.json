            "answer_text": "I think you might mean \u201cfudenosuke\u201d pens. A fudenosuke is a kind of Japanese pen that has a flexible pen tip, so it behaves somewhat like a brush. (\u201cFude\u201d is the Japanse word for \u201cbrush\u201d.) The thickness of the line varies with the pressure and stroke of the pen, so it\u2019s useful for calligraphy, while being somewhat more convenient to use than an actual brush (and separate ink). ",
