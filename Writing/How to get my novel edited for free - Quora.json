Most publishers take on new authors in what they recognize as pretty raw. Your agent will see the potential in your work, but will recognize when it needs to be honed for the market. Publishing houses have editors who know the ins and out of the market and can help you polish and focus your work. Proceeds from your book pay the salary of the whole publication team from editor to layout artist. The more work they have to do will of course cut into the royalties they pay you, but if it makes the book sell, why not?",
