But that is defeasible. defeasible: open in principle to revision \u2026 \u2014New Oxford American Dictionary online As you intimate, depending on the social context and the speaker\u2019s tone of voice, these words might function as a question, and that causes confusion. Even when they do function as a question, as a rule, though not absolutely always, it is best to follow form as opposed to function, and omit the question mark. A possible exception: You are writing a novel, and you want to convey the personality of the speaker. Then you might write \u201cI was wondering whether the speed of light changes through time?\u201d There are few if any absolutely hard and fast rules when it comes to usage. Communication through language is a creative process. But it is also governed by rules, of necessity. Hence tension can arise between the pull of creativity and the pull of convention.
