            "answer_text": "Politically, most of them aren\u2019t for religious rule. Ideologically, some may differ from others. The Egyptian presidential election, 2012 saw the rise of Islamists to power because the other option was a way-back portal to the Mubarak era, though he was secular and suffered a very close defeat by the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood. The MB had been outlawed for years until Mubarak resigned in 2011, because they introduced religious extremism to Egypt in 1928. Whenever somebody asks me if Egypt is inherently religious, I always like to reference a speech given by Gamal Abd-El Nasser, Egypt\u2019s 2nd president. In it, he mentioned a Muslim Brotherhood figure's demands which included that women should wear the headscarf more often in public, a man stood up and yelled \u201clet him wear it himself!\u201d This was the popular sentiment in Egypt in the 20th century, after British rule was abolished and Egypt\u2019s ruling class was almost crushed. Religion has historically been a spiritual affair in Egypt, whether it\u2019s Christianity or Islam. Perhaps nationalism was the more destructive sentiment because it drove us into many wars, but it was never \u201cjihad\u201d or \u201choly war\u201d (note: that\u2019s actually true of most if not all Arab Muslim-majority countries that are secular by nature). I don\u2019t see religion everywhere I go. There are almost no religious \u201claws\u201d (except for family laws and laws against adultery/infidelity which exist everywhere in the world). There are religious establishments like Dar Al Ifta\u2019a and Al-Azhar which play a prominent role in organizing Islam and keeping it separate from the state. Similarly, Coptic Christians have the Patriarch of Alexandria. We have churches, mosques, religious festivals, and yes the majority of us are Muslim, but we survive on a live-and-let-live tolerance. The majority of women wear headscarves, some wear the niqab, religion is perfectly in tact, but we keep it between ourselves (perhaps that\u2019s a very lazy generalization on my part). The far-right isn\u2019t at all powerful in Egypt, it\u2019s replaced by socialist and nationalist parties. We\u2019ve only ever had one Islamist president and his rule didn\u2019t last a full year. Islamists pursue a majoritarian form of government and that just doesn\u2019t fly with Egyptians. The legal framework takes elements of the Islamic shari\u2019a but doesn\u2019t incorporate it in its fullest because we have the largest Coptic community in the world. Nowhere in the Arab world do people live, eat, and sleep by religious standards. None of us are ideal Muslims, Christians, or Jews (yup). Religion is an integral part of our identity but it doesn\u2019t overtake our sense of loyalty to our countries, which involves religious tolerance. This is insulting by many people\u2019s standards. I\u2019d be lying if I said we had no religious extremists (Muslim Brotherhood supporters et al), but I don\u2019t think Egyptians in particular fit the term \u201creligious.\u201d ",
