            "answer_text": "To give you a more honest answer (and not false expectations): You can\u2019t. There is no How, and you should not finish a PhD thesis in 2 months. But if you mean \u201ccan I just keep working like a robot, as I have VERY GOOD command of technical language skills (relevant to your field), and I have been publishing like crazy in top journals in the past 3\u20135 years\u201d - maybe you stand a chance to write up a thesis within 2 months by putting all the results and writings from the 3\u20135 years into a book. I give this opinion/answer, because we need to have some respect for thesis writing. It is not about just writing any book or facts together. It is a thesis that shouts out your processes, thoughts and valuable outcomes in a very crafted and organized way, so that readers, from a novice to experienced professors/academics, can understand it, reproduce your results and carry on your work to bring it to the next level. In reality, we may not get the above. Still, you should treat your thesis with respect, give time to it, and treasure it. Writing is about questioning your thought processes, and challenge your ideas. I once read this book \u201cWriting Your Dissertation in Fifteen Minutes a Day: A Guide to Starting, Revising, and Finishing Your Doctoral Thesis\u201d by Joan Bolker (actually I read it while I was writing my dissertation that definitely took longer than 2 months) and I really agree with Joan on using writing to reflect on your points/ideas. And hence, it should never be rushed (expect when you have a submission deadline in 48 hours or 2 months). The very fact you came to Quora and posted this question, I have the understanding you must be in a rather desperate situation. All I can say is - start writing if you have not, keep writing even if you don\u2019t feel like to, write with as much confidence as you could gather now. My only advise for you to complete writing a thesis successfully is - start making baby steps every hour/day towards the end of the journey. All the best! I believe you can make it. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you asking this because it\u2019s mid-October and you\u2019re our of money at the end of the term? You get off Quora. You start writing up the easiest things to write up. This is to get momentum building. DO NOT START ON THE BACKGROUND (unless you need to refresh your memory and then you can do that by reading). AFTER THAT, you develop a narrative for the overall thesis and sketch that out in an outline or a whiteboard. You decide what goes into each chapter (except the Background). You make check boxes. You blast through as fast as you possibly can to have a first draft by following those checkboxes. Do not think hard about how to phrase things. Your sentence is a paragraph? Fine. Just write words onto paper. Presumably the conclusions are a foregone conclusion, but write that up too. OK, now you have a crappily-written thesis with no background section. FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO EDIT IT FOR YOU. You want them to just suggest what needs to be clarified, what they don\u2019t understand. This is \u201ccontent editing\u201d not copyediting, and you want them to be somewhat familiar with academic theses so they don\u2019t try to edit it like it\u2019s \u201cPopular Non-Fiction.\u201d While that is happening, write your background section (including your references). The references are deadly and will take time and diligence, so do not delay!! Put everything you can in there. Be sure everyone on your committee has their work well-represented. Whether the editor is still working on it or not (depending on how fast you blast out your background), you give the draft (with your background) to your advisor and any super-friendly committee members (check with your advisor first), and ask them for anything that\u2019s missing, but let them know you\u2019re going to edit it like crazy. Take another version of the draft and now YOU edit it, and make the revisions your editor suggested, while your advisor is perusing his or her copy. Copyediting (i.e. punctuation etc) is still not done yet, just focus on making things make sense to a human being. Hopefully there are not any substantive rewrites. If so, do those. If not, now you do a solid copyedit (hiring someone else is fine). Then ask for a round of reviews from your committee. Then defend your thesis. Hopefully again, not any substantive rewrites. When there are none, you\u2019re done. ",
