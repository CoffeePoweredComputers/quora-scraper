            "answer_text": "There is only one Hunter x Hunter series. The manga currently has 390 Chapters. It often goes on hiatus, and even now it\u2019s on hiatus so the series is going on and on forever. It first started in 1998. As for the anime, the first anime adaptation was in 1999. It is a classic anime and one of the best I have ever watched. The first season contained 62 EPs (up to the York Shin Auction).Then there were 3 OVA:OVA 1: 8 EPs (Phantom Troupe)OVA 2: 8 EPs (Greed Island)OVA 3: 14 EPs (Greed Island Final) So in total, the classic anime consists of 92 EPs. But since there wasn\u2019t much content back then they had to stop animating the series after Greed Island arc. However, after 10 years in 2011, they decided to make a remake(from the start) with new animation quality, soundtrack, etc. The 2011 version has 148 eps and covers till the Election Arc of the manga. Since the manga is still ongoing but goes on hiatus often, they didn\u2019t have much content to animate so they stopped at ep 148 after a major arc was finished. Many fans argue which version(1999 Vs 2011) is better. Opinions differ but I like both of them. But still, a classic is a classic, if that\u2019s the first thing you have seen, you can\u2019t forget it. So as for your question goes there is only one Hunter x Hunter series with a remake. ",

            "answer_text": "The order of the arcs in Hunter X Hunter are as follows with a quick synopsis. Spoilers in the following answer. Arc 1: The Hunter Exam The protagonist Gon leaves his home town to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps to become a hunter, a highly skilled combatant that only a few can become. Along the way he makes new friends (and enemies) and becomes familiar with the world outside of his island. Arc 2: Kukuroo Mountain Arc After completing the Hunter exam, Gon, Kurapika and Leorio travel to the Zoldyck estate and train in order to rescue their newly found friend Killua from his delusional, assassin family. Arc 3: Heavens Arena Arc Killua and Gon need to train to get stronger but make money too so they travel to a proffesional fighting tournament where they meet Wing, a teacher of Nen. Nen allows them to control their aura which will help them in future battles. Meanwhile, Kurapika has started working as a bodyguard and Leorio is studying to become a doctor. Arc 4: York-New Arc Deciding that Killua and Gon will search for Ging (Gon\u2019s dad) they go to a legendary auction hosted by the mafia to collect an extremely rare game that Ging made, hoping it will get Gon one step closer to finding his dad. Kurapika also goes to the Auction to find the eyes of his fallen clan, and Leorio reunites with Gon. The two boys also develop their nen and a group of thieves and murderers called the Phantom Troupe are getting in the way of their plans. Arc 5: Greed Island Arc Arguably the best arc in the series. Now they have the game Ging made, Gon finds out that it is a game where the player actually goes into it. After being explained to that the player must collect 100 specific cards to win, Gon and Killua meet Biscuit, Wing\u2019s teacher, which develops their nen further. They also have to stop a violent nen user within the game that is killing people for cards, while trying to collect cards themselves. Arc 6: Chrimera ant arc Due to them completing the game, Gon and Killua are transported to Kite, a student of Ging. From there, they enter a country with Kite that is infested with beasts called Chrimera ants. A king and specialist soldiers that can use nen appear from the ants which pose a threat to the Hunter organisation and humanity as a whole. Gon, Killua, Kite and other hunters are sent in to save humanity. Arc 7: The Election Arc Gon is in critical condition after using too much nen in blind rage against one of the King\u2019s bodyguards and therefore Killua attemps to get his supernatural brother to heal Gon. Meanwhile there is a battle between people who want to save Gon, and others who want to let him die. Also, since the head of the Hunter Organstion was KIA, there is an election to choose who will be the next chairman, in which Ging and Leorio are candidates. Arc 8: A bigger world (currently in progress) Gon finally meets Ging, where he explains to his son that Earth is just a small part of a bigger picture. A man named Beyond comes out as Netero\u2019s (the deceased chairman) son and attempts to cross to this \u201cbigger world\u201d. Meanwhile, Kurapika is nominated as the Rat of the Zodiac group, a team of highly prestiegous hunters and nen users. ",
