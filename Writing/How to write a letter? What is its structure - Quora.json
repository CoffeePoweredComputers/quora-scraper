            "answer_text": "A letter essentialy consists of three blocks: An addressBodySignature(The naming of the above blocks can be as different as are the number of letters written in a day, i mean in those days of letters' reign)  Generals:   The naming of the address block could be either in indented (just as an indented shoreline) or in block form (all of the address' lines in line with that of the first) All the blocks could start from the left end, or the address and the signature blocks could be at the right side of the page. The date should be in the format of: *date* *month*,*year*. (pay attention to the relative positions of the comma and the full stop) Dont write \"to\" and \"from\"; the position of the address block should rather indicate it. The date should be in between the to and from address In formal letters, the subject should be just after the invocation of sir/ma'adam. In formal letters, sign your name in the signature block and write, if needed, the name in parenthesis. All the lines in the address block should end with a comma except for the last one which ends with a full stop.   ADDRESS:In a formal letter,  The first part would be the address of \"to\", the recepient.This is followed by date as in the above mentioned format.The \" from\" address follows the date.MODEL: Mr.Xyz,2nd block, banshankari,Bangalore-85. 5th january,2015. Ravitej S,3rd block, banashankari,Bangalore-85. In an informal letter, you could as well skip the \"to\" block as you will mention the same in the outside of letter while posting.   2. BODY:  You can furthur divide the body into three parts, viz,IntroductionContentSumming up In the introduction, write about the prelims of the subject of the letter.In the content, get to the content and dig in as much deep, as enough to cover all the matter intended to present in the least number of lines.Summing up, tell about what your suggestions are, and what you draw from the facts mentioned in the content (formal letter) or wish them well, ask them not to forget to attend the xyz function, ask them to convey your regards (informal letter)MODEL: Respected sir,       sub: submission of a poem to your magazine   Introduction Content Summing up  3.SIGNATURE:  start with a *thanking you,* (dont forget the comma)continue with any of the notations of; yours faithfully, yours loving son, yours sincerely, as the case may intend (yours should be continous with no interspersed notations)Sign, followed by your name in brackets, if needed.Yours **** should be followed by a comma and a full stop after the signature.MODEL: thanking you,  Yours faithfully,\u00a3\u00a2\u20ac\u00a5.(Ravitej S) *The currency symbols is my signature!
