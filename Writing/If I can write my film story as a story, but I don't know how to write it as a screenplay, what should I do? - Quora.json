Alternatively, you can also hire someone to write your screenplay for you (based on your ideas). It\u2019s a service my company provides and is very popular! But, either way, reading \u201cSave the Cat\u201d is a good start that I would recommend doing no matter what you choose. ",

While you are taking the courses or afterward, try to apply what you have learned to the stories that you have in mind.Read as many screenplays as you can - Study them closely and determine which among has a structure, narrative flow and pacing that you see fits your writing style. Adapt your current stories accordingly.",
