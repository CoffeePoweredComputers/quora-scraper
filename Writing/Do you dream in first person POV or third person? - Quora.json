Here I am moving through the dream in first person but can also see myself still sleeping, in third person.I've also had omnipresent POV, where I am not participating in the dream but observing the dream as if I was watching a full blown movie, full narrative story, including sound, cutaways and closeups.All this besides lucid dreams and aware dreams. I lead a very fascinating, to myself, nightlife. ",
