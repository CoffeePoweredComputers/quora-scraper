There a many factors that determine how good a stylus feels: weight. width. ink. nib size, texture of case, kind of surface, sticker price, and more. Test out enough writing instruments to be sure which pleases you the most, for what particular writing job. If you can\u2019t afford an Aurora or two, Pilot makes a very good pen for less than $20. And then there are peacock quill pens for kicks. ",
