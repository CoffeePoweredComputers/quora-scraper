            "answer_text": "For the last almost 10 years I have focused on military consulting to apply (or sometimes not) some of my previous decades of academic and industrial R&D results. During my most recent ten years of academic research, I changed emphasis from systems to algorithms\u2014those are much easier to transition to industrial/military practice than are major system architecture changes. I then also had a about a dozen (mostly Ph.D.) students\u2014algorithm research and theses almost always require less time to do than systems ones. The students were very bright and hard working. We aspired for the team to produce research results in an average of at least five papers accepted per year in high quality mainstream ACM and IEEE journals and conferences\u2014which we exceeded. (Currently I have reduced my consulting primarily to giving lectures, leaving more time for research and writing a research monograph\u2014so I am measuring years per \u201cpaper\u201d (book) instead of papers per year.)

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have any principle, but it generally turns out to be one paper per year or so. Since my position is full-time teaching rather than the usual mix of teaching and research, all research and writing I do is in my own time, so I write when I feel like it. My colleagues who are actually given time to research are probably obliged to produce more of it. ",
