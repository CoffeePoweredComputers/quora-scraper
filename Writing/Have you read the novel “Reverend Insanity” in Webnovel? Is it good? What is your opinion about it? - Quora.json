            "answer_text": "Its probably one of the best webnovels ive read so far. It has a great plot, interesting characters and is rlly well written. Most importantly it doesnt have any noticeable plot holes or plot armor. Every character is smart and you wont question any characters decisions for how stupid they were. The only thing that is left to the taste is the protagonists personality. He is a machiavellian and cares about nothing but his own advanzages. ",

The MC is best, staying true to his own desires and does everything he can to achieve it. He is not OP like other novels, but best at scheming and has a very cunning personality making the next chapter completely unpredictable. Overall it\u2019s the best! ",
