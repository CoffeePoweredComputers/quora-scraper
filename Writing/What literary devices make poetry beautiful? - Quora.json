            "answer_text": "There are many aspects that make poetry beautiful. Literary and poetic devices are absolute keystones of that beauty. Though, writing good poetry is like making incredible meal. Just because you have all of the right ingredients doesn't mean that you'll end up with a world-class entree. First, you do need to learn the systems. I think one part of poetry that people don't give enough credence to is the importance of meter. \u2014Meter \u2014  If you think about the difference between a rap song and a romance ballad (minus the actual music), most of it will be in the structural meter. The way the words are said and emphasized vastly differs. Poetry is just the same. Whether you're dealing with a sestina or Haiku or free verse poem, a lot of the beauty comes in the metered structure that the poet crafts. For example, The Iliad (like most Greek poetry) was written in dactylic hexameter. I love opening of the Iliad: RAGE:\u00a0               Sing, Goddess, Achilles\u2019 rage,\u00a0Black and murderous, that cost the Greeks\u00a0Incalculable pain, pitched countless souls\u00a0Of heroes into Hades\u2019 dark,\u00a0And left their bodies to rot as feasts\u00a0For dogs and birds, as Zeus\u2019 will was done. \u00a0    Begin with the clash between Agamemnon-- \u00a0The Greek warlord--and godlike Achilles.\u00a0\u2014Repetition\u2014  Repetition is a very powerful device in poetic language. Actually, John F. Kennedy (US President) was very poetic is his speeches (or rather, his speech writer @Ted Sorensen was). Here is a selection from an article analyzing his speeches.[1] Sometimes, those lists followed the \u201crule of three,\u201d or \u201ctricolon,\u201d making sure to use three images, arguments or examples. Other times, Kennedy made longer lists by using \u201canaphora\u201d: repeating one word several times to expand a list and continue an over-long sentence well past the rules of grammar. Kennedy often used the classical literary device, \u201cchiasmus,\u201d to invert the word order in a sentence and make a new meaning. Consider how Kennedy uses the rule of three and chiasmus to begin his inaugural address:  \u2014Imagery and Representations\u2014  One of the most powerful building blocks can come for really powerful emotive poetry is imagery and representation. One of my favorite forms is Synecdoche. Synecdoche is a literary device in which a part of something represents the whole or it may use a whole to represent a part. Here is an example from Percy Bysshe Shelley: \u201cTell that its sculptor well those passions readWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,The hand that mocked them.\u201d In this case, the hand represents the sculptor that passed on the \u201cgift\u201d of life to lifeless things. \u2014Simple, Raw Emotion\u2014  Sometimes you just have certain poems that just hit home with their raw emotion. This why the poetry of Rupi Kaur resonates with a lot of people, even though some take umbrage with its form . But, one of the emotional masters was and always will be Maya Angelou: You may write me down in history\u00a0With your bitter, twisted lies,\u00a0You may trod me in the very dirt\u00a0But still, like dust, I\u2019ll rise.\u00a0\u00a0Does my sassiness upset you?\u00a0Why are you beset with gloom?\u00a0\u2018Cause I walk like I\u2019ve got oil wells\u00a0Pumping in my living room.\u00a0\u00a0Just like moons and like suns,\u00a0With the certainty of tides,\u00a0Just like hopes springing high,\u00a0Still I\u2019ll rise.\u00a0She most certainly uses the power of poetic structure. But wow, that just strikes a powerful chord. Like dust, I\u2019ll rise\u2026 Hope this was helpful Best, Brenton Footnotes[1] The art of words\u2014what JFK can teach us about speech writing - Office Blogs",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single definitive answer to this question. Poetry and beauty are both very subjective experiences. That being said, some of the devices I think make poetry beautiful are: Extended metaphors - \u201cHope\u201d by Emily Dickinson Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul, And sings the tune\u2014without the words, And never stops at all Juxtaposition - Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare, Act 1, Scene V (not really a poem, but still an effective use of juxtaposition) O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope\u2019s ear Romeo is praising Juliet here, saying that the brightness of her face could teach the torches how to burn bright, and that against Ethiopian skin, she would seem to be a sparkly jewel. Not sure if I would enjoy being told that my face was shiny, but the image gets across pretty well. Symbols - \u201cOzymandias\u201d by Percy Bysshe Shelley And on the pedestal these words appear \u201cMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\u201d Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away The ruined statue of Ozymandias and its location (another epithet for Ramses II) represents where vanity of man gets you. The same place everyone ends up, in lonely death. The \u201cking of kings\u201d seems to realize after his life that even his works can (and did) become a \u201ccolossal wreck\u201d, and that his vanity only isolated him in life. ",

However, useful ones for me alliterative, consonance, personification, metaphor, anaphora, inverted syntax and vivid imagery. Below, I have written a short (and rather poor) poem that hopefully illustrates this point: On the moors, Where the petals ploughed the fields, Where the grass groaned the greys of night away. Where the dew of day moistened the ground with an oblique petrachor. This was the moors. ",

Other aspects are its Structure, Rhymic scheme, Sentences, Vocabulary etc. Literary Devices are there to help you make a poem better and to present it in a profound way. It us up to the poet whether to use various literary devices or not. According to me \u2018Personification\u2019 is the one which makes a poem alive. It is a literary device in which an inanimate object or animal is given the attributes a human. ",
