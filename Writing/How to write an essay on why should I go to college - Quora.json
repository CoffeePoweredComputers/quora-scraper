            "answer_text": "First you should fully understand why do you really have to go there. I'd recommend to set your personal life goal and write down some steps for achieving the goal. If it's still hard to figure out the arguments you can use some specific resources for help (for example, this one http://myessaywriting.co.uk/term-paper-wrtiting.html). In my humble opinion, the main argument why you have to go to college and obtain at least college degree is because you will have a great time there. You will have new friends, you will be able to share ideas and create new things (philosophical articles or engineering stuff). In any case, that education will really help you to be better prepared for further living and life problems, you will have the basic amount of knowledge you need for being a specialist in some area and you likely will not feel a lack of employment. I wish you all the best. ",

Then write your essay and tie all your examples back to that. ",
