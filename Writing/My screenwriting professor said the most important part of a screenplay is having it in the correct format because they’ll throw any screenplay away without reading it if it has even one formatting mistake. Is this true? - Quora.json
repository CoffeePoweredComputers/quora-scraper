            "answer_text": "A formatting mistake is exceptionally indicative that you are not fluent in the business because software has been available for 20 years for relatively little money to assure the correct formats are used. It\u2019s not an exceptionally difficult format. If you\u2019re self-producing, you don\u2019t need to follow the format, but here are some issues that come up as more difficult if you do not use a good format. Both the Screen Actors Guild and the Writers Guild of America define contracts in terms of lines of text in the screenplay. In the WGA world, if you ask the writer to rewrite more than twice or three times, it\u2019s considered an implicit contract. To straighten out the script for the purposes of analysis within the contexts of those two unions \u2014 SAG and WGA \u2014 uses up one of those rewrites. There are probably other considerations as well. For example, with the format, the general guideline of one page of text is approximately one minute of film is often assumed. So \u2026 if you don\u2019t follow the format, you\u2019re not only displaying your unfamiliarity with the industry and the craft, you\u2019ve complicated the rewriting process, you\u2019ve started down the path of having issues with SAG and WGA, AND, the producer doesn\u2019t have a rough idea of how long your movie is going to be.

            "answer_text": "EVERYTHING has basically already been said\u2026. BUT I\u2019ll add this. By following format it helps measure the timing of the length which helps them determine the budget. Locations can can run $10k a day, cinematographers are over $600 a day, etc etc. hell, even a union extra can make $400 a day. when there\u2019s millions and billions riding on it - format - with regards to measuring timing and budget are imperative. UNLESS you are making it and funding it. Clerks is a great example of something that was a hit and broke all the rules - it was also self funded and more expensive than it looks. Formatting is also derived from Greek theatre where holding people\u2019s attention was a matter of getting rotten produce thrown at you. Have you ever seen a movie that wasn\u2019t bad but wasn\u2019t good but you can\u2019t really place what\u2019s wrong with it\u2026.? it\u2019s likely because specific plot points got missed. They are subtle, but every blockbuster has them. ",

People expect me to be worth the money they pay me, so I have no qualms at all at asking you: Who is \u2018they\u2019 exactly? I only ask because there\u2019s only one scenario were \u201cthey\u201d will throw \u201cany screenplay\u201d away, and that if it\u2019s an unsolicited manuscript. If someone asks to see your screenplay, they\u2019re going to read it. No reader wants to be the one who passed on the next Iron Man or Matrix because there was a formatting mistake in the screenplay. That being said, don\u2019t go off half cocked. You should ALWAYS put your best foot forward - whether you\u2019re a noob or a seasoned professional - because it shows that you care about your product. ",
