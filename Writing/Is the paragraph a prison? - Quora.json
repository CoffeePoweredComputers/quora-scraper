            "answer_text": "When I was in k-12, I was forever getting B's on essays. Teachers kept singling out my use of punctuation, run on sentences, and my deviation from the normal structure. I wanted to change, but I just couldn't ever seem to get my head around it. It just didn't make sense to me. I guess I would say it felt like a prison. It felt like it was keeping me from expressing myself. I went to college where they made clear that they weren't teaching you how to write, they'd just fail you if they couldn't understand you. You got A's by having quality of thought and innovative ideas. And so I got A's there, got my confidence boosted, wrote more. Years later, I'm a \"Top Writer\" on Quora, which isn't exactly the Nobel prize, but clearly people aren't having trouble reading my writing. So I think there is plenty of freedom for writers as adults. Once you come into your own, if you simply need to express yourself in a bit of a non-standard way, people will call that have style. So why do they teach us rigid structures in school? I would say two main reasons, one good, one more iffy: 1) Because you have to walk before you can run. A teacher can't point to David Foster Wallace and say \"Write more like that.\" The teacher has to have something to tell students that the students are able to roughly get their head around. So processes are created to help out. I'll tell you also that as a teacher of high school physics, I do the same thing with physics problem solving. 2) Because teachers need an objective way to grade everything they assign, and if they stop being consistent about it, they open themselves up to all kinds of complaints. Before a teacher knows it then, they can find themselves knocking a student for doing something that really isn't an important issue in terms of the holistic results. Obviously that can be a bad thing. It can make someone try to fit their ideas into a box that they just don't quite fit in unnecessarily. That's how I felt. At the same time though we shouldn't overstate how bad this is. I may be able to get my ideas across my way, but wouldn't it also be good if I were versatile enough to write my ideas in a variety of ways depending on the audience I'm writing for? The very best writers can do that. What separates a minor annoyance from a major travesty here is how the teachers go about this process. If they use it to demolish a students' will to continue with writing, that's horrible, but the issue there is not so much with the process as with the teacher. ",

            "answer_text": "They're not prisons. They're a way to contain related thoughts or statements. Your question, for example, is a perfectly good paragraph. I didn't learn the PQE system--instead, I learned the five-part essay (intro, three paragraphs with a point each, conclusion). I learned it in fifth grade, and then again in sixth grade. Then again in eighth, and one more time in tenth. *yawn* Apparently each teacher was afraid I'd missed it one of the other times. I don't know. But I rarely stuck to it, and I still got good grades. That makes me think teachers use it to help their students--who are mostly inexperienced writers--to keep from rambling on. That makes some sense. Most of us ramble on when we're still thinking out our ideas; I imagine very few people don't do that at least the first time they're arguing a particular point. The PQE system is probably similar: a container that helps kids get started. But more experienced writers don't need training wheels. There aren't any hard and fast rules about paragraphs, but I'll give you the one I use most often: group one aspect of one idea in each paragraph.  Oh, and do use them, please, even in email. Everybody dreads the sight of a block-o-text in their inbox! ",

            "answer_text": "As someone who has actually taught freshmen composition, I'd like to point out that PQE and similar methods is designed to be a teaching tool, not as the model for all good writing. Most kids who are learning to write essays and other expository writing have a lot of trouble taking their broad ideas and dissecting them to find the different individual points and propositions upon which their broad ideas are based. Thus, teachers focus on how to make discrete, defensible, concise, and coherent points, often in the form of topic sentences or \"main ideas.\" Students also have trouble recognizing what needs to be backed up by evidence, where to look for evidence, and how to use sources as evidence in their own work. Thus, teachers emphasize the use of quotations from sources as one of the most useful and common ways to provide supporting evidence. Other forms of evidence, such as first-hand accounts, original data analysis, and original research, are not very applicable to most students at the stage they are when they are learning composition. In order to do original research to use as evidence, you have to know how to do original analysis or experiments, which most students don't learn until later in their college careers (if at all, unfortunately). Composition teachers use textual evidence, i.e. things other people wrote, because it's accessible (just go to the library), can be reproduced easily (the teacher doesn't have to re-do the experiment to know if it was done correctly, just find the source and make sure the quote accurately reflects it), and requires using the other skills we try to teach in composition, namely textual analysis, logical argument, and translating ideas into words and vice versa. Finally (at least in the PQE system you refer to), students usually don't know how to take the place of their reader, to know what the reader will understand and what they need explained to them. Thus, teachers spend time on the transition from the quote, the evidence, to the point, the main idea of the paragraph, in order to give students practice with connecting two things that are related but not necessarily self-evidently related. This is especially true when students are taught to use multiple quotes for every point (often it's 3+ per paragraph), and the quotes all need to be related not only to the idea of the paragraph but also to the other quotes in the paragraph. Transitions are hard, and the only way to learn how to do it is to do it repeatedly. The best composition students, at the end of the semester, will write very clear, well-researched, well-argued essays. But they are almost never anything like \"the best essays in history.\" The goal of the class is not to teach people to write the best essays in history; it's to teach them how to break down writing into its component parts, how to examine the ways those parts fit together to make the whole, and to try to create, from your own parts and quoted parts of others, another, new whole that is compelling. Once they have that down, they can start exploring. Once you know how the machine works, only THEN can you ask, \"What happens if I do this?\" What happens if I write a short paragraph with no evidence? It'll work in some circumstances, but in order to know when it will work, and how, you need to know what it's not doing and how that blank space is being used. What happens if I change my thesis midway through? That will work sometimes, but only sometimes, and in order to know when it's working and learn from those examples, you need to know what a thesis is, how it usually works, and what the writer does in order to make it work differently. It should also be noted that composition is very much biased towards concision because the only way to teach someone what's actually necessary is to show them how an essay can work with the bare minimum. It is also, of course, a product of the fact that we need students to write several complete pieces over the course of the semester, that they have other coursework they need to do, and that we have to grade all of them. But while kids in composition class may be writing 1000-1500 word essays, the expectation is that in their other classes, over the course of their college careers, they'll be writing 15-25 page papers, which will require a much less restricted style. But on things like in-class written exams, the more minimalist methods of something like PQE are often best simply because they allow you to make your argument quickly. But that doesn't mean that any composition teacher would ever want you to be limited to that one method. PQE is a stretch of road. It's not the destination, but you have to go over it to get there.
