            "answer_text": "Terrible, really terrible. 20 years ago we used to peacefully live our quiet life. In the summer we would have our yearly vacation to the North Sea. Enjoying the cold sea breeze when we would walk hand in hand along the undulating sea with the girl we loved, watching seagulls flying a murmuration over the sea at sunset. Feeding the hungry, with some of our delicious regional dishes: grey shrimps stuffed tomatoes, rabbit with prunes, or mussels with Fries. finishing with a Dame blanche or coupe br\u00e9silienne with lots of whipped cream. Quenching the thirsty with a good Trappist beer watching people stroll by our terrace at the sea-dike, commenting on their bad sense of fashing or how their stubborn Chihuahua is giving a new meaning to a canine carnage. Things were so simple and uncomplicated. Belgium basically had a monopoly on Trappist beers. We only had to cover up with the proverbial mantle of love that La Trappe was brewed a few km outside the Belgium border. With La Trappe, our Northern neighbors had at a good beer brand so we shrugged it off and gracefully accepted La Trappe as technically from the Netherlands (It is not exactly a big accomplishment to be better as Heineken so the Dutch should not get too excited.) But look what happened now. Currently, you have Trappist beer from Austria, Italy, and the United States.The United States of all places!? I tasted Spencer Trappist.Because of BNBR rules on Quora, I wouldn\u2019t go that far to call it an abomination, but I\u2019m not so sure it will make America great again either. Our traditional food is not traditional anymore we now have to follow the latest Culinary food hypes. Seaweed tacos anyone!? Turmeric, quinoa and chia seeds. We can\u2019t drink plain water or beer. No, we have to have lemon flavored water or even coconut water or fermented liquids like kombucha. The harder to pronounce the better it seems The seagull \u2014who used to be a welcome guest at our coast\u2014 is getting more and more aggressive and is now a real plague. Admiring beautiful girls in polka dots bikinis at the beach is not politically correct behavior anymore either, you need to ignore them and focus on your book. To conclude it is not as it used to be in Belgium, but if I may quote my late grandmother: \u2018If you are complaining about these little flaws, you do not have any real problems.\u2019 I guess that summarizes the situation in Belgium rather accurately.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m Belgian, and no I don't like Belgium: I know there is worse out there, way worse but Belgium is no longer safe. It's the feeding ground for terrorism and other criminal activities. Ever since we've opened our borders with the euro and not adapted our social security system, we have been overrun by bottom feeders and opportunists. We pay social benefits to people whom own property in other countries. It has been discovered that about 40 percent of people getting benefits have one or more villa or house in another country. As Belgians we pay for that ( hence the high taxes) It doesn't matter to our government that people choosing to live here commit crimes, they are hardly ever expelled or even have their social benefits retracted. When official instances are made aware of the criminal income some of their beneficiaries have, they decline to withdraw the payments because: \u201c they receive funding according to the amount of people requesting benefits\u201d Politicians are utterly uncaring about real problems and remain content as long as they fill their pockets. Their main concerns are banalities like banning words such as allochtoon and making it into multicultureel. Companies based in Belgium, doing their damnedest to stay above board and legal, are harpooned by companies from other countries ( Poland, Roumanie, Bulgaria,\u2026) who go under the possible selling price of Belgian companies, nothing is done about it. In 2017 110000 Belgian based companies didn't file their tax returns \u2026 because they are companies used as shell companies for fraude or other criminal activities. Nothing is done about it. People with social benefits can own a house (in Belgium!!!!), go on holiday 7 times a year to countries, I as a working member will never be able to afford, have 590.000 euro transferring through their bank accounts in 5 years time and no one does a thing about it\u2026 logic anyone? Preying on a social security system, while spending money like Kim kardashian? Ridiculous much? They force you to buy new cars that have a decent euro emission, yet they let the prices of suitable cars skyrocket, very motivational especially when as added bonus your non conformed car IS BANNED from big cities and you must pay a fine if you do enter. So tough luck if you can\u2019t afford buying a car that will cost you at least 15000 EUR. You want to work in a big city? Comply to the emission norms mofo!. We are one of the most expensive gas counties in the world btw. But hey we have public transportation right? Uhuh if only they weren\u2019t on strike every two seconds, or about as reliable as a voodoo witch doctor in a horror movie! Also did you know bread around here costs 2.20 euro? Do we cultivate golden grain or what? They tease you with premiums and advantages for solar panels, than they force you to pay taxes on them because they miscalculated. only to go on to the next \u201clet\u2019s scam the population plan\u201d\u2026 windmills ( trust me, those will be paying taxes soon too) They rid their overload of electricity by paying other countries to take it off our hands in the summer, too many solar panels you see\u2026 THAN they need to buy electricity in the winter because our so called nuclear reactors are failing ? Does anyone else see the irony of this?? So you pay extra in summer to get rid of your electricity that they enticed you to produce and than they make you pay AGAIN because during winter they don\u2019t have enough and need to buy elsewhere. Only in Belgium\u2026 No one else would swallow this crap\u2026 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat would happen in any other country on the mere principle of the thing\u2026 Unemployment is going everywhere because other countries around us are cheaper, way cheaper. Why pay someone double the salary if you can start a satellite company in Poland and pay the workers less tax heavy minimum polish wages? Or hell pay him under the table, no taxes necessary\u2026 We have 48 ministers ( and 10 Secretaries of State) where countries thrice our size have 8, and naturally we pay them a tax free salary of a whopping amount between 6000 and 17000 euro per month. Our prime minister earns more than the fucking president of the United States! Fun fact: our Constitution says every Belgian is equal before the law: yeah depending on which province, community or part of Belgian you live in. No one pays the same taxes, or gets the same advantages \u2026 and of course wether or not you\u2019re and immigrant or a citizen. Working paying citizens get persecuted to the extend of the law, whilst bottom feeders receive a notice to leave the country. A letter people, they receive A.LETTER. ( *facedesks*).\u2026 and of course all those nice people leave immediately. *cough* Ps did you know our country once decided to pay 580 euro PeR DAy because certain fugitive families didn\u2019t have living quarters?? Meanwhile they REFUSED to go to the barracks that were set up for them for \u201c lack of privacy\u201d and we actually swallow that shit!!! You take refuge in our country, we let you stay, provide food and shelter and than you have the AUDACITY to DEMAND better and more? Yep here it\u2019s possible\u2026 I pay 53 percent taxes on my salary. I calculated this, I don\u2019t know the percentages published but this is the amount of my wage that I don\u2019t get in hand. Single parents barely have any advantages. When a modal tax paying citizen commits a crime he'll be paying for his mistake the rest of his life. When career criminals commit crimes they keep living the life, merely because they don't have any official income, yet they earn more than we do, they just don't put it in bank accounts. They drive Audi, Mercedes or BMW. Wear Calvin Klein and Boss and not the fake stuff and manage to get paid for schticking it to the citizen. You can open bank accounts here in any name as long as you have a copy of an ID. ANY.ID\u2026 You can take out loans without ever having to see anyone in person. Seriously \u2026 Elderly People are targeted a lot here because, due to their ailments and need for dependency they confide their official documents to people whom have no qualms about abusing the weaker people in our society. Also you can deviate people\u2018s mail with one single email and no one is the wiser\u2026 you d think the government would demand banks and BE postal office to maintain stricter policy\u2026 but nooooo. Copkillers get liberated after ten years because they were sentenced to 30 years and did 1/3 of their time. one.third.!!! It has become a free loaders emperium. And the good working citizens are paying. Crime rates have shot up drastically since 2000. And we are being left behind. We are literally mopping the floor with all the taps open\u2026 In some parts of our country they don't even use the Dutch, German or French language anymore \u2026 we can't even read what's in those stores, or what service they\u2019re providing. Fun fact: They ( our government) are considering making officials speak ARAB in Brussels. I mean WTF? I\u2019m all for being client oriented but fuck, some of the effort has to come from the other side!! Drugs, terrorism, fraude are th\u00e9 most popular crimes here. We do not have a reference based home rental system, so home owners renting out their property have realistic chance of finding drug labs or cannabis plantations in them. Your ( snail) mail can easily be intercepted, since the BE postal service does absolutely nothing to secure it ( overflow bags are put into building entrances for anyone to access). This allows people to modify the account numbers on invoices or money transfer orders and send them on like nothing has happened. Belgium seems nice, Belgium seems rich but we're are going down the drain fast and no one is doing a damn thing about it. We are the most apathetic people to exist.. the worst we ever do is\u2026. \u201cgo on strike\u201d\u2026 ( omg no not a strike! That\u2019s so useful\u2026 im so embarrassed with our talent for doing nothing useful) which is the equivalent of shooting in your own foot since this only impacts the modal working citizen\u2026. Also I wanted to add that we don't really have a democratic system anymore. Why? Because very simply our votes do not count. Parties, have long upfront, decided what they need to do or have for a majority vote. If their party doesn't win they make the necessary coalitions to remain in power \u2026 it's fake and frustrating, especially when you don't have a choice wether or not you vote, since it's mandatory. Our system permits anyone to have a party in politics so there are as many parties as there are ministers \u2026 we suck. Set all that aside and you\u2019ll find yourself in a densely populated area with a \u201cme and mine first\u201d attitude that isn\u2019t exactly inviting nor pleasant. Though like for any other thing said\u2026 not everyone here is like that. Do we have social security and free health care? Absolutely! Is this a luxury? yessir mam! But the whole friggin world knows we do and comes here to take advantage of it. Do we have cheap but quality education! Yes we do!! We also have understaffed badly maintained schools with frayed and exhausted teachers who are not considered for the \u201cheavy labour\u201dprofessions due to \u201c lots of days off\u201d The fact that these teachers stand in front of classrooms with 30 or more kids, ALONE, and that they often need to work until 11 in the evening.. is of no issue whatsoever.( Fuck most of us are parents and we get tired handling two kids, for three hours after work\u2026 imagine 9 hrs a day\u2026) and that\u2019s me not mentioning the non Flemish or French or English speaking kids tossed into a 5 th grade without any former language training or discussing kids with parents WHO Do Not Speak ANY of our languages. Do we have decent salaries? Ministers and CEO with triple cumul do\u2026 us average people we get by\u2026 living in Belgium according to a normal standard will cost you at least 1600 euro per month and that\u2019s really a bare minimum. If your kid has a past time, grows and devours clothes and food, you own a car and pay rent, your average living cost will soon be 2 k per month\u2026 and I can guarantee you that the average single parent does not have 2 k per month in wages.

I fall in that same bloc but i\u2019m not really well educated , rather self educated \u2026 I could pay to go to school but since my father & his sort of wife both teached in state schools , i went on state money . No Uni for me cause i wanted to be a soldier , so i went to school there at 16 & they payed good money to wear kaki\u2019s & to feed you to the brim with great food !Healthcare for military personnel is even cheaper if you let yourself be treated by military docters , i never paid anything , never received a bill \u2026 Even your family is included (wife & kids have that choice )I lived on Base for 3 yrs in my own private studio-appartment for the monthly price of 1 visit to the barber \u2026 My meals were priced between 99 cents & 2 euro\u2019s . No car needed for groceries & the military gets you 30% off on train . To this day , 26 yrs after enlisting i\u2019ve never paid for a bus ride neither .I do not own my own house but live in social housing , for wich i pay less than the upcoming Playstation Classic . But since i had to wait for years on end to get in one , the governement pays the rent partly back for the same amount of time i had to wait (minus 5 yrs ) .These days i\u2019m an handicapped . I\u2019ve been home for 2 yrs , i\u2019d rather work but they said \u201cenough is enough\u201d ! Perhaps after brain surgery i will be able to try working again . Since i\u2019m in this position , the rent will be decreased again , no more car taxes . The healtcare association i\u2019m in has asked me to come in so they can help to get more grants & benefits . I pay no more than 1 Euro for a docters visit or meds .Although i hear many people in Belgium complain about high taxes - wich is true - i do not , most of my life i got money back \u2026 no complaints here \u2026So between Nicolas his statement on Belgium & mine we\u2019re pretty much happy & covered , i would think !Belgium has real freedom , great food , best beer & great , social people \u2026 And although grass can be greener elsewhere - not saying it is - this is pretty much the greatest small country to live !",

            "answer_text": "Hi, as king of Belgium, I feel obligated to answer your question. Belgium is an amazing country, which has a lot of special properties not found in any other country, not even in Europe. Its on the top list of developed countries, governed by democracy, a rather high level of multicultural tolerance, social solidarity and hospitality. Always on the front of innovation, founder of Europe, not taking bullying from big powers as US or Russia, or even Oil providing Middle East countries. Protecting human rights, big supporter of U.N. This all besides a very modest pride about it. But you are not asking what the good sides are. Your question stipulates how \u201cbad\u201d it is to live in Belgium. Well, lets focus on that : Living in Belgium first comes with bad weather. The climate is good for agriculture, but even summers can be as wet as winter, which can be cold, windy and dirty as just not enough freezing to keep the snow solid and clean. Although last summer was exceptional warm with the longes heatwave since long time, but thats contributed to global warming (?).Taxes are extremely high. Look up the list, Belgium is either number one or two with the highest income tax possible in the world. Its only since a few years that the highest tax scale was reduced from 60% to 50% (yes, there was a time you paid 60% of your income to taxes). And do not forget, these taxes are calculated on your income after subtraction of an already very high social security amount. So now, for 50.000euro a year, you get to keep only 29.448euro.So, as you pay much for social security, the system is very good. If you have nothing: 0euro, no house, no job, no nothing\u2026 you will still not have to sleep in the streets. But, immigrants and parasites also now this, so there is a lot of abuse. You will have to live with the fact that this foreigner with a villa or two in Morocco, gets a monthly minimum wage without working. He gets a house from social security which he pays rent 3 times less than you. He gets almost free access to public transport and medical services, which you pay for. So its only bad to live in Belgium if you have a job and work for your money.Being sick, or pretending to be, is also not bad in Belgium. The same benefits apply as described above. Being healthy on the other hand, will make you carry the burden, and you will have to be able to watch your \u201csick\u201d neighbour, who gets his monthly allowance from medical social insurance, go on holiday for mountain hiking three times a year.Belgium has three official languages. Dutch, French and German. Almost nobody speaks German so forget about that. More than half the country speaks Dutch, but when they meet another language person, they will adapt. Any foreigner that comes to Belgium, just speaks his own language, and Belgians adapt, so expect to be put in that position.Planning for houses and roads is a mess. People can build any kind of style house almost anywhere. Hence it looks like chaos. Roads are either brand new or age old, with bad maintenance. It depends on which government, county, or community needs to take care of it.Every road, how bad it may be, has lights for visibility. They were once put there partly because our nuclear power plants produced to much electricity at night which had to be spend somehow. Now, these lights, even on highways are mostly turned of, depending on the exces of electricity that is available. Now that these nuclear power plants are getting broken of old age, the next step is, to switch of entire communities to save electricity. The list in which order they will be switched of is already distributed. Expected timeframe : this november-december.If you\u2019r english language native, and used to a \u201cquerty\u201d keyboard, get ready for a change : Belgium uses the \u201cazerty\u201d keyboard layout, as in France. Main difference is that numbers are accessed through the shift-key and the general layout is different.I almost forgot, but one thing you will not understand when you live in Belgium, because its so bad, is the political system. There are 3 political regions, each with their own parlement and ministers and president. Then there is also the federal government with prime minister and parlement and chamber of representatives. And than the worse : Belgium is also a kingdom so that this guy gets the final vote on any law that has to be passed. So don\u2019t expect to know whats happening soon.And I probably forgot a number of things because I\u2019m so used to leaving here. So ask me a specific question and I\u2019ll answer :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Edit and warning: I live in the southern part of Belgium, and this country is divided in two. The north and the south do not even share the same language. My experience is with the southern part. \u2014 I\u2019m 30 and I was born in Belgium. I lived in Greece for 4 months (Erasmus program, in Thessaloniki). I visited Israel twice, and the northern part of Italy and the Netherlands briefly. About taxes : taxes are high, and I hate it, but a great part of it is actually redistributed in services. The health system is exceptionally good, while public transportation is exceptionally bad (you just can\u2019t rely on it to be at work on time, even when there is no strike). I have a friend that left for Singapore saying \u201cit\u2019s true that the health system is good, but still, is it worth that much in taxes?\u201d. The answer is, probably not. To give you an idea : with benefits from the system, my father, having no diploma, was able to raise 3 kids on a single salary and send all three of them to University. I was even allowed by the system to flunk and flunk again until I reached 26. Health : as I said, the health system is exceptionally good. You have good doctors and hospitals everywhere, and everybody can afford it. Education : the quality is probably average in a developed country, but it\u2019s very affordable. The tuition for University is around 900\u20ac a year, which makes it basically free. Housing : it\u2019s very expensive. And it\u2019s very difficult to own a house as a young worker, as the government takes 13 percent of the value of the house when you acquire it. A decent house is 200k. Which means the government is going to take 26k just to show you it can. As a relatively young worker that wants to buy a house, I find that outrageous. Prejudice : Belgium is divided in two parts. The northern part is very different from the southern part. I\u2019m a white christian, so I cannot say I encountered many prejudices based on my skin color or my religion. But I currently learn Hebrew, and I meet Jewish people at the language school. Life is clearly not fun for them in today\u2019s Belgium. They have to hide the fact they are Jewish. Also, we aren\u2019t allowed to stay in front of the school, and should disperse instead. The teacher was happy to have a policeman among its students. That\u2019s how tense the situation is for them. What makes me want to leave Belgium is the feeling of lack of opportunities, which seems to be caused by such high taxes, and the perceived lack of ambition of most people (a lot of that feeling comes from the fact people vote often for extreme leftist parties like the PTB). At the same time, I know the system gave me a lot, through health and education. So, it\u2019s all relative. Belgium is probably in the top 20 countries where life is the most comfortable and if people complain constantly, this is because life here is extremely easy. All in all, I would still leave for a country like Singapore if given the opportunity. ",

            "answer_text": "*native story, ninja cutting onions spoiler alert* I have lived in Belgium for 22 years and recently moved to the Netherlands. Belgium is great until you randomly move somewhere else and understand it\u2019s better. There are good things in Belgium, especially in Flanders, the area where I am from just looks like a massive crowd of people on Redbull, unemployment money and complaining all day long. Healthcare isn\u2019t bad, crime isn\u2019t too bad to be visible to citizens (except some famous crime infested cities, of course). Your salary and the cost of life are pretty okay if you know how to handle money. Taxes are high as hell, which would be okay if we actually saw where the money is going. I quickly realized this environment is not what will help me be happy. My uncle left Belgium around the same age as me and told me there is nothing good for me there. I moved to Utrecht, in the Netherlands earlier this year. The bus drivers are rarely on strike, the police has time to focus on accidents and bigger crimes because the city has \u201cHandhaving\u201d, people who take care of minor offences (badly parked cars, bikes, neighbour issues, etc.) People spontaneously greet you on the street or at least acknowledge you, they generally take care of their health, enjoy working and also having fun. I am not sure if it is the mentality, the history of the country or simply a more \u201cnorthern\u201d way to live, but the environment is much better. I am much happier. I am surrounded by people who are interested in what I do, people who support my activities outside of work, people who want to succeed and see others succeed. The Netherlands is a country focused on progress. All products that are lifestyle/health or technology related seem to come from the Netherlands and hit the rest of Europe afterwards. I have reached the point where I am ready to give up my Belgian nationality to get the Dutch one, without hesitation, which I will do in five years if all goes according to plan. I am ashamed and I feel sick when going back to Belgium. I see all the people that cannot reach the next step in their life because of the way they think. I believe there are good and bad people everywhere. If you see much bigger than the bigger picture, move where people have the same vision. Belgium is a broken corrupted country, a failed Beta lagging version of the Netherlands. ",

But there is always room for improvement. ",

And not to forget: a German part in the east, acquired after WW I, Belgium got a piece of Germany as a compensation. (that\u2019s why - before the Euro was introduced - there were 3 languages printed on Belgian banknotes!). There is of course a federal government as well. This means serious problems never get fully solved.- Luckily, I cannot complain about the healthcare system. ",

On the other hand, you probably cannot access the great services the government offers to their citizens, such as free education - you probably finish your education before moving to Belgium to work. In other words, you work, pay tax but did not get (all of them) back. Furthermore, as an expat who works in Belgium, you probably spend your most beautiful time (25 - 50 probably) in the country. Unfortunately, this is the period of your life that you do not need the healthcare service most. ",

Our urban and suburban planning is almost non-existent and at the same time our rules are maddeningly frustrating, which makes any sight-seeing trip a journey for unexpected and wonderful treasures among otherwise butt-ugly architecture. The business climate is equally paradoxal, it seems like everything goes and rules are laxly enforced, but at the same time entrepreneurs complain (rightly so) about harsh, complex and difficult regulations. But our cooking is the best of French cuisine served in German quantities. And we love quality and variety, so you will find plenty of other cuisines from all over the world in excellent and nice restaurants at a fairly affordable price point. Also quality of living is important to us. Houses are still fairly cheap to buy and keep.
