            "answer_text": "Development is turning raw materials (land, building materials, infrastructure) into what amounts to a new business (an apartment complex or an office building or a retail center are all businesses in the form of a building). So you need to explain to the bank how the inputs to the process can be \u201cpaid for\u201d by the business you create. That's a pro forma. The rest of the package will be explaining why the assumptions in the pro forma are correct. How do you know what the building will cost? How do your rents compare to market competition? How many tenants/sales are committed now? What insurance is needed? How much entitlement work is required and how long will that take? Who will operate this business and what are the costs of their services? What professional consultants are on your team and what is their history? You need to prove to the lenders that you've considered this proposition thoroughly and believe in the very high likelihood that this new business will be able to repay the loan. Worry less about the template and form and more about telling an easy to follow story about this new business. Generally more information is better in this case. ",
