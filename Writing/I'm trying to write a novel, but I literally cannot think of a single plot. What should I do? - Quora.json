            "answer_text": "Start with the basics. Write some nonfiction about the problems and ideas and save that in a separate folder or notebook. Make a list of conflicts which seem significant which a reader might also be experiencing or benefit from knowing about. There are themes from life. List events that do not make a lot of sense, but show up in experience or the news. Note some characters that seem out of the ordinary and may be motivated uniquely. Look at interesting places. Wonder about inventions that might cause side-effects. This could all be correspondence to a friend which is going to be the novel in this case. This is like telling it a story in pieces and it is going to have to put it together somehow. Then try some short stories on different topics. All of these are narrative points which form a platform from which something can be composed by filling in the gaps by seeing them from the perspective of a protagonist who is after something, but everything seems to be in opposition. Try some scenes, perhaps based on things they try to accomplish or arguments they get into. Look for symmetries between various things, and try contrasts and reversals to see what might happen. There might be elements from every genre in there, like a mystery, scifi, fantasy, romance, or horror. It has a lot of various emotions which can be delved into. These are all studies which will be stitched together into scenes. The theory is that plot is time. It is going to be a beginning middle end, arc, race, and so on. The narrator may not see it that way and may be trying to deceive someone. The question goes from what the author is writing to why they are. It is like guiding the audience through this thicket. Then were will be summaries to spell out. Too many words afterward means editing down the nonessential. Save the drafts. The minor characters sometimes have minds of their own. Follow the complications. Someone will finally be telling this tale for a reason. Needless to say on this site, ask a lot of questions of them. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly then you have not said your reasons for wanting to write a novel.Are you really deadly serious about this and it is not a passing fancy or sudden desire of which you have no control of? The reason I ask is that you really have to be totally committed if you are going to give yourself half a chance to succeed. Let's assume then that you are indeed serious and that you do not have any ideas whatsoever of what type of novel you want to write. Difficult this because you are the person who must have the ideas to put into writing. No one can tell you what to write. It has to be your own work.  As you say you don\u2019t know where or how to start, I feel you need to look at some basics before anything else. If it were me I would consider> why do I have this \u201cwant/need\u201d to write a novelwhat is motivating me herehow did it all start, this novel writing thinghave I got the ability to write x.000s of words - is my knowledge of grammar up to scratchhave I got the willpower to finish what I start or indeed the time to devote have I really not got any ideas at all floating around \u201cupstairs\u201d Then:I would try to remember all of the novels I had previously read. The good and the bad ones. No mean feat I can tell you.From these novels select the parts that really impressed you in any sort of way - write these downSelect the parts that did nothing to hold your interest - write these downTry to remember how the novels started, how they got you interested, how the story lines flowed culminating in the plot if appropriate, how the novels ended. You can make comparisons between the good novels and the bad novels. Make as many notes as you are comfortable with. Under no circumstances should you copy or mimic the styles of others. You need your own identity here.You then need imagination to get you started using all the information that you have absorbed whilst doing the above. This could all take some considerable time so do not expect instant results. It would be helpful if you have a close friend (s) or family member with whom you can bounce your thoughts off. Would assist in relieving any tension, stress, and tiredness  and in these early stages. If after doing the above nothing has jumped out at you to give you some inspiration and motivation to write then I would see what I could get out of the internet. You could consider googling basic stuff like:how to write my first novelhow to devise a storylinehow to devise a plotwriting my first novel but short of ideasThe 4 examples above are straight off the top of my head so do not read them as though they are the only ones. There must be hundreds more like these. Also when googling, you will probably find some of your answers will refer to books on the subject of writing a novel. Here you may find something right up your street ie tailormade for you. You never know. I am not aware of any such books so I cannot recommend here.  To finish, I think being able to sit down with an appropriate person to discuss your predicament would be invaluable at any time during your preparatory \"work\". ",
