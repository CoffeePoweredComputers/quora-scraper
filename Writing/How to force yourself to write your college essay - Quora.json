            "answer_text": "The most common way to incentivize yourself to do something you\u2019d rather not do is to promise yourself a reward once you\u2019ve completed the task. It doesn\u2019t need to be anything major (e.g. a new car) - just something you know you will look forward to an enjoy. The deeper question is working out why you are procrastinating in the first place. I\u2019ve suffered from this most of my life, and still do, and I\u2019m still not sure what drives it. To a degree, I think it\u2019s related to over-thinking things, and a desire for perfection, but I\u2019m not 100% confident that\u2019s what it is. Another tactic is to timebox your work - set yourself a deadline, or if necessary, a series of sessions if it\u2019s a long essay (or maybe one session to to the necessary research and another session to actually do the writing). It can also be helpful to use a kitchen timer, or similar - but the sound of time ticking away is what helps, because it\u2019s a constant reminder that your deadline is approaching. It is also recommended not to try to work for more than about an hour at a time (at most), after which you should take a short (e.g. 5 minutes) break before getting back to work. You may find that listening to instrumental music while you work - it does for some people, but not everybody. ",

            "answer_text": "If you first make a good plan, you won\u2019t have to force yourself to write the essay \u2014 you\u2019ll just execute step by step and feel confident along the way that you\u2019re saying what you want to say, the way you want to say it. That\u2019s the mission. First make a list of the required and supplemental/optional essays you\u2019ll have to write. There will be some overlap, so you don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel for every essay. Some of the essay questions won\u2019t have been released yet for 2019\u201320, but those will roll out in the next few months. The Common App essay topics are staying the same as last year, so you can already find out what those are for 2019\u201320. Then figure out where there\u2019s overlap, and where you might want to swap out essays (e.g. my Common App essay would work really well for the School X Supplemental essay, so I\u2019ll use that one for the Supplemental and write a different one for the Common App essay for School X). You can change up what Common App essay/topic you submit school by school, so take advantage of that flexibility. Once you have your list of topics (and which ones you\u2019ll be using for which school), identify what it is they\u2019re actually asking for. Read the questions carefully. Whatever it is they\u2019re asking (an experience that changed your perspective on something, your favorite book, or quirky ones like \u201chow is Plato like Play-Doh\u201d), remember that underneath they\u2019re always asking about *you*. So you are always the subject, no matter how they ask the question. Sometimes that takes the form of you writing about your experiences/observations, or it might be about more indirect through something external (like a book), in which case it\u2019s your opinion or insight that makes it about you. Either way, don\u2019t lose sight of the true (and constant) topic. How you write it \u2014 the voice, the tone \u2014 also makes it about you. Even if it\u2019s a particular story that someone else might cover as well, what makes it unique is that only you could have written it the way you did, and it has your voice, and it sounds like you. That means that whatever it is that you write about, it has to be *specific* and *personal*. If it\u2019s a \u201cWhy School X\u201d essay (which you\u2019ll often find in the school supplemental essays), you want to signal to the school why you and the school are such a good fit. It\u2019s not enough just to say as much; you need to back up that assertion with examples and specific reasons. That means you need to know enough about the school to make a convincing argument: the academic culture, the location, the learning environment, the kinds of students they have, a particular department or major that interests you, etc. Be as specific as you can and namecheck those specific things so that you couldn\u2019t say the same thing about its peer schools (which would make the essay too generic). You don\u2019t have to have figured out your life goals before you apply to college, but you do need to have some goals for the college experience itself. What is it you actually want to get out of college? Does it line up with what that college has to offer? If you\u2019re finding it hard to connect the two, that might be a sign that that college isn\u2019t a good fit, for you or for the school. Your college list might even change in the process, and that\u2019s OK. You can focus on career interests or academic interests or both. Include some goals for things about college life that excite you, but keep academics front and center, because college is ultimately an academic enterprise. Also important: ditch the 5-paragraph structure that they teach you for papers in school. This isn\u2019t a school paper (even if your English teacher doubling as your college counselor might be encouraging you to write it like one \u2014 no). In a personal essay this short, you do not need an intro (paragraph 1), three points (paragraphs 2\u20134), and then a conclusion (paragraph 5). That\u2019s not how you tell a story, and a college application essay is fundamentally about telling a story. The 5-paragraph structure is deathly dull for application essays \u2014 they honestly made we want to stick a fork in my eyes when I was reading thousands of them back to back. Begin with an opener that grabs the reader, and end with a closer that releases a reader. Under no circumstances should you use an introduction that is a preview of the essay or a conclusion that is a summary of the essay. That\u2019s the 5-paragraph standard coming back from the grave. Kill it. And finally, don\u2019t let the grown-ups in your life, who are probably more risk averse and haven\u2019t been admissions officers, scrub the voice from the essay that is distinctly yours. That goes for topics too, because teenagers don\u2019t sound like middle aged people (I know, right?). For example, I once read an essay about a student who founded the model UN club at his school and he was proud of being a \u201cchange agent\u201d and of all the \u201csweat equity\u201d he had put into it; I\u2019m guessing dad had a heavy hand in the essay. Don\u2019t let that happen. Your voice gives the essay personal authenticity. That\u2019s so important. The admissions officer wants to get to know you, not your parents (or whomever). I have a LOT to say on the subject but I hope that gives you something motivates you \u2014 if done right, this should even feel a bit fun, not something to dread. :) ",
