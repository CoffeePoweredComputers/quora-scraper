            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been a while since I had need for using any of the websites, so this information may be a bit dated. But back when I last needed to go hunt for new penpals, I quite liked InterPals Penpals. It had tons of active members with a good spread both across geography, gender and age.Powerful search function that makes it fairly easy to find people that may be a good match for you.Low amounts of spam, and reasonable privacy-controls to keep away people you\u2019re NOT interested in. (it\u2019s a sad fact of life in international penpalling that especially if you\u2019re a young first-world woman you\u2019ll otherwise get a lot of messages from men in poorer countries who are trying to use the penpal-site as a dating-site)I have no clue whether or not it\u2019s the best site though, there may well be others that work even better. But it\u2019s served my needs well and I think unless the site has somehow deteriorated a lot in the last few years it\u2019s likely to work well for you too. ",

It\u2019s really easy to fund friends on it because it\u2019s for people who are both interested about looking for penpals. It\u2019s really easy to use and has heaps of internet safety guides which is also good. ",
