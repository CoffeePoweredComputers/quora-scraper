            "answer_text": "My data is anecdotal and dated, but back in the 80's when I was a student it was not uncommon for women to wait until things got so hot and heavy they thought you no longer possessed any self control. Then they would spring the good old \u7d50\u5a5a\u306e\u524d\u63d0\u3067\u306d meaning \"on condition we get married\" on you. There is no bigger turn off than a woman using sex as a weapon to control you, instant limpness will commence. At the time my vocabulary was too limited to explain what just happened to me emotionally and physically, so I took the time and effort to study some phrases and idioms, this was not easy since all my teachers were females, that would explain to her (any potential partner) that a woman that puts preconditions on a relationship will not have much of a relationship.It required trial and error over several months until I got it right, but in the end it was worth it, saved me a lot of hassles. The point being that while premarital sex may be frequent it is also used for ulterior motives. Caveat emptor. ",

            "answer_text": "In the 21st Century I would say virtually non-existent. While you may find the Japanese not as sexually active than their European or American counterparts, that in no way means they ever had much of a problem with pre-marital sex. It\u2019s not like the Japanese are very religious (one of the least religious in the world) and you\u2019re not taught to stay celibate either. If the media, anime, manga, movies and magazines are somewhat reflective of Japanese society, I\u2019m sure you would agree that Japan is actually one of the most sexually diverse cultures in the world going back centuries (that\u2019s another topic entirely so feel free to to do a separate search).
