            "answer_text": "Some ignorant, racist and romanticized or mythologized replies here and some decent, honest accurate replies. Native Peoples of the Americas go back 20,000 to 30,000 years that evidence can be found. That is enough \u201ctime\u201d to be considered \u201cIndigenous\u201d but these days any little leverage or a little nugget of \u201cinformation\u201d to back political spouting off that, \u201cWe are all immigrants to America\u201d or \u201cAll people migrated from somewhere\u201d will continue until the aliens (ET\u2019s) land. So, the argument will continue indefinitely. Americans don\u2019t want to feel guilt and so nation building mythologies have been created from Columbus (who had nothing to do with the United States) to the Founding Fathers to Manifest Destiny to Cowboys & Indians, whatever. So while these folks argue over who and what is American, they can not comprehend or deal with realities on the ground. Native populations have been walking, moving and yes, migrating, up & down the continents for thousands of years, which \u201cbeats\u201d the Euro-American presence of a mere 400\u2013200 years (talking North America now). So what is the current argument that immigration or migrant flow has become a problem? America is made up of immigrants from all over the world! So rather it is a political argument and sides are taken, so one side says \u201cAmerica is Full & your kind need not apply to\u201d the other side which says \u201cWhat about our founding principles as written in the founding documents & espoused on the Statute of Liberty?\u201d Peoples moved and migrated and were forced to move or were assimilated in Europe, Asia and Africa too. There was no White Race or White Nation, but English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Greek, Russian, Nordic, Slavic all related or not, who became neighbors or nationals or foreigners within Europe until technical innovations and plagues or disease and industrial revolution compelled peoples to move & migrate. So has the United States of America become a White Nation only for whites & Christians? That argument goes against the great melting pot theory (religiously taught in nation-building myths in all schools), so we quickly see people disavowing that concept for another that goes against mythology to try and rationalize new agendas. The Know Nothing Party was the first \u2018America First\u2019 anti-immigrant one-issue party and if course considered themselves \u201cNative\u201d Americans. (See the film, Gangs of New York.) In their answers, Sandbrook and Borreson state grounded and cogent research as to habitation of the Americas. Our people\u2019s oral traditions about migrations and stories about the land are sometimes proven true with modern discoveries. Our routes have been underwater since our ancestors hugged the shores but certain areas were never submerged. Yes, waves of peoples created varying conditions of cultural conflict but the Idea of America has always been wide open so people moved by choice or by being compelled. Even now, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Openness\u201d is a feature touted by both sides, until it\u2019s not and it\u2019s too crowded and we got to ship people away or turn them back. Unless they\u2019re from Norway or England? History says people move and nations fall and countries change. Why not say we are all in this together and be ahead of the curve? Kind of like flatten the curve and make it last longer, or, ride the curve high then fall fast as Empire collapses. ",

            "answer_text": "Biogenetic evidence suggests that most indigenous populations of the Americas derive from populations which crossed into Alaska/Yukon somewhere between 30,000 and 22,000 years ago. There is evidence for multiple back migrations, and break-out from Alaska/Yukon past the Cordillera/Laurentian ice sheets no less than 16,500 years ago. There were certainly later migration waves such as the Thule migration into the Canadian high arctic circa ~1,000 CE, and they apparently did displace the earlier Dorsett people. And when the ice free corridor opened between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets some 12,000 years ago, there was apparently another migration wave from Alaska-Yukon (as evident from XRF analysis of obsidian artefacts, linguistics, and the great difference between Alberta and Clovis points), and dispersed into the interior possibly as far as Mexico. Also, this isn\u2019t so much something that people think as archaeologists. I\u2019m pretty sure most people think nothing of this at all. ",
