Dear Harikirtan, I don\u2019t mean to prevaricate but I believe either would pass muster if they were spoken, (or perhaps I mean \u2018pass unnoticed\u2019). Personally, I feel, there is more sense of movement with the expression \u201cnewly-found\u201d and since it is obviously about \u2018change\u2019 itself, it would feel to me to carry more weight. Certainly though, the adjective \u2018newfound\u201d is all one word, as a rule, is all one word and possibly this is why I find it less emphatic. I hope you are happy, well and SAFE. You are the future of our World. ",

            "answer_text": "My old style guide \u2014 A Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage, 1957 says, \u201cThe form new may be used as an adjective to qualify a noun. Either form may be used to qualify a participle. New is preferred with short familiar words, as in new laid eggs, new born child or new baked bread. Newly is preferred with longer less familiar words, newly discovered pride, newly furnished rooms. But I\u2019m not sure that was good advice when when they wrote it. In a different dictionary, I find \u201cnewly baked bread\u201d as an example of the use of \u2018newly\u2019. I do find dictionary entries for \u201cnewfound\u201d as a single word, non hyphenated. Likewise, in a \u201cnewborn child\u201d, \u2018newborn\u2019 is one word, usually without a hyphen. . The only compound word I find based on \u2018newly\u2019 is \u2018newlywed\u2019., and no hyphenated uses. I think you can choose between \u201cmy newly found career choice\u201d and \u201cmy newfound career choice.\u201d No hyphens in either. ",
