            "answer_text": "Probably, but if you are caught then you will be kicked out of the courses in genuine Australian education institutions. This is a standard that has been held from Britain for a long time - each student must do their own study, research and assignments as qualifications in Britain and the West must be genuinely earned. So, any attempts and plagiarism (copying) and paying for assignments to be done or brides to markers and teachers is still morally and ethically unacceptable and rightly so! So, the answer is yes but watch out you do not get caught - you will never be able to publish in the West and probably never be able to study genuinely in the West again. Traditions are there for a good reason. ",

Not in the least bit. You\u2019ll fail the assignment, more than likely fail the course, and quite possibly get kicked out of the university. If you\u2019re here on a student visa, you might want to book your flight home, too, since your visa will be cancelled. ",
