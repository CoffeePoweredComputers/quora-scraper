            "answer_text": "Amazon makes it pretty easy, in that the content guides help you format, and prepare a manuscript. There still is the cover art that you must either make yourself (not advised) or have done. With so many freelance sites and group sharing on social media it is pretty easy to find a cover artist you like the style of, but it will cost some money to get this done. With cover and manuscript in place, and following some simple tutorials (amazons or YouTube and other platforms are full of how to format for KDP and upload) you can it done. Please remember the REAL elephant in the room is, can you stay disciplined enough to write something worth reading?
