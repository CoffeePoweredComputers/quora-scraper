            "answer_text": "First answer the question of WHY (specifically) you feel the need to write such letter. The reason I ask is to make the letter more authentic. (More personal than the greeting card blurbs). Some of the obvious reasons may be: You\u2019re feeling greater love for her because of something she has done, or is doing now, that makes you proud of her. You may be feeling a bit of guilt for some bad action you have done recently. You may have just recently come to your senses and realize you\u2019re in a very happy place with her by your side. Start your letter elaborating on one of the above. For example. Case 1: Praise. \u201cHoney, I\u2019m so proud of you because (insert her action s or attributes that makes you proud)\u201d Case 2: Acknowledgement: \u201cDarling, I am so grateful that you (insert the act that she did to make you admire her even more). Your unselfish personality makes living with you an absolute joy. Case 3. Happiness: Dearest, I am just so happy to be by your side. You make my life worthwhile. Each day I look forward to just be sharing it with you. Case 4: Apologize: Apologize for a misdeed that you committed. Note: Even if you believe that you did not make a \u201cmisdeed\u201d apologize anyway. As long as SHE believes you acted inappropriately, you must apologize. Example: \u201cHoney, I am so very sorry about our misunderstanding concerning (insert topic). I realize I could have handled it better. Our relationship is just too important to let this matter fester any further. I love you dearly and hope you will accept my apology accordingly. (If she responds, either verbally or with a reply note, you can be sure you did the right thing.) Second Paragraph: (Tell her again how you feel. Use words that are positive and emits love images. Be general.) Example\u201d I really want you to know how much I appreciate, trust, and respect you. You\u2019re my rock that I can depend on and I\u2019m so very happy with you. Your love is my bliss. Your Loving Husband, Eric Note to Eric: The letter need not be long. Actually, Should not be a long letter. Every sentence should be upbeat, positive, happy, loving, etc. Some things not to do: Do not include any defensive statements, no matter how subtle or ambiguous. Such as \u201cYou\u2019re such a good Mother to our kids until it\u2019s time for me to put them to bed.\u201d Being defensive will only buy you a bigger doghouse. The most important advice I can give to any man about keeping a relationship in good standing is: learn to apologize. (I\u2019ve been there done that) It is very important for two reasons. 1) It is one of the hardest actions that a man can do. The typical man would rather visit his dentist than to make an apology. 2) An \u201capology\u201d has a different meaning to a woman than to a man. Women want to be recognized and appreciated. Apologizing to your woman lifts her self-esteem thereby lifting her love and respect for you. A man just wants to win the argument, with or without an apology. An analogy to this advice would be when a woman stokes a man\u2019s ego by telling him how intelligent or gifted he is, when in fact she feels he is a dunderhead. Hmmmm. Note to self: Maybe write a book titled, \u201cLying Your Way to Love\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Alisa Hope you are doing good. It's been a long time, we haven't talked. You are a very good friend of mine. You have helped me numerous times and you have always been there for me whenever I was in need. Well, you might be wondering why I am telling all these things to you. You know, you are the one who listens to me every time, no matter how boring or rubbish I am talking. That's it, I have something to tell you today, please listen to me and help me in the way you always do. One of my closest friends was asking me today if I am going to propose someone this Valentine's week? He was also asking me if I have ever fallen in love with a girl? I was about to tell him, \"Yes!! There is a girl and she is very special for me, much more special than anyone else in this world. I really love her to the moon and back. But unfortunately, I haven't got any chance yet to tell her what my heart is saying for a long time. Most of the times, I am afraid, what if she would lose her temper after listening to me? Or what if, she would never talk to me again or she would do something even worse?\" I want to tell you about that girl Alisa. You have always given me honest opinions and pieces of advice. Please help me in resolving this one indeed. I think that this would be the biggest and most important advice, which I am going to get from your side. Please tell me, if that girl would be the proper match for me or not. Alright, without wasting much time let me tell you, why did I fall in love with her? 1. I like her name really so much. Every time I call her by name, I get butterflies in my stomach. ( I know, if a girl is having a good name, it doesn't necessarily mean she would be having a good soul also. But anyways..) 2. She is beautiful. She is very beautiful. She is as beautiful a Barbie doll coming from heaven. Every time I look at her, I just lost myself in her divine beauty. Her eyes, as beautiful and glittering as a diamond in a huge mere. Her smile, so genuine that I always fall in love with her every time I look at it. The way she talks to me, the way she helps the needy... really makes me fall much more for her every time. 3. She is a girl with an amazing soul. She is not only externally beautiful but is the same from inside also. 4. I like the way she never gets angry from me, no matter how much rubbish I am talking to her. She is always kind to me (also to everyone) and understands all my feelings, my goods and bads. Alisa, I really can't express in words why do I love her? If would write 100000s of words, still I wouldn't be able to express 'how much she is special for me'. I just want to tell you, that I really love her so much. I would always care for her, I would never hurt her, I would never make her cry, I would fulfill all her wishes, I would never ever cheat on her. I want her to be my permanent, I want her to be with me till my last breath, I want her to become my better half. I just want to tell her, every time she's with me I feel like I am at the eleventh hour, or I am on the seventh heaven. Every time she breaks into laughter, I just feel my life to be beyond 'serene'. Every time she is hurt a bit, I cry my heart out. Alisa. That girl is much similar to you, that girl's name is as lively as yours. Oh God, let me not beat around the bush. I love you, Alisa. Will you be my valentine? Yours permanent Anant Vyas Share and upvote if you like Full post ",

I miss you when you aren't here. My favorite days are the ones we can wake up together. I love the days when we have time to drink coffee and talk. I love you for so many reasons. You are always there when I need you. Always a phone call away. When you call me in the middle of the day just to see how I am doing it melts my heart. I can't wait for you to get home. We laugh and joke about how much we spend time together. We always laugh when we are in sync. When we say the same thing at the same time. Even when we do something at the same time and exchange looks like really. We always have fun together. It may not always be easy but we end up laughing later. We don't celebrate most holidays or even participate in the commercial ones. This week will be amazing and a ton of fun. Thank you for always making me smile. ",
