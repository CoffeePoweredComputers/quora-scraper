            "answer_text": "Missing work is pretty cut and dried. You either missed work or you didn't. If you did, there is no way to exculpitate yourself. If you didn't, then there is nothing to worry about. Maybe you just want to explain the circumstances around why you missed work. If this is the case, then you are throwing yourself upon the mercy of the person you are appealing to. You will not be able to do this if you deny the fact that you missed work. A \u201ccharge letter\u201d sounds like a formal document that is already on file with your company. You cannot get rid of that without using a time machine, and i don't think they have been invented yet. However, you might be able to convince your human resources department to attach your letter describing your reason in this case. If your superior filed this letter without first asking for your explanation, then you should ask yourself whether this is the right company for you. Maybe you should look for a company that doesn't mind if you don't show up after you have made a commitment to do so; or a company with a superior who checks with you before committing you to a schedule.

            "answer_text": "You are being disciplined for what ever amount of time you didn\u2019t report for work without management permission . . . (1) If your employer has a disciplinary policy, you should follow the guidelines to obtaining a hearing. Bring what you have for documented evidence and/or witnesses to defend yourself. A letter isn\u2019t necessary, unless it is needed to request such a hearing. (2) I assume you wouldn\u2019t be asking this question if your work place was unionized. Your union representative would follow contractual grievance guidelines. Your union officials and yourself are legally obligated to function within such agreement procedures. (3) If you are working for a non-unionized company that has no written disciplinary procedure, then you use your best judgement. A letter in itself may not do you any good. It may need paper evidence and/or witness statements to prove your justification in breaching your commitment to report for work as mutually agreed upon. Many small businesses do not have the finesse to author a disciplinary procedure for employees. Owners may feel the small workforce they maintain does not require such larger company disciplines. Also, many small business owners (some State labor laws empower them) feel it is entirely within their power and employer rights to be arbitrary when it concerns executing discipline. (4) Lastly, are you guilty? If so, take your punishment. Move-on, prove you are sorry by showing-up on time; doing your work as expected; and not vocalizing your frustration among fellow workers for being justifiably disciplined. ",
