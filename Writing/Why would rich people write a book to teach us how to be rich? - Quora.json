            "answer_text": "People tend to think wealth is a zero sum game. We often think that, if one person has become wealthy, they must have had to climb over others.  Or they think that one of the results of one person becoming wealthy is that many other people have to languish in want. This is one of the main fallacies of communism and class envy. When one becomes wealthy, they in fact usually bring a lot of others with them. Bill Gates is a multi-billionaire and he created many millionaires in addition to many upper middle class professionals.  This did nothing to diminish his wealth. In fact, putting talented individuals into positions where they could become wealthy, elevated his own wealth further. If Bill writes a book telling others how he made his fortune, this does not put his own fortune in danger. In fact, it is more likely it will elevate his status further.  Now, to be sure, there are pretenders who write books telling people how to get rich, who are only trying to get rich themselves. If someone says \"Buy my program on how to become a millionaire by the time you're 40,\" you're right to be skeptical. They might just be trying to get rich themselves by charging everyone $300 for a multi-media kit on how to get rich. Getting rich is a tempting commodity to sell. But for the most part, helping others toward prosperity does nothing to diminish one's own wealth, and can even elevate that person's wealth and status.   ",

            "answer_text": "What.... Hahahahahahahahahahah. Dude, richness isn't about stealing. What is wrong with you? First rule of being rich is this: don't blame other people for your lack of success. Do that, and then you won't think making money is about taking other peoples' stuff. Imagine you are a husband, and that you are happy. Should you teach some of your skills to your wife, so that she can be happy too? Won't that make you less happy? Imagine you are an actor. Should you teach other actors in your movie how to improve? Won't that make your performance weaker? You are running a company. Should you tell your underlings how to improve? Won't that make you less relevant? Or more? You are a person in a society. You know what you are doing. Should you share what you know? How does that help you? The very act of helping is good. Teaching teaches the self. We learn by teaching. Even if you teach a direct competitor he will likely inspire you more. If he takes you out of the game, then you deserve to go anyway. You just can't cut it anymore. Normally teaching goes out to people who won't ever compete with you. Though competition is good. The essence of capitalism is based on this idea, that competition improves the marketplace. If you think capitalism is bad, then your a socialist. Communism failed, or didn't you hear? The United States, for example, is based on the idea of healthy competition. If one guy stands to beat you, then you have to improve to beat him. You can't help but share your ideas because anyone can just look at you and learn from you, and then outperform you, if they know what they are doing. ",
