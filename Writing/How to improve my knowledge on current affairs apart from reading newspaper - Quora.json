Actually it is not the case.What one require is active reading where one ask question about the topic for example odd even policy require question like what was the policy, how was it implemented, its success, failures, etc. One should follows simple three point method as follows: - Make a list of topic you want to cover- list down all the topics important topics. Remember everything is not important. These may include comments, page 3 news etc. - Researching about the topics- research should be done to answer questions framed on the topic as mentioned above. you can diverge from the Newspaper to include magazines, internet, etc. The researched material should be summarized in your own words - Revising- the summary made at proper intervals. Use Spaced Repetition for maximum retention i.e. revise in interval of 1 day, 1 week, 1 month.  ",

            "answer_text": "Gk is a very interesting and dynamic subject and its nice to hear that you have the habit of reading newspapers because when you are reading newspapers you are gaining almost all the knowledge at one place still you can surely improve your source by taking into consideration about these things : I personally prefer to watch good channels like National Geographic or History channel because they provide content in a very interesting wayInternet is something which has both pros and cons so instead of pointlessly scrolling for other websites you can watch GK blogs like Indibix which has separate folders for each area and CA of last 6 monthsIf you are an active user of FB , Linkedin then use these social apps in an innovative way by seeing the important news or turn on the notifications for the news so that you are updated each hourWhen I am running out of time , I read headlines from the Inshorts app which you can also refer if you want .Manorma yearbook is the golden book which is unbeatable in the field of Gk because they provide information about anything and everything .Scrolling in Youtube for songs and trailers is nice but you can use the same Youtube for seeing educational videos , channels like STUDYIQ , GRADEUP etc will be really useful for you . I hope it helps :)",
