            "answer_text": "You can learn how to write a script and understand the dos and don\u2019ts of screenplay writing. To be a script writer, one needs the following qualifications: Patience, because your story won\u2019t reach perfection overnight. It takes time and many drafts to get it right.Persistence, for when you have all those naysayers trying to discourage you from pursueing your project,Practice by writing out descriptions that are visually concise and familiarise yourself with the script writing format and the story structure of a movie, andProblem solving skills, for when the readers point out problem areas, you will need your problem solving skills - Take a problem solving class if you have to.It is a competitive market within the industry and only 1 out of 10 scripts that are written get produced. Sad and frustrating, but true. However, if you have the financial backing of someone or if you are able to fund the project yourself, then find out what the audience knows on a particular subject or topic that you are planning on writing for and then present it to your target audience in a creative way. You will also need to practice learning to write out descriptions that are visually concise. Meaning, your descriptions need to be saying the same thing as anything that is written in prose, but more concise. This allows the reader to visualize what you are showing. Because you are writing for movies, and the fact that they are presented via a visual medium, you will need to abide by the axiom: show, don\u2019t tell.Do a combination of reading scripts and watching the movies rather than just watching the movies and start writing. Reading scripts of popular movies or your favorite movie even, will give you some idea of how things are described. You will be able to visualize it yourself and understand how the reader in the industry does it.Stay away from anybody who gives you this piece of worn out advice to aspiring writers: \u201cwrite what you know\u201d. I say, \u201cwrite what the audience knows\u201d and \u201c know what you write\u201d. You can still have an original idea and write what the audience knows.Also stay away from the over used \u2018boy meets girl\u2019 premise in your movies, as well as glorifying anything that happens in everyday life. Doing so, you won\u2019t be doing yourself any favors - it is pretty competitive after all.Don\u2019t just follow what other popular screenwriters and filmmakers are doing, because you won\u2019t have your own voice and identity that way.",

            "answer_text": "Though I am not a writer, but I think you can take help from lot of online courses available. Below are few links. Also please check AIB (All India Bakchod) - Yes those same folks who create funny and humorous videos, they organize and fund (all expense paid) 6 months training on screen writing. So if you feel/think you have that in you. Please apply and check. Also one of the great place to start learning is to look for novels/stories those are converted into film. Read novels and watch film and see how is it done. I think you don't need much investment for that and you can start doing it right away. For example Jhumpa Lahri \"Namesake\" is made into movie, or Chethan Bhagat's many novels are made into movie. So look at it and start learning. Here is the link...AIB: http://aibfirstdraft.com/ Online courses (Few links - but rest you can start searching on google). https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/screenwriting http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/opportunities/introduction-to-screenwriting https://www.nyfa.edu/online-screenwriting/ It all boils down to your strong urge to learn - you will figure out the way soon. All the best. ",
