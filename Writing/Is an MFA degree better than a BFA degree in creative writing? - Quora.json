            "answer_text": "Well, considering a BFA is an undergraduate degree and the MFA is a graduate degree, the short answer is yes. Of course, the quality of the program has a lot to do with it, too. For argument's sake let's assume we're talking about an MFA and BFA from the same institution. (Note: it's generally not a good idea to study for your MFA where you did your undergrad creative writing degree). Consider, the MFA is a degree sought by adults who have chosen to pursue their craft. More, students have been accepted solely on the quality of their work (as opposed to test scores, etc). They are vetted by the program (often by the teachers). The expectations for their work and work ethic are higher. I teach in an undergraduate creative writing program and in a low residency MFA program. The calibre of my students in the MFA, both in their writing and in their ambition is much higher. ",
