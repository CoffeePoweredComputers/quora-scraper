            "answer_text": "As Ugur Akunchi pointed out, both need corrections, though they are found in day to day usage. Accordingly, at least, the following corrections are certainly on: \u201c\u2026 as best as they could \u2026\u201d and \u201c\u2026 the best that they could \u2026\u201d.  Further, \u2018best\u2019 is the superlative degree of the adjective \u2018good\u2019, and it also means \u2018better than all of (some specified or implied) others\u2019. For correct use of superlative degree, it is essential that the sentence specify or identify the lot with which a comparison was being contemplated. Thus, \u201cHe is a best student.\u201d is wrong, because best can be one and only be one. \u201cHe is the best student.\u201d is also wrong, since best \u2018from out of which lot\u2019 is not specified; for example, best (of all students) in the class, in the school, during the year, et c. Best means \u2018better than all else\u2019, and better means \u2018more good compared to some (specified) other(s)\u2019. The phrase in your example, therefore, could be: \u201cas well as they could\u201d. or \u201cthe best (of all) that they (possibly) could\u201d. The latter version has words in parentheses which are implied, whether stated, muted, or unstated. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say neither is correct grammatically, even though I\u2019m sure you hear both of those usages frequently in everyday exchanges. The grammatically correct form is \u201cas best as they could\u201d since the clause is most probably a part of an invisible sentence that compares one thing with another. The full open form of this sentence is probably something like \u201cThey answered the question as best as they could,\u201d comparing their current performance with their potential best. Both \u201cas best they could\u201d and \u201cthe best they could\u201d are truncated and more popular versions of \u201cas best as they could.\u201d So at the end of the day and from a purely practical point of view, you can say that both are correct.
