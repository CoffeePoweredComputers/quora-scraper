            "answer_text": "Ask yourself, How? Why? and So?  I like to use an analogy when I'm discussing supporting sentences with my middle school students. I have a three-year-old daughter, and anyone who's ever had a conversation with a three-year-old will tell you they're constantly asking questions, and they're never satisfied with a simple answer. They'll always ask why? \u201cDaddy, why are you on your computer?\u201d \u201cI'm entering grades, baby girl.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause I need to enter grades before next week.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause Monday is the last day of the semester, and my grades have to be in before the end of the semester.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause if grades aren't in before the end of the semester, students won't have grades on their report cards.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u2026 You get the idea. My point is that, in theory, she'll always be able to follow up my answer with a why. There are infinite layers of information she'll attempt to dig into, regardless of how unnecessary or irrelevant that information is. This is the function of your supporting sentences. You are anticipating your reader asking \u201cwhy?\u201d and you're providing the answers and evidence up front. Here's the exercise I give my students. Begin with your topic sentence, then provide an example or evidence. After you've given your example or evidence, ask yourself three questions: Why? How? and So? Then answer them in a supporting sentence. If you do this once or twice for each example you give, you'll be on your way to providing sufficient development for your ideas. Here's an example. Topic sentence: Quora is a great forum for improving your writing. Why? and How? For example, Quora allows people to write about topics for which they can share personal experience or expertise. So? When people are knowledgeable about, or engaged in, the topic they're writing about, they tend to write better quality content. Why else? In addition, Quora allows the community to suggest edits to users\u2019 writing. So? These edits can help improve the quality of a user\u2019s writing while reinforcing grammar, spelling, and punctuation rules. If you were to remove the questions and consolidate the information above, you'd have a decent little paragraph about how using Quora can improve your writing. Ask yourself Why? How? and So? as you write, and writing supporting sentences becomes pretty straightforward. As you practice, it'll become second nature. ",

            "answer_text": "When you're in doubt, always go back to what your writing teachers should've taught you in jr high (hopefully sooner): outlining. Any good explanation in writing will always have a basic thesis, a core idea that you can beat like a drum. You can make that thesis mostly factual, but there's usually at least a little of your own opinion, your own views in it. The more controversial it is, the more effort it will take to make your point with supporting sentences. But those supporting sentences will be what gives real value to your writing. Let's choose this (yawn!) thesis to demonstrate supporting sentences: \u201cPotluck dinner parties are a great way to make new friends.\u201d Without the word \u201cgreat,\u201d this would be a fact, not an opinion, so our task is to come up with reasons why they\u2019re great. Of course, you can replace \u201cgreat\u201d with any adjective you wanted- \u201cterrible,\u201d \u201cimpossible,\u201d \u201cthe best,\u201d etc. It's your thesis, it's your choice. The word why is crucial here, so if we make a list of reasons, the simplest way to come up with those reasons is to start with \u201cbecause\u201d. Potlucks are great \u2026 because: Everyone likes/needs to eat.Everyone brings their favorite dishes.You\u2019re already friends with the person who invited you.The variety of food is usually amazing.Dinner discussion is automatically built in: \u201cHow did you make this?\u201dIf you don't like one or two of these 5 supporting sentences, don't use them. But once you have a thesis, the numbers three to five are the magic numbers here. If you can't think of at least 3 good supporting sentences, at least 3 good \u201cbecauses,\u201d then your thesis is too narrow, too hard to defend, not something you're familiar with, or there's some other problem. Find a way to broaden your central message so you can think of three to five good \u201cbecauses.\u201d On the other hand, if you can think of six or more of the best \u201cbecauses\u201d in world history, then you really have two (or more) papers, and you might need to pick and choose the three to five that best make your case. Here, you might limit yourself to the social reasons only, and ignore the food. Or focus on the food and let that naturally create a good social atmosphere that helps you make friends. But never six becauses, ever. Now then, your teacher might appreciate getting two papers, two pieces of homework from you\u2026 or maybe not. Some teachers insist on brevity, that you keep it short and simple. That puts more pressure on you to come up with the best becauses you can. And never forget: the essence of good writing is rewriting. Rough drafts, second rewrites, and all those good things? They're good things. For now, the structure is important. And so far, we have a central idea/thesis that fits with what you know and have experienced, and three to five good reasons for your readers to want to agree with you. Remember the outline comment at first? Now we\u2019re getting to the point where this really is helpful. Everyone likes/needs to eat.If you're not enjoying meals, if the action of chewing and swallowing food is not pleasurable for you, please see a doctor or psychiatrist at your earliest convenience. Arguing against the desire and need for food should be a really dead end street. That's why this is probably a good #1 because sentence. You want to argue with this idea? You're going to lose. Nutrition, international cuisine, recent new menu items, and all sorts of other interesting ideas can get shoehorned into your first paragraph. Avoid the obvious or trite ideas (\u201cBabies love to eat, and so do we!\u201d or \u201cWhat would life be without food?\u201d), and try to find newsy sorts of ideas about liking or needing food. Cultural dietary rules, different central dishes in a meal in different countries, how we think of things as \u201cfood\u201d or \u201cnot-food,\u201d or whatever ideas can get your reader nodding along with you- that\u2019s what should fill this paragraph (or two, or three). Don't forget to rewrite. Let things sit at least overnight after your first draft. You might be surprised at how a few hours away from writing will help you write more, faster and more easily, later. 2. Everyone brings their favorite dishes. Just in case your reader isn't familiar with potluck dinners, here's a chance to inform him/her. Maybe you've been to a more unusual potluck dinner, or even a progressive dinner, or some such chance to meet new people and make new friends. Here's your chance to \u201chook\u201d your reader\u2019s interest in your message. So the real challenge is to put something new and different in front of your audience. Personal experiences here are the best. If you say, \u201cOnce, I did\u2026,\u201d only a fool is going to argue that you didn't. 3. You're already friends with the person\u2026 Here's your chance to go into the process of how we make new friends. Our friends\u2019 friends become our new friends, we find people with the same interests, a full stomach makes us more accepting of new challenges, etc. Each of your three to five reasons for your central thesis can become a short essay by itself. You want your reader either impressed with your new information for him/her, or you want your reader nodding in complete agreement. Or both. ",
