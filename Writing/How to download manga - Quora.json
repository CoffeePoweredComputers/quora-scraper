            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know how broad or good Android manga apps are. As an iOS user, I\u2019ve been very pleased with Manga Rock Premium. You can read literally any manga you can think of. (From big-hit mainstreams like Naruto and One Piece to not well-known doujinshis) You can download unlimited number of mangas for offline reading. The app shows you notifications of updates from your favorite mangas, and will download new episodes automatically if you wish. The reading experience it gives is the best I\u2019ve had so far. There are a variety of reading options that will satisfy your needs. While iBooks sell a volume for around $10, you can read unlimited volumes in Manga Rock with a one time payment. Obviously, it\u2019s a huge difference. If you\u2019re a heavy manga fan and want to enjoy the best Manga reading experience on digital, I suggest you go buy Manga Rock Premium with a one time payment of $6.99 on the App Store. You won\u2019t regret it! Note one thing, however, that if you\u2019re looking for manhwa more than manga, Manga Rock isn\u2019t the best option. ",

If you mean you want to steal manga by torrenting it(which i\u2019m not accusing you of by any means, just putting it out there), then I can\u2019t help you, because only scum would steal from a hard-working mangaka.
