I know the rough yearly incomes from friends and acquaintances who make their entire income from drawing caricatures for companies that rent spaces at theme parks - they make anywhere from 15\u201330 grand and maybe another 3\u20136 grand drawing at events. 60\u2013100 grand and up is doable for individuals at non-theme park locations that have steady, non-seasonal clientele. 40\u201380 grand and up for caricature artists who travel from fair to fair nationwide, setting up caricature booths at each location. 40\u201380 grand for caricature artists who entertain at events in areas with large populations, and 20\u201330 grand in less populated areas. These are my general estimates based on working for one year at Seaworld and 22 years working as an independent entertainer and illustrator in Southern California\u2026  ",
