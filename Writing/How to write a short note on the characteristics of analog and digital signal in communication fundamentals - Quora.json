            "answer_text": "The first thing you\u2019d need is a correct understanding of the nature of these two types of information encoding, which unfortunately very few - even many in the engineering community, who SHOULD really know better - seem to possess. Here are a couple of warning signs: if you read or hear someone saying such things as \u201canalog provides infinite resolution\u201d or that somehow \u201creality IS inherently \u2018analog\u2019 in nature,\u201d you are dealing with someone who really does not understand the fundamentals of these two systems. With that said, I will humbly submit the following as at least a starting point: Bob Myers's answer to What does analog mean and how does it differ from digital? ",

            "answer_text": "I would keep it simple and use AM and FM radio encoding as a simple, easy to understand example. Explain why AM has static while FM doesn\u2019t. If you need a more complete answer and examples, you can move into a more complex answer and explain the reasons digital applications enabled the information era. An interesting side note is that the first IBM commercial mainframe had only 128K of main memory. ",
