(prompting my own circular ponderings ~ what do we want jail and prison to be? rehabilitation? punishment? both? and when full term has been served, when, if ever, is a second chance at employment warranted? also, \"criminal\" history includes so fucking MANY things that do not reflect being a danger to others. and we want people to move forward in work and life, yet even when people serve their full sentences, their history so often remains a barrier to the very moving-forward-ness we want people to do. we create our own catch-22 escher loops.) women AND men who lost everything as a result of a divorce. gay kids whose family disowned them because they love people with the same body parts. men and women who were dealt terrible, terrible hands of both nature and nurture. people who experienced significant trauma that i imagined was the rare exception that movies show; not realizing that terrible nature and terrible nurturing happens way more often than i used to believe. if who we are is hugely determined by some blend of nature and nurture, could i do any better if i had received terrible hands of both? could you? how can we ever know? people who experienced trauma, and did not have the services, supports, or tools via nature and/or nurture to know how to deal with the traumas in healthy ways. people who now know of better ways, yet new habits are hard to build, and the times of dealing/avoiding/escaping in unhealthy ways has changed their brains., making change even harder. and still... so very many get up every morning and try again to be clean, to be sober, to do that again and again for longer than the last time. and many make it, and many others keep trying. the man who had a house, a savings account, a car, a good job. and cancer happened, and health declined, and medical bills cost more than he had. so he traded his home and security for his life. the many, many men and women who are also in those shoes. the widows and widowers whose deceased partner was the main breadwinner and money manager. and the living person either doesn't have health and/or marketable job skills, or doesn't believe that anything they know or do is marketable. and/or maybe for any number of preventable and/or unpreventable reasons, there wasn't much money left to manage anyway? the woman whose landlord raised her rent by 50%, and her job and savings didn't enable that to be fiscally viable. and the eviction and lack of first, last, and security are a significant barrier for her to get a different place, even if the rent is much less, which is already almost as rare and hard to find as unicorns. ~~~~~ who stays at warming shelters? the musician who writes songs and shares his love song lyrics and i fall in love with his heart. the kid who plays guitar badly, yet passionately, and you can see his anxiety melt as the music centers his being. the woman who hugs me and thanks me for being there as she gets up to go to work at 4:30 each morning. the guy who wants to stay up all night playing question games with me, because it's about who he is as a whole person; not about him being homeless. the people who struggle with addiction, yet will fight anyone if someone disrespects me as a warming shelter volunteer, and while that is heart-touching, it's not exactly desirable, and they *so* have my back, yet they honor your request not to fight on your behalf, even when their own honor codes would have them do just that. the foster kids who are in limbo because we suck at preparing kids for life. the men and women who are starved for just being seen as an equitable human being, where a smile and a hello is a treasure worth almost everything. the trans kid who just needed someone to sit with her as she cried. the people who are in alternate reality and even though i cannot fix that, we can leave space for that reality to co-exist with our own. people who are working to leave homelessness behind them, living on the streets or in cars or tents, and washing up in the bathrooms, leaving early for their jobs. people who are not physically and/or mentally ready to work, who are struggling with basic survival every day, and might or might not get \"there, yet they try each day. warriors. ~~~~~ Anyone can slay a dragon, he told me, but try waking up every morning & loving the world all over again. That's what takes a real hero. ~ brian andreas at warming shelters and in life, i am so very often surrounded by heroes and angels. and my heart melts and my heart bursts, and vivid-ness spills all over my days and my thoughts. <3 ~~~~~~ who might become homeless? and who might stay at warming shelters? my past co-worker, whose husband's Alzheimer's developed to a point that she could no longer care for him at home. and putting him into a place that *could* care for him depleted their resources and life savings. and she visited him every day because even though he rarely knew who she was anymore, she knew who he was. and she loved him. and if her own health was poor at the time, she may not have been able to rebuild her life and savings from scratch after his death. my neighbor, who lives on minimal retirement benefits and sometimes lives in an alternate reality. if her alternate reality becomes more detached from more common reality over time...? my beloved friend when i was a teenager. his depression swallowed his life, and i was too young to know what to do or how to save him. and i still don't know how to save anyone. yet now i know of some resources. and the resources still might not be enough to save a loved one from depression, addiction, homelessness, or death. my own kid, if schizophrenia happened to him, and i am dead and he used his inheritance for basic food and shelter and to deal with or escape his mental illness, and the money ran out. my own mom if her dementia happened and my sister and i did not exist. my own dad, if he did not have kids who would offer him a place to live, and if he had opted to trade his resources for his life, by trying harder to beat cancer and kidney failure. my own relative, if she spent all her resources to help her husband recover from a stroke, and if her own retail job ended because, Amazon. me, if i developed a traumatic brain injury, and didn't realize i wasn't making sensible fiscal decisions, and my family was not here to take over if necessary. anyone, who does all the right things, and saves money for emergencies or rainy days, and life hands them more rainy days than their resources can support. you, if physical and/or mental disabilities happened, if you didn't have family or friends or fiscal assets that were adequate to meet the health costs and support that might be needed. ~~~~~ when i believe homelessness can only happen to *other* people, i delude myself. there but for the grace of the universe go i.

            "answer_text": "That the only time you see homeless people is when you pass them sitting on the side of the street. In reality, you see homeless people working at McDonald\u2019s, standing in line at the grocery store, and picking up their kids from school. You just don't know they're homeless. They may be temporarily staying with a family member but fretting because they can only stay a few more nights and have nowhere to go after that. They may be living out of their car or a storage unit. They may be living in a homeless shelter. \u2014- A while back I read an answer on Quora about homelessness that really got to me. The person claimed that most homeless people don't want to accept help and refuse to enter homeless shelters. As a case manager for a homelessness prevention program in New York City, I can tell you that, at least in NYC, this could not be more false. The vast majority of homeless people seek help, including applying to stay in homeless shelters. Before I started my current job, I didn't even realize you have to apply to stay in a homeless shelter. In New York City, not only do you have to apply, but your background and housing history will be investigated thoroughly, and if it is determined that you have any other housing option available (even if it involves leaving the country to stay with a family member), you will be found ineligible for shelter. I've had a client who was found ineligible because her mother had a house in Puerto Rico. DHS (the Department of Homeless Services) wanted to ship her back to Puerto Rico (as in, pay for her flight there) before allowing her to stay in shelter. It's expensive to house homeless people. For that reason, a lot of people are denied and not permitted to enter shelter. To say that most homeless people don't try to seek out help is ignorant. The classical image of a homeless person is a middle-aged or slightly older white male, scruffy beard, dirty face, mumbling to himself and shaking a cup of change. He most likely has a history of substance abuse, suffers from mental illness, and is chronically homeless. Those who fit this general description are often shelter resistant. It may be that they've had bad experiences there in the past, the setting is too overwhelming for them (especially if they have paranoid schizophrenia or PTSD), the shelter rules are too strict for them, or they don't trust \u201cthe system.\u201d Whatever the reason, these shelter resistant folks are not representative of the homeless population as a whole. I beg you to please remember that homelessness does not just look like this:  It also looks like this:  And this:  And this:  Above images were taken from Google Images and do not necessarily depict homeless individuals.
