Follow your hearts and see if it works out. You and he should be asking each other this question, and not taking any advice from anyone. Else. Period. I will give you the benefit of my experience. At least 10 of my fellow male Marines are STILL married to their boot-camp sweet-hearts. A lot of couples go to the way side too. But, history is NOT advice. No one can tell you your hearts desire\u2014and no one should try to, either. My advice is for you all to communicate honestly, and to follow your hearts. Love is not a Sprint\u2014it is a marathon ",

If you do decide to end things with him, make it clear that that is what you will do when he joins, and then end it well before he deploys. The stress of a breakup is not a good thing to have on your mind when you're in a combat zone. Either end it now or stick it out. No \"Dear John\" letters, please. ",
