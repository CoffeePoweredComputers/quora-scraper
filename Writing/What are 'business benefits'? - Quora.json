            "answer_text": "A business benefit can be defined as an outcome of an action or decision that contributes towards meeting one or more business objectives. The business benefit concept is central in strategic planning and most forms of business case analysis, where business people evaluate investments and actions in terms of likely cost and benefit outcomes. Some kinds of benefits are easier to verify, measure and value than others. For most business people, positive financial outcomes are readily accepted as business benefits and easily measured. Such outcomes include cost savings, cash inflows, and increased profits. However, many people are uncertain about how to measure or value contributions to business objectives defined first in non financial terms, such as changes in key performance indicators for customer satisfaction, risk, branding, or quality of service delivery. This article explains and illustrates the reasoning for measuring and valuing all classes of business benefits. The benefits rationale is presented in the context of common benefit-related terms including Financial benefit, non financial benefit, Hard benefit, soft benefit,Tangible benefit, intangible benefit.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll speak only for my own small retail business. I employ 4 people, which not only provides them with wages, it also provides a sense of self-worth & teaches them skills useful for their future employment. My business pays taxes which provides services to the community I live in. Because we sell quality used furniture, we\u2019re diverting items which might otherwise end up in a landfill (i.e. recycle/reuse). Our products provide a better quality for less cost alternative to our customers. Much of our spending is on local businesses so we also support the survival of local business. We also donate a portion of our sales $ to local non-profits. ",
