            "answer_text": "I don't think that the issue is about making your posts longer. If there's one thing that I've addressed on my own blog is that providing your readership with \"value\" is more important than getting to a certain word length and I think you'd be hard pressed to find a credible blogger that would see this differently. Granted I have my own quality standards that include length for each of my posts, but even so... such standards vary from blogger to blogger.  With that said, your blog posts should be about substance and not just fillers for the sake of length. So how well do you know the topic that you are going to write about ? What research have you done on the topic that you are writing your post on ? It may be helpful to see what others have said on the subject so that you are better prepared to be able to talk about it in your blog post.  If your question about length is connected to the reality that you just don't know the content of the topic that you're writing on very well then I would suggest that you do a more complete job of preparing to write on the subject so that when you do write your post you're giving your readers something substantive and valuable to read.  Additionally I would ask what components have you added to your blog post that give your reader value ? Have you added the following components in addition to the body of your content ? : Data / graphs Media (photos / videos) Engagement pieces (if applicable: polls, games, surveys, embedded peer response etc) In fact, aligning content in your blog post to questions that other people are asking on sites like this one (e.g. Quora) can also be embedded within the context of your blog post too.  Consequently the more value that you add to your blog post will ultimately lengthen the blog post that you are writing. With that said, the length of your post is completely up to you and connected to the value that you strive to provide to those who will be reading what you've written as well.  ",

            "answer_text": "We all know that longer articles tend to rank higher on Google. According to Brian Dean, \u201c Based on SERP data from SEMRush, we found that longer content tends to rank higher in Google\u2019s search results. The average Google first page result contains 1,890 words.\u201d But I know it can be hard to create long blog posts. You can only add so many bullet points. Right? lol Well here are some ideas to make your articles longer 1 - Include valuable insights from others (Industry experts) in your articles. 2 - Include data-backed research, not just opinions. 3 - Add visual elements like images and infographics. 4 - Go into the details. e.g. Instead of just saying \u201cPost visual content on Facebook\u201d, find 3 - 4 examples and add your insights. 5 - If you are embedding videos in your article, add the description and captions. 6 - Study and apply the \u201cSkyscraper\u201d technique from Brian Dean.
