            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean as good at writing. Good writing involves a number of factors: Creativity\u2014you either have it or you don't. You can nurture your creativity by increasing your knowledge, world view, flexibility with ideas, ability to combine and contrast ideas. Many people do this through reading a broad range of historical and cultural literary pieces and writers.Heart--you either have it or you don't. The more you are challenged in life, the more you will see your way into your emotions. Similarly, the more you connect with others, the more you will understand how people feel and what they experience and endure. Many people participate in community events--sports, religion, charity, travel, work.Skill--there is a broad range of skills necessary to writing well including thinking, organization, literacy, grammar, editing, plus a variety of genre specific disciplines such as poetry, essays, memoir, reportage, fiction, cross-genre or mixed media, computer skills such as promotion, word processing, web pages, blogging, advertising. Typically, good writing at some level can be attained by high school, more advanced skills by college, and more developed advanced skills by advanced studies leading to a Masters or Doctorate degree if you would like to teach.Fluency--this can imply typing speed, ability to change between genres or ideas, ability to speak as yourself with your own ideas, clarity, ability to change and learn language etc. This is often nurtured through practice, conversation, foreign language study, reading.Minimum, I'd say : Four years of diary writingThree years article writingTwo years poetry writingFour years fiction writingThree years essay/memoir writingTwo years editingFour years language skillsSo any one of those will make you good, more of them will make you better, but creativity and heart can take a life time.

All it took was a bounding vocabulary, a keen sense of the absurd, and a deep love of well\u2026 everything really, but especially what we would call the classics. And a clear vision of what matters to him in this world. I don\u2019t think that words can be considered something that you suddenly become good at and stay at that level. It requires daily work and humility and effort and dedication, and I have learned a great deal from the esteemed Mercedes R. Lackey about the amount of dedication and effort and sheer rewriting needed in bringing a single book to fruition, never mind over a hundred. Just two examples, mind you, of people who humble me, and are greater humans. I feel grateful. Thank you. I think it\u2019s, ultimately, a lot less about the aggregate hours spent writing, in and of themselves, and a lot more about who you are and what you know, what interests you, and what you feel driven to share with the world. Of course, you must write, and write a great deal. It matters that you write at all, and flesh out your literary self over time, more than it matters whether or not any amount of what you write is publishable. But there\u2019s no on switch. I think what makes writing magical, in and of itself. You keep producing, communicating, writing, building, trying\u2026 And then one day it just all clicks together. And someone else understands you. Keep writing until that happens. Then keep doing it. ",

This would be typical of a journalist There are many people who are good at writing, such as teachers, lawyers, editors, proof readers, publishers, etc. Being good at writing is the same as any other skill, you learn the craftThat is not the same as being a writer in the sense of someone who writes professionally Also, writing professionally means you get paid for your work. It does not mean you earn your living at writing. Extremely few writers earn their living at writer Writers who earn their living at writing, rarely make a good living at itIf their book is illustrated they will have to share the income with an illustratorIf they require an agent then the agent may take 10\u201320% of the income There will be different source of income such as from shop sales, libraries, sometimes translations, and if it is a children\u2019s book, possibly merchandizing Books have a \u2018Shelf life\u2019, so having a good selling book doesn\u2019t mean it will sell for longBooks are also aimed at different target groups. Hardback books have a different a readership to those who buy a softback or eBook Books that are successful might become a series in the sense of a popular character like Sherlock Holmes or James Bond, or they might be designed as a series like Harry Potter Books are marketed like any product. They have to fit into a House style if handled by a publisher. If you self-publish then you have to understand about the publishing processes The question of \u2018How many hours does it take to become good at writing\u2019 might reasonably be compared to how many hours does it take to become good at piano playing ",

There is a lot to be said about knowing the meanings and usage of words, the proper use of grammar and style, the coming to terms with what imagery and descriptions that work, and which just makes me look lazy, or worse; not knowing what I am writing about. That\u2019s me, however. With you, who knows? I am not sure of the level of knowledge you have within your chosen language of use. If you know your language\u2019s spelling and grammar, and your vocabulary is such that you never need to use a thesaurus, then you are quite a long way, along the path of becoming a good writer. I do not know what inspires you, or what level your imagine is at, but you could be the most skilled person in your language, but if you do not have an imagination, or you cannot be inspired by the most mundane thing in your life, then you need to hone your imagination, and this is achieved by reading and listening to music, and watching movies and documentaries. If you cannot conceive of some idea by just riding an elevator, or looking at someone walking a dog, then you need to discover what imagination is and then work towards fine-tuning the ideas that you conceive. You can attend college or university to learn your language and what makes it special, but no matter how many years of study you have in completion of hours of study, if you apply all that you know to your story or novel, you will always discover that you can do more with it and there are so much rework and editing you can do. Planning-out a story, to its finest details, you will learn to turn what you have in mind, into something coherent, and that editing would be basic repair of missed problems, but you will be happy with your story. I would recommend you not think about perfection in terms of hours, but think of how good a writer you are by the excitement, or lack of it, from your readership. ",

            "answer_text": "Writing comes in many different shapes and sizes. These generally spread from the practical and mechanical to the creative. To be good at writing you need to be able to do at least some of all of these aspects. I shall start with the mechanical and move through to the creative side. Before we dive too deeply into it though we need to look at mastery as a concept. So, from a mechanical perspective you have the physical ability to write and knowledge of the technical rules of writing. This includes grammar and, to a certain extent, knowledge of etymology. Physically being able to write isn\u2019t that hard of a skill to master. Speed isn\u2019t even a factor if you are looking at fluency and quality. Generally speed will improve by the sheer fact that you are doing the particular task multiple times. To that end there is the concept of 10,000 hours making you a master in something. The idea was one touted by Malcom Gladwell in Outliers (book) - Wikipedia. There are issues with this and a search of that particular rule on google will show you that it has been debunked. There is a core idea in there though. We have all heard the phrase \u2018practice makes perfect\u2019 this is the core to that concept. The 10,000 Hour Rule Is Wrong. How to Really Master a Skill goes into some detail about the original Gladwell concept. Essentially it boils down to several other factors and the soundbite being taken out of context. 10,000 hours is the average length of time spent by Masters of particular areas. Notice the average part to this. Add to that there is the genetic component. Personally I physically cannot do certain things. With practice I could potentially do those things but others who are predisposed are likely to take less time. The next part of the concept is the type of practice and how you have learnt. While the other adage \u2018a bad workman blames his tools\u2019 is often used it doesn\u2019t actually fit too well. Think of it this way. If I give you a teaspoon and myself a shovel then task us both with digging a hole of a certain size I will get to the end result faster. You would rightly blame the tool in question. The tool is not appropriate for the task. With language this is similar. If you are taught by someone who does not know much then you can only get so far. That teacher is then the tool. (So close to BNBR there). If they are bad you are going to struggle even if you reach the same outcome in the test. There is then what happens if we are giving people the same tools. If I get you a shovel and a mattock and asked you to dig a hole of a certain shape and size you would likely be able to do that. Now you are comparing it to the speed at which I dig. I would likely dig far faster than you. This is the practice element and knowing what to do with those tools. I have had years of practice and have a method. Not only that I have built up that particular skill. Now we relate this back to writing. Mechanically the skill is relatively easy. You just have to be able to use a keyboard. You are inputting data (i.e. strings of characters in a particular order). You need to be able to recall that data, this would be spellings and the particular words for any given situation. Then there is the grammar. All of this combined is what gives someone the ability to write. Incidentally it is the desired outcome of education as a whole. Now consider how that subject matter was taught in schools. People are graded. Classes are streamed by those grades. The ability of each individual when given a level playing field (a single school doing the teaching) still results in differing abilities. Some will never make it to the higher levels. This shows that no matter how many hours are put in to the core concepts some will be better than others. While all could eventually gain the same result the hours of education needed for some would be higher than others. This is where the concept of Tutors (in the modern usage) comes from. Those skills take years. Schooling goes from roughly 4 till 18 as a compulsory level of education. That is 14 years. The emphasis on the writing aspects will be higher in the earlier years and lower in the later years of that education. The last two may not even have direct acknowledgement and teaching. Over those 14 years you will likely average 60 hours a year. (2 1 hour lessons each term week with 30 weeks of term a year). That is a very rough average. Multiply that by 14 and you have 840 hours of education. Some with extra tutoring will reach 1000 hours. That is the basic set of skills. It includes how to write and also the language. It is also only the direct teaching hours. This goes back to the concept above of the right learning. Add in all of the passive hours and everyone is likely hitting 1000 hours to be able to write in the first place, if they have the skill. The next step to look at is the type of writing. There are many types of writing. Fiction and non-fiction are what most people group these into. For ease of working so shall I. Non-fiction is a good place for me to start. The first thing that you need to decide is which bit of non-fiction. An essay is different to a book. They are both different to blog posts. They are different to technical writing and also they are all different to advertising copy. What I suspect you are doing is pointing out the overlap between several of these. That is something that is very important. Writing has many transferable skills within the niche of writing itself. An example would be a technical review on a blog, which is technical writing and a blog post. Another would be a book that is derived from a thesis and an essay. Essay writing at school is a huge part of this. Writing to argue, persuade and advise are core tenets of this. Non-fiction falls into those particular categories no matter what it is. The ability to write essays easily comes with time as all things do. Often it will be the third year of someone\u2019s university career (British 3 year course standard) that they will be able to write essays at a high level using those skills. Most people do not get taught essay writing at university though. They are taught that at school and use that to form the basis of their university essays. The repeated practice is what makes the quality of the writing rise. Consider ten essays a year, discounting exams and smaller pieces of coursework, then that leaves you with 30 and a dissertation for an undergraduate degree. Each essay including planning will take about a week. This excludes the research sections. A dissertation will take a proportionally longer time. Let\u2019s say 5 times as long (3000 word essays for the 3rd year and a 15,000 word dissertation). That leaves us with 35 weeks. At a full time workload that is roughly 35 x 40 hours. A total of 1400 hours. Add in another 100 hours for all of the smaller assignments and reports and we have 1500. So far we are up to 2500 hours to be able to write at undergraduate level and achieve good marks. Again that is changed by the abilities of the person. There is an important factor here. When you write essays at university you get feedback. This is very important in the learning process and also the writing process. This is where editors come from. To become good at writing you need to know where you are going wrong. By the point in your education that I outlined above your writing standard should be good, or at least passable. This will only cover non-fiction essay writing though. If you wish to branch out from there then you need to go further along each route. A nice example of this is the blog writing skill set. When writing blog posts you have to take into account many factors. These include: Being concise.Engaging the reader.Fulfilling any SEO criteria.Staying on topic.Being clear.Being helpful.While there are more that others would likely add to the list these are the core concepts that you really need to hammer out if you want to be successful at writing blog posts. The first part is about length. Your blog posts should generally be around 1000 words long. This is similar to the word limit for a short essay. Being able to engage the reader often comes through use of a call to action. These bring the reader into the post and make them actively engage. To do this you need to be clear. Part of that is staying on topic and the other part of that is writing quality content (the helpful part). The SEO part is also quite interesting. Not only are you writing for your readers but also for the search engines. After all what you write won\u2019t be seen unless you put it out there properly. This affects word choice. 16 experts answer: How long should it take to write a blog post? | Authority Marketing gives some good figures on this. The most interesting part is this: \u201cWhen I started blogging seven years ago, it used to take me four to five hours to write a post. Since then, not only have I figured out how to write 1,000-2,000-word blog posts in under two hours, but I\u2019ve also figured out how to improve the quality of my posts.\u201d Source (Source: 16 experts answer: How long should it take to write a blog post? | Authority Marketing, with their source in the quote) Notice how the person quoted (Neil Patel) reduced the time and whilst also improving the quality of the posts. This is the practice part. I\u2019m sure anyone who knows of Neil Patel will agree that he is an expert at writing blog posts and he is good at it. Ergo he is a good writer in that niche. The article also quotes Michael Hyatt (Michael Hyatt) he is a master at productivity and organising yourself to be able to achieve things. You don\u2019t get to his level without being good at writing blog posts (and books). His quote: \u201cAfter writing more than 1,000 posts, I have gotten better and faster with practice. Now, on average, it takes me 60\u201370 minutes to write and format a single post.\u201d Source (Source: 16 experts answer: How long should it take to write a blog post? | Authority Marketing, with their source in the quote) With an average length of somewhere around 500 to 1000 words we can see that he has put in somewhere around 1000 hours at least to get to the level he is it. That doesn\u2019t count his books and courses. The takeaway here is that that particular skill set takes at least 1000 hours on top of all of the other work that has gone into writing skills. The next thing we really need to tackle is book writing. I am going to focus on fiction here. Let\u2019s start with some numbers. The average novel is around 80,000 to 100,000 words. Writers of fiction have many different targets for word counts and also speeds at which they write. In the days of traditional publishing a full time author (or any really) would publish around 1\u20133 novels a year. Less later on and more earlier. In the current climate of self-publishing that number is often higher. Some authors pump out 1 a month (although these tend to be shorter at around 50\u201360,000 words). Whatever speed an author works at they will often spend 30\u201340 hours a week at the task. Be it writing, re-writing or editing their latest work. The only problem here is: How do we measure whether they are a good writer or not? The biggest issue here is that fiction is subjective. Objectively writing quality is ironed out due to editors levelling the playing field. If we take editors as levelling the playing field then why do some authors get famous and rich (or one of the above) and others settle into obscurity? That is about the audience. It is about finding the right niche and audience. Goins, Writer is the website of Jeff Goins (Jeff Goins ). His podcast makes interesting listening too. A concept that he talks about is finding your tribe. This is the group of people that like your writing and will support you. This concept therefore skews our statistics. A writer who does this well and finds the right audience will receive more recognition than an equally good writer who doesn\u2019t. This is not to bash the notion (personally I love Jeff\u2019s podcast) this is just to say that selling lots does not make you a good writer. It makes you a good marketer. (Or rich enough to pay a good marketer). Reviews are another good way to see the quality of a writer\u2019s work. These are also fraught with issues. This is again because writing is subjective. This means that you are seeing the quality of the work to engage the particular group who reads the work. The clearest example of something like this is the fifty shades of grey debacle There's Already a Backlash to '50 Shades of Grey' quite frankly the writing is mediocre. It is also \u2018Fifty Shades of Grey\u2019 started out as \u2018Twilight\u2019 fan fiction before becoming an international phenomenon. Now, opinions on a postcard about the writing quality of twilight. Something is missed there thought. Good writing is also something that engages readers. Technical qualities aside the writing definitely does that. It fulfils a need. Is that not therefore good writing? This takes us back to that essay subset. Writing to persuade and also knowing your audience. This leaves us with an issue. What makes a good writer? Is it the technical quality? Is it the ability to engage readers? Is it a bit of both? A good place to look might be here https://smartblogger.com/stephen-king/. More specifically Stephen King\u2019s writing advice On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft - Wikipedia. This work catches both of these areas. Implementing those lessons, from someone who knows what they are talking about, also takes hours. If we take a trilogy of fiction as our needed amount to be successful enough to count then we can say that the author has written 3 times the average book writing time of 160 hours. That is a bare minimum of 480 hours. Once you add in the many years of failed manuscripts and learning the craft of writing 1000 hours doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable. The numbers here keep coming out at 3500 hours whichever niche you head into. In other numbers that is 145.83 days or 67 hours a week for a year. That is concerted effort and doing nothing else. That is using the right resources and the targeted learning needed. It also ignores a big concept. Passive learning. That is a topic for another time but it includes the use of that language and those writing skills in all aspects of one\u2019s life and other learning. Thanks for the A2A.  Endnote: To give an idea of how long I have been writing and the level I am at here are the figures. I spent 5 years at university (3 full time undergraduate, 2 part time masters). I write all of the time. On Quora I average 7000 words a week. That includes writing at a maximum of 2000 words an hour (This year that is just on Sundays and I usually spend 8 hours on here). I have multiple novellas in the editing stage, two websites, a complete world building project, a job that requires specialist reporting and interpretation, an active role in many political debate groups and countless other factors. If you consider my writing in any way good then it is the constant effort not just the skills that I have fostered. ",
