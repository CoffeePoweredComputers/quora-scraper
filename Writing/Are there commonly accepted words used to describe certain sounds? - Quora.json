            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t tell from your question if you are fishing for a particular word to cover the phenomena (onomatopoeia), or if you asking if the onomatopoeic terms we use in one language are commonly found in others in similar form. If you mean the later, generally no. For instance, as I mentioned in another thread on a similar topic, in ancient Egyptian, the word for \u201ccat\u201d was miu, which imitated the sound a cat makes. That is fairly close to the English meow. On the other hand, what\u2019s the sound a dog makes onomatopoeically? Bow-wow? Ruff-ruff-ruff? Woof woof? In English, we might arbitrarily transliterate that sound three different ways, but other languages like Chinese might use the onomatopoeia \u201cgo\u00fb go\u00fb\u201d instead. We use the onomatopoeia bang bang! to denote gunshots in English, but in French it is pan pan! ",
