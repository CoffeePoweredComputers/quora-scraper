            "answer_text": "What is Copify? Copify is a platform that aims to produce together clients wanting content and copy with writers available to write it. The type of writing wanted can include product descriptions, blog posts, press releases, and web copy, and while the amount of work possible varies, there\u2019s usually some tasty variety. How Copify works After signing up with the normal credentials, profile picture, and CV, you are required to do a writing test. This requires writing a couple of hundred words on a topic they present you. It\u2019s a timed test of one time, and you have to type right into the box provided \u2013 no cut and glue allowed. There\u2019s no evidence of whether they use this copy anywhere. After you\u2019ve been allowed, you are easy to log in and look at the job provisions. Here you view a list of \u2018orders.\u2019 \u2013 Unlike Upwork or Freelancer, you don\u2019t own to implement for jobs \u2013 you merely accept an order. This reduces the number of time you need to consume pitching to work or liaising with clients. \u2013 It\u2019s often recommended that an excellent way to hone your craft is writing the sales copy for a product, or 100 words on a new brand. A lot of the work on Copify concentrates on product descriptions or short web copy, so it\u2019s possible to study of the site as an outlet for your practice in that way. \u2013 It\u2019s contract-free, giving you flexibility around your commitments. \u2013 There\u2019s no minimum or greatest number of output that you can do. This means that you can log in and write copy in the fifteen minutes over a cup of coffee, or between other projects. \u2013 Once your copy has been given, the pay appears in your Copify account for you to remove when you want to. There\u2019s no invoicing or chasing payments. Copify Review: The Cons \u2013 The pay is very low, working out to approximately a penny per word. I worked out that this means you want to be writing 825 words an hour to be doing the UK minimum wage! It\u2019s negative impossible, but when you factor in research time as well, it\u2019s not specifically a high rate. \u2013 Some of the work is slow, which is clearly why it has ended up on a content mill. While playing this Copify review, I found one order for 150 words on drill bits! \u2013 The briefs can be unclear. While this is frustrating on any job, the low prices mean that any time spent doing changes to copy as a result of an unclear guidance process is damaging to your time/pay ratio. \u2013 As you\u2019re not in direct contact with the clients, you won\u2019t know when your copy goes live on their website, making it hard to track the content and use it for your portfolio. \u2013 The deadlines can be quite short \u2013 a couple of hours in some cases. It\u2019s hence only really worth logging on if you are free to work on something right there and then. \u2013 Despite the short deadlines for authors, the time for the copy to be approved can be a few weeks. If the client has not approved text after 30 days, it is automatically allowed. \u2013 ",

            "answer_text": "Hi I'd suggest, you look locally before you try Copify.  Take a look at some copywriters' websites and see if you like the way they're written. Then get them on the phone. I'd recommend you run through the same questions with a selection of copywriters and see which ones give you the best responses. (I think it's important to get a good working relationship going with your copywriter - not sure if that's possible with Copify.)  Of course, cost is a big issue. But think about the value of the work that's being done for you. If you get a good writer, one who really understands you, your audience and your business, it might be worth paying that little bit extra.  Oh, and if you've got ongoing work, you can always negotiate a volume discount... Hope that helps. ",
