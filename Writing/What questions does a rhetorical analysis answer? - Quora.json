For example, if a political candidate makes a speech, a listener can say, \u201cThis is what that speech means.\u201d A rhetorician will say, \u201cYes, and here\u2019s how that speech made meaning: if you look at the narratives it subtly connoted, count the number of times he said the word \u2018freedom,\u2019 and highlighted his use of metaphor, you will see different ways additional meaning was added to a mere summary of his semantic content.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, Moawia. For me to answer your question to make it clear to you, I need to rearrange it a bit so that I can better understand it and bring it into conjunction with your question. Instead of asking: \u201cWhat questions does a rhetorical analysis answer?\u201d lets determine what rhetorical means. Bear in mind that a rhetorical question is a question asked solely to produce an effect, rather than call for a reply. Rhetorical speech can be negative, as when it is bombastic, but it can also be positive, as when it is well mannered and persuasive. When studying this word, remember that its two definitions are contradictory. The definition of Rhetoric therefore indicates a twofold meaning, depending on how it is employed. It is defined as: 1. relating to the skill of using language effectively and persuasively; 2. using language that is elaborate or fine-sounding, but insincere.\u201d For example: \u201cHer rhetorical comments are meant to impress, but they just make her sound bombastic.\u201d (Negative.) \u201cIn the press conference, the heckler kept asking rhetorical questions in an attempt to disrupt the meeting.\u201d (Negative. Used for effect only) \u201cHer speech was rhetorical; her words were obviously well-chosen\u201d. ( Positive, eloquent, effective, persuasive) \u201cSpeakers sometimes use rhetorical questions to keep their listeners\u2019 attention\u201d. (Negative, verbose. Used for effect only) Now that we have illustrated the two definitions, we should pull the analyst in whose task it is to analyse the words/sentence in order to place a particular speech or remark or any other utterance into its proper definition. The analyser will be skilled to spot the difference between two sets of rhetoric. To come back to your question: \u201cWhat questions does an analyst answer.\u201d It seems logical that he/she should distinguish the two possible definitions and to inform his/her instructor. My dear, Moawia, I sincerely hope you can decipher my scribblings to enable you to understand your question better as well as the answer. \u2018bye for now. ",
