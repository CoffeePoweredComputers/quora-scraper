            "answer_text": "Choosing a topic would mean writing something that you know well about. You would most likely write a \"literature review\", because you are not going to perform a research in real time (laboratory, or survey). A literature review is a compilation of information on one particular subject. Not just a subject, but a thesis statement. A thesis statement is a claim on a subject that the author (you) would make based on reading various research papers.  There is a general structure of writing research papers: AbstractIntroductionSubtitle1Subtitle2....so onFuture scope ConclusionReferences Write the abstract in the end (at the beginning of the paper, but write it after you are done with writing everything else). It is only half to one page of a Word doc. 12pt Times New Roman double spaced. It summarises your paper. Introduction is about why and how you ended up choosing this subject  Subtitle is a sub-topic of your main title (e.g if you are writing on \"Genetics of Obesity\", then your subtitle could be \"The link of obesity to Gene 1\", subtitle 2 could be \"Gene-Environment influence on Obesity\") Future scope is what you feel can be researched further based on what is missing about the topic. Conclusion are the crisp few lines as to what is the current scenario, a sort of an abstract of your paper, but conclusive and crisp. References is the list where you list all authors with corresponding research papers that you have referred for writing your thesis (literature review) Few rules Don't use first person languageDon't use passive voiceDon't copy paste without giving credit to author (there are specific rules for citation in an academic paper. Search for \"APA citation guide\" and read it when you cite an author) ",
