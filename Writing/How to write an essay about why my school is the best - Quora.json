            "answer_text": "Start out by thinking of the things that make the school special for you. Teachers? Curriculum? Location? Student body? Sports? Make a list. Next to each entry, write a few points about what makes that factor special. If possible, think of an example. For instance: teachers- motivated, motivating, caring, enthusiastic, make us think, don\u2019t lecture but use innovative teaching methods. example: Ms W who gave me extra help, Mr D who incorporates field trips and movies to give us new perspectives on topics he Once you have your list, begin writing. You can start with your opening paragraph in which you introduce your idea. If you have several reasons why you think your school is the best, then devote a paragraph to each idea. Discuss it and bring one or more examples, and maybe why this reason or example is significant for you. If you listed one reason (e.g. student body) then use each paragraph to expand on a different aspect of the student body and what makes it special for you. The last paragraph is generally shorter and sums up the essay and/or provides a closing thought. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Brainstorm a list of things that make your school special. If it\u2019s the only school you\u2019ve attended, it makes it difficult since you can\u2019t compare it to another, but not impossible. Ask around. Are there sports teams that have succeeded?Are there individual students who are special in some way? (We had a young woman who was training for the Olympics, another who was a champion in martial arts.) Are there special programs that are emphasized? (Our music and arts programs were really special because of the hard work of the teachers in promoting them while we had a very active foreign languages program that took students all over the world.) Are there teachers who are impressive in some way? Administrators or school support personnel? Is there data such as test scores or school rankings that make the school stand out? Or are you greeted by name daily by teachers and staff? Is this just a welcoming place that challenges you to be your best? (I worked in a special program in which we had 60 kids that we got to know over the course of the year and we knew those kids really, really well and they knew us. And while they weren\u2019t academically gifted, they were our kids.) Look around. Even if you don\u2019t think the school is special, it is in some way to someone and that can be your way into the essay. Good luck. ",

Use at least two or three sentences in each explanation/paragraph. Have a a general sentence for the beginning, such as: My school/name of school is the best. Skip to the first paragraph for the first topic. Make a new paragraph for each new topic. Short sentences are perfectly okay throughout. Just make sure the explanations or paragraphs are in detail and to the point. The last paragraph should be a short summary of the topics, even just referring to them like this: These three reasons\u2026as a conclusion of your entire essay, and should end with repeating the beginning sentence.
