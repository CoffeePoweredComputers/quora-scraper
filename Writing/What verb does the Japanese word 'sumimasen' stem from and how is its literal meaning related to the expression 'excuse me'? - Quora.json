            "answer_text": "While sumimasen (\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093/\u6e08\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093) is the polite negative form of the verb sumu (\u6e08\u3080), very few Japanese people these days use the kanji for sumimasen, usually writing it only with hiragana. Sumimasen has an idiomatic meaning of its own unrelated to the verb in modern Japanese. The verb sumu means \"to finish\" or \"to come to an end\", and while it is unclear exactly how the modern meaning of sumimasen comes from this, it might be related to the expression koto ga mondai naku sumu, meaning that \"something gets done without any problems\". Thus, sumimasen would indicate that there was some issue with the proceedings and an excuse needs to be made. ",

            "answer_text": "As mentioned already, \"sumimasen\" is the polite negative of a verb meaning \"to be dealt with, to be cleared,\" though the Japanese parse it this way no more than English speakers parse the \"sorrow\" aspect of \"sorry\" (though it isn't unheard of for some souls to say \"sumanai,\" which is the informal negative of that verb.) It's not really a one-to-one with \"excuse me,\" as it has a wider range of uses. For example, I've heard it used after someone makes a small but troublesome request of someone. It's also more formal than gommennasai, which can sound strange to some ears when used in a work setting, especially toward a person above you. At any rate, sadly it isn't as simple as \"sumimasen\" = \"excuse me\" and \"gomennnasai\" = \"I'm sorry.\" Minding, I say this as a Canadian, and we tend to carpet bomb with the \"I'm sorry\"s. ",
