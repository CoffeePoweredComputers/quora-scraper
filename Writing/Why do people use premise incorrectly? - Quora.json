For example, you can say that the premise of Philip K Dick\u2019s \u201cThe Man In The High Castle\u201d is that the US lost WWII, and that Germany and Japan now run the country. In this case \u201cpremise\u201d is correctly used to mean a proposition which forms the basis from which the work proceeds. ",
