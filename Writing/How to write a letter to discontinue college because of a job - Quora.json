May I request you Sir to kindly accept my request and allow me to discontinue studies now. I would request you to issue a certificate to this effect so that at a later date, I am in a position to continue the studies from where I left now. Looking forward to your kind help, Sir, Thanking you, Yours respectfully, TANISHKA Sharma ",
