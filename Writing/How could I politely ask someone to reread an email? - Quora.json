            "answer_text": "The best way to make someone reread your initial email is just to send another one. A follow-up. The follow-up email is a great way to draw one\u2019s attention. But before starting to write a follow-up email, you must first define what your objective is to create a more efficient call-to-action. These three phrases we\u2019ve all seen a million times: \"Just checking in to see ...\"\"Thought I would just check in and find out ...\"\"Wanted to just check-in to hear ...\"But the truth is, these examples are often monotonous and ineffective. Start your email by adding a hint of context. After all, you are trying to get someone\u2019s attention for a good reason. Think about different email subject lines. Those catchy ones tend to have more chances to be opened. Timing is also a key component. Knowing the right time will help you achieve your goals a lot faster and more efficient. ",
