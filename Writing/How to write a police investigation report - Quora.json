            "answer_text": "It's very simple to write a report. Just answer these questions in this order: Who called, what happened, when did the incident take place, where did it happen, how it happened, and why it happened. You're not going to be able to answer all of the questions, especially the \u201cwhy\u201d most of the time; that's okay. Do not include opinions or conjecture. As the old saying goes, you include the facts and nothing but the facts. The report needs to be neat and succinct. Double check your spelling. Remember that the succinct reports are read by others, and that they could end up in a court of law. ",
