            "answer_text": "Wow, this answer stimulated a lot of ads/answers! :) I do this type of work. I am a developer, but have good design skills, too. Many developers aren\u2019t really interested in \u201cthe look\u201d, and that\u2019s probably what you ran into. They are more interested in the inner workings, the back-end stuff. Without seeing your site, I can generally say that you\u2019d need someone who was very strong in CSS, and had a good feel for layout, color, and design in general. You could try some scattershot quickie solutions that may be nice and cheap, but probably with a low chance of success. I\u2019d suggest consulting a professional design firm to get good advice. You\u2019d need to ask around and maybe see if you can find a firm near you that can visit you or vice versa. ",

            "answer_text": "Without reviewing the site, it's hard to know if the problem is a good design (WordPress theme) that's been implemented badly, or just a bad design (or both). Hiring competent web developers is extremely hard to do. There's far more work available than there are people to do the work. A lack of any formal certification process means a lot of people are selling bad work. The best way to find someone competent is to ask other people for recommendations. No one is really a \"WordPress Styler\" as an occupation as this is too specific a skill. (It would be like looking for screwdrivermatician within the construction industry.) You definitely need someone who knows how to set up WordPress, but wether they need to more of a designer or a developer depends on the nature of the \"ugly\" you're trying to fix. Hopefully you can find someone who will at least be honest about telling you if they are the right person to fix the problem or if you're really looking for someone with a different skill set. ",
