            "answer_text": "The first thing \u2018object\u2019 is missing in the sentence. And, without objects, a sentence can but be changed into Passive Voice by imagining one. The second thing: The sentence is in Future Perfect Tense with Yes/No question. And, to change this type of questions into Passive Voice is very simple. Imagine the sentence as an Affirmative Sentence, change it into Passive Voice and then take the Auxiliary Verb out putting it before the Subject. That's done. So, the answer is finally here: Will that job/the task have been finished by us? ",

            "answer_text": "The verb to finish is being used intransitively here. An intransitive verb sentence cannot be made passive, as it lacks a direct object to promote to the subject position. If you can use the verb transitively\u2014supplying an object\u2014then you can proceed: Active: Will we have finished our homework? Passive: Will our homework have been finished [by us]? ",
