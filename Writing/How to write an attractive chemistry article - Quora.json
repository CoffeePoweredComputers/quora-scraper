            "answer_text": "Decide who you\u2019re writing for. Are you writing it for children? Make sure you add plenty of pictures, preferably high quality and maybe aesthetically weirder ones. Think back to your childhood or browse a picture book the next time you\u2019re in a store and you\u2019ll learn what the word-to-picture ratio looks like. Also, don\u2019t skimp on the art because kids can tell. Are you writing it for teens? Most high-school level wording works, I should think, because teens won\u2019t be reading things unless they\u2019re A) forced to or B) are already interested in the topic, hence their attention. Whichever the case, please don\u2019t try to sound cool or hip. Just use language for adults with a depth level and sentence structure suitable for teens. Are you writing it for laymen? Write it to a depth level that you\u2019d be able to pick up if it were a topic you didn\u2019t understand. The important thing is in the packaging. Show how it affects common objects that they know to be regular, or part of their lives. If I saw an article titled* \u201cThe Effect of Phylliomeres on the Production of 5-Benzone and Other Gamete-Related Pheromones in Salienta Anura\u201d you lost me. If, however, your title was \u201cThe FBI is Adding Chemicals to the Water to Make the Frogs Gay!\u201d \u2026 you get the point. If you\u2019re writing it for those in research, the more specific the better. Either your article pertains to the narrow pool of work and substances they\u2019re using, in which case you are potentially a resource to quote and expand on\u2026 or your article doesn\u2019t pertain to the narrow pool of work and substances they\u2019re using, in which case you\u2019re not a priority anyways. *The topic of example for me, evidently, being biology.
