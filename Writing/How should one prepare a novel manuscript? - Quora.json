            "answer_text": " By Karen S. Cole, Book Editor and Formatter from Way Back Nowadays, a poorly edited manuscript will be thrown into the \u201cround file\u201d or garbage can. If you don\u2019t have it edited and formatted properly. Both editing and proofreading to make a nearly squeaky-clean manuscript are hugely important. A book may be full of wonderful ideas, but poor editing and formatting make it stand out like a sore thumb, and treated accordingly. So you need to professionally edit and proofread your manuscript. Either use one of the great editing software programs on the market currently, or hire someone if you think there\u2019s something lacking in your editing skills. You can perform the final proofreading yourself, if you feel up to it. Or hire a professional proofreader to really make your manuscript sharp and gleaming. Meanwhile, you also need to format your manuscript according to modern standards and guidelines. These include: 1\u2033 all-around margins on every page (things need to be the same and standardized throughout); pagination (page numbers) for a print version, no pagination for an ebook version; a Title page with no greater than a 20 pt type size book title, smaller type size for author\u2019s name and info, a Publisher\u2019s Info page properly written (you will need to look into this if you are self publishing, not if you\u2019re traditionally publishing. A lot of people don\u2019t bother to properly format self published manuscripts. This is a sad mistake on their parts. It should always be properly formatted); an Acknowledgements page thanking everyone involved; pagination if used, skip the Title page and start further in, etc. There are lots of rules. Try this article to get you started on proper formatting rules: Proper Manuscript Format for a Novel | First Manuscript Finally, you must prepare, if you\u2019re submitting to traditional commercial book publishers, a book proposal. This can be written before the manuscript is actually written, to test the waters for your book before working harder on it. But any book proposal will require two to three sample chapters. A fiction book proposal or package of docs is less labor-intensive. You only need the sample chapters, a query letter, possibly a cover letter and a synopsis in most cases. But when submitting to a literary agent or agency, you MUST follow their guidelines precisely for what they want you to submit. A nonfiction book proposal is usually much more thorough and contains quite a few other documents than a simple query and the sample chapters. Sometimes you want to do background research on how well similar-themed book sold in the past, to demonstrate that there is a market and audience for your upcoming book. And there are other docs included in a nonfiction book proposal as well. You will want to send them through the same guidelines as for a fiction proposal, following the agent or agency exactly on what they want you to send in. I think it\u2019s best to hire someone, if you can afford it, to do final editing and proofreading, manuscript formatting, and book proposal creation services. Hire someone with access to an A-List of genre-relevant literary agents. We offer those types of services, and so do other ghostwriting and freelance writing services you can find on the Internet. Hire some help to get your foot in the door fast! ",
