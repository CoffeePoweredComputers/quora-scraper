            "answer_text": "I can't really be helpful unless you tell me about yourself. Your fear. What kind of writing. Situation. How did you discover this fear? Age. Education. Country. Have you written anything before? What makes you think you are afraid? Do you really want to write or do you want to have written. What type of writing are you interested in? If you can answer these questions I'll try to figure out why you are having this problem. In the meantime, here are some things to consider. Perfectionism - are you afraid your writing won't be good enough? Writing is rewriting. Criticism and doubt are paralyzing. Get it down. Then find the gems. For me, I'm not sure what I want to say until I get it on paper. Then clarify it. Sharpen it. Tighten it up. Procrastination. I was taught the most important lesson a writer can learn is how to consistently put their ass in a chair and keep there until you produce X pages. So much depends on the type of writing you want to master. If it's a complex piece maybe start by explaining or describing what got your interest. Clarify it. Explode it. I do nonfiction. It has a different set of issues from drama, although today creative nonfiction is popular and brings fictional techniques to factual stories. Oil the gears with something interesting and easy. Answer a question on Quora. Something about helping another person and knowing it will be read is motivating and good practice. Here\u2019s another way to get rolling. Write an email to somebody that is responsive to your relationship; deep for good friends, superficial for acquaintances. Anyway, answer my questions and I might be able to provide something semi-useful. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to write, then practice makes perfect. The way to eliminate the fear is to begin writing every day. Perhaps it is the potential criticism you fear if someone reads your work \u2014 and that's okay. Every writer begins with an idea and a blank page\u2026and sometimes, it's just the blank page. If you can find a creative writing class, it may inspire you to look deep inside and find yourself. If a class isn't an option, you can find opportunities to write online. You can also create a list of your favorite topics and begin there \u2014 always bring a notebook, because you never know when you may want to write something. Once the genie is out of the bottle, it's impossible to return to what was before. People write for different reasons, and no two are alike. If you have no inspiration on a particular day \u2014 it's okay to take a break. More than anything else, have fun with writing and enjoy yourself\u2026when the endorphins are flowing and you feel wonderful, it's a good day \u2014 and those are the days you hope for, as a writer. You are in my thoughts and prayers. \u2764\ufe0f ",
