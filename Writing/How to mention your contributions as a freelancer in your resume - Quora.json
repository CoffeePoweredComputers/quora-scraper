I have engaged in many freelance projects during my career and I\u2019ve acquired a lot of experience due to these projects. However, only two stand out. Apps that acquired millions of users and made a huge impact on those users and I was a software development lead on those freelance projects, so it helps me sell myself as a leader/software manager. The only exception to my rule would be if you are completely new to the industry, and you literally have no experience then, by all means, include the freelance projects so that you can show the hiring manager that you are familiar with the software development lifecycle, meeting deadlines, delivering projects and deploying them to production.

            "answer_text": "Some people will just list themselves as Freelancer in the job title. So that\u2019s one way to show you\u2019re freelancing. An alternative to show you\u2019ve done some freelancing is to have a bulleted statement with your qualifications summary or as an additional information section. Which way to go is a personal choice and a matter of best judgment. And yes, it is acceptable to use a job title that shows what kind of freelancing you\u2019re doing. For example, Freelance Web Designer. It\u2019s also a personal choice whether you want to provide some details about the kind of freelancing you\u2019ve done or are currently doing. Some include details about their freelance activities. Others just want to get across they\u2019re doing or have done freelance work and leave details out. One more way to handle things is to have a separate section for your freelance activities. So if you have several things to list and/or want to draw specific attention to this, then completely separating it out with its own section may be the right way to go. Again, this is a personal choice and a matter of best judgment. ",

What you must include here are your title or role that accurately reflects the work you\u2019re doing; date range; projects you have worked on; accomplishments; and pretty much anything that relates to your competencies as a freelancer or an independent contractor. Complying with the basic rule of resume writing, experiences including freelance work, should be listed on your resume in reverse chronological order (newest on top) and in a consistent manner. ",

If you did it remotely, enter \u201cRemote\u201d for the location. I would also consider replacing the word freelancer with consultant or independent contractor as freelancer tends to have some negative associations.
