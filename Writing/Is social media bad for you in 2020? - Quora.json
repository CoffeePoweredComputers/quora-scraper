            "answer_text": "It really depends on how you use it. I think given the current state of the world, social media is a way we can spread hope stay positive, and stay connected with our friends and family as we practice social distancing and self isolation. Especially for businesses that have not been able to operate or pivot during this time. It\u2019s important to stay in touch/keep putting yourself out there so you customers/clients will remember you. It\u2019s important to maintain a good reputation and relationship because after this is over, people will still remember how you reacted/responded during the pandemic. ",

            "answer_text": "No more than television. It's a distraction for sure, and on social media, it's a little difficult to see the difference between fiction and reality like on TV (There are so many people with yachts on there! What are we doing wrong where we don't have their money and stuff and double D cups?) Other than that, though, it's a great way to get informed about events, to keep touch with friends, to share your own achievements and to support each other. Just try not to leave or respond to negative comments. That'll create a rabbit hole that'll make every day that much harder. ",
