            "answer_text": "Simply put, it reads the article itself, as well as the page title and the anchor text of any incoming links (both internal and external).  Meta tags are fairly useless as a ranking signal simply because it's easy for me to write an article on one thing, but fill the meta tags with something else. But, if Google takes its keywords from the article text, there's not really any way I can do that.  So, if you wanted your blog post to rank for \"Best Mobile Phone of 2015\", you might make the title \"What's the Best Mobile Phone of 2015? | Your Website\"You would then have in depth sections about the contenders, images using correct mobile-phone related alt text, sections about the must-have features this year, links to reviews of each phone you've mentioned. You would use lots of mobile phone related synonyms in your text (though naturally, of course - no keyword stuffing) like 'cell phone', 'smart phone', 'phablet', etc. You'd also use lots of keywords around the topic of mobile phones - though for an article like this, it'd be pretty difficult to avoid it - 'screen size', 'battery life', 'android', 'ios', etc.  Google is able to pick up these contextual keywords and figure out what keywords the article should be ranking for. Obviously, this would be a fairly competitive phrase to rank for, so unless you're writing this on a pretty authoritative domain, you'll probably need some links too. ",
