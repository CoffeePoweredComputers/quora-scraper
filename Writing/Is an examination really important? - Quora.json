            "answer_text": "Until my high school days, I almost hated all my exams. I hated the competitive ones and I hated the non-competitive ones. I hated them religiously, without any discrimination. And I hated them because I thought exams were a discrete hammering on a child\u2019s intellect. But as my age changed, so did my views and beliefs. Surprisingly over these 3 years at college and going through a university level of education almost on my own, I have understood one straight simple thing; exams are more than just a reality check. Exams are the stimulants that activate your intellect and the ability to cope with insane amounts of difficulties in life. Only a week has passed since I wrote my \u2018Turbo machinery\u2019 exam and I don\u2019t even know if I will pass but trust me I don\u2019t hate exams now (though I don\u2019t even love them).As the common saying goes on, \u201cAn engineer might not study for the entire semester, but he will be a master of his subject one night before the exam!\u201d, and I am proud to certify the above statement to fullest of my beliefs.It was a rainy night in the serene town of Vellore and I remember calling every friend (excluding the toppers) of mine, pissing them over and over again by enquiring about their progress with the syllabus. I knew I was irritating them but trust me this was the only anti-depressant available to me at the moment. If friends were behind you in the race with syllabus, you man, are safe!I knew I had to spend another sleepless night (or else I might be f****d in the exam) and the calendar reminding me that only 3 days of pain and torture were left. Still I wanted to cry. I wanted to go and kill the teachers. I wanted to run away. I wished I had studied this before. But amidst all of this, a strange transformation took place. I took out the previous year\u2019s question paper, I called up a few (trustworthy) friends and enquired about the most important questions that the teacher has unwantedly spelled out in the last few classes, and I started to prepare \u2018just to pass\u2019. And I kept on studying, desperate not to fall asleep at any cost. But life happens. I woke up at 8:00 am cursing myself, found my notebooks lying on the floor. I hurriedly began revising all that I have studied and went to give the badass exam leaving the rest on the almighty (though I am not a believer of god, exams can always do the impossible). I came out of the hall, 30 minutes before the exam was over. And surprisingly I was optimistic about the exam. I still do not know whether I will pass or not but I did my best. I gave in more than I actually could. It is today that I realized that exams are an exact analogy of life scaled down to 180 minutes. Whatever I did for the turbo exam was actually a teaching in disguise. It was a lesson for what I should again do in future if I face something as deadly as \u2018turbo\u2019 in my life. THE BEAUTIFUL ANALOGY For anything deadly that I might face in my life ahead, I should trust my past experiences (look out for previous years\u2019 questions). Then I should call my friends for help or pray to god for some hints and solution (enquire about the most important questions that the teacher has unwantedly spelled out in the last few classes). My priority shall always be to just \u2018survive\u2019, (start to prepare \u2018just to pass\u2019). And the last thing I should do is to leave the rest to god\u2019s will. I am sure I will come out optimistic as I did in my turbo exam. So you see exams are just an emergency algorithm to life\u2019s problems. EDIT-1 I just found today, that I have passed my turbo exam. :P ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, because without exams the instructor has no way of knowing whether the students understood the subject or not. Thus examinations are important but the current pattern is wrong. Currently in India most exams are used to judge the theoretical knowledge and memory skills of a student irrespective of the fact that how much a student understood practically. There is very less emphasis on practical knowledge, whereas examinations should be such as to judge the practical knowledge of students. ",
