            "answer_text": "Prior to the midpoint of the last century, the formal way to address two individuals was (male): Messrs or (female) Madams. For example, \u201cDear Messers Smith and Brown\u201d. It was a bit more complicated when some recipients were male and others female. With two recipients, you would simply write \u201cDear Miss Smith and Mr. Brown\u201d. (Prior to Gloria Steinem in the late 1960s, a woman was always Mrs. Or Miss. Later, the salutation changed to \u201cMs\u201d). If a man was under 18 and unmarried, his title was Master. Just as C-3PO says \u201cYes, Master Luke\u201d. But, I doubt that this would be advised in any modern manual of style or etiquette today. It's just too arcane. I suspect that others answering this question will disagree with my position. But, I feel that in most any scenario, today\u2014even formal or when addressing a superior\u2014it is safe to address multiple individuals by their first names in writing. Yes! I am even suggesting that upon returning from a job interview, it is not inappropriate to write a letter that begins \u201cDear Dave and Susan\u201d \u2014 at least not if you established a bit of rapport, and exchanged a few smiles during your brief time together. There are definitely a few exceptions: In the case of royalty or recipients with a political / judicial title, anyone who has been knighted, and high Church officials. These are very special cases. It should be noted that the United States never grants honorary titles, but we still show judges, senators and members of congress similar titular respect. Incidentally, we do not do this for the president. It is \u201cMr. Obama\u201d or \u201cMr. President. it is always wrong to address him as President Obama. This is a long-standing convention which highlights the fact that the United States is a democracy, and rejects nobility in its own government. Let\u2019s look at the exceptions. These are the cases for which I would still use a formal title\u2026 In the case of a bishop or The Pope, you would use the deferential phrases: Your Grace, Eminence or Holiness \u2014 addressing each individual separately, even if you are not a member of their faith. With a King, Queen or Prince, you would refer to them as your Royal Highness; and with a military commander (while you serve in any military capacity), you would address them by their rank. There may be a few other cases, but with lesser nobility (dukes and duchesses) or lesser politicians (ambassador, assemblyman, council members, etc), you should feel perfectly comfortable using a first name in any multi-recipient communication\u2014even if you are not generally on a first-name basis with each individual.

            "answer_text": "In a formal letter, if you know their names, you address them with \u201cDear Mr. White and Mr. Black\u201d; \u201cDear Ms. Green and Ms. Gold\u201d; \u201cDear Ms. Smith and Mr. Jones\u201d; or if they\u2019re married, \u201cDear Mr. and Mrs. Williams.\u201d If you don\u2019t know their names, but you know one is male and one female, \u201cDear Sir and Madam.\u201d If you don\u2019t know their names but both are male, I\u2019d suggest \u201cGentlemen.\u201d If you don\u2019t know their names but both are female, I\u2019d suggest \u201cLadies:\u201d (although traditionally it was \u201cMesdames:\u201d). I believe you\u2019d want the same greetings in a \u201cformal\u201d e-mail as in a letter. Footnotes: (1) Fifty years ago, if there were several addressees and you didn\u2019t know any names, the letter had to begin simply \u201cGentlemen:\u201d Please note, not \u201cDear Gentlemen,\u201d just \u201cGentlemen:\u201d Now, we begin with \u201cLadies and Gentlemen:\u201d (again, not \u201cDear Ladies and Gentlemen\u201d). (2) Sadly, there are ill-informed people who are wrongheaded enough to object to \u201cMadam\u201d or \u201cLadies\u201d for women as somehow sexist and insulting and object to \u201cGentlemen\u201d for men as, I don\u2019t know, elitist or otherwise politically incorrect. Unwilling to use words like \u201cMadam,\u201d \u201cLadies\u201d or \u201cGentlemen,\u201d they put forward all sorts of awful-sounding workarounds. My advice is that the traditional words showing respect should still be acceptable among enlightened, well-mannered people. Hillary Rodham Clinton as Secretary of State was \u201cMadam Secretary,\u201d and why not? ",
