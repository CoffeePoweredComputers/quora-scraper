            "answer_text": "Fish meal is a common ingredient in many fish foods. Other foods may include other kinds of fish. The ingredients in Tetramin Tropical Flakes are: Fish Meal, Dried Yeast, Ground Brown Rice, Shrimp Meal, Wheat Gluten, Feeding Oat Meal, Fish Oil, Potato Protein, Dehulled Soybean Meal, Soybean Oil, Algae Meal, Sorbitol, Lecithin, Monobasic Calcium Phosphate, Ascorbic Acid (Source of Vit. C), Yeast Extract, Inositol, Niacin, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate, Riboflavin-5-Phosphate (Source of Vit. B2), A-Tocopherol-Acetate (Source of Vit. E), D-Calcium Pantothenate, Thiamine Mononitrate (Source of Vit. B1), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Source of Vit. B6), Vitamin A Palmitate (Source of Vit. A), Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vit. K), Biotin, Cyanocobalamin (Source of Vit. B12), Cholecalciferol (Source of Vit. D3), Manganese Sulfate Monohydrate, Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate, Ferrous Sulfate Monohydrate, Cobalt Nitrate Hexahydrate. It is an adequate diet for most tropical aquarium fish, but not what I would consider the best. I like the ingredients in Omega One Super Color Flakes better: Ingredients: Whole Salmon, Halibut, Seafood Mix (Including Krill, Rockfish, & Shrimp), Wheat flour, Wheat Gluten, Fresh Kelp, Astaxanthin, Lecithin, L-Ascorbyl-2-Phosphate (Source of Vitamin C), Natural and Artificial Colors, Vitamin A Acetate, Vitamin D3 Supplement,Vitamin E Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Riboflavin, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Folic Acid, Biotin, Inositol, Tocopherol (Preservative), Ethoxyquin (Preservative). I only feed flake food to about half of my fish, generally the cichlids, characins and livebearers. I prefer to make my own mix from several different flakes I get from Kensfish.com. I usually start with about 1/4 Ken\u2019s Premium Vegetable Flake: Main Ingredients: Mixture Of Plants And Vegetables Including: Seaweed, Spirulina, Carrots, Squash, Spinach. Vegetable Oils, Soy Meal, Yeast, Wheat Flour, Vitamin & Mineral Supplement. Asorbic Acid (Source Of Vitamin C). Natural And Some Artificial Coloring. Dried Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Product, Dried Bacillus Licheniformis Fermentation. I then usually mix in about 1/4 Kens\u2019s premium color max flakes: Main Ingredients: Salmon Meal Blend, Special Mix: Dried Plankton, Shrimp, Krill And Dried Spirulina Algae, Wheat Gluten Meal, Oat Flour, Brewers Dried Yeast, Mix Of Natural Color Enhancers, Carotene, Lecithin, Soy Oil, Fish Oil, Vitamin Supplements, A, D3, B12, Biotin, Natural &Artificial Coloring, Ascorbic Acid (Source Of Vitamin C). Dried Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Product, Dried Bacillus Licheniformis Fermentation Then I will add a mix of earthworm flakes, soldier fly larvae flakes, silkworm flakes, bloodworm flakes, black worm flakes, brine shrimp flakes, and mysis flakes. The mix varies depending on what I have on hand, but I noticed he now offers a multi worm flake and a multi shrimp flake, so I will probably use those in the future. I like getting a good amount of worm, insect and crustacean protein and other substances like chitins in the mix. My other fish such as killies get live blackworms, live tubifex, newly-hatched brine shrimp or frozen brine shrimp, frozen blood worms or other frozen foods. Most killies won\u2019t eat prepared foods and most other fish get some live and frozen foods added as well, especially if I am conditioning them for spawning. I am cautious about giving cichlids and live bearers too much protein as I believe they need a food amount of veggies in their diets. Characins and killies generally feed on aquatic invertebrates and insects so their diets are heavier in protein. I don\u2019t keep any piscivorous fish, but if I did, I would try to get them eating a quality stick or pellet with a good fish protein, or a frozen fish or pieces of fish. ",
