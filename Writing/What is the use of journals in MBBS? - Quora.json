            "answer_text": "They are more useless than using antibiotics for a common cold. There is no purpose in drawing hundreds of Red and Blue diagrams or writing case reports because the journals themselves carry no marks for universities. They are just another tool used by departments to make you run in circles for signatures and torture you. Trust me at the end , you will be scratching your head wondering what the hell you accomplished by writing (or copying) journals. -Sincerely, A frustrated student who has finally(!) finished the last of her journals in MBBS.
