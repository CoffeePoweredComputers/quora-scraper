            "answer_text": "Compared to all these other answers, I wonder if this answer still has a place here. But I am struggling with some real insecurities, so I will write this anyway. Right now, I am writing this at 1 am and am crying. Why am I crying? Because I don\u2019t like the way my life is turning out. That makes me even more sad. Some people aren\u2019t loved, and I have a loving family. Some people are homeless, and I live in a nice home. Some people are starving, and I have access to plenty of food and water. Some people are sick, and I am perfectly healthy. As a teenager, I guess I can blame my emotions on hormones. But there are dreams that I want to pursue where I feel that I am not supported. My parents told me that they don\u2019t support my acting as a main job, because they said that most people don\u2019t make it and end up being waitresses. They tell me that the people who do find stardom get addicted to drugs or commit suicide. They tell me that I am not the best actress in the first place, so I shouldn\u2019t even try. I know that they are just trying to look out for me, but I do love to act and want to take every opportunity that there is. I have FOMO every time I miss an audition, which in my mind is a huge opportunity. Which brings me to my next point: religion. As a Jew, my Sabbath is on Saturday. I can not go out and do things on Saturday because that is the day of rest. The problem? Many auditions or acting classes are on Saturday! There are great acting classes not far from where I live where famous actors sometimes come in and talk. It\u2019s also a great way to bond with other people who share the same interests. BUT IT\u2019S ON SATURDAY! And I\u2019m missing out. This makes me resent my Judaism because it gets in the way of my dream. I feel like I have to choose between my religion and my potential career, which puts me against my own identity. I also question God. Like a lot. How can my parents not have faith in my dream but surround their lives around God? There is no proof that God is or isn\u2019t real. In my mind, there is more of a chance of me being a successful actress than of God being real. I hate thinking about this too much, because then I see my parents as illogical and insane as they are devoting their life to something that is supernatural. However, I really feel depressed every time I lose faith in God, because I don\u2019t like to think of a world without God. That possibility would mean that there is nothing to hold us up and no hope to grasp onto. I really do want God to be real. But often times, I just don\u2019t believe it. School is also something that makes me sad. At school, I feel a rebellious streak. I want to change things up. I want to be different. Because right now, I see school as a horrible place that damages childrens\u2019 creativity. Everybody has to learn the same things and sometimes even wear the same clothes. The message is also very conflicting: technically the average grade is in the 70s, but we are told that average is not good enough. Yet we are taught to be like our peers at school, so what do they want from us? I know I have potential, but I am grades in the 70s and 80s and being told that they are \u201cbad\u201d. All of this just makes me so sad. Lastly, I also worry about my body-image. I sometimes feel fat or unattractive. Sometimes I even skip lunch in an effort to become more skinny. I even look up celebrities\u2019 heights and weights and compare them to mine. All of these factors contribute to the sadness I feel now. But you know what? Just the fact that I am ranting on about this makes me sad. I don\u2019t deserve to be sad because some people really have it hard. Reading over what I wrote, I know I sound insane and mentally unstable. If you don\u2019t want to read all this, I understand. Maybe this video I made talking about my feelings is a better way to get my message across:  ",
