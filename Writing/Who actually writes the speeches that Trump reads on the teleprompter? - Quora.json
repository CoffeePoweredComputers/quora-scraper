            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know the names of all of the speech writers, but Stephen Miller has figured prominently in some of them. Presidents always have speechwriters on hand to help with major addresses. Some will barely step outside without a script. Others have been quite good with a quip. Reagan always seemed to be a little odd in his off the cuff remarks, as if he had been well briefed and considered all of his options before he entered an arena. His acting training no doubt helped a lot, but age had made his delivery a little obvious. He was not ad libbing nearly as much as we were meant to believe. Still, whoever wrote his material matched it to Reagan\u2019s personality and politics quite well. A speech writer and a good consultative staff when partnered with a natural outgoing figure can really make a difference. Kennedy was a great presenter, Nixon, when he was on, was really on. Bush the senior struggled a bit, and the junior Bush was not afraid to stick a toe in the mouth once in a while. He came off as rather genuine, if just a bit pedantic. Clinton had a great style and could shoot from the hip with the best of them. but he also had good speech writers. At the end of the day, we could ask, who doesn\u2019t? It\u2019s the big leagues. You go prepared. ",
