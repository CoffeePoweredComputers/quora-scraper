            "answer_text": "Just because you made a good grade in a class, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that your professor will write a good letter for you. When interviewers or graduate schools ask for letters of recommendation, they want letters from people who can speak to your character, not just your grades. They want to know things like whether or not you were trustworthy, hard-working, motivated, and dedicated. Were you on time to class and when turning in assignments? Did you work well with others, take initiative, seem truly interested in the material, etc. Are you someone this person would readily recommend for a job or admission to graduate school? You need to get your letter from someone you really knows you and can answer these kinds of questions about you and provide any other pertinent information he or she deems relevant. You will not get that from someone with whom you never interacted. ",

            "answer_text": "From my experience I would be extremely careful about asking anyone for a reference. My primary professor in my engineering courses, in which I earned very high grades, and did a number of good things as a research assistant, stabbed me in the back on a number of job applications before one company was kind enough to help me see who had been killing my chances at employment. I am after that as certain as I can be what will be said and what will not be said before ever listing anyone. Spend time talking with the professor about the impressions you have made regarding your work and employment interests. ONLY if you are satisfied your risk of a bad reference is as low as possible should that person be listed on an application. NEVER list references on a resume or cover letter. ",
