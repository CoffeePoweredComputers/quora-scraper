            "answer_text": "Not nearly as much as you think. Of the entire membership of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors of America, slightly less than 10% make a living\u2014and by that, I mean about $24,000-$30,000 a year\u2014from writing. Of that 10%, only half, or 5%, make a living writing only science fiction or fantasy or both. The rest have jobs that qualify as \u201cwriting,\u201d but not SF/F\u2014they might write romance under another name, or are journalists, or technical writers, or copywriters, or work in advertising agencies. Most authors have full time jobs and write on the side. Sometimes they make nothing at all in a year. Sometimes they make a few hundred dollars. You\u2019ll see news stories about people getting the \u201cbig paychecks\u201d from writing, but you are more likely to be struck by lightning than be able to earn a living from writing. ",

The Authors Guild said that in 2018, median author earnings were $6,080 Use a rule of thumb of $4 to $5 per book (hardback). If you sell 30K books, you could make 120K per year. (Advances just pay that same money up front.) But it\u2019s hard to sell 30,000 books. Even if you do, you\u2019ll make more money from speeches. Sell more, make more. Dream a lot, make nothing. ",
