            "answer_text": "The most common mistake is overwriting. For example, when creating characters, inexperienced writers describe physical appearance giving all the details. But we remember people in \u201cparts.\u201d For example, we may fall in love with someone for their voice, not their physical appearance. It\u2019s important to draw attention to one or two memorable things that define a person. Don\u2019t deprive your readers of the pleasure of their own imaginings! Sometimes, inexperienced authors tell the reader things instead of showing them. For instance, X was scared. Instead, show X shrinking away from whatever scares him/her. Let the reader fill in the details. Inexperienced writers may sometimes let their own voice leak into what their characters say. Give your characters the freedom to be themselves. Another mistake is to be overly concerned with plot. My tip is to let your characters lead and tell the story. This list is by no means complete. But these are my major gripes. ",
