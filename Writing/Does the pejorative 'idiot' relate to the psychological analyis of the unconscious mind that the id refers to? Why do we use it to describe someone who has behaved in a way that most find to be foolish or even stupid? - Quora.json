            "answer_text": "In the sense Lacan uses yes, but his use is very peculiar and he prefer its negative form: non-idiot. What is a non-idiot, in the teaching of Lacan? - Any person that, inspite of literacy, is sensible enough to supose the existence of the unconscious as Freud formulated: a language system that precedes us all, traspasses as all, and somehow comands as all against our will. \u201cPsychoanalysis can not be provided for those who are not non-idiots\u201d, he says, because someone that is not a non-idiot (that is: an idiot) can not suppose a knowledge on someone else and hence can never stabilish a transference (with a person or with an institution or a discipline etc). As you can see, than, an idiot is someone that has a presumption of knowledge in themselves, instead of a supposition of knowledge in the Other (culture, nature, civilization, language, the unconscious itself). In this sense, an idiot is not someone that is mentally retarded: Lacan says that Plato, genious in the Symposium (a dialogue precisely about the supposition of knowledge and the sliding place of the truth), is an idiot in the Republic, as in the Republic the tirany he proposes exclude the symbolic order - hence implies an imposition of knowledge (from the Philosopher-King, say) instead of a supposition of knowledge (throu a vote in a democracy, etc). Also, as you can see, because of that an idiot can not take responsibility for their desires and mishappenings - an idiot can not have an effect of subjective rectification. As an idiot has no effect of the symbolic, of the signifier, it is like as if they were reigned completely by the It (id, Es) - an \u201cinhabitant of the id that ignores external reality\u201d. This, as you can see, is similar to the psychodynamics of a psychotic patient - but psychotics are not idiots as they produce and receive a knowledge from the external reality they rejected in the form of delusions, and with this they can become sort of profets instead of idiots (as Schreber says, he is writing precisely to prove to God that he did not become an idiot - about that see the seminars Or worst\u2026 and Joyce The Sympthom).

            "answer_text": "There is no direct connection. Interestingly, however, many pejorative terms started out as non-pejorative terms in psychiatry to describe those with mental deficiency. Imbecile, moron, cretin, retard and idiot were all \u2018politically correct\u2019 psychiatric terms before they were (mis)appropriated by the general public. Those with a mental age of less than three years were classed as idiots; those with a mental age of three to seven were imbeciles; those with a mental age of seven to ten were morons. If this sounds \u2018bad\u2019 to our modern ears, it\u2019s only because each of these terms has now taken on a pejorative meaning. In their original usage, they were neutral labels. Idiot specifically comes from the Old French idiote (uneducated or ignorant person), which in turn comes from the Latin idiota (ordinary citizen [i.e., presumed illiterate]). It was adopted in English in the 14th century to mean mentally deficient. In 19th- and early 20th-century medicine and psychology, an \"idiot\" was a person with profound mental deficiency. Only then did it start to creep into common, pejorative use. Id is the Latin word for \u201cit\u201d. This comes from Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic theory of the tension between the conscious self and the power of unconscious instincts. Freud referred to these in German as das Ich und das Es, literally \u201cthe I and the it\u201d, but the English translation of 1924 adopted the Latin words for I (ego) and it (id). To the German reader, Freud's original terms are more or less self-explanatory. Their replacement with Latin terms in the English translation has been criticised for being unhelpful. ",

My field as of today is spirituality and Vedic philosophy. My painting ground, my own experiences. Here, I am writing from a spiritual sense. Not a psychological sense. Anyone who calls another 'idiot or stupid' has zero value for themselves. It is their own inner reality of not feeling good enough about some situation, that is getting reflected outside. A person who deeply values themselves would never ever call another 'any names'. Yes, any- never ever. Because as they deeply value their own life, Self and emotions in themselves, they value the same in another as well. They won't even call someone who has 'mental challenges' any name. Because they see the same value in that person and feel compassion for them, not to call names. It is the person who doesn't value themselves call others names. They don't see that value in themselves, so it becomes okay to call others names. Always remember- Our inner reality, shines outside! One's own outer reality is a true mirror to their inner reality! So, if names are coming out of one's mouth- check, where is your inner reality lying? This is totally from a spiritual point of view. Psychology- please ask experts. I am not one! All the very best!

An idiot is, most literally, someone who mentally is engaged only in their small self-absorbed world, sees things completely subjectively like a solipsist but without any of the practical intelligence that a solipsist might bring to bear. The village idiot is still used as a phrase instead of the \u201ccity idiot\u201d because he is considered a small self absorbed person in a community that is itself small and self absorbed !! i.e. hyperbole.
