            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re writing an essay, think of a paragraph as a cluster of sentences that support some aspect of your thesis statement\u2014each sentence relates to the others and all relate to your topic. Because there is no prescribed length for a paragraph, you need to decide how and when you end one paragraph and transition to another. As a general guide, I have always suggested to my students that an 8.5 x 11 page should have three or four well-developed paragraphs, and this is just a guide, not a rule. The best and most natural way to end one paragraph and transition to another is to pick up a key word or phrase from the last sentence of the preceding paragraph and work it into the first sentence of the succeeding paragraph\u2014this creates a flow that allows the reader to follow your argument more easily. A unified paragraph will have its own main point\u2014a statement related to your essay\u2019s topic\u2014and the following sentences will explore or explain that main point with more specificity\u2014general statement followed by sentences that expand on that statement with detail (often a concrete example). As you write, keep asking yourself whether each sentence is logically related to the first sentence of the paragraph, and when you discover that you have switched to another topic entirely, you will have a paragraph that has lost its unity. Ask whether sentence 2 expands upon or adds detail to sentence 1 and so on through the paragraph. Your paragraph will end when you have said what you need to say about the topic sentence of the paragraph. ",

            "answer_text": "As a rule, try rending versus ending. Paragraphs are chains or chunks of ideas to persuasively convey an argument or story. Transition phrases are a sign that the writer or speaker is about to shift concepts. That is then a place to break up the block, unless it would be too short, but those are okay in a blog. All the bridge types are relevant: counting, continuity, contrast, confirmation, concession, conversion, counterexample, and so on. When the same word is repeated in the next sentence, there may be more detail. Or if the format is parallel, like both use parentheses, split into a pair. Reverse outline a good book\u2019s style, for instance. The first half is simpler than the latter which builds on the concepts and deepens the theme. Skim through the first sentences which would be the normal points. A new name or place is brought up. They may look like topics and subtopics on separate index cards. Again go through the last sentences. Like jazz, they would have been the sharps and flats. A set may be negative, or broken apart where a semi-colong could have been, for exanple but all are varied. See how the lengths change for pacing. Altogether they follow a presentation scheme like slides in a class. They all assume the footnotes, or compressed references, as a series of facts. Whoever is telling it would be pausing after each to look around for questions. In this case those may be unstated, but the solutions still appear. Each frames the next play for the audience\u2019s attention. Answers here are often dropped to a short single for readability on a phone. ",
