            "answer_text": "BTS DOES answer their phones. We can see from the large amount of footage of them that they are on their phones all the time. It's 2019, of course they answer the phone. How else would they communicate with management, their friends, or each other? And I doubt management has control of or must approve every time BTS communicates with us on social media. For example, JK has posted between about 3am and 4am on Weverse before. I doubt Sejin was standing over his shoulder checking each post before he sent it. Back to your question. I could be misunderstanding you, and I apologize in advance if I am. But, if you mean why doesn't BTS answer their phones when their FANS call there is a very simple reason for that. Pardon my tone, but WE ARE NOT THEIR FRIENDS!! Of COURSE they don't answer their phones if a fan calls! On a recent Vlive, JK recieved a call from a delulu fan who had somehow gotten his number and I assume wanted to confirm its validity while he was live on the air. He knew what was going on, was NOT happy about it, and said he doesn't answer calls from numbers he doesn't recognize.  Why do people do this? They are celebrities! No matter how much we FEEL like we know them because of the info they decide to share with us in front of the camera, we don't know them in real life! You have a greater chance of winning a billion dollars in the lottery than you do of becoming their close friend or significant other. The odds are even worse if you get their number from a person who was NOT authorized to give it out and call them out of nowhere when they don't know you. Delulu Stalker, party of one, your table's ready. Believe me when I tell you, NO ONE in BTS will appreciate this. Your chances will have gone from 1 in any number plus about 20 zeros to exactly nil.  Anyway, I don't know if you were asking this question because you want them to answer your call or what the situation may be. Regardless, to all ARMY I say: YOU WILL NEVER BE THEIR FRIEND, BOYFRIEND, OR GIRLFRIEND! DON'T BE THAT PERSON! LET IT GO!  I apologize for the mini rant. Some \u201cARMY\u201d have really been getting on my nerves recently because of their treatment of JK and Hobi. And to those people I say:  Anyway, that's it. I'm done. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably because most kpop artist's social media are actually controlled by their manager. That means, if they wanted to post something or answer a text, they need to ask the manager first. In their contract, they need their manager\u2019s approval to do something so as to not causing any trouble or unnecessary \u201cfan and celebrity gossips\u201d (even though it's a good one but still in their contract, the manager is in control of almost everything in their life).
