Essentially, if there is no way the protagonist can reasonably be exposed to information critical to the story plot. In basic practice, each additional viewpoint adds about 4x as much housekeeping including but not limited to : That character\u2019s back story, front storyThat character\u2019s wants and needsThat character\u2019s stakes and motivationsThat character\u2019s goals and epiphanyThat character\u2019s immediate side cast and THEIR upkeepSo, it\u2019s hard enough to do one character well\u2014 doing all the above. If you have two or three, you SHOULD do the same justice to each. I find that most writers add another character without sufficient justification and generally weaken the narrative\u2026 because their motivation was a some trivial revelation that totally wasn\u2019t worth the extra dilution. See my article on developing character / milieu here: Will Greenway's post in Writing Challenges If big casts are your thing I have a whole article series on dealing with that: Writing: Handling a Cast of Thousands (1 of 3) Writing: Handling a Cast of Thousands (2 of 3) Writing: Handling a Cast of Thousands (3 of 3)  ",
