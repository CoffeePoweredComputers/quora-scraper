            "answer_text": "The question, from a personal standpoint, is kind of annoying. I am not certain what the reason for your question is because novels are not written just to fill up a certain number of pages. In my view, stories are as long as they need to be, and those stories are then viewed as to word count and not page number. This is especially true, today, with the ever-growing library of eBooks which sometime show thousands of pages for a book that might only be 200 pages, if they were in print. If you wish to perform estimates then consider the original average of 250 words per page (based on typed manuscripts that are double spaced and a font point of maybe 10). I, personally prefer to estimate page word counts to 300 words per page. How long do you plan your story to be will determine the final word count, and for print, will give you a close approximation of page count. Short stories can be as long as 100 pages (maybe 30,000 words). Novellas are commonly between 150 and 200 pages (60,000 words). Full novels are commonly 200 to 550 pages (165,000 words) and epic novels are larger than 550 pages, though these are becoming harder to sell unless the author serializes the story into multiple parts. Plan-out your story. You will then know how long your book will be, according to how many chapters you need to tell the story, and how long each chapter will be. Writing a novel is not just sitting at a computer and vomiting out whatever comes to you. There are a few genius writers who can do that, but they still have a full plan inside their heads. Anyone else doing this falls into the category of hack, and usually their stories are pulpy and are easily forgotten. If you are going to spend the time and effort in writing a novel then it is with planned intent and do it correctly. When you get good in your planning a novel, you will know your word count, of the finished product, before writing one single word towards your story. ",

            "answer_text": " I bought a book that is a collection of novellas, I\u2019d been trying to figure out when I was done, needed to add more. I did the whole word count, line count, per page. Some stories started to naturally end at around 200pgs. I\u2019ve written other stuff that is 500+ pages so I\u2019m always conscious of not just size/length but also ultimately production costs and profit margins so in proof/galleys I play with font size, etc. to find the space between comfortable read and the right amount of pages. Then Toni Morrison\u2019s God Help The Child came out, right after I got Home and they\u2019re both around 200 pages.  I also put together my work in short story collections with novellas so I feel like anything around 100\u2013125 pages could stand on it\u2019s own BUT what got me all page counting was that the spine of books, to print name and title which is one of the criteria for Barnes & Noble, equals out to 132\u2013140 pages. So there\u2019s always that business consideration which dictates my construction of a total book. I do Special Reports, minimum 150 pages for binder/spine titling, stores, etc.. Generally in a 10\u201312 font, with about 4\u201310 pages for tile, legal stuff, foreword. I used to add in glossaries but we\u2019re looking at changing the whole line so that those are only in digital E Books or solely as E Book videos. As part of my LGBT workshop work and educational general work, I\u2019m often teaching a specific topic and the participants want glossary information so in my first publishing iteration, I did glossaries, which could be about 20 pages of terms, financial info,m educational info so that generally got me from 130 to 150 pgs in non fiction. But even in E Books you\u2019re looking at the original file size cutting into margin. I think like, The Dead, you can get a good story told in under 200 pages, even under 150 but the slimmer the volume the more you\u2019re looking at specialty costs associated to the production. #KylePhoenix #TheKylePhoenixShow ",
