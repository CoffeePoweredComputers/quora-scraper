            "answer_text": "Fellow 17-year-old at the ready! I\u2019m probably gonna get a bit of flak for saying this, but as someone who\u2019s gone through the exact same thought process of wanting to write a 1,000+ page novel with dozens of characters and an intricate, interwoven plot: yes, it is too ambitious. You know War and Peace? Game of Thrones? The Lord of the Rings? The Brothers Karamazov? The Harry Potter series put into a single novel (probably on Kindle)? That\u2019s what I was aiming for. I had a whole structure set up, the lore of an alternate history, a multitude of factions and war events, with a cool backstory for the main character\u2014when I started I said to myself, \u201cMan, this is so original and interesting. I\u2019m really proud for coming up with such a unique and well-developed concept for the story.\u201d This so-called story I had begun sits at 35 pages. You wanna know when I started? A whole freaking year ago. Chances are, you lack the experience, and that includes the ability to write powerful dialogue, nuances between characters and their relationships, and excellent prose. Seriously, Tolkien and Dostoevsky make writing prose look easy; it\u2019s not! Good prose is almost impossible, frankly, as is building a long, winding plot with numerous threads, all of which connect in a satisfying conclusion at the end. The literary greats write these 1,000-page story-lines with breath-taking prose, witty dialogue, and an engaging story. It\u2019s ambitious, sure, even inspiring, but these guys have years upon years upon decades of experience: time dedicated to honing their skills and even writing other works, publishing them, even. Trust me, my writing isn\u2019t even one-hundredth of their quality because, much like yourself, I lack the experience. I have a hard time keeping a scene flowing, or rolling out entertaining dialogue without boring myself. For goodness\u2019s sake, we\u2019re not even adults! I love your ambition, and I hope that passion for writing stays with you. But trust me, give it time. Read as much as possible, write short, 20\u201330 pages stories every week, or month, perhaps, and above all else, don\u2019t procrastinate. It\u2019s like when James Cameron had the great idea we now know as the blockbuster hit Avatar, yet he waited up to ten years because the technology for his ambition simply wasn\u2019t available. Same here. You and I both need more experience; our skill just isn\u2019t up for lengthy and interesting plots. Give it time and keep at it. I know I will. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u00b4t advise on writing about that subject specially if you are inexperienced (unless is somewhat centered as the racism on the black people from a white people perspective sorta thing, like a female european girl falling in love with a black male or something). Mainly because you are most likely to write better of stuff you relate too similar to you are more likely to read stuff you relate too. If you build a lie (which is what basically a book is) under no foundation it gets increasibly harder to stack it over and over and you lose much if not all the details since they get harder to remember. Writing about something you have experienced and then translate it into something fictional is the best way to go, some of the most famous writers are just telling their life anecdotas in much more interesting ways with criminals and spies and stuff but at the bare bones is just a mundane life anecdote. Take Harry Potter for instance, is a mundane story about a highscholer boy, sure they have magic but most of the early books is just mundane interaction. First book is about new school, moving to a new place. Second book is about inner identity and finding your true self, third book is about family, maybe being adopted sorta thing, where you come from, fourth book is about teenager relationships and teenager sport events. fith book is about authority\u2026.and I could keep going. But anyway this ar stuff that the writer (or someone close to them) have lived and can narrate to them which makes writing much more easily and the text coming out of it feels much more natural even if contains witches and trolls ",
