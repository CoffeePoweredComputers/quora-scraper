            "answer_text": "Do I like Journalism? Short answer: Yes I do.  Long answer: I have previously mentioned why I liked journalism on one of my answers regarding Multimedia Journalism, here is the link to my answer: What skills do you need to be a multimedia journalist? Journalism for me is a platform where I can voice my opinion and also learn. Ever since college I have been exposed to journalism, from TV to radio. Whilst at college I have been admired by my tutors on subjects that no ordinary student studying media would choose or be interested in, which is politics, current affairs and what\u2019s happening generally in my city. I have always been interested in the radio journalist industry and majority of my packages suited for radio, I\u2019m not opposed to TV journalism (I have done lots of TV packages) radio was more my style and suited me better. Journalism has given me the confidence to voice my opinion and not be afraid to go out find a story and interact with different people. Prior into studying media and journalism I was a reserved kid, I didn't interact with people much so my confidence level was low. Where I am at now my confidence level is high! Sure I can be shy but thats me, Journalism has given me so much life skills I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll be like if I didn't purse that path.  I\u2019m still a student and currently on my final year at university! I pray after my degree I get a job in the industry, I\u2019m still young so I have so much to learn within the industry so watch this space! ",
