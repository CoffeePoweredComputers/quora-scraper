            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to like my answer. It\u2019s not because you\u2019re too young (mostly), it\u2019s really not. I\u2019d say the same thing to anyone with an idea like this. It\u2019s a cute idea, and a nice fantasy, but that\u2019s it. In real life, it\u2019s just not going to happen like you may want it to. The example letter in the question details is full of big promises and commitments, and ends with a declaration of unconditional love, forever. That\u2019s not a promise you can make, plain and simple. Especially before dating someone. Even if you were already dating someone, you couldn\u2019t just guarantee unconditional love, flowers and chocolates every week, and perfect loyalty and selflessness. Especially not right off the bat. These things take time. So I\u2019m sorry, but you don\u2019t love him, and you can\u2019t know whether you\u2019d be able to keep any of these promises. If a girl I wasn\u2019t dating gave me a letter like this, I\u2019d be somewhere between awkwardly flattered, but not interested, and creeped out and completely turned away from any prospect of dating her. The whole thing reeks of clinginess and reads like wedding vows. And no way am I trying to marry someone before dating them. Most people are averse to that sort of thing. I think she should think long and hard about your ideas about relationships, and you probably shouldn\u2019t write that letter. You don\u2019t even know for certain if he will be you future boyfriend, for crying out loud! You can\u2019t assume anything will just magically work out like a fairy tale, honestly. I hate to crush your hopes and dreams, but happily ever after only comes after building a relationship, from the ground up. You can\u2019t just expect one to fall at your feet. ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah !!! It\u2019s a terrific idea !!! And it\u2019s exactly what I did !!! I wrote a letter to my future bf when I was 15 .i meet my first bf at my 18 .But unfortunately I wrote that letter in Chinese and he\u2019s an American so HE CANT READ THE Letter  . So plz remember to write the letter prepared for future bf in different language  Btw it shouldn\u2019t just be ONE letter ,it should be a series right ? Cuz u probably don\u2019t just have one bf .  Peace \u270c\ufe0e and good luck ",
