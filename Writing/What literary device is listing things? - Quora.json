            "answer_text": "Employing LITERARY DEVICES for the purpose of LISTING THINGS: It is an excellent question because good writers are frequently faced with offering examples to support opinion and fact. Organized speech does not quite run into the same stresses as does good writing. When you compose, it is vital that you LIST items (things, objects, etc.) comfortably and with a sense of professionalism for the reader. This helps to carry with it respect for your written words. Here then are various ways to LIST literary things: Alphabetically: Random listing is troublesome for a reader who wishes a second and third reading of your list.Perhaps number the list vertically.Perhaps number the list within the text in parentheses, each item separated by a semi-colon. There are a number of formats to listing within context. The Internet has experts to guide us.Similar to # 3: Using e.g., a Latin abbreviation that very simply means the writer will list examples. It is placed in the text and followed by a comma, and then followed by a horizontal list. \u201c I like many sports, e.g., baseball, soccer, rugby, and tennis.\u201dA glossary at the end of the written work, completely defining all terms alphabetically. This allows flow of the text without getting too mired in definitions within the text.Footnotes at the bottom of each page where a footnote is indicated by a small numeral in the text. Once again, as with a glossary, it allows flow of the text without getting too mired in extra data within the text. Footnotes can also appear at the rear of a text, as with a glossary, rather than at the bottom of each page.A table of contents to appear initially that outlines what is to be found within. Each chapter/section is numbered.Outlines: Quite formal in nature, outlines are often requirements for research assignments and book proposals. Outlines have various formats, often employing capital letters, numerals, indentations, etc. They serve as \u201csneak peaks\u201d to the much larger picture. Some speakers like to have a bare outline before them for guidance and/or reassurance.A final point: The Internet is fabulous. If you have questions about any of these eight suggestions I have listed and more, turn to the Internet. There are experts with excellent articles that offer so much to all of us. ",

            "answer_text": "Word level: Many literary devices affect single words or short sentences. For example, a metaphor is when one word replaces another. Thus, for example, \"The Sun\u201d was a golden gem\" would be a metaphor and a word level literary device. Polysyndetone: Polysyndeton is the opposite of another styling device known as \"asyndeton\". In Asindeton, the words in the list are separated by commas, and no link is used to join the words in the list. ",
