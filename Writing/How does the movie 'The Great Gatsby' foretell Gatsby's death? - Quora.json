            "answer_text": "Which movie? There were 4 movies made of the novel and each reflects the director\u2019s vision. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses foreshadowing and flashback as key elements throughout the novel, so let\u2019s focus on that and then you can go back to the movie and see if the director mirrors Fitzgerald in the film. Look at the scene in which the gang of 5 makes a stop in the hotel room with the intention of cooling off and tempers flare when Gatsby and Tom square off over Daisy. Everyone is perspiring except Gatsby who is seemingly untouched by the heat. Why? Well, it sets him apart from the others; one of my students once suggested that corpses don\u2019t sweat and Gatsby would soon be a corpse. Don\u2019t know if that was Fitzgerald\u2019s intention, but it works. The heat, certainly, foreshadows the increase of tension between the main characters. Combine that with the emotional upset and the recklessness and just bad driving in the novel, and it suggests something bad will happen in that wasteland of the Valley of Ashes. But there are other places in the novel where a bad end for Gatsby is suggested. Owl Eyes acts as if Gatsby\u2019s mansion is falling apart (and it is torn apart by the party goers on a regular basis); the clock on the mantel falls\u2014 Gatsby cannot hold back time; Nick\u2019s insomnia suggests that he senses something is wrong; Gatsby swims on the first day of autumn, a season of change and death (the summer is the time when his affair with Daisy is in full swing; Miss Baedeker\u2019s comment about drowning in a pool; Daisy and Gatsby reunite during a rainstorm suggesting water will be part of some part of their relationship, in this case, Gatsby\u2019s death; the carelessness in which both Tom and Daisy conduct their affairs\u2014 wide open, little care for the consequences as evidenced by how little thought seems to go toward the victim of one of those affairs, Myrtle. Certainly Nick\u2019s narration at the beginning suggests a bad end for Gatsby or, at least, not the end that Gatsby was looking for. ",
