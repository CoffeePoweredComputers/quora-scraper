            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re asking does Quora pay people to ask question, the answer is essentially no. Though Quora does have bots that generate generic questions like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best pizza in Yonkers, NY?\u201d There undoubtedly are staff members who get those generators rolling. So in that sense part of their job is being paid to ask questions. If you\u2019re asking if there are people who are paid from outside Quora to ask questions, then the answer is definitely yes. Quora has both spammers and paid trolls. Quora does have filters. We don\u2019t see what Quora blocks from getting on. We only see what gets through. Quora does depend on users reporting spam and troll questions.  UPDATE: Some months after answering this, Quora started the Partner Program. It\u2019s a pilot program that people have been (randomly?) invited to. They ask questions and are paid a tiny bit if a question generates answers. Partner Program - Frequently Asked Questions The problem for Quora is that there are way more people who want to answer questions than ones who have questions to ask. The purpose of the program, I believe, is to generate the type of questions people ask on Google which will then bring Quora up in a search. If the question has answers. Clicks then bring in revenue. A couple of Top Writers are in the program and reported being paid less than a $.25. Some prolific question generators say they can earn $10 or so. But it takes lots of questions and time to do that. That\u2019s not 1000s of quality questions, though! When they generate a bunch on one topic it clogs up people\u2019s feeds. The program obviously has some kinks to work out! I\u2019ve found it helps to Mute and Block people who keep generating similar questions. I also have The Qure browser plugin (for Chrome and Firefox). It adds the question author\u2019s name to questions in the feed. That makes it easy to spot the annoying question writers so they can be blocked. ",

            "answer_text": "If you can\u2019t make sense out of it you are in good company. I would like to join you. Thousands are trying to figure that out. The quality and usefulness of the question does not seem to matter. There is no time and there are no resources to measure the \u201cquality\u201d of a question. So they adopt a simple metric. You bring them money, and they give you a share of it. How much? I don\u2019t know. And they wont tell. I suspect they generously parted with a greater share last year but this year they are tight-fisted. To earn well, a question must be on a trending topic that invites a lot of views and attracts many answers that in turn attract more views on the answer pages that result in advertisers inserting ad impressions. The more the impressions the more the chances that these ads will actually be clicked on. Each click is like a the ring of a cash register for Quora. Quora has fixed a percentage of this ad revenue to be shared with the person who asked the question. While this is easy to understand what is a mystery is how to ask questions that fulfill the above requirements. I have tried all tricks and failed. I now stopped chasing money for questions, and ask about 4 to 6 questions a day and satisfy myself with the dollar or so that I get per day. Quora cannot be enjoyed if one chases money. Hope this answers your question. \u2014 ",

            "answer_text": "Oh yes - and also some are paying Quora to do so. \"What do you think of the 2018 Expensive Car?\"... things like that. And let's not even talk about the number of push questions. Shaping political attitudes is advertising too. The latter would be here regardless of what Quora wanted to do... it's what participatory websites (like this and facebook) have that's appealing to marketers. Now, I doubt Quora is paying anyone for questions that aren't ads in disguise... it's not like there's fake nuclear physics questions here, or more arcane areas of certain subjects. But it's easy to tell - I think. Maybe I'm just into language, but you can tell the stereotypical stoner with his friends in a basement (sophomoric), the true cranks (informed but conspiracy-theory-ish), both are certain vernaculars. There's also adult cases of arrested development, another vernacular. Ads seem slightly too well written, have turns of phrase that are more \"written\" than \"spoken\" - most people here, I've noticed, write in a kind of spoken in a proper written English way - i.e., they've written college papers, they can construct a paragraph, but there's a person writing it, you can tell. A touch of conversational there. Some are great communicators - the serious stuff that Habib Fanny has written are both academic and accessible. You're not going to see that in ads. They're in ad-speak. They're not going anywhere, though... really, looking at ye olde edit log, seeing if it's anonymous, seeing if the OP seems like a real person... after a while, I wouldn't get worked up over something that seems sketchy. There's a few members I've noticed that, hmmm.... I feel their questions are \"placed\" but I don't know. Anyways, as another member used to be fond of saying, if you think it's free, it's not. So of course there's money in the background, every business, every website there is. You just have to guard your own intellect from nutters or ads. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Yes, Quora pays me for asking questions on this platform. I\u2019m a member of the Quora Partner Program since January 2019. With the Quora Partner Program, Quora compensate users who make Quora better. As a partner you can earn money by asking questions that many people want answers to and by requesting qualified writers to answer questions. When you add a question to Quora, it's often a question others have too. The more people there are who want answers to questions you add, and the better the answers to these questions , the more you'll earn. You can request answers to questions from qualified writers on Quora, and the more good answers your requests produce, the more you'll earn, all while helping Quora become more useful to others. You get paid as your questions and requests produce useful answers that others discover, either on Quora or elsewhere on the web. You make money from the advertising revenue earned from answers you helped produce because good, useful answers which can help others depend on good, well-considered questions and requests. QPP is an invite-only program and most probably the invite is completely random. You also agree to be bound by the Platform Terms (https://www.quora.com/about/tos) as a condition of participation.

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026sort of. For starters, you have to be invited to join the Quora Partner Program (or QPP, often hilariously backronymed as the \u201cQuality Prevention Program\u201d) The QPP financially rewards its members for asking \u201chigh quality\u201d questions on Quora. At least, in theory. What it really does is reward questions that generate traffic. And as any business person can tell you, you have two strategies for generating revenue: quality, or quantity. Some people in the QPP take the time to write good, insightful questions that really make you think. Others spam Quora with thousands of questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s the square root of 34?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s your review of *insert random movie*?\u201d. Now you might be thinking \u201cWho clicks on \u2018What\u2019s the square root of 34?\u2019\u201d and the answer is very few people. But if you also post \u201cWhat\u2019s the square root of 35?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s the square root of 36?\u201d and so on\u2026it starts to add up. I was invited to join the QPP. I\u2019ve earned all of $9.79 for my question-writing efforts. Not $9.79 per day\u2026 $9.79 total. (I believe you can\u2019t cash out until you reach $10) But I refuse to spam Quora with pointless questions, so I don\u2019t think I shall be retiring on my QPP nest egg any time soon. For the record, I\u2019ve read some murmuring lately that people are having trouble getting paid by the QPP, even if they have passed the $10 threshold. Make of that what you will. My point is this: if you\u2019re looking to make money online, there are easier and more reliable ways to do it than the Quora Partner Program. ",

Getting a question worth hundreds is not unlike winning the lottery, it might happen, but you really can\u2019t rely on it. Most of your revenue will come from those questions that never crack 20 cents. The QPP is, put simply, a numbers game. To make anything even resembling decent money, you\u2019ll need to amass thousands of questions churning out 1\u201310 cents every other day. The temptation is there to mass produce questions, to churn them out like a program or lift them from a trivia book but everything you do on Quora effects the visibility of your content. Using templates or quiz questions will attract a whole heap of animosity and downvotes, this severely effects the visibility of your content as well as your potential to earn. You might make a quick buck, but you\u2019ll restrict your future potential and possibly get dropped from the program if your questions are too trivial or obvious. If you stick with it though, after a few months you\u2019ll start to make some progress, but it will be slow. If you\u2019re diligent, your question quality will improve, your visibility will be good and you\u2019ll make more per question. ",

            "answer_text": "Quora pays only certain users for asking valuable questions and contributing to the platform throgh Quora Partner Program (QPP). It is a completely invite based program which is credited to only few people on Quora who seem to be regular and have complied with the Quora policy. How does QPP work? Through QPP, every partner gets a dashboard (as shown in the image) where they can add question and track their earning. Your earnings are determined by the amount of views and the ads shown/ Clicked.  (Source: Google Images) However, off late I have read that a lot of people have received the invite just in few weeks of joining Quora without having contributed much, while others who have spent a lot of time, are yet deprived. It makes me question if the process is completely random. I got in touch with the Quora team for QPP recently and I asked them the same question to which I was told that QPP will be open for more people in coming days. So, just contribute your best to the platform and wait until Quora thinks you're deserving. You can make use of the platform even without QPP by contributing and learning from plethora of good writers here. QPP is just a bonus! Suggestion: Do not count on it as a reat source of income as it doesn't a pay lot as it did earlier. You might have to spend a lot of time to earn a dime. As pointed out earlier by Gopalkrishna Vishwanath Sir in one of his recent answers that QPP is best for the people who are retired or just stay at home with not much of a responsibility and enjoy sharing their knowledge on this Platform. Hope that helps! ",

It's just peanuts, but it's still better than $0.00. I haven't been making any money off of new questions that I've ever asked or re-asked in about a month or so. I've determined that the only questions that make any money for me are on the topics of pets, politics, WWE, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Michael Jackson and the Beatles. I make next to nothing on anything that falls outside of those categories. ",

It could be fewer but you will increase your chances dramatically if you do 50/50. Once you get invited to the program you will not be paid per question but instead we paid on what is called revenue sharing. It\u2019s very simple and is very similar to Google ad words or other content networks. You are sometimes paid pennies. It\u2019s not easy money. You have to ask quality questions. That\u2019s how you get paid to ask questions. I will come back and post the explanation of the QPP views, add presentation and clicks so that maybe it would help you understand better. QPP is not a big moneymaker but it can buy you a cup of coffee or more each month depending on how much work you do. The top partner makes about $5000 a month and they work pretty hard. Here\u2019s how to understand QPP and how people are paid: What are \"Ad Impressions\" on the Quora partner program? ",

But if you get an invite, and don\u2019t stuff up by getting banned - then: When you reach $US5 Quora will ask for your Stripe account details if you live in the US or PayPal account details if you live outside the US. When you reach $US10 you are eligible to be paid. You get this money automatically if you reach the $10 by the first Monday of the Month. The money gets into your Stripe or PayPal account usually within 24 hours. Note however: There is NO guarantee you will get anything from Quora. Quora shares a part of ad revenue they MAY receive from adverts placed under questions. If Quora gets nothing, you get nothing. Earnings since the September algorithm adjustment have been much reduced usually, often to about 1/4th of the amount before hand. So don\u2019t expect to get rich fast on Quora, or even slowly. OP: Can I actually earn money from asking questions on here, and how do I get it? ",

I went into this whole Partner Program with the mindset that I\u2019m making all these little deposits every day into an interest-based checking account. Just like with one of those, you\u2019re not going to earn that much from the start. But little by little over time, you will start to see your earnings slowly go on the up the more questions you ask, and I mean questions that get a lot of engagement and attention. Just a few days ago, I was only earning 50 cents from a day, and the amount that I\u2019m accumulating daily has already doubled. I see progress each day, and I\u2019m going to continue to keep at this to see what happens. I\u2019ve only been posting questions like this on Quora since last week, but I\u2019m convinced that it\u2019s not only a fun way to learn but a cool way to build a bit of passive income on the side in addition to having a job already. Check it out!  My goal with this is to try to get this up a bit more to the point where I\u2019m earning at least a few dollars a day, but try to keep my questions as high quality as I can. I also still enjoy contributing answers to this site daily. ",

To date, I have answered hundreds of questions on Quora, but I have a asked all of one question. It was before there was a partner program. It didn\u2019t matter anyway. It got zero answers.

Some questions make more than others, so you'll have to do a little experimenting to find good types of questions to ask. Some topics, like Quora, are excluded from this and can't earn money. So start asking questions, it's harder than you think ",
