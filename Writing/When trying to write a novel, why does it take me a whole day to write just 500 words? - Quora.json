            "answer_text": "500 a day is good, nothing to worry about. It's when you stop then it becomes a problem. Try to think in terms of scenes within the chapter, what is the main pov's goal what do they want or need to do? Do they need to escape? Find the words to make another person listen? Solve a puzzle in say, a locked room? Figure out where to go next? Maybe they need to explore a town/city? Undergo training? Is this pov the one with the most to win or lose in this scene? If not try switching povs (If you aren't writing in first person.) Refer to your outline, if you didn't have one make a short list and at the top put the plot in a few short words along with the main goal of your main pov. Then below this write something about the first chapter and the ending of that chapter. Pin down what was important in it that kicked off chapter two. Keep doing this until you reach where you were slowing down. This is silly but try it, smash random keys and don't think about anything for a couple of minutes and let your frustrations out. Now try writing again thinking about what needs to happen and what your pov really needs to happen, even if they don't necessarily like it. Still coming out too slow for your tastes? Break time! Go into Google or Startpage and search Writing tips structure Writing tips foreshadowing Writing tips character development Writing tips show don't tell Writing tips deep pov Writing tips first person Writing tips third person Writing tips third person limited Writing tips omanisant Writing tips the importance of paragraphs Writing tips writing into a corner Writing tips readers hate these tropes Read the articles even if you know this stuff already, I find that reading them will help kick something free and I'm able to go back and write better and little faster with less doubt. Some days will be better than others, and some books will be harder to write than others. That doesn't mean you should quit it just means it's coming out at this pace and that's okay! Sit down and read all of you have done far no editing allowed. Soak up every word until you're back were you slowed down. This will refresh your memory on everything that's happened so far and help you continue forward. Maybe the problem is the character is stuck? Go back to some earlier point in the chapter and add in a way to solve the problem. Not early enough? Go back several chapters and search for a sneaky spot to set up this fix. For example: On chapter four my 2nd pov (major character) stops the antagonist from hurting the main pov by threatening them with an ice potion, but ends up not having to use it. Eleven chapters later I slowed way down to less than 500 words for the whole day. Arrg! And couldn't figure out how to get the other two characters out of the deadly rapids after falling in. Boom! He climbs down to the river bed and freezes them in the river. A new problem but at least they aren't going over the waterfall anymore. You are author god and can go back at anytime to add in or take things out. If an awesome chapter that you can't think to get rid of is causing the slow down open up a word doc (or Google docs) paste the whole thing, save as 000darlings and then in your book DELETE. Poof problem gone but not truly deleted. You can go back later and harvest all darling chapters for easy dialogue, descriptions, settings, and such. Hea. Sometimes the taken out chapter fits better later on. This often gets things going and I can hit 2-3k words for a while. But usually it's between 500 to 800 per day I'm okay with that. Anyway, if things slow down try thinking of something else that came before the problem chapter that can be used. Your subconscious probably set something up already, just have to go and look. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two types of writers - those for whom the words pour out and those that struggle to get the words out. Often the ones that have no trouble putting words down act as if it\u2019s the only way to be, like if the words aren\u2019t coming easy you\u2019re not a writer. To that I say hogwash. There are advantages and disadvantages to both modes. It\u2019s frustrating when the words come hard, but when they come, they\u2019re hard won. It\u2019s likely that most of those words belong on the page. If words come fast and furious, that\u2019s great. But odds are you\u2019re going to have some next-level editing to do afterward. My advice is to let the words come as fast as they will. And keep in mind that at 500 words per workday (assuming you work every weekday), it will only take nine months to finish the first draft of a 90,000 word novel. That might seem like a long time if you\u2019re young, but at that rate you could put out a book a year. Every time this question comes up, I\u2019m reminded of a quote from journalist A.J. Liebling - \u201cI can write better than anybody who can write faster, and I can write faster than anybody who can write better.\u201d ",
