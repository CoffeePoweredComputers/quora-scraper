            "answer_text": "If a person isn't offering any decency even when times are tough they refuse to listen. The intention is what was important.They, we don't understand ourselves most of the time. How can a outsider pretend to know what's going on. The others only see the person showing emotion, the person who seems to be fighting. The passive person, aggressively defending another persons freedom to use their wife as a pinata for 14 years. The passive would rather watch their own wife suffer and cry over being set for the fall. Instead of the endless suffering why not communicate??? Use the words God gave us to relay a message to those we call loved ones. Absolute disrespect to let a family member abuse your girlfriend /boyfriend, or spouse. Fighting or foreplay at this level is wrong, no matter who it is. Please give the family a chance to right the wrongs. If everyone judges all the time without knowing the history, or thinks that the person who is yelling and fighting is the crazy one, then think again. It's nice to offer the person who took responsibility for their mental wellness a straight jacket . Anytime you dont want to accept the reality , Remember to evaluate yourself as well. I guess the average person does not have enough passion to get stirred up for the same I choose. But I do see you have passion for the person who did nothing to protect or defend my honor. Everyone has compassion for the poor man involved who is taking credit for being a peacekeeper. He could not even utter \u201cPlease leave her alone\" or \u201cwhat's your problem\" I think I do carry more than my share, in fact I carry way too much, but for the right reason. I can adjust my behavior and in reality I do see where I'm terribly wrong, and I am very sorry! I will never live down the humiliation I have endured since I joined this family. I had a religious bomb dropped on my head as well as a very disturbing reception on my first Christmas with my husbands family. I was set up to a slaughter. A year in advance notice, to a holiday gathering that i was not invited to or welcome at. Eating at your ex wife's house without the travel companion who cried for 9 hours knowing that she was in for the time of her life. The ex wife thought her husband was coming back to her. The kids are all adults and could have visited grandma anytime. And likewise. A hour or two drive. Why wait until you bring a innocent person with no idea that they are the scum of the earth to go see your brothers ex wife occupy her turf. .. ",
