            "answer_text": "When I write, I write in scenes and later cobble them together in chapters. To me, a scene is on that has a unity of space, time and perspective (point of view).And I ensure that scene has its own beginning, middle and end. Because of my background as a playwright, i tend to use the same techniques of drama- using rising action, falling action, beats etc. I try to make sure that the book itself begins in media res\u2014 or in the middle of the story, preferably in some action scene\u2014 or a scene that immediately brings out the conflict. The order in which I write may depend on the mood and the setting. for instance, in my latest novel, I wrote the scenes in Pondicherry whike visiting. I write climatic and other important scenes only when i am in the flow. Since I write the scenes in no particular order, I use Scrivener, which is a great piece of writing software which allows me to stitch the complete novel together any which way. Sometimes, because of the way I write, I need transitioning sentences at the end of some of the scenes/chapters. Different writers have different methods. There are the strict outliners who know in advance to a great degree the plot, the chapters and the scenes they are going to write. These people are likely to write int the order of reading. then are the \u2018pantsers\u2019 \u2014 who follow a seat-of-the-pants approach. These writers will probably never write in the reading order. ",

If you write in a non-linear manner, then the first full edit is a crucial step to assuring continuity, and you may have to make some major changes. The advantage to random order, especially for a beginner, is that you get to work on the scene that excites you, and if you are stuck on something you can leave it behind for a while. The disadvantage is that continuity can be a bear, as you can forget where in the text plot elements were introduced, because \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d has no relation to the writing process.

So I also maintain another writing software where I write down whatever that comes to my mind at the moment, following no order. Sometimes, I write the same chapter twice. Sometimes, I write down different plot twists. Most of the times, they are \u2018practices': I don't always add them exactly to the main novel, but rewrite them or use bits and pieces of them in the main writing piece. ",

I\u2019m not sure why except that I\u2019m strapped for time right now, and so when I get writing time, I\u2019m inclined to write the scenes I imagine the most vividly.

If I'm inspired to write a certain part of a story, I'm going to write that part of the story. I don't care if it fits chronologically with what I've already wrote. I'll make it fit eventually.
