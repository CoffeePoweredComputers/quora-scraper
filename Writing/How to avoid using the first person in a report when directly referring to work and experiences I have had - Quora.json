            "answer_text": "Concerning the use of first person in a resume, it all depends on where you use it! I always recommend that a Summary (especially instead of an Objective) be included as part of a resume. This would be the only section in which first person would be appropriate. It wouldn\u2019t really even be necessary in any other section. Your Summary is describing you as a person as well as potential employee. If you are an Accountant for instance your Summary might begin with \u201cI have always loved numbers. I was a \u2018Mathlete\u2019 in school competing in math contests. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 That is the only time that you would have occasion to use \u201cI\u201d. For the Employment section of your resume the format should be- Company name and location and employment dates Job Title then objective of the position \u201cHired to review\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 then bulleted accomplishments \u201cStreamlined the process to\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. None of the rest of a resume needs you to identify yourself as the person performing what you describe, that is a given. ",
