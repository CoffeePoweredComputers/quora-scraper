            "answer_text": "Imagery, the descriptive words used to describe people, places, things, and situations all create imagery in the mind of the reader; rather, the reader creates the imagery from the words. The tone of a text may be described as the additive collection of images: \u201cIt was a dark and stormy night,\u201d lends itself to dark and troubled tone. \u201cThere, they basked in the warm Miami sun, while sipping champagne on the beach,\u201d may lead to a happier tone. What if both were in a text, though, or hundreds of conflicting images? The reader ultimately determines tone by memory of the collective imagery in a text. Also, the memory of other texts adds to the reader's interpretation of the current text. Quick answer: the reader alone can answer this question. ",

            "answer_text": "This sounds like the \"criticism\" classes I was able to avoid in both English literature and in music. More worthwhile using the time to do more reading and playing! (Since most ideas -- and books -- are mediocre down to bad, it's a good idea to encounter lots of them to better the chances of \"cosmic collisions\".) But you can also answer this question quite easily yourself just by looking at the official definitions of the terms. \"Tone\" is basically attitudinal: formal, carefree, humorous, sarcastic, etc. \"Imagery\" applies to sense-like descriptions: scenes, smells, sounds, etc. Pick an attitude and then pick sensory examples that help embody it or are opposed. Pick a sensory example and then pick attitudes that go along or the opposite. Good writers use lots of devices, but lots of devices don't make something worth reading. This is similar to the problem of sculpture: clay is completely malleable, but it can't simply be debugged into art. Vision is needed. Much better to start with searching out important ideas that are worth explaining to others, and then to find as many ways as possible to help them understand the importance. ",
