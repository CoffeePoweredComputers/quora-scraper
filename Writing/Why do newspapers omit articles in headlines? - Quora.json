            "answer_text": "Remember, newspaper publishing comes from the days when they were actually printed on actual paper. This meant there was a finite space in which to print news. You had to be economical in how you allocated the \"real estate\" on the page.  Headlines are supposed to give the briefest synopsis of a story's content. Because the letters used in a headline take up more space, dropping the indefinite articles saves two or three characters (a or an, plus the space), and dropping the definite article saves four (the, plus the space). Removing \"and\" while inserting a comma saves three characters. Doing so rarely impedes clarity, and creates a tiny but crucial amount of room for extra detail in the story. \"Bus crash kills 2, injures 3\" says the exact same thing as \"A bus crash kills 2 and injures 3\", but if the second one causes the headline to wrap onto a second line, you no longer have room on the page to offer more details in the story itself. And if it extends an extra inch or more straight across the page, it takes out room needed for another story on the same page. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it's primarily to save space and make the important words jump off the page. A lot of newspaper layout is optimized in a very \"front-loaded\" way; for example, the most important articles are on the top half of the page (above the fold). Also, currently each article has a headline, so it would be confusing if headlines had multiple articles. ",
