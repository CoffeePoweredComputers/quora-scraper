            "answer_text": "This reminds me of when I was working door at a club. A guy comes in as the band is playing. I tell him that the cover is 10 bucks. He asks if he can stand there for a second to see if he likes the band. After a song he starts peppering me with questions like, \u201cWhat is it that a band has that will take them to stardom?\u201d It turns out that he was the guitarist/manager for his own band and was looking for an angle\u2026 as if this kind of alchemy can be distilled. I\u2019ve seen thousands of bands in my time. I saw Nickelback play to 18 people in a club on their first tour of Canada. I have no answer for why some bands become mega-stars and others don\u2019t.They tried to make Paris Hilton a music star. They tried with Lindsay Lohan. Then the \u201cCash me Outside\u201d girl from Dr. Phil gets signed and sells a million records. Movie stars\u2026 for every guy like \u201cThe Rock\u201d or \u201cJason Statham\u201d there\u2019s a \u201cHowie Long\u201d or \u201cRowdie Roddy Piper\u201d (I STILL love, \u201cThey Live\u201d BTW). And who can explain \u201cAhnold\u201d? Dude could barely speak English! If they knew what it took to be a star, no movie would ever bomb and every record would be platinum. To quote the late William Goldman, \u201cNo one knows anything.\u201d I think it\u2019s the same with comedy. What separates a great comedian from an average one? They have that, \u201csomething-something\u201d that takes them to the next level. Full disclosure, I NEVER thought that Roseanne Barr\u2019s standup was funny. I refused to watch her show because her voice annoyed the hell out of me. Mega-star. I saw Sam Kinison do a club show. Half the audience walked out on him (including me and my girlfriend). 2 years later he\u2019s the biggest comic in Hollywood. Russel Peters can NOT break through into movies despite selling out stadiums. Then you get a comic\u2019s comic\u2026 a guy like Norm MacDonald (from my home town, BTW. I saw him when he was first starting out). Norm is loved by all comics. They call him a genius. Norm is not a star. Norm would be lucky to sell more than 500 tickets to a comedy show. So, not even a comic knows what separates the greats from the goods. ",

            "answer_text": "My friends are comedians. Really funny and amazing people. All at various stages of their career. Here\u2019s us at one of our house parties.  In this pic (or often at the parties) are all types of comedians: Dane Cook, Seth Green, Matt Rife, Kevin Miles, Vinny Fasline, David Sullivan, Rick Glassman, King Bach, Daniel Van Kirk and several others. They\u2019re all at different stages of their careers. Everything is a spectrum. Multiple instances must come together is a person\u2019s lifetime to help them achieve stardom, success and separate them from average comedians. A few things you can control: Practice like there\u2019s no going back. This is common amongst all the greats.Live in a city that fosters comedians. In America, that\u2019s likely Los Angeles, NYC or Chicago.God given talent. (It\u2019s a euphemism don\u2019t hate). Some people are born funny (not me). This is a tremendous advantage, but still requires the other points. Ok, you can\u2019t really control this so much but it is still critical to know your strengths and weaknesses.Find friends that help and foster your creativity, comedy and career. It\u2019s a long road filled with ups-and-downs. You\u2019ll need people who genuinely want to help you and see you succeed. Fans come and go, friends are there when you need them.Obsessed with perfecting their craft. Almost every waking moment find inspiration, study past comedians, record and watch your performances, understand the cadence of your own voice, practice your mannerisms, practice timing, practice writing, practice improv, practice with an audience, practice skits, practice and watch every nuance of your performance.Don\u2019t let the haters get to you, but take constructive criticism from people you respect and trust.My friends are hilarious. They\u2019re also great humans. ",
