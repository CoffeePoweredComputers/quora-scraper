            "answer_text": "The trim and the technical details are probably the least important things (your designer will ask you about the basic specs if he/she doesn't know them). Your job is to figure out what you want from your cover artistically.  I did this very exercise for my debut novel (Food Whore: A Novel of Dining & Deceit). Here's how I organized my design thoughts (and, btw, got the cover of my dreams).  1. CREATE A PINTEREST BOARD.   Don\u2019t worry about why you like them or if your examples are even book covers to begin with. Just trust your gut and pin things that speak to you. What would you pick up at the bookstore? What does your current bookshelf look like? 2. LOOK AROUND YOUR LIFE. This is my old apartment, painted in the colors of this Georgia O\u2019Keeffe painting What\u2019s the color scheme of your life? I live in a jewel-toned apartment and wear colorful, textured clothes. Your personality\u200a\u2014\u200aand your palette\u200a\u2014\u200aare infused into your words. Make your cover match, too. 3. PICK OUT VISUAL THEMES. After enough thought, certain patterns will emerge. For me, I found that my personal style and the designs I liked fell into these two looks. LUSH & PRETTY   GRAPHIC    4. PICK OUT CONCEPTUAL IDEAS. You\u2019ll also find you like covers created with a certain technique or hook. These were mine. FOOD THAT TELLS A STORY  MAKE YOU LOOK TWICE    A HAND-TOUCH (SOMETHING TO MAKE IT LOOK ALIVE)   5. PICK OUT COVERS YOU DON\u2019T LIKE. I won\u2019t name mine here because that\u2019s rude. But you\u2019ll know them when you see them. Perhaps the reasons are universal: they look cheap or clich\u00e9. Or, maybe your reasons are more specific to you\u200a\u2014\u200ayou don\u2019t like script, or images of people. It\u2019s important your art team knows your dislikes as much as your likes. 6. MOCK UP YOUR COVER (OPTIONAL). Sometimes you don\u2019t want to beat around the bush and have to put pen to paper (or fingers to mouse). You can say you want X, Y, Z, but you won\u2019t really know until you make it and see. I highly recommend Canva if you\u2019re not an actual graphic designer.      7. SEND EVERYTHING TO YOUR DESIGNER! (OR TO YOUR EDITOR IF THAT\u2019S YOUR PROCESS ) I made a picture-heavy PDF presentation that included all of the above, along with \u201ckey elements\u201d (themes and characters that could make good cover content). If you have explicit ideas for your cover, send them too. If you're interested... this is how my cover turned out.    The key is to 1) know what you want, 2) articulate it in a clear and actionable way for your designer, and 3) trust the process. Your cover art designer is like any designer\u200a\u2014\u200ahe or she wants clear guidelines, and then: freedom to do his or her thing.

            "answer_text": "Here are some questions to keep in mind while designing a book cover:- 01. Ask Relevant Questions First and foremost, before starting the design work, you should be getting the right answers to some key questions. Ask who is the author and know more about his or her background. What is the author\u2019s brand? Find out if the book is first from the author or he/she is an established and trusted writer.  Has the author published books in his or her name earlier? What is the genre? Is it science fiction, romance, thriller, horror, fantasy, etc? All such genres have different styles of book cover design. Similarly, literary books have different styles of cover design that define high-quality writing. 02. Know About The Target Market Of The Book It is very important to know the target customers and market of the book. For example, the author may intend to sell the book to e-readers only and want to avoid print format completely. In that case, the book cover design will be different in style and purpose.  A professional book cover design for selling on the web is created for visibility as the book will be sold on the platforms like Amazon as a thumbnail. An online reader or consumer will scroll down hundreds of titles on a computer screen. On the other hand, a print book sits on a shelf of a bookstore where consumers can physically pick the book, feel it in hands, and flip through it. 03. Pay Attention To Graphics Another tip on how to design a book cover is to make sure that you do not forget the graphics. A book cover contains a large amount of graphic information, which includes a logo of the publishing company and barcodes that help in selling a book from the stores.  04. Decide On The Format And Copy Choose the book format. These formats include hardback, paperback, or casebound. When designing for hardbacks, cover images are printed on the boards. Keep the size of the book in mind. Books come in a wide range of sizes. The copy includes back cover copy, front copy, author bio/photo, endorsements, and blurbs.  05. Consider Budget A graphic designer must first know the budget for publishing a book. If a book cover design cost is not kept under the budget, additional costs can increase the financial burden. Remember that the design costs include purchasing the font licenses, ISBN identifier and barcode, stock images, and other costs.  06. Know The Author\u2019s Vision Before designing a book cover, talk to the author to know what he/she has in mind about the design. Most authors have a certain image of their book cover design. This is because they know the content inside very well. As you talk to them, you get some design direction. So, instead of copying the book design ideas from other book covers, consider taking inputs from the author.  You should also visit a local bookstore. Handle some books there and feel them in your hands to know what paper thickness and material works better for a book. What cover designs suit to what types of books and get such tips. Make notes and consider them when designing your book cover. 07. Lay Emphasis On A Particular Element What should be the main element of the story you want to depict through your book cover design? Once you have decided on the story, you need to pick an element of it to lay it over the design predominantly. This is done to catch the attention of the buyer. The buyer can instantly know the content of the book this way. So, pick the most important element of your story and emphasize it in the cover design. But do not make the design look like a cheap copy.  Keep in mind that the author may be looking forward to writing a sequel or continuing with the title in more such stories in the future. So, in that case, the cover design should be able to accommodate and hold future titles. This means that there should not be a need to change the cover design drastically. Similarly, if the author is a brand name in the market, the emphasis might be on designing the letters of the name itself. But make sure that whichever design you choose to create, it must stand out amongst a host of titles on a bookshelf. 08. Pick Right Fonts And Graphics Another thing to consider about book covers is, it should be designed with great fonts and graphics. The designer should create a cover that is in line with the writer\u2019s wild imagination. Many books cover feature abstract design. Others have illustrations. Some of the covers have a photograph. In fact, modern cover design features a wide range of things including cartoons and typography.  Consider a graphic style that is unique, expresses the book\u2019s content, and is memorable as well. What message does your graphic design intend to send to the buyer? Soft typography should be used in natural settings. A mismatch of fonts and the book content will confuse the buyers. So, if your book is about women, use soft fonts. If the book is on some machines, use the strong and bold typeface. 09. Meet The Printer\u2019s Requirement When sending your book cover design to a printer, you need to consider sending a large file. The file would be containing the entire gamut of graphic design along with text details. The file should have the design of the front and back covers. It should also have the design of the spine and flaps.  Many printers prefer files such as .eps or .ai. But others like to have graphic designs in PDFs of high-quality. You may also be required to send the cover design file that is in full bleed. This implies that the images and other elements you used in the design should be extending beyond the trim line. In other words, there should not be any white margin-left. Since every printer is different and there are many industry standards in this regard, it is better to first consult your printer before sending the file. Looking for graphic design? We have helped thousands of business owners from all around the world with their graphic design needs such as logo design, website design, social media posts, banner, and much more. 10. Feedback Matters After you have created your ideal and great book cover design, do not take it as a final thing. That egoist approach may not contribute much to the design. Instead, move out and approach the author first. Know his/her views about the cover design. If you find the author\u2019s suggestions worth considering then go ahead and do the design or tweak it. Take the design to the outsiders also. Take the design to your followers on the social media page and ask them to give their opinion.  So, these are the key book cover design tips you should consider. If you are a book cover designer or even an author, a way to source many cover design ideas is to crowdsource the work.
