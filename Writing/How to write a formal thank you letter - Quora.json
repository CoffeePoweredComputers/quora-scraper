            "answer_text": "Thank you letters are meant to make the receiver feel good about something that they have done for you or given you. If you keep this in mind, then you will be set. Start by stating what you are thankful for. \u201cThank you for the gift/time/consideration\u2026\u201d Then follow up with stating why the gift of time/physical object was meaningful to you, and then explain why you felt that way. Did it help you achieve a goal? Was it something that you\u2019ve been really wanting but couldn\u2019t afford? Did the time that was given to you provide some insight/wisdom/direction for you life? The key is to be sincere. The recipient will know if they are getting a form letter sent out of obligation. ",
