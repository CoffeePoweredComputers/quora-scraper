            "answer_text": "If I were a teacher, asking students to describe something, I would show them some photos of famous natural/man-made phenomena and get them to describe its most significant historical points. I would probably include pictures of: Machu Picchu (describe the overall geography)Mont St. Michel (explain what a tidal island is, and why anyone would build their castle on one)A pillory (explain what it was used for; also, talk about the types of societies that used it \u2014 were they religious?)An old black-and-white \u201cwoodcut\u201d image of a slave auction. (What country is this? When? Why is it important in history?)A picture of Walter Cronkite reading the news, in the old days of THREE networks. (Talk about his audience, his following; his trustworthiness; the \u201ccult of personality.\u201d)An old 1900-era photograph of a female suffragette holding a protest sign. (When was it taken? What country? What is she protesting? Why?)An old photo of the Titanic at Southampton before her fatal voyage. (Talk about the \u201cunsinkable\u201d myth; talk about lifeboats and the lack of them; talk about the rich being saved while the poor were drowned. Were there any changes in labor laws or safety regulations after this disaster?) That\u2019ll do for a start.  ",
