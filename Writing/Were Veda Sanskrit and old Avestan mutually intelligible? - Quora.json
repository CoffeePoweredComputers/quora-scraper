            "answer_text": "Those two languages being quite close to each other, there could have been a fair degree of mutual intelligibility (though not 100%) between the two. But there were both orthographic and phonetic differences between the two even for words with the same meaning, as they were not identical but cognates. This phenomenon would have given rise to some difficulties in mutual understanding. The real \u201cproblem\u201d, however, was more likely related to culture than purely linguistics. There are enough mythological and ancient anecdotal accounts to believe that the Vedic and the Avestan communities, though originally having the same ancestors, separated into two groups due to differences in religious belief and value system. So much so, that they not only made derogatory comments about each other but also demonised the gods of each other. Because of such quarrel brewing, no wonder that sooner or later the two groups should split geographically. Hence they had their respective homelands in ancient Persia and the Indus region. Politics must have also played a role in this. Linguistic divergence was the consequence of that split. There followed the stigmatization of the other group's language as something ignoble. That, in effect, created a linguistic barrier between the two groups and finally undermined mutual intelligibility. ",

            "answer_text": "Q:Were Veda Sanskrit and old Avestan mutually intelligible? Thank you for this question. I am not really an expert, but I may provide some of my observations. Sanskrit and Avestan are closely related languages with similar grammatical principles and numerous cognates, similarly like Italian and Spanish. You can find words which are basically identical, like Sanskrit/Avestan naman (name), ushtra (camel) etc. Then you have cognates which are basically the same, except that their similarity is somewhat obscured by a divergence of a certain sounds. It is comparable to Italian generale and Spanish general. Basically the same word, but the \u201cG\u201d is like English \u201cJ\u201d in the first case and as \u201cKH\u201d in the second. Some possible divergences between Sanskrit and Avestan cognates: S \u2194 H: soma \u2194 haoma (a pressed plant nectar) H\u2194Z: ahuti \u2194 azuiti (an oblation) H \u2194 ZH: ahi \u2194 azhi (a serpent); ZH = \u017d(\u0292), like French J J \u2194 Z: vajra \u2194 vazra (a tough weapon) T \u2194 TH: mantra \u2194 manthra (an utterance) K \u2194 KH: kshatra \u2194 khshathra (dominion) BH \u2194 B: bhratr \u2194 bratar SH \u2194 S: shyena \u2194 saena (a raptor) SHV \u2194 SP: ashva \u2194 aspa (a horse) RT \u2194 SH: martya \u2194 mashya (a mortal; a human) The Avestan RT \u2194 SH shift seems to be a less archaic characteristic. Its specific is that it happens only when R and T are next to each other, but not when a vowel is between them. You thus have amesha (immortal; amarta in Sanskrit), yet ameretat (immortality). Regarding the S \u2194 H divergence, it may be sometimes also S \u2194 NGH in the middle of the word: Nasatya \u2194 Naonghaithya. As you can note, the Avestan also commonly contains extra diphthongs if compared to Sanskrit: Arya \u2194 Airya (an Aryan), deva \u2194 daeva (a supernatural being), hotr \u2194 zaotar (a priestly officiator), ahuti \u2194 azuiti (an oblation), Sushravas \u2194 Haosravah (\u201cof Good Fame\u201d) etc. Outside the difference in diphthongs, there can be sometimes also a difference simply in the usage of different vowels: hiranya \u2194 zaranya (gold). The Sanskrit terms starting with \u201cR+consonant\u201d can have Avestan equivalents where a vowel \u201cA\u201d is inserted at the beginning, like rshti \u2194 arshti (a spear). It also means that while an extra \u201cA\u201d at the beginning which is not a part of the root of the word can mean a negation in both Avestan and Sanskrit, it does not in the Avestan \u201cR+consonant\u201d words. The Avestan negation would be anarshti (\u201ca non-spear\u201d, a hypothetical word which I just made up). Of course, these were examples of relatively ideal cognates which are separated by merely one particular shift, which is not always the case. Moreover, you also need to be careful about a few false friends, the same-like words with a different meaning, for example: dasyu X dahyu (savages X a country) marya X mairya (a young man X a thug) urvara X urvara (a fertile field X a plant); in Italian albero (a tree) Outside this vast amount of cognate words, you will find also words without a cognate in the other language. For example: Sanskrit: atman (self; a soul) brahman (something like \u201can essence\u201d) agni (a fire) Avestan: urvan (a soul) daena (an inspiration) atar (a fire) Of course, there would be also some more complications, like accent differences.
