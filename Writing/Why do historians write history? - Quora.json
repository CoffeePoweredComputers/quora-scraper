            "answer_text": "every dominating nation tries to project its history as the most glorious one, never mind the truths and facts, for example western european historians conveniently forget that their west europe was barbarian and had nothing to do with either greek or roman civilizations who both arouse because of eastern mesopotamian and egyptain civilizations, but western historians all link their genesis ultimately to rome and greece which doesnt make sense, its like saying that since africans were colonised by the europeans, the africans are europeans now, which would never be the case. i think misguidingly western european historians try to plant their history as a fake one and have largely succeeded in that too as well. since roman identity wasn\u2019t enough, western european historians have concocted indo european and aryan theory in which their ancestors supposedly invaded and civilized india and converted all indian hunter gatherers into civilized people, projected persian barbarians as the greatest civilization never bother the reality of persians being barbarians and adopting foreign culture in the first place, so by projecting fake indo european and racial aryan theory now western european stand as the top of racially and morally superior being whose colonial crimes have been justified because of them being racially superior and top of the food chain (Darwinian theory). the history is always more about perception the dominant powers create rather than reality, because perception is bigger than any reality or truths.
