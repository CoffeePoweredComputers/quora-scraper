            "answer_text": "It depends. In some ways, both fandoms have had trouble with each other and their own fandom. Although, they are by far two of the most popular fandoms in this generation, that has made them have an easy target for being accused of being possessive and problomatic. The reason I didn't include \u201ctoxic\u201d, is because it's misused in this situation. Toxic means poisonous, which theatrically it can be used to describe a person or a group of people. But back to the original question, no. I'm a multifandom and BTS and Blackpink are my number 1 and 2. I have to say that the fandoms are no better than each other. Each fandom always has different problems, but if you favor ( in my opinion, I think stan is harshly used, and more on the obsessive side ) a group, why let fandom ruin it for you? After all, the fandom is one, tiny chunk of why this group is one of your faves! So, don't worry about them, and focus on what matters most: Loving and Respecting your favorite groups (and solo artists, don't forget about that, sis!). ",

Personally, I am an Army, but I do not think that I am better than anyone else just because of who I am a fan of. Still, I appreciate Blackpink and enjoy their music from time to time even though I do not consider myself a Blink. So what? You might have your own preference for which group is better, but the fanbase is a whole other situation. ",
