            "answer_text": "like Ross Ritchey says, it will largely depend upon how you want to be involved with flash (i've used it since version 3) as it has become much more complicated + versatile insofar as what one can do. some examples:  animation (2D/3D, timeline/programmatic)video/audioria's (rich internet apps via Flex, 3rd-partly libraries/components, AIR, remoting, media server, etc)design (interface, component skins, mobile, ads, etc)production (import/export to/from flash from other environments)game designmobile app developmentarchitecture (client-server communications, edge-of-network appliances, etc)likewise, the basics don't take too long to learn (granted you practice regularly) + there are many great resources + books to model lessons from. beyond the basics, one should learn actionscript itself (syntax, vocabulary, methodologies), then move onto advanced topics which include classes, UML, interfaces, inheritance/composition, OOP, design patterns such as MVC, architecture, data consumption/parsing/exchange, client-server behavior + so forth. much of this will depend upon the path you want to pave for yourself + the players with whom you will inevitably choose to work +/ play.

            "answer_text": "This obviously will vary depending on what you are intending on using Flash for.  If you want to do timeline animation with some very basic button actions (think: banner advertisements, Newgrounds-style animations, etc) then there is not much of a learning curve.  You can be off the ground running in less than a day. On the other hand, if you want to create some rich interactive content (think: Plants vs. Zombies, a chat application, etc) you will need to learn Actionscript, a process that may take some time - assuming you have an affinity for programming.  You can probably get moving on the basics in 1-2 days of dedicated tutorial watching and trial-and-error.  But to really get good, I would expect to take some dedicated training classes on this. To get started, I would take a glance at the AdobeTV site. (http://tv.adobe.com/product/flash/) There is also the Adobe Flash DevNet. (http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash.html) After that, Lynda.com has some good tutorials if you are willing to pay.  And if you aren't - a Google search for \"Flash tutorials\" will give you a lot of good tutorials. ",
