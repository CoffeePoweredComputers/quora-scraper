            "answer_text": "It depends on how \u201cgood\u201d of a book you want to write, and whether you want many people\u2014if anyone, really\u2014to read it. The more important parts of writing are planning, research, reviewing, and editing. The most important part is rewriting. And rewriting. And rewriting. And rewriting. And rewriting. And reading (out loud). Repeat. Writing, as with any craft, takes practice. A book is a major project, no matter the subject, no matter how long or short. I wouldn't say writing is ever easy, but you can get better each time; your state of \u201cflow\u201d in the working process will also make you feel/think/believe the process is moving along quickly. Writer\u2019s block and procrastination don\u2019t discriminate, but don't let that intimidate or discourage you, either. If you want to write a book, the book will get written. Research the process. Read about writing. Read the writers you want to write like, so you start thinking like them. Plan. Take a notebook with you everywhere. Have notebooks and/or recorders everywhere. Then write, everything. All of the time. Don't pause trying to get it just right, because you might lose the next best thought. That's what rewriting is for. Oh. And rewrite. Did I mention that yet? You may have to restructure your schedule. Change routines, give up bad habits, be more conscientious, become obsessive. Build an accountability team. Gain the support and understanding of family, friends, colleagues. The first time may be the hardest, though I\u2019ve heard authors say the follow-up was harder, scarier. So, as with anything in life, never mind the easy/hard of it. Ask yourself: is it worth doing? Is this pursuit worthy of my time and talents and skill and passion and personhood? If writing a book is already within your consideration, perhaps it is very much worth it for you. ",

            "answer_text": "TLDR version: It is not easy! Depends on what kind of book you have in mind. If you're talking about a novel, it can take a long time to write a novel. Hiccups can occur where you're doing research and you get stuck, or if you're fine-tuning sentences or having trouble with point of view. This process can go from the quickest 3 months to the more realistic 6 months. However, beyond 6 months is still possible and in reality, more common. If you\u2019re talking about the kind of book that is technical in nature. e.g. science textbook or instruction manual. Compilation of raw data and references could mean 3\u20136 months of your writing process. Once you get it done, similar process as above will follow summing up to a year. Next you have the editing process. In general, it can go to the fastest as 3 weeks but 3\u20136 months should be the magic number here. Usually the going back and forth between the editor and the author is imminent. In conclusion, the process from when you start writing your book (read: actually START, not from the time of idea conception), provided you do it full time, will take on average of 1 and half year. However, if you're talking about the kind of book that is unreadable, an average person can type out 200 pages of gibberish non-sense in 100-hours (that is completing 1 page every half an hour). In real life, that will take about a week. ",
