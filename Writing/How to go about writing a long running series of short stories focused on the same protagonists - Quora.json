            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve never done that, though I have written three trilogies which involve the same characters over a period of many years. My suggestion is much the same as for any book - the characters should grow and change over the full arc of the series, even within a single book. Every experience changes us, your series should reflect that. One thought I have is that perhaps you should develop and document that growth before you start writing - how will each character be at the start of the series and how will they be at the end? Document some intermediate stages and when you write each short story, review that pattern of growth and change and see if the story reflects it. Good luck! ",
