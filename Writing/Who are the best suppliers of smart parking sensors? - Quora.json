            "answer_text": "We have a system that uses a camera in streetlights or overhead lighting to identify the occupancy of parking spaces on streets or in car parks - as well as a number of other things. It can, for instance, raise the level of illumination locally as people come back to their parked cars as it has traffic and pedestrian detection capability as well. It could, with a bit more development, alert to people loitering or trying to break into cars. The lights are meshed using RF technology. ",
