On a serious note, there isn\u2019t really a best way because you\u2019ve practically put yourself in the worst situation possible, however, what does tend to help is making sure that you start as soon as possible. Essay due in for tomorrow 9am? Don\u2019t start writing it at 9pm, start as soon as you can. Have a draft/plan of some sort. Make sure the plan outlines what each paragraph will include, and the main points you need to elaborate on. Split your time up. Giving yourself a a set amount of time on each section of the essay will ensure that you get the bulk of the essay done quicker, while talking about the main points. Also, in the end you can go back and add extra information, detail or explanations wherever needed. This is usually how I would approach a last minute essay. I hope you do great on you essay, all the best! ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that the best way to write your essay in one day is to compose the right outline at first. You need to determine what to write about and to list your arguments.However if you have just one day left, you'd better to look for some writing tools, like, for example outline generators or some writing guides.
