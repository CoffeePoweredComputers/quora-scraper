            "answer_text": "There is a plethora of advice re this subject on line and on Quora, but a Dissertation Chapter is essentially a Part, in a sequential series of points in an argument, on the way to a conclusion. There are often 3 chapters to be written for, eg, an English Lit Undergraduate Dissertation: Abstract Chapter/Part 1 Sets out your argumentative premise in response to a proposal or question, considering existing research, then begins to consider the main ideas that led to your point of view or likely conclusions. Any modifications to a previously submitted research proposal ought to be examined and justified early in part 1. Chapter/Part 2 Elaborates \u2013 (perhaps by examining evolving thought or focusing on a particular aspect of the topic that is essential to your premise.) It will continue to expound on any original ideas or theories you introduced in part 1 and will be highly analytical of data/material and will acknowledge existing, authoritative research in the field of study. Chapter/Part 3 Concludes - Gets right up to date and considers closely the context of reception of whatever data/material you are considering. It perhaps hypothesises about future interpretations of existing or likely data and summarises, concludes, justifies analytically and wraps up your argument and the significance and implications of your study. But different disciplines and establishments vary on the 3 chapter approach. A 4 chapter structure is more usual for a Social Science/Sociolinguistic or Scientific Dissertation, where Methodology deserves a chapter to itself. Here\u2019s a useful guide to a typical 4 Chapter Dissertation plan: http://ebeit.mandela.ac.za/ebeit/media/Store/documents/Research%20Guidelines/WritingDissertationThesis/THE-LAYOUT-OF-THE-DISSERTATION-OR-THESIS.pdf And here\u2019s a link to a typical 4 chapter structure, for a Psychology Dissertation: IntroductionLiterature ReviewMethodConclusionhttps://www.duq.edu/Documents/education/_pdf/DCPSE/psychology/dissertation-outline.pdf ",
