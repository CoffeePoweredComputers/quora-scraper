            "answer_text": "Research paper is an essential part of academic writing. It enables you to present your own evaluation or interpretation or augment based on a particular topic. Writing research paper can contribute on a large scale in student\u2019s career. Students can gain many benefits from research paper writing. Some of the key benefits are listed below: 1)\tCritical thinking: While making any opinion on a particular topic we need to research thoroughly and think deeply about the theme. We are unable to make a right opinion on that topic without this. So, we are able to think deeply about that topic by writing research paper. By developing the ability of critical thinking, we will be able to express the viewpoints in more creative and meaningful ways. 2)\tStrengthen the communication skills: If the author writes and innovative paper without thorough research which is lacking in logical connections then it will result in complicated content. Appealing factor should be there in your writing. The consistency in the research paper not only helps in developing logical thinking, but also initiates the interaction between the readers and the writer. In that way it will improve your communication skills. 3)\tImprove research skills: We consume a lot of data as we start researching. We start with how, what, why. Then from the set of collected data we select the relevant portion for the topic, evaluate the content and then write about it. A well-researched research paper eventually improves the tendency to collect the relevant part from voluminous data. 4)\tDomain Authorization: It will be confusing if you are doing research in new domain. The author will gain a lot of information once he delves deep into the particular topic. A well-research article will help you to develop the domain knowledge. You will be able to develop all these benefits within you if you are writing a research paper. Hence, I can say that students should write a research paper and should not run away from the. ",
