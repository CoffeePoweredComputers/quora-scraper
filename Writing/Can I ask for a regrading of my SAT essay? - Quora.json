            "answer_text": "It is unlikely that your essay was mis-scored.  When I have had a student who scored low on the SAT essay, but who has always done well on school writing assignments, it is usually the case that the essay didn't fit the scoring rubric.  In most cases the problem is that the evidence in the essay wasn't specific enough.  I haven't read your essay, so I don't know if this applies to you.  However, it is a common problem.  Suppose the prompt was, \"Do all people need to be creative?\"  What you do NOT want to do is write something along the lines of \"Creativity is an important trait.  Those who are creative will often, blah, blah, blah.\"  Actually you CAN, but then you want to follow it with very specific examples of people who were (or were not) creative and what happened as a result.  You can pull examples from your own experience, from history or even from fictional literature, but they need to be specific, and they need to support your point.  You can't just wax philosophical with generalities. That said, keep in mind that scoring well on the SAT essay and having written a good essay are not the same thing.  Standardized essay scores have to follow a strict rubric that doesn't leave room for a variety of writing styles or approaches.  If college admissions officers are worried about whether or not you can write, they can always go online and read the essay itself.  They know that the scoring system has unavoidable problems.  They are probably going to focus more on your admissions essays than on your SAT essay. ",
