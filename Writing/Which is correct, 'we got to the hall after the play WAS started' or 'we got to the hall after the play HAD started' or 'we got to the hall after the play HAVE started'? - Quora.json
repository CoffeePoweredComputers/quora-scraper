            "answer_text": "From the 3 phrases mentioned, ONLY \u201cWe got to the hall after the play HAD started\u201d IS CORRECT (see clarification below). \u201cWe got to the hall after the play was started\u201d [focusing on the action by ??] suggests one came too late to actively join one\u2019s team. However, \u201cwas started\u201d suggests one witnessed the start [the action] whereas one wasn\u2019t even there yet, which MAKES NO SENSE.For that reason, I would call it WRONG.I would INSTEAD say \u201cWe got to the hall after the play had been started\u201d, as this clearly expresses one wasn\u2019t there yet when the play was (YES: was!) started [\u201chad been\u201d expressing an action by ??? that one did not witness when it took place].This is CORRECT English AND MAKES SENSE.This phrase has not been given by you, though.\u201cWe got to the hall after the play had started\u201d suggests one came to passively watch the play, but missed its beginning and possibly the entire play (dependant on whether one could still enter the hall). \u201cThe play had started\u201d indicates a situation (the play was being played when one got to the hall), rather than an action (transition).This phrase is CORRECT AND MAKES SENSE.\u201cWe got to the hall after the play have started\u201d is grammatically WRONG as the direct verb \u201chave\u201d does not correspond with the third person singular subject \u201cthe play\u201d. Moreover, the present tense in \u201chave\u201d does not correspond with the past tense in \u201cgot\u201d.Hence, my conclusion in the first line above. Kind Regards, Andr\u00e9 ",

            "answer_text": "The two former snippets are perfectly acceptable in the way of English grammar. The first may sound a bit wierder than the second because \u201cthe play was started\u201d is in passive voice\u2014it\u2019s acceptable, but I would recommend active voice\u2014\u201dwe got to the hall after the play had started\u201d would be the best way to say it. The third snippet, however, does not meet the standards of English grammar. The problem is that \u201chave\u201d is being used in the past tense when it is usually used in the present tense. \u201cHave\u201d is both the present tense form and the infinitive form of the verb. It is likely that you were uncertain about which form of the word to use so that it matched the tense that the sentence was in. ",
