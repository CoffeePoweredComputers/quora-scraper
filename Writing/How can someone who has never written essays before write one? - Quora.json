            "answer_text": "Writing an essay in English can be a daunting task. I have noticed in my time abroad that not all countries put so much weight and practice on writing; especially essays. My tip for you would be to simply practice now as much as you can before the exam. Take a topic, any random topic for example fruit flies, pollution, computers, states, presidents, etc and jot down what you know about the topic at hand. Important to note though is that essays are not just writing about a topic but about stating some type of opinion or idea about a topic and methodically giving reasons why this opinion or idea is true (or not). This idea or opinion is best stated in what they call a thesis statement and should go at the beginning of the essay so your reader knows what the essay is about. Here are some examples of theses statements with the random topics from above. Fruits flies are one of the most important insects on the planet. Or\u2026Pollution is a hazard to the health of people and can be prevented easily. After you have the thesis statement you can take a look at the information you know about the topic and make a rough outline of how you would like to present any information you have that will support your opinion. Don\u2019t be afraid to refer to common arguments that may go against your thesis, just make sure you can refute the argument with a more important point for example: Although bees play an important role in the pollination of flowers, fruit flies have been a vital part of developing treatments to physiological diseases.\u2019 An essay should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. The beginning should introduce the topic and the thesis. The middle should give all the arguments/information about the thesis, and the end should be a rough paraphrase of the beginning and middle including no new information. Try and practice before the exam and good luck. While practicing don\u2019t hesitate to use your creativity if you are unsure about a topic. If can help break one hindrance to writing an essay. Just be sure to keep your facts solid when it comes to the real thing. :) ",

Following are some very simple tips that can been used well by beginners to go by the process of writing an essay. Make sure you are able to introduce the topic in a gist in the very first paragraph.If your topic happens to be that of argumentative type, make sure you put forward your argument and make your stand clear in the very first paragraph.If you are writing an essay about the pros and cons of something, start with writing the pros or the positive points first, before you go on to the cons.A paragraph should be there for the beginning and ending, that is, introduction and conclusion of the essay.Break down your essay into various paragraph, wherein each one should be expressing a certain specific aspect of the elements in your essay.Give your essay a particular structure and flow.A preceding paragraph should be connected to the present paragraph and the following paragraph as well.You can also begin or end the essay with a quote, but make sure to explain the quote or state its meaning before or after quoting it.Use figure of speeches to make your essay even more lucid and interesting.It will work wonders if you plan your essay by breaking it down before you get on to writing it.

            "answer_text": "Here are the basics: Presumably, your essay will answer a question you\u2019ve been asked. Sometimes, depending on the question, you may have to figure out the central question. Now, your essay may have a word limit or not, but, in the end, it doesn\u2019t matter, the structure remains the same; only the length and the number of paragraphs will change. First you decide the answer to the question. In your first paragraph, you state the answer to the question in an entertaining and clever sort of way. In each succeeding paragraph, you make individual points with attending research backing up your answer. In the last paragraph of your essay, you sum up your points and restate your conclusion (ie: the answer to the question) in an entertaining and clever sort of way. And that\u2019s it! That\u2019s an essay. Use spell check. ",

            "answer_text": "Students generally fear assignments and homework that require them to write essays. This can be attributed to the stereotypes with regards to essays that have been passed on from the old scholars to the current ones. Essays have been exhibited as the hard and extremely burdensome work that calls for a lot of reading and comprehension of many aspects of today\u2019s life. While it is true that essays require an understanding of some aspects of the world, the part of them being hard is indeed flawed. Essay writers are often encouraged to ensure that their arguments are objective, and are backed by factual information which of course requires one to have an in-depth understanding of the topic at hand. Writing an essay can be a challenging exercise, but once one acquires the required skill and techniques, the task becomes easier. Essays and creative writing are different, but there are indeed some aspects of both that overlap and that can help one master the skills to write the other. This article outlines some of the techniques from creative writing that can help one improve and enhance their essay writing skills. ",
