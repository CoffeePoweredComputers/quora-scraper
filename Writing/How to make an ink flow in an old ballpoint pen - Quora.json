            "answer_text": "I think the ball in the tip would have stopped rotating because the ink might have dried . To prevent this , store it properly first . Now coming to the matter , just jerk the pen a bit and then you would have it writing again . If it does not work , stick it refill to a fan or something that involves centrifugal force . Give it a good spin . Then voila, you will have it working again . If it still does not write well , time to get a new refill or a pen . Hope this helps!!! ",
