            "answer_text": "The Bible. The Books of Ezra and Daniel were written in Hebrew and Aramaic. Probably because the Hebrews were writing under the influence of Assyrio-Babylonian linguistic imperialism. Also, Migne's Patrologiae primary source Christian texts, were written for a Latin speaking world, but some of the primary texts were in Greek, so he had Latin on one side and Greek on the other. The Complutensian Polyglot was Latin, Greek and Hebrew, created for scholarly Philological inquiry in relation to the Bible. Many Enlightenment writers wrote texts in Latin, French and German at the same time. Noam Chomsky's books are written in all sorts of languages because he's considered \"arguably the most important intellectual alive\" by the New York Times. ",

(See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_autonautas_de_la_cosmopista) Since Cort\u00e1zar was for years a translator for UNESCO and they both knew French, they wouldn't have had someone else do the French version. And I'd expect the motive was just to reach a wider audience (since travelogues are of international interest anyway), not for any particular artistic reason. ",

            "answer_text": "\"War and Peace\" was originally written in a mixture of Russian and French. Some translations into English translate both languages into English and some leave the French as French. Tolstoy's motive was to reflect the reality of the society he was describing: since the time of, IIRC, Catherine the Great, the Russian aristocracy had admired French sophistication to the point that they spoke French preferentially and Russian poorly or not at all. Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812 initiated a patriotic rejection of French and a return to Russian. ",
