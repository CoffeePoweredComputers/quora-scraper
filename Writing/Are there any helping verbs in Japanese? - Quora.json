            "answer_text": "First of all allow me to clarify helping verbs in English. What Are Helping Verbs? Helping Verbs A helping verb (also known as an auxiliary verb) is used with a main verb to help express the main verb's tense, mood, or voice. The main helping verbs are \"to be,\" \"to have,\" and \"to do.\" They appear in the following forms: To Be: am, is, are, was, were, being, been, will beTo Have: has, have, had, having, will haveTo Do: does, do, did, will do There is another kind of helping verb called a modal auxiliary verb (or modal verb). The modal auxiliary verbs are \"can,\" \"could,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"must,\" \"ought to,\" \"shall,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" and \"would.\" The modal auxiliary verbs never change their forms.  Got it? Take a quick test. Examples of Helping Verbs Expressing Tense Here are some examples of helping verbs expressing tense. In these examples, the main verbs are in bold and the helping verbs are highlighted. Peter was singing for an hour.Peter is singing in the shower.Peter will be singing tomorrow evening.Bonzo had eaten the chicken before we could stop him.Bonzo has eaten the chicken already.Bonzo will have eaten it by then.Clara had been running before her race.Clara has been running every day for a month.Clara will have been running for an hour at that point.In Japanese, the grammatical structure of sentences use comparable verbs, To Be: iru - to exist (something living or animate) aru - to exist (something non living are inanimate) these two verbs are the Japanese equivalent of \u201cto be\u201dTo Have: motsu- to have in possession, andTo Do: suru: with two more in Japanese which are:To Come and to Go: Kuru & Ikuall of which are used in a number of patterned endings which are formulaic. This means they are common enough to follow a direct pattern phrase which are standard enough to be placed into a verb wheel or list of 12 sample verbs, permitting conjugation of any verb in the Japanese language and how it is converted to a stock verb ending which \u201chelped\u201d often helped with one of these verbs.All of these are primarily used with the \u201c-te form endings\u201d, which are linking forms to allow the attachment of two verbs together in a standard pattern.  This is the verb wheel, which I designed for my students to help them learn the significant standard patterns used in Japanese, by rotating the inner wheel of, which is attached with a brass brad the the pasted larger outer wheel to a standard folder to give it a solid base. This allows the inner wheel to rotate so that a sample verb can be directly aligned with Base 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 endings and the endings for the TE forms and TA Forms of Japanese verbs. The uncolored one sheet document is this:  Here is the colored version.  All that is needed to assemble a verb wheel then, is to get a stable document folder of a persons Design or color choice, cut out a suitable partial half circle to allow visibility of the lower half of the main wheel, pole a hole in the center of the wheel and attach the small center circle with the sample verbs at the center of the larger wheel with a brass brad at the center, taping it down at the back of the folder with clear cellophane tape to keep it stationary but rotatable to align each representative verb with the standard verb ending related to the helping verb phrases in Japanese.

            "answer_text": "No, if you mean the modal verbs. Modalities of a verb are expressed by its conjugations. For example \u201cwatashi wa iku\u201d means \u201cI go\u201d, \u201cwatashi wa ikou\u201d means \u201cI will go\u201d, and \u201cwatashi wa ikeru\u201d means \u201cI can go\u201d. Negation is also expressed by a conjugation such as \u201cwatashi wa ikanai\u201d meaning \u201cI don\u2019t go\u201d and \u201cwatashi wa ikenai\u201d meaning \u201cI can\u2019t go\u201d. ",
