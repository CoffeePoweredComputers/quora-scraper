            "answer_text": "This the story of Lord Krishna & Sudama\u2019s friendship.Sudama was a poor Brahmin. He didn\u2019t even have enough food to serve two meals a day to his family. Sudama was very sad that night then his children slept without food. I said to his wife, \u201cWhat can be done? We can\u2019t ask for favors from anybody.\u201d Sudama\u2019s wife replied, \u201cYou talk of Krishna so often. You have told me that you have a deep bond of friendship with him. He is the King of Dwarka, so why don\u2019t you go to him?\u201d Sudama found wisdom in the words of his wife. He decided to go to Dwarka & said, \u201cI\u2019ll definitely go to Krishna but I have to take some gift for Krishna. What gift can I get for the king?\u201d Sudama\u2019s wife borrowed some rice from their neighbor. She bound it in a piece of torn cloth & Sudama took the bundle & left for Dwarka. On seeing the city of Dwarka, Sudama was amazed. The entire town was built with gold & the people were very well-off. He asked for directions for Krishna\u2019s palace & finally reached there. Sudama looked like a hermit. The palace guards stoped him and asked, \u201cWhy have you come here?\u201d Sudama answered, \u201cI want to meet Krishna, he is my friend. Go & tell him that Sudama has come.\u201d The guard smirked on seeing Sudama\u2019s attire. However, he hesitantly went & informed Krishna of Sudama\u2019s arrival. On hearing Sudama\u2019s name, Krishna immediately stood up & ran bare foot to meet him. Everyone looked on in wonder upon seeing such a great King running bare-footed to meet a begger.   \u200b\u200bLord Krishna cleaning feet of sudhama. Krishna took Sudama into the palace. They recalled their childhood days at the Sandipani\u2019s school.   \u200b\u200b Lord Krishna offering food to sudhsma.  Seeing Krishna\u2019s wealth, Sudama felt ashamed of the gift (rice) that he had brought for Krishna. He though it is better not to offer this to Krishna. He tried to hide the bundle but Krishna snatched it from him. While enjoying the rice Krishna said, \u201cI have never tasted such sweetness in anything else.\u201d Later, they sat to have their meal which was served in gold plates. Sudama felt sad as he remembered his hungry children at home. He stayed at the palace for two days but he couldn\u2019t prepare himself to ask Krishna for any favors. On the third day, he got ready to go back home. Krishna embraced Sudama & escorted him out as he bid him farewell. On the way back, Sudama wondered, \u201cWhat shall I say when my wife asks me what I\u2019ve brought back?\u201d As Sudama approached home, he could not find his hut! Instead, his wife came out from a magnificent palace & dressed in elegant clothes. She told Sudama, \u201cLook at Krishna\u2019s might; we have been rid of our poverty. Krishna has ended all our miseries.\u201d Sudama recollected Krishna\u2019s pure love & his eyes welled up with tears of joy.   \u200b\u200b True friendship doesn\u2019t distinguish between high & low status or between riches & poverty. Therefore today, even after thousands of years, the friendship of Krishna & Sudama is remembered all over the world as a symbol of true friendship. Source cubsindia.com ",

            "answer_text": "Once Raj and his two friends Dewid & Ruchir planned a Goa trip. They were so excited that they booked flights as it was refundable and cheapest. But, as we know tragedy is a compulsory unwanted guest in every travel diary after booking and before travelling, three of them met with three different tragedies. Ruchir, the guy who encouraged the other two to take leaves for Goa plan by giving long 9-to-5 hater speech got his leaves disapproved. Dewid, who used to brag about freedom in his dating life had to cancel the trip because his girlfriend wasn't happy with that 'booze & bachelor' trip. The third guy Raj had the engagement ceremony of his long chained aunt's cousin's child. They shared their troubles with each other and decided to cancel the trip. They sat together on a sofa to cancel the booking. They opened the laptop, connected internet & pinged the booking site. Meanwhile, they saw an image ad of a hot girl with title - 'Come & Party With Me in Goa.' They all looked at each other and Ruchir said, 'You know what? I\u2019m already looking for a career change. I guess we should go to Goa. I'll manage.' Dewid back-up Ruchir by saying, 'I'm still thinking that break up will be hard on me. But, life is never easy. I say yes to Goa.' They both smiled and looked at Raj. Raj looked at them and said, 'There is no marriage actually. I made up things as I was low on money. But, I'll make it.' Like any trip makers, they too made it after all those difficulties. Ruchir just got a warning mail from his company in which he was advised to not give any fake reason like diarrhoea while bragging by Goa check-ins. Dewid almost had a breakup. But, he and his gf had a long fight of 15 days and a happy together ending. Raj, the guy who was low on money was very high on the trip. Because his friends sponsored him. That was the trip when destiny sponsored life time friendship to three boozy bachelors. ",
