            "answer_text": "That hasn\u2019t been my experience at all\u2014 I tend to take my notes with a black pen. Red tends to be difficult to read, but black is generally a safe (and legible) color, and yes so is blue. However, as another commenter to this page noted, it\u2019s not the ink color that matters\u2014 it\u2019s the quality of the notes you take. I often find that when I re-read my notes days later, I have written half-sentences or statements that are difficult to follow (but may have made sense at the time). To avoid confusion, you may want to have a highlighting pen handy, and as you are taking notes, you can mark the key points; that will make them stand out when you read them later on, no matter what color pen you have used. Also, beware of rules that have no evidence to support them\u2014 it may indeed be true that blue pens are wonderful, but I haven\u2019t seen credible studies that show the benefits of only taking notes in blue. I suggest finding what works for your style of note-taking. Use blue for a while, use black for a while (or some other color), and as you perfect your ability to take good notes, you can decide which type of ink supports you in reading/ understanding what you wrote down.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so as color of ink would not matter towards your remembering ability. Infact I thought black ink to be more helpful as it would be more bold as you go on writing. There is a logic that writing with green ink will have a lesser impact on your eyes and brain but not specifically. Your concentration matters more :) ",
