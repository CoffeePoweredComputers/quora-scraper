            "answer_text": "While suspension of disbelief was a concept that came after Shakespeare - so he could not have used the idea - Aristotle wrote about the mechanics of the concept in The Poetics and Shakespeare was most likely well aware of this: A probable impossibility is favourable to an improbable possibility. So we accept that Harry Potter can use a flying broomstick because it is probable with in the world of the story, while completely impossible in reality. Witches flying on broomsticks is favourable to the very real possibility that twins separated at birth or over the adventures of a lifetime can be reunited, but not the improbability that they wouldn\u2019t recognise each other when standing less than 20 feet apart (Comedy of Errors, Twelfth Night). While this is possible, when watching or reading the plays, it is highly improbable - but necessary for the wind up of the plots (flawed as they are). This \u2018suspension\u2019 also allows us to believe that Orlando doesn\u2019t recognise Rosaline dressed up as the boy Ganymede in As You Like It or Portia disguised as a layer in The Merchant of Venice - even though the audience does. Probably one of the biggest of these (if you can quantify these things as big or small) is the improbable and impossible ending for The Winter\u2019s Tale, when the dead queen comes in as a statue and is brought back to life. And one of the reasons this one sticks out like a sore thumb is that it doesn't follow a convention that Shakespeare uses with his audiences in all of the plays. In every Shakespeare play, the audience is cast in the role of \u2018god.\u2019 The audience always knows more than any character within the world of the play. The audience is directly spoken to by characters who know there is an audience (there was no 4th wall in Elizabethan/Jacobean theatre and none of Shakespeare\u2019s characters talk to themselves - EVER - that is a 19th century convention born out of the weakness of realism). The audience sits in a \u2018magic\u2019 realm that does not exist anywhere else in life - save maybe as a congregation in church but a congregation knows less than the \u2018actors\u2019 (priests) on their stage (alters) - and Shakespeare put that hallowed, magic place of the audience and their relationship to the actors to great use. But in doing so, he created some wonky scenarios where we have to look past the flawed improbable to see the beauty of his work. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cSuspension of disbelief\u201d is a phrase originating with the Romantic poet, critic, and philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and it refers to putting quibbles about probability or verisimilitude aside in order to follow where a work of fiction tries to lead us \u2014 sometimes violating our sense of \u201cwhat is likely\u201d to do so. In the fourteenth chapter of his Biographia Literaria, Coleridge was discussing the kinds of Gothic fantasy he explored in works like \u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d and \u201cChristabel,\u201d which he contributed to his and Wordsworth\u2019s landmark book, Lyrical Ballads. Coleridge is recalling discussions from the time that work was being composed and assembled: It was agreed, that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural, or at least romantic, yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith.[1] Related is what Keats, a Romantic of the succeeding generation, said Shakespeare possessed so enormously\u2014I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason[.][2] So: take these formulations, add Shakespeare, stir.

In his Biographia Literaria, It describes that an author describes such a true to life character that the reader accepts his or reality no matter how fantastic the setting is. Certainly this can be applied to Shakespeare. Both Hamlet and Macbeth are believable characters even if both live in worlds in which ghosts actually make an appearance. ",

            "answer_text": "The willing suspension of disbelief for the moment is the phrase that S.T. Coleridge coined to describe the contract between reader and writer. In drama it applies between audience and performer. Fiction is an invitation to play together in an imaginary world for a while. In modern realist style (no true naturalism or realism is fully possible in fiction it should be noted) the audience expects to be convinced that the fiction is as realistic as possible. The parameters for a Shakespearian era play are related but not the same as a modern cinema drama. ",

            "answer_text": "There are too many examples to list them all. Art is, by definition, artificial, and we accept that the artifice is part of the serious game when we read a novel, watch a film, look at a painting or go to a play. For example, we know that people don\u2019t speak in iambic pentameters, yet in Shakespeare\u2019s plays many characters do. We willingly suspend our disbelief as we realise we\u2019re watching heightened reality, not reality. The same goes for the richly metaphoric language of the plays. For example, we know that in real life no one would answer a grieving brother who\u2019s just learned that his sister has been drowned, and wants to know where it happened, with a lengthy description of the flowers found on the river bank, as Gertrude does to Laertes in \u2018Hamlet\u2019. This just wouldn\u2019t happen in real life, but it\u2019s right in the artificial world of the play because it magnifies the real tragedy of the event. As Touchstone says in \u2018As You Like It\u2019, \u2018the truest poetry is the most feigning\u2019. In other words, in art, to arrive at the truth you have to tell some big lies. ",

There are not that many places where you pay an admission, sit in an audience, and bear witness to fellow human beings wear clothes that aren't theirs, speak sentences (lines) that were written for them, and pretend there are relationships between each other.
