            "answer_text": "Earning money via freelancer is a little tedious job at the beginning, but after you've done a couple of projects, you'd be able to get more projects easily. Here are some steps that you should take to start your career on freelancer.com. I have been working there from past 5 years and can share my experience.  Register your account, and make sure you have a good username (name displayed to the employer ).Complete your profile.Add a bank account to receive payments.While filling your profile, add only the skills you're perfect at, adding skills in which you are not perfect won't lead you anywhere.Add a professional profile picture, do not put your Facebook dp as your freelancer profile picture.On your info/bio, list your skills clearly, so they are visible to the employer.The most important thing is to make your portfolio, add everything you've ever made to your portfolio. Clients ask for your portfolio before hiring you.Now, some tips and tricks to get your first client. As soon as a project is posted, it will appear as a notification. Click on it, read everything clearly and then bid on it.Since this would be your first project, bid less amount. You can't expect a big bid for your first project.What clients like is, if you ask some questions related to the project. I always ask a question related to the project. This sometimes forces the employer to start a chat with you. Once he starts the chat, it's upto your way of talking and convincing him to select you ;)Getting first project is a little difficult, but work hard, make bids and ask questions. This will surely get you your first project within 7-10 days.Work your level best on the project, complete it within the deadline and make your client happy. If he is happy, he would give you good ratings and then you're a better freelancer than the newly registered ones ;) P.S :- While freelancer is great for starting, but it's slowly degrading. The freelancer staff is corrupt (search Google for freelancer scam and you'd understand what I'm saying). Good luck :) ",
