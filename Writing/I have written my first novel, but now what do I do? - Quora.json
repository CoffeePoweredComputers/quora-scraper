            "answer_text": "Is this the first draft? If so, now the fun begins. Now you need to edit. Then edit some more. Then revise, then edit, and polish it until it is perfect. Then, write a second novel. And a third and a fourth. Then come back to your first one and read it again. Edit. Revise. Do the same with the other three. When one is completely ready, look for an agent (assuming you\u2019re not interested in self-publishing). Write a query letter. (Make sure to look up how to do that before attempting; it\u2019s a process.) Send it only to agents who represent your kind of work; the scattershot method of querying everyone on earth does not usually work. When you get an agent, s/he will rep your book for you to publishers. Once a publisher wants it, you sign all kinds of contracts and then the book is published. And, hopefully, it\u2019s all uphill from there. And then you write novel #5. (Credentials: I currently work as the Grad Secretary for the English Department at my university while attending undergrad classes. We have a Creative Writing MFA program. I\u2019ve been around published authors for several years now and attended workshops on how to query agents. I wish it were as easy as write a book, submit the first draft, get agent next week, get published in a month, roll in dough\u2026 it\u2019s more like a year of revising, then months to edit per the agent\u2019s wishes, then more months before it\u2019s published\u2026) ",

            "answer_text": "It depends upon where you are in your career, what you should do after completing your first novel. If you haven't created sales pitch documents, your query letter, synopsis, outline need to be written. If writing nonfiction you need to create a survey of the market and business plan. Fiction writers don't usually require those, but I recommend you build them anyway. If you have created a writer's platform, great, if not, start building one. A writer's platform includes social media presence, sales to literary or other genre magazines, topical articles, a blog, a webpage, and broadbased social life. If you have written short stories, seek an agent and/or publisher. After reading endless accounts about writers getting agents, I realized many authors get agents based on their short story sales to major magazines. Three mainstream short story publications is a good start. Three short stories may be equivalent to writing a book but will likely only be 30k words. Sold stories can be collected and sold separately. If you have all the above, look for an editor and publisher while writing your second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth book. Lucky people sell their first book. Less lucky sell their third book. Average people sell their ninth. If you don't want to do all of that stuff, consider self-publishing. Don't expect to sell many unless you're sales oriented. Writing is easy. Selling is hard. ",
