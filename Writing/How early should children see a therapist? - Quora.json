            "answer_text": "Personally, I am an advocate for therapists being a regular part of someone\u2019s life. They can help teach your child powerful coping skills and form a bond with them to deal with complicated life situations. Therapists are a valuable asset to have for people from all walks of life. That being said, my only concern would be in whether or not your child is willing to see a therapist. Kids cannot get help in their lives if they are unwilling to accept it and, sometimes, negative stereotypes around therapists can actually make them very adverse to the whole experience. It is not something you can force on them and trying to do so - Especially if your rhetoric follows the idea that those who talk to therapists only do so because something is wrong with them, instead of therapists being a source of conflict resolution and self management - will only cause them to reject the entire experience. Personally, I think that it might be a good idea to have most children start seeing a therapist around five years old; There are many changes in their life at this time and it will be easy to present a therapist as a new person in their world there to help them handle problems or worries at school or home that they might not feel comfortable talking about with their parents or teachers. If your child goes once or twice, but doesn\u2019t feel like going again, it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t force the issue. They may have a reason for not wanting to do it and it\u2019s unlikely to create a positive experience in going if there is always a fight that proceeds it. Simply leaving the option open for them to go if/when they want to and reminding them that the resource is there for them will have them creating a positive relationship with seeking a therapist and they are more likely to do so, themselves, in the future. The only time I might advocate starting younger is if there is some form of very early childhood trauma in the child\u2019s life, particularly if that trauma is causing dysfunction or discomfort in the child.
