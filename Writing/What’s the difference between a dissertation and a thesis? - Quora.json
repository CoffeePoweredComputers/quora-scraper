            "answer_text": "What\u2019s the difference between a dissertation and a thesis? (A2A - thanks for asking) The two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are some big differences between them. A dissertation is usually the capstone project for a doctorate while a thesis is more commonly done at the master\u2019s level. Depending on the country and subject area, the term \u201cthesis\u201d could be applied to doctoral level work, but \u201cdissertation\u201d is the more commonly used term for this. A dissertation is expected to be a piece of original research that adds to the body of knowledge in a given field. A thesis (master\u2019s level) can be, but is not necessarily expected to be original research as much as it is supposed to be a demonstration of the student\u2019s mastery of the literature and methods appropriate to the field. A thesis (master\u2019s level) is commonly prepared over the course of one or two semesters. A dissertation, by contrast, can take several years of preparation. In keeping with this, a thesis is usually shorter than a dissertation. I\u2019ll note in passing that David Rector\u2019s doctoral thesis (MIT 1969) was nine pages: intro, three pages of math, and a bibliography, so length is not necessarily a defining characteristic a long as the work is original. I don\u2019t know that this is the shortest ever, but it has to be in that ballpark. Anecdotally, I\u2019m told that Rector\u2019s supervisor liked short papers, so this may have contributed. ",
