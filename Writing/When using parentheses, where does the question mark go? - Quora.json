            "answer_text": "Inside, if the entire question is parenthetical; outside if the parenthetical clause is ancilliary information to the question. Examples are probably easier to understand: \u201cDoes the question mark (used to indicate a query in written English and many other languages) go inside or outside the parentheses (specifically when writing an English sentence)?\u201d - Question mark outside parentheses because the information enclosed is not a complete question. \u201cWriting a question in English requires a certain knowledge of phrasing, structure and punctuation (e.g. should the question mark appear inside or outside the parentheses?) in order for the result to be unambiguous to the reader.\u201d - Question mark inside parentheses because the entire question is parenthetical. And yes, for the avoidance of doubt, the same applies when there is a parenthetical question within another question: \u201cDoes writing a question in English require a certain knowledge of punctuation (e.g. should the question mark appear inside or outside the parentheses?) in order for the result to be unambiguous to the reader, or will native readers understand anyway?\u201d Finally, I would say: use parentheses sparingly, as they can be pretty confusing and slow down comprehension. I wouldn\u2019t have written any of the above examples using them, had I not been trying to illustrate my answer! ",
