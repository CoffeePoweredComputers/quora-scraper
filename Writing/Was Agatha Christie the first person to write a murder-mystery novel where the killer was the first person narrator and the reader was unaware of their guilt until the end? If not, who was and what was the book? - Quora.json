            "answer_text": "Yes. This had never been done before and the ending was both celebrated by critics as innovative and daring and derided by others as unfair and a cheap gimmick. The skill of the novel lies not just in the ending but in the way Christie narrates the story through the eyes of the killer. Through skillful and precise language, the killer becomes the most classic of the unreliable narrators even though every word he writes is literally true. The Usual Suspects among many other works owe a debt to this story. It put Christie on the map. Interestingly , it appears as if the idea itself may not have originated solely with Christie. According to Christie, her brother-in-law James Watts suggested in a conversation one day that Christie write an novel in which the criminal would be a Dr. Watson type character: i.e., the friend and assistant to the detective and the narrator of the story. Christie considered it to be a \"remarkably original thought\". ",

I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is the beating of his hideous heart!\" Published in 1843, The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe is a short story, narrated by a mentally unstable man. Spoiler alert! Until the very end, the readers are unaware of the narrator\u2019s crime. The story is worth reading, despite the spoiler; Poe has contributed a lot to English literature, and was known for his rich language and musically pleasant poetry. ",
