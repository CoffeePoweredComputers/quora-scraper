The difference in my ridiculous example and your semi-offensive question is that butterflies and humans aren't the same species; white people and black people are. However a similarity is that if butterflies could talk there would be a few who would judge your writing harshly because you're not and have never been a butterfly. Trust me, it will be the same with the humans. As long as you know this in advance, you will be fine. ",
