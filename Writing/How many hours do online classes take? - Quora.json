            "answer_text": "Hi, Normally what type of course you are looking for find out your interests and filter it out. I wanted to learn social media online and I am learning it with Shaw Academy. They have courses in various fields. Normally the social media course have different modules and In each module it consists of 5 or 6 lessons. Each lesson will take 1 hour to complete. If there are 5 modules consists of 5 lessons it will take 25 to 30 hours to complete your course plus extra 10 hours to do assignment work. Since its better to spend 5 hours a week which increases concentration. Within 2 months you will be able to complete the course. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on the amount of courses you take, and duration of the course/courses. Once I had 9 courses I had to take within 3 months. Every week there\u2019s a deadline for the materials yo study, and the assignments for each course. For example, one course lasts 12 weeks. You need at least 1 hour a week to study the materials + 2 hours for the quizzes, and the assignments. One course will be 36 hours. I had 9 courses, so that would be 36 hours * 9 = 324 hours. ",
