            "answer_text": "Yes, for several reasons. First, the lesser writers at the publisher that was going to release her latest novel going on strike are irrelevant. She has enough money to buy a publishing house, if she wanted. She can certainly self-publish, and she has the star power to market it and sell it as cable TV show and major radio show hosts. Second, the small but vocal social justice activist crowd does NOT represent most of the market. They just seem to, because they dominate social media, academia, and the limelight. For every person who agrees with \u201csay people who menstruate, not women, say people who give birth, not mothers\u201d, there are 100 who agree with her. Ironically, the attacks on JK Rowling are counter-productive to social justice jihadis. JK Rowling has been criticized by moderates and the right for constantly trying to update Harry Potter to fit the latest SJW narratives. AKA, Hermione rewritten as black and Dumbledore as gay. Now she\u2019s attacked for defending very basic truths \u2026 and even her right-wing and moderate critics are defending her. Hello, publicity. Third, the hardest person to cancel is someone with something to sell. Bash Goya for the CEO supporting Trump? They sold out of stuff. Bash JK Rowling? Buy her books or watch the movies based on them. She then gets more money. ",

            "answer_text": "Sales of Harry Potter books went up during lockdown.[1] This should not be surprising for three reasons: They are the most popular books of our generation, and in the all time top-ten for fiction, and so a first choice for those looking for something to read.Most people don\u2019t actually care about the row which appears to be going on, or, if they do care, think it\u2019s tedious.Controversy sells books. Far worse books have done well because of being controversial. Dan Brown\u2019s other books, for example, have not enjoyed the sales of the Da Vinci Code, which was marketed on its controversy. In fact, a large audience which might have been suspicious of Rowling (too left wing) is now much more open to her.Controversy creates publicity, and the one thing which books most need to sell is publicity. It isn\u2019t an election: Rowling gets a royalty for every book sold. People who choose to \u2018vote with their feet\u2019 by not buying don\u2019t actually influence anything at all. She is also being taken more seriously by people who didn\u2019t like Harry Potter with her detective books. If you look on the credits for Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them: the Crimes of Grindewald you\u2019ll see she is credited as the writer. Not many authors get to write films based on their books. 99.9999% of people would do far better if the peak of their career was anything like Rowling\u2019s alleged \u2018slump\u2019. Then there\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s still writing. With what she learned from Harry Potter, she might write something that trumps The Lord of the Rings and Narnia next time. And we\u2019ll all be reading it. Footnotes[1] Harry Potter books prove UK lockdown hit despite JK Rowling trans rights row",
