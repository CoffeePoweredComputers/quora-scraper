            "answer_text": "It does seem so. I believe that the callous attitude of society towards languages and writing skills is largely responsible for the dwindling number of good pieces of writing. With increasing importance of mathematics, science and other technical subjects, languages, literature and creative writing skills have taken a back seat in today\u2019s academia. The students are not to blame. Maximum stress on math and science right from an early age on children closes doors for pursuing any other non-technical subject. It\u2019s just English. A day before the exam, you can quickly revise all the stories and poems, memorize a set of answers from guides/reference books. And you\u2019re done. There\u2019s a strong imprint in the minds of people that only those who could barely get through their high school end up taking literature and arts (this is in Indian context). My parents always contend that the quality of writing in their times was far better than the substandard articles of the current times. Newspapers and magazines had such amazing content written in an impeccable style, while today\u2019s papers are more full of advertisements that largely dominate the pages than the actual information/news itself. Also, the presentation of information is quite plain. Not much effort is made in neatly crafting and tailoring the content to make it interesting, comprehensible and very enjoyable. Only a few newspapers are striving to maintain their legacy. I believe that the skill of writing is really undervalued. It\u2019s a skill that can help you share, present and effectively communicate your ideas to others in a very persuasive manner. Mastery of this skill can help you reach unfathomable heights. A good textbook, a good novel, a good magazine leaves a lasting impression. Not only does it pack your head with information, it also helps you open your mind and think further. Cheers to all the creative writers! ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. Let me put it simply: As we know pen is mightier than the sword, the amount of content that is being published online in today\u2019s generation has no limits. The ease of access and platforms have built new people give a try to writing. May it be blogs, personal websites or ghost writing. The communication, social media and digital world has created more opportunities to write and share your perspective with millions of people from the comfort of their chairs and tables. When it comes to good writing, that\u2019s a personal choice on how much you wish to improve. I am a part of 40+ publications on Medium and a community of so many writers who help each other improve their work. We are in a time when writing is booming, information is unlimited, research is getting qualitative and people are spending a lot of time reading and consuming content. So, to put it in simple words, good writing is the need of the hour across any platform and it won\u2019t die any time soon. :) ",
