To be considered a secure password, the following are the minimum set of characteristics it should (my requirements training REALLY wants that \u201cshould\u201d to be \u201cmust\u201d or \u201cshall\u201d) meet: Contain at least one each of three of the following:UPPER CASE letterlower case letterdigit (0\u20139)special character allowed by the systemBe programmatically generated - preferably by a computer programBe unknown to the userBe at least 20 characters long - preferably as long as the system allows, minus 1 to avoid off-by-one errors in the system.Think that covers it. (Hint - human generated passwords/passphrases always fail at least the third bullet, and often fail the second and fourth bullets. Use a reputable password manager. I just read an article that 1Password was favorably reviewed by Consumer Reports \u2014 congratulations to the team at AgileBits (company); the posts here on Quora I stumbled across written by Jeffrey Goldberg and Khad Young were of such high caliber that I added it to my list of recommendations some time ago, and I\u2019m happy for them and their company that Consumer Reports recognized the quality of their product as well. In addition to that quality product, I also recommend KeePass and Password Safe - I\u2019ve used all three of these utilities, and found them to meet very high levels of capability and security (and 1Password offers direct backup and support, which KeePass and Password Safe each leave as exercises for the user).) Disclaimer: Other than having used each of the above-recommended utilities, and been personally and professionally impressed by the information shared by Messieurs Goldberg and Young, I have no affiliation or other association with any of the three.
