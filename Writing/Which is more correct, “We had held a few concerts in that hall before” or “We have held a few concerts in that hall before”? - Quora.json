(The timelines are different.) \u201cWe have held a few concerts in that hall before\u201d is more likely to be applicable in most situations and simply means that the hall in question has been used by us, at unspecified times in the past, for concerts. (The verb tense here is the Present perfect.) \u201cWe had held a few concerts in that hall before\u201d on the other hand refers to a situation in which you were holding - or intending to hold - a concert in the past and are noting that the same venue (the hall) was used on earlier occasions for the same purpose. (This is an example of the Past Perfect which is used to relate two different events, both in the past, one occurring before the other.) ",

If you\u2019re talking about time in the past up until the present moment, you would say We have held a few concerts\u2026 This would be the more usual form. If you\u2019re talking about time in the past up until some other moment in the past, you would say We had held\u2026 For example, We decided not to use that hall for the concert because we had held a few concerts in that hall before. In this example, you\u2019re talking about time in the past before you decided. ",
