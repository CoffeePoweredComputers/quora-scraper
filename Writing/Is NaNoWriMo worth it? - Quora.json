            "answer_text": "It depends. If by \u201cworth it\u201d you mean \u201cI will have a publishable novel that I can make money from\u201d, the answer is 100% NO. The purpose of Nanowrimo is not to produce a publishable novel in 30 days. 50,000 words in any case is not long enough to make a publishable novel in any genre except YA fiction. No publisher will touch a manuscript that short. So what is Nanowrimo actually for, then? It gets you into the habit of writing every day. This is important, if you want to be a writer. 30 days is just enough to form a habit; in this case the habit of spending a couple of hours writing every day instead of a couple of hours in front of the TV or playing video-games. The purpose of Nanowrimo is to get you into the habit of being a writer, even when November is over.It gets you accustomed to the challenge of writing to a deadline. 50,000 words in 30 days sounds impossible, and it will be if you procrastinate until the last week. But 1,667 words a day is easy. So Nanowrimo teaches you to write every day in order to keep it easy.Most of what is written for Nanowrimo is garbage. It\u2019s poorly written, it\u2019s written in a hurry because you\u2019re concerned only with getting the right number of words out as quickly as possible. For Nanowrimo, that doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re practising, and that\u2019s important. Mercedes Lackey says you have to write a million words of garbage before you get good enough to write something brilliant. Every word you write now gets you one word closer to brilliance.If you like the challenge of the competition, Nanowrimo is fun. There are local groups that meet up in cafes to write, to support each other and share ideas. There are online groups, if real-world interaction isn\u2019t your thing. Or you can just go it alone if you prefer. Whatever your style, you can do Nanowrimo your way.Nanowrimo is for people who enjoy writing and who want to make it a bigger part of their life. For people like that, it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s not worth it if you hate writing. It\u2019s not worth it if the deadline stresses you to the point of damaging your health. It\u2019s also not worth it if you are already a professional writer. In this case you already have deadlines, and Nanowrimo will just get in the way of those. ",

            "answer_text": "Last year, I spent a chunk of NaNo outside of my home region. I was visiting my boyfriend in PA and when I got there, the first thing I did was ask him to help me locate the closest write-ins. The forum was silent. There was no calendar. I was confused as all get-out. In North OC, CA\u2014my home region\u2014we have so many write-ins and events that you seriously cannot do them all if you\u2019re working even a part time job. Some of our big ones are going to write at IKEA, taking over the lobby of the Grand Californian at Disneyland, and even getting on the Metrolink and having a write-in as we\u2019re taking a train down to Oceanside. In all the years I\u2019ve participated in NaNoWriMo (and Script Frenzy back when it was a thing), I have never completed on time. I keep going back because I love the atmosphere. I love the people who show up. It\u2019s like a month of Christmas mornings a month before Christmas! This is all part of what makes it worth it to me. I\u2019ve found so many new places to keep writing fresh instead of tedious just because I braved going to a new write-in. Would this make it worth it to someone else? Maybe, maybe not. They have to figure it out themselves. Another way to look at it is NaNoWriMo has been going for almost 20 years with many, many return participants. Obviously some people see value in taking on the challenge. ",
