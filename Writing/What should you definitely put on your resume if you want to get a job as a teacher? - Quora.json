            "answer_text": "As somebody who\u2019s taught in both public schools and colleges and universities, I can tell you that your education and being a subject matter expert are the most important. And with public schools, your state may require you to be certified by fulfilling certain requirements. FYI, they vary among individual states. So where you went to school, what you studied, the number of credits you have, and your degree level are extremely important. With colleges and universities, faculty have to meet accreditation standards. And it\u2019s commonplace for you to need one degree higher than the level you\u2019ll be teaching. So to teach undergraduate classes, a Masters is typically required. So you want to include any classes that you\u2019ve taught and/or are capable of teaching. Grade levels too for public school teaching. Learning systems that you\u2019ve used and/or learned about should also be included. If you have any classroom support training and/or experience, include this too. For instance, I was a Paraeducator, which is a teacher\u2019s assistant. This experience also helps if you\u2019re new or pretty new to teaching because it shows you have some exposure to a classroom environment and helping out teachers and working with students. You should also include which grade levels you\u2019ve dealt with, any student teaching you\u2019ve done, and any state(s) where you\u2019re certified to teach in the public schools. With college teaching, it\u2019s very common to include any publications you\u2019ve written. For example, I\u2019ve written books and articles. If you\u2019ve done or are doing any tutoring, mention this too. ",

            "answer_text": "For a fresher, a basic resume will suffice. Start with your name, address and contact details at the top left corner. Then, draw a thick line, which means from here your professional details begin. Write about your career objective and why you want to be a teacher. Write about your educational qualification. If you have any special achievements during your schooling or degree education, add it here. They can be anything from winning a cultural event, or general knowledge quiz, debate competitions, to taking part in volunteering event. If you have done any internship, you can add it here. In the end, write a sentence that all the information that you are providing is true to your knowledge. That's it. Try to complete in one page. ",
