            "answer_text": "You write an essay on leadership the same way you\u2019d write an essay on any topic. Figure out what you want to say about leadership, then write the essay. I suspect your real question isn\u2019t how to write the essay but what to write about. Why are you writing the essay? Is this a college application essay where you want to tell them about a role or time where you acted as a leader? Or where you learned something about leadership? Is it an expository essay where you want to inform readers about what leadership is comprised of (such as what effective leadership is)? Is it an argumentative essay where you want to put forth and defend a thesis about leadership (such as why Trump is not a true leader)? You need to provide more information if you want more specific answers. ",

            "answer_text": "The absolutely essential thing that all leaders have is: followers. This may sound obvious but without them, who are you actually leading? Base your written work on why you may wish to follow another. What is it that enspires you?, how do they communicate?, do you feel compelled or is it simply an act of duty? You have got it in you so go for it. ",
