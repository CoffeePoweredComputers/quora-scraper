            "answer_text": "Generally, there\u2019s no need to set quotas for reading, unless you\u2019re doing coursework or something like that, where there are time limits imposed from the outside. Then you need to schedule your own time based on how much reading there is and how fast you read. But I think you will be best served if you switch from focusing on quantity of reading to focusing on quality. This has 2 aspects: the quality of the things you readthe quality of your readingIf you\u2019re trying to get more out of your reading, one approach is to read better things. As for what counts as \u201cbetter,\u201d that\u2019s somewhat up to you. If we\u2019re talking about nonfiction, it might mean reading more scholarly or in-depth works on a particular subject, or maybe reading more books on that subject rather than just one (if the subject is of interest to you). If we\u2019re talking about fiction, it might mean reading works that challenge you more: classics, literary fiction, or general fiction that is outside the genre categories you usually read. As for the quality of your actual reading, how well you read, I\u2019d like to recommend the book How to Read a Book (ISBN 9780671212094) by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren, first published in 1940. It\u2019s an excellent guide, but its focus is mainly on nonfiction. I haven\u2019t found anything comparable for fiction reading, but if you\u2019re willing to put on your thinking cap and have your mind expanded very far, then try Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays (ISBN 0691012989) by Northrop Frye. He looks at literature in great depth. Another interesting one is How to Read and Why (ISBN 0684859076) by Harold Bloom; he loves literature, and helps the reader love it more too. I love reading and I read for hours each day, but I don\u2019t really worry about how many pages I read. For me, the important thing is enjoyment and whether I\u2019m absorbing what I\u2019m reading. So I will read a book for as long as I\u2019m enjoying it and absorbing what I\u2019m reading. When my attention starts to flag I\u2019ll put that book aside, and pick up another one. When I don\u2019t feel like picking up another book, my reading period is over. You\u2019re far better off choosing one really good book, and reading it carefully, than reading 100 mediocre books. With reading, as with so much else in life, quality is king. That\u2019s the way to get the most out of reading, in my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "For my ENGH 305 class, we read 100 pages or fewer for Wednesday\u2019s class and over 100 pages for Monday\u2019s class until we\u2019re finished with the novel(s) For my other classes, we just read articles and/or the textbook(s), which can be short or lengthy, simple or complex. The extraction of quotations has to happen at some point in most of my classes. (In ENGH 301, we also read a lot of pages per class period. Usually we finished the book within 2\u20133 weeks, even though we met once per week.) Then, we have lots of reflections, participation discussions, group projects, peer reviews, and essays. I\u2019m neither done taking exams nor am I done with multiple choice (I\u2019ll have to do that for my history courses I bet, as well as the VCLA and Praxis). I read my once-a-month murder mystery in under a week. I try to aim for about 100 pages daily for those, too, yet I might go over if I want to finish earlier. Then, I write simple summaries and interesting facts from the novel. This is my current list (published) of books/writings I\u2019ve read as of my Fall 2020 semester. I will not be adding more books to this list, since it\u2019s time-consuming. I will only be updating my list for records\u2019 sake.
