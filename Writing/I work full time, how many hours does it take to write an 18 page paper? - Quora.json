            "answer_text": "It really depends on the genre, topic, the amount and type of research involved, and how quickly you can synthesize ideas and translate them into written English in your own head. (Also, how fast you can write/type.) My averages are one hour per page for legal briefs and 2\u20133 hours per page for academic articles, but I know both genres inside and out, I read very quickly, and I think and type even faster.
