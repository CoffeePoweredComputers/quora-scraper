            "answer_text": "The same rule is applied i.e. practice. GT is quite different from Academics. You will have similar reading and listening modules. But the speaking and writing module differs. So you need to practice accordingly. Spend more time on practicing speaking and writing modules, but that doesn't means you won't practice the rest. Practice all the modules in a day.Read novels and newspapers to increase vocabulary. Listen to english channels on radio. Practice well, the more you practice, the more chances of getting a good score. All the best. ",
