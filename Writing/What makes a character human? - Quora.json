            "answer_text": "Confusion. When a character is confused readers feel a bond. Most people have experienced being shoved off balance by confusion. Worse, being confused and not being able to identify the feeling as confusion until much later in time. Not knowing what needs to be known, and is not known. \u201cNot knowing\u201d can come from information deliberately withheld from the character (secrets, sabotage, are examples), or not being able to identify lies. We\u2019ve all been lied to, and have lied. We can relate to feeling messed up, and even making messes. Fighting to gain clarity when maybe dark forces in people close to us want to keep us confused. Maybe daily. Fascinating conflicts right there so readers can take a reality break from through a character\u2019s messy situation. Confusion from being in an unfamiliar setting that makes the character not know how to behave but takes action for the sake of doing something, and creates a mess. We have all been in that awkward spot. As the character battles the confusion of inner conflict, the reader gets answers that can be applied to the reality of tapping into knowing one\u2019s self. Intriguing to get answers from a character in a book. HOW a character handles the confusion, and WHAT the character does when in the state of confusion can be comedic, heroic, awe inspiring, tragic, or as unnerving as Chinese water torture. We are like a sprig of mint leaves stuck in a glass of iced mint julep; wondering what in the world are we doing in this frigid liquid; feeling warm lips gently brush by in unpredictable uneven tempo and then being in total confusion when tossed in a trash can, used up. \"Let me out out here! Let me out of here! Hello? Hello? What is going on? Anybody there? Can you hear me? Can you hear me now?\" Yes. We can relate. And oohhh, being able to relate is satisfying. ",

            "answer_text": "Layers. Getting to know a character is like getting to know a new friend. When you just meet someone, you know only a few superficial facts.  You may know their first name, and a few of their physical characteristics such as gender, height, body shape, and coloring. As you interact with them, you will learn bit by bit about them.  First, you might learn about a hobby, a shared experience, etc.  This is the top layer.   As time passes, you may learn their values, fears, hopes.  Each new facet of personality peels back another layer until you can see somewhat the soul of a person, or character. Many writers stop at the top layers.  They present you the outer shell and leave you to fill in the rest based on your pre-existing ideas about what kind of person fills a defined role.  That is weak story telling. In order for a character to be human, there must be layers revealed as naturally as if you were getting to know a friend. For an interesting character, each new revealed layer should challenge your reader's assumptions about who that person is. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to think that the way to write a very \u201chuman\u201d character was to know exactly who the character was before writing them at all. For me, most of those characters were based on either people I knew or parts of myself. I\u2019d plan out everything . . . every little detail of every aspect of every scene . . . until eventually I felt like I knew exactly who each character was, what they wanted, how they\u2019d react, etc. It took me 5-10 years to write a novel that way, and it ended up being a heartbreaking experience by the time it was done. I thought my characters were alive and human since I felt like I knew exactly who they were. I\u2019d made them adhere to their blueprints perfectly. But by the end, they weren\u2019t people at all, in the same way that my narrative voice was no longer a voice, and my world wasn\u2019t even a world. All had become a relentless mad-dash reaction to every little imperfection I could imagine as I frantically read through and edited over and over and over... Now I\u2019m so happy to say that I work the exact opposite way. I don\u2019t quite know who my characters will be when I begin writing. I have a vague idea, maybe, of a character\u2019s essence, or \u201ctype.\u201d But just as I now let the plot play out naturally without planning every detail in advance, I let my characters show me who they are. I meet them the same way readers do. I let my characters be people . . . I let their humanity be whatever it is. And the result, I believe, is a keyword here (in response to this great question): nuance. When you try to make a character into something specific\u2014when in your mind they\u2019re supposed to represent some particular force in the story\u2014they become artificially black-and-white. But real humans are nuanced, since each person has a completely unique life experience, which colors their individual perception of their specific values a certain way that maybe no one else could fully know or appreciate, at least not completely. When I meet my characters, and get to know them more and more as the story develops, I find that the way they \u201cshow themselves\u201d in scenes is much more nuanced and human than anything I could contrive in an outline upfront. So, even if you\u2019re not like me at all in terms of how you write . . . meaning even if you love to plan, and enjoy getting all the details mapped out before you jump into your first scene . . . I\u2019d recommend leaving who your characters are at least a little open as you go. Get to know them along the way, and you\u2019ll really start to love them (or hate them, y\u2019know, in a fun way). That way their humanity can show forth, and probably surprise you. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, what makes a human being \"human\"? What do you mean by \"human\"? On numerous occasions, either Dr McCoy or Captain Kirk said to Spock that he was  \"human after all\", which Mr Spock took almost as an insult. I think that characters are not \"human\" or \"inhuman\": they are consistent and coherent. Consistency requires that they will behave more or less the same way in similar circumstances (unless there's a good reason not to, such as madness, external constraint or undisclosed need). Coherence refers to the fact that they 'make sense' within their world and the parameters of their environment, life, psychology and so on. Characters we consider \"human\" generally exhibit certain behaviours: compassion, altruism, tenderness, defence of the weak, and so forth. In other words, they exhibit noble behaviours. Conversely, \"inhuman\" characters tend to be cruel, callous, manipulative and out for themselves first. This of course overlooks the fact that most humans are some mixture of the two behaviours. A good character is usually a well-rounded mix of attitudes and emotions: that's why there's so much opprobrium heaped on 'cardboard cut-out' characters in many films and computer games. But we've become accustomed to the sketchily-drawn villains and heroes, and we recognise the black and the white. It's easy. Characters are what, and who, they are. They reflect their world, their society, its attitudes and their own attitudes towards them. And if, whatever their species, we can see the things we consider good, and noble, in them, then we call them \"human\". Personally, though, I'm with Mr Spock. ",

In truth, I have never met the above mentioned woman. She is just a fragment of my imagination. But, I have known a few women who had eyes as blue as the sea in a night of thunderstorms and a heart almost as chaotic. They burn from a distance. They burn with love. They burn with pain. Forget the character. Their ability to do so inspires me. To make something human, give them a defining characteristic. An emotion. An emotion so strong (such as betrayal, jealousy, anger etc.) that it defines their mindset and history. Give them a reason to be who they are. Leave the character in oblivion. Emote the human that they could be. \u201cTo be\u201d is the essence of human nature. Take a chance\u2014forget the character, and just let them be. ",

It was wishful thinking that I could do it. I longed to be with them. I suggest to make a human, \u201chuman,\u201d DO : ~ Give them emotions (denying emotions makes a human a beast) ~ Make them have real features ~ Think about people around you (What do they have? Write it down and brainstorm ideas for your character.) DON\u2019T : ~ Give them supernatural abilitys (telepathy, mind reading, wings, etc.) ~ Love at first sight doesn\u2019t always exist ~ Make them weird in any way (copy the people around you) Have fun with your story, give details, then overwrite and edit ruthlessly (too much detail = boring story, no takers), then have someone close to you read over and edit as well, make them give you their best comments (even if their comments are hurtful, it helps to have feedback).

I saw someone here write confusion, which I found interesting and isn\u2019t something I\u2019d considered. I think it\u2019s valid but perhaps not applicable in all scenarios. On the other hand, a flaw in a character that makes them less perfect can be essential. Even if it\u2019s a villain\u2014we don\u2019t believe perfect villains, rather we want them to be complex. What\u2019s a redemptive quality that gives some, however small, connection? Or perhaps it\u2019s the hero or heroine - that flaw that makes you root for them even more, that makes the reader able to see themselves through those eyes of the character. Perfection is boring, not only because it\u2019s unattainsble, but also because it makes a story flat. ",

            "answer_text": "You need to start observing human beings.  Try to do it like you are not from this world and all you have to go on is what you experience in your observation. You will find that there is no such thing as a truly good or truly evil person. Much of those qualities are prejudicial observations from other human beings. What are humans all about - or that one human, in particular?  Yes, they are a living and breathing animal.  They are somewhat functional within their society.  That human has hopes and dreams, personal philosophy and beliefs. Where did those come from?  A human being is both a saint and sinner.  Circumstance and attitude dictate which is a stronger trait.  The human is not just a leader or just a convenience store cashier, or just a bum. They are in those places for a reason. Human beings are four dimensional creatures. They do take up three dimensional space but they are also time travellers.  In real time they travel into the future with every passing second, not knowing where the end of the road is, but also they live in the moment and can recall the past, as if it is happening to them in the now.   What really defines today's human being is this:  they have no idea of their origins or why they exist, and all they know about the future is that it is their and that their hopes and desires may find fruition somewhere along the way.' I am no expert on the subject.  I am only a human that has spent his life observing others and trying to make sense of it. ",

            "answer_text": "\"What makes a character human?\"  Flaws. Superman is not human. He is a flawless alien, ridiculously strong and powerful and kind and altruistic, whose only relatable part is his love for Lois Lane. Batman is human. He is vulnerable, using technology to protect himself while he takes revenge on criminals for a deep seated trauma over the violent death of his parents.  Nobody is perfect. Perfection is boring. It's all about our flaws and how they influence our lives and the choice we make when we're hurtled into situations that are not under our control. ",

Everybody can act perfectly in perfect situations. But choices you make in conflict is what makes you who you are. That's what defines you as you are the one who has to live with it, for better or for worse. A character becomes human when they need to make these tough choices. The constant struggle of making decisions makes a character human. ",

What's amazing about the film was how most of it just revolved solely around one person - the protagonist - Chuck Noland (played by Tom Hanks), a FedEx employee who survived a plane crash and found himself having to fight for his survival alone on this deserted island where there was no other life form. This film thoroughly explored the subject of loneliness and solitude and the human reaction to solitude. Hank's character was so human to me because he reminded me how much all of us as human beings crave human affection and relationship. To the extent that he was so emotionally invested in his best friend Wilson - a volleyball he opened from a FedEx package after the crash. If you wanna see what the movie is about, watch it here! ",
