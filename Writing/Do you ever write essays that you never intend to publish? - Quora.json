            "answer_text": "Yes and no. I would never bother to write a formal essay that wasn\u2019t for a specific purpose such as part of an educational requirement, a work requirement, or for publication. The yes part is about informal essays. I have been asked questions by friends that I just couldn\u2019t answer in a messenger length text etc. Those pieces are essays in the sense that there is a structure, a point to their writing and a formulating and exploration of the subject. They often form a more \u2018how to\u2019 style. The style will be more colloquial and sarcastic than my Quora answers too. Exploring a subject by using an essay format often helps me form my own thoughts on a particular subject. I sometimes read my own answers from years ago to refresh my memory, as an example. When I am writing such pieces they are for my personal use. I also share them with some people to answer questions in publishing but those people are limited. Often because what I have written included private or secure information about finances. More often though I will pick a question on Quora and write an essay as an answer to explore the question and my thoughts. In a sense it is published but I don\u2019t consider writing on Quora publishing so again a yes and no. As others have said writing pieces is more often to share ideas. It is one of the reasons why my Quora answers tend to run long. As a writer I have a lot of words sitting on my hard drive that aren\u2019t published. For fiction that is sitting around 100k words at the very least, non fiction would include handwritten which is many times that. Sometimes it is about timing though and what today I think I will never publish might be the focus a year or more from now. Thanks for the A2A Sun Kim. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a lead-light bookcase in my study where the bottom shelf is reserved for my notebooks, about 30 X A4 X 180 pages. Most are my travel diaries - but others are subject-related or just plain \u2018general\u2019 notebooks. Taken together, I suppose these several thousand pages in my own handwriting serve as a rather unruly mind-map to my writing life. There are plenty of essays, or part essays, or essay beginnings, or essay ideas in there that I will never publish. I certainly don\u2019t intend to. The writing of them has been the most important thing. Writing is the transfer of thoughts into a widely understood system of marks on paper. It takes practice. Clear thinking also takes practice. That\u2019s why I find my notebooks so valuable. They continue to give me the room to flex my muscles without constraint. They have done more than that. They provide me with a record of my intellectual excitement in the early years and its sometimes downright foolish or foolhardy sparks, and they can also show the way this excitement is gradually tempered with time.
