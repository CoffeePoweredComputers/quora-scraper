            "answer_text": "So many scientific journals ARE open access. This is most likely true if the journal is a new one that started from scratch open access. Others that began under a subscription model would require an up-front investment to switch business models from reader-pay (subscription) to author-pay (open access) on account of the delayed revenue from the authors (after services are already rendered). The amount of that investment depends on the journal, but typically is one to two million dollars. Scientific societies do not have that kind of reserve to switch their journals. Many are now publishing hybrid journals that have some content open access, but other content behind a paywall that is accessible only with a subscription. As the fraction of open-access content grows, the up front cost to \u201cflip\u201d the rest of the journal to open access is reduced. I suspect that many of these hybrid journals will become completely open access in fields where authors are well funded for their research and therefore have the resources to pay the open access charge. For those fields where research grants are not common, it is less likely that authors will be able to pay open-access charges, and thus their journals will remain hybrid. Right now there are hardly any journals that are both free to readers and authors because it does cost money to publish. The few that are completely free depend greatly on volunteer time, so that in the end someone else (e.g., universities) is paying for the publishing well beyond just the peer reviewing. ",

            "answer_text": "Some journals are open access, so I suspect the intended question is, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t all journals open access?\u201d Academic publishing is not free. You need some sort of business model to pay the bills. One business model is to charge libraries a subscription fee. This model in the past sometimes widened to include individual subscribers rather than institutions, and more recently expanded to include paywalls for individual articles, so someone who wanted to read a single article could buy just one article. The subscription / paywall business model emerged before the introduction of the internet, and was probably the only one that could have worked given the infrastructure needed to print journals at the time. There are other business models, but they yet don\u2019t have the established track record that the subscription / paywall business model does. ",
