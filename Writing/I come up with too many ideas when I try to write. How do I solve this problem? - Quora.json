            "answer_text": "If there are 5 writers in the room, you will get 6 answers. What it comes down to, is finding the system that works for you. All of the answers presented here work for the people who wrote them. But they might not work for you. Does this mean that you shouldn't write? No. Does this mean that you're a BAD writer? No. It means that system doesn't work for you. I think the trick is to discover that; what system will combine clever plot lines with lovable characters and an entrancing narrative voice that will force readers to slow their rate of consumption, attempting to delay the inevitable depression that will ensue once they finish your story? That's what you have to work out. That's what we do, isn't it? To paste that little sardonic smile in the corner of your readers' lips or have them put the book down because the event (and the way you describe it) is overwhelming is why we write.  Neal Stephenson (even in this day and age) writes by hand. The Quicksilver Trilogy ended up being a stack of notebooks nearly 5 feet tall. Harlan Ellison blasts loud rock music on the stereo and types on a manual typewriter. My personal system is to separate the editing from the writing and write/construct full blast and then go back and trim and smooth.  Ideas to paper. It's curious that all the answers contain the words \"write it down.\" Not that writing it down doesn't work, but you most likely have a voice recorder in the phone in your pocket or bag. Use your tech! I think the one thing that every writer can agree on is that if you DON'T write it down (or record it), you will not have it when you need it. I don't think the questioner was that concerned with this part of the process, rather, how to fold those ideas into a story and make it work.  I would look at the 'type' of idea. For example, is your 'aha' moment about an incident that could twist a plot and have your reader exclaiming, \"I didn't see THAT coming?\" Or is it that a character woke up to the smell of garbage when the wind was just right in his childhood home - how does that have him reacting to the elements of your plot? Were there pigeons cooing on the kitchen windowsills at lunch? In other words, is it character, plot, or setting? Where in this deluge of ideas does each element fit? How does it lead to/contribute to/inculcate/ nurture the all-important conflict that is driving the story to a resolution? The magic we practice (and don't fool yourself, it IS magic) is the wizardry of weaving together these elements that will take the reader on the trip that he starts, enjoys, and finishes all in the space between his/her ears with an occasional direct-line tug on the heart muscle.  I often find my writing just stops. It isn't a block; I have plenty o' ideas, it is a stop. Luckily, I discovered that when this happens, it means something bigger and better is coming. I must respect that and let it happen.  But that's just me. What is YOUR system? Can't know until you try to nail the dang together. Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Kudos, first of all, for trying to write something that might be categorized under Science Fiction. It's not easy to build something on those grounds. You can always maintain a Notebook, where you might note things down by segmenting the book into various appropriate fields. I generally use Google Keep and Microsoft OneNote, to keep track of all my ideas. Due to its lightness, Google Keep usually comes into use when I come across something while on the move. OneNote is used whenever I have something more specific to note down, i.e., a premise, or a sequence setting, or a scenic description. Coming to classification, the most common sections, I believe are, Characters, Concepts, Scenes, Sequences. However, if your story spans across a bigger period of time, you might want to break your notebook down to include another section called Timeline. You could use this to have a general flow of events sketched out, such that you never come up with something where you might contradict yourself. ",
