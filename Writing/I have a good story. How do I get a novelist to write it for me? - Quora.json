            "answer_text": "I'm going to be the guy who says it.  I'm sure you didn't want to hear it, but I'm going to say it anyway.   \"Write it yourself.\" But I have a horrible vocabulary! I've been a professional and non-professional writer for years, with varied amounts of success.  My vocabulary is horrible.  That's what a thesaurus is for... if need be.  But even Stephen King admits that he doesn't have an extensive vocabulary and prefers authors to NOT try and dazzle with big words.   I've never written before! There was a point where I had never written before.  There was a point where J.K. Rowling had never written before.   I don't have the time! Believe me, if you have a story in your head, you'll make the time because you're realizing it and getting it out of your head in a more organized way.   I wouldn't know where to start!   Page one, first sentence, just after the title.  I don't want to be a storyteller! You already are.  You have a story in your head and you want to tell it.   I don't want to take classes! I've taken one screenwriting class in my entire life, and it didn't open my eyes all of that much.  My true classes were watching movies, reading scripts, and in your case, reading novels.  That's how you learn.   If you want an excellent \"how to\" book to read that doesn't overwhelm you, go read Stephen King's On Writing.    Okay, you almost have me, but I'm still on the fence! Writing is therapy.  The process frees you.  It's complete freedom.  It's complete escapism in the best of ways.  You get to realize your story how YOU want it without any interference.  You are the creator.  You can create whatever you'd like.  You can create characters, worlds, settings, scenarios, conflict, etc.  And all you need are some fingers and a keyboard.   Trust me, you won't fully understand that until you just go out and do it. ",

            "answer_text": "I can't tell you the number of times I've had someone say to me, \"I have a great idea for a book. You write it, and we'll split the profits.\" I think every author gets this at some time in her career. And it has to be one of the most annoying suggestions, and it's difficult to smile through a polite response. Usually, I think most of us suddenly say something like, \"Oh dear. My phone is vibrating. I really need to get this.\" and we then walk away, pretending to answer a vital call and spend the rest of the party ducking the person who made the statement. Why do writers hate this question? It shows a woeful lack of understanding about the writing process. That great idea you have is probably 1% of the work involved in creating a good book. If that. No, I take it back. Let's say .001%, because coming up with ideas isn't work at all.Writers are incredibly creative people. Not because we're magical unicorns of inspiration, but because we exercise that part of our brains constantly. I have more ideas of my own than I could ever have time to produce. I'm passionate about my ideas. They make me feel inspired. Your ideas, however brilliant, are never going to excite me the way they do you.Writing is bloody hard work. The very notion that what I do, day in and day out, is somehow comparable to a flash of inspiration you got in the shower over the course of 3 minutes is pretty insulting. Because nobody ever says \"You do all the hard work and I'll take .001% of the credit and .001% of the money.\" No, people think it should be a 50/50 split. So their suggestion is pretty demeaning of the work I do.In addition to the hard work of writing the story, the process of writing a novel isn't just Idea > Finished Product. I spend weeks hammering out a structure. Then I spend months writing a draft. Then I spend months tweaking, refining, and sometimes substantially changing a story to make it work.Sometimes I get inspired mid-process and the project takes on a different  direction than I thought it would. I want the freedom to follow my inspiration. Now, that I've discouraged you from messaging a novelist like myself on Facebook or approaching someone at a cocktail party, I will say that you can hire a ghost writer.  About Ghost Writers:They are expensive. My understanding is that a professional one will cost between $100-$250 per page. (There are people who work more cheaply than that, but this is for professionals who have experience writing full-length novels.) The higher end ones are the ones who have a successful career and likely have penned bestsellers.So if your novel is planned to be, let's say, 85,000 words. (Average for certain types of fiction. Epic fantasy is likely longer, Young Adult books are possibly shorter, but let's use this as an average.) 85,000 words translates to about 340 pages. That means your idea will cost you between $34,000 - $85,000 to produce. If you're famous, your publisher will take your idea and hire the ghost writer for you and it won't cost you anything out of pocket (although it will probably dent into your take of the proceeds -- I'm not sure how that works, though). If you're not, and you're just an average person with what feels like a brilliant idea and you have the average number of social media followers and no rabid, built-in audience (like vlogger Zoe Sugg  did for her ghostwritten book), then don't spend the money, even if you have it.Why shouldn't an average person do this? The average novel sells fewer than 1000 copies (I've heard much lower figures as well, but let's be generous and use that number because it's nice and round and assumes good things). If you're with a large publisher, you'll be earning around 15% of the cover price (don't forget you'll be paying out 15% of your money to the agent you had to hire to get that publishing contract in the first place). Say, $7.99 x 15% x 1000 = $1198.50. Your take. If you self-publish, you'll get 70% of the cover price from Amazon, but likely charge less per book. That's OK, because even though I only charge on average $3.99 per book, I make more per book than someone earning 15% gets for a $7.99 book. (Math. Go figure.) So $3.99 x 70% x 1000 = $2793.00. Either way, if your book has average sales, it comes nowhere near the low end of $34,000 you had to pay the ghost in the first place. \"But, but, I have a bazillion followers on Twitter who love my idea!\" All of these numbers go out the window if you have a huge following online.  If you've read all of this and you're serious about hiring someone to write a book for you, then I would suggest doing a kickstarter or indiegogo campaign to get the money together. Doing so will also help determine how much of your huge online following is really into your idea enough to shell out for it. I'm not trying to discourage you from writing your idea.  To the contrary, I don't view writing as a competition. The more books out there, the better it is for all writers because this is what helps maintain a society full of avid readers. This is good for me as a writer and for us as a society. Learn to write. It's hard work, but it's not rocket science. It is a learnable skill. If you've come up with a brilliant idea, learn how to make that idea into a brilliant book. ",
