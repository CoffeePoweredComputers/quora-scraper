            "answer_text": "There are several reasons that may be preventing you from expressing to others how you feel. You may not be able to to identify with your feelings. You may have had experiences that you suppress due to trauma, discomfort, shame, not being allowed to exhibit feelings. You may not have the self esteem to allow yourself to have certain feelings. Others may have mishandled your feelings in the past. Discounting your feelings, not acknowledging them, shaming you for them, hurt you during vulnerable emotional times causing you to distrust and withdraw. I think you could benefit from therapy or counseling. Learn how to practice mindfulness. You can break patterns of negative feelings that have become a natural response. Look at how many emotions a human can have, allow yourself understanding and freedom to experience them. Work through the events and environment that would cause and affect the responses you feel. Find someone you can trust that won\u2019t negate, manipulate, judge, give ill advice or not be confidential with your struggles and successes. Let this person be one you can practice expressing your feelings so you can be more adept and comfortable being open to sharing your feelings. Sometimes, verbally expressing things out loud to another helps it become more clear in your mind. ",

            "answer_text": "I will assume a couple of things and make an ass out of you and me. So please pardon if I miss the mark. One l. you feel there is something wrong with your feelings or your feelings about other people and circumstances are incorrect. Two. Revealing these feelings your errors will be discovered.Three. Their is a good chance you have hatred turned inward called shame. Realizing feelings are more real than thoughts is an important step. Standing strong and not letting other people disavow, minimize or discourage our feelings is the next. That means we have to respect others feelings as correct and real no matter how uncomfortable that makes us. It is our responsibility to manage or cope with our feelings no matter what the truth is. It is the responsibility of other people to manage their own reactions to truth or lies. Right or wrong we are only responsible for our own feelings. Trying to please everyone causes us to become lost about how to cope with our own feelings and believes. Having someone even if it is a therapist we can trust to synchronize what we feel with how other people see us is an important step to take. Then discovering the hidden reasons what, when and why we feel a certain way and react the way we do to people and circumstances. A life long adventure. Enjoy the trip. ",
