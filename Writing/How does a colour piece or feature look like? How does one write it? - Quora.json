            "answer_text": " Once upon a time i was a Features editor and writer for a college magazine. I mainly focused on niche, interesting or articles too small for a Cover story. A Cover story generally ran 4 plus pages. A Feature was generally 2. Or less. Book reviews, short interviews, ongoing stories about the community, an art exhibition. A Colour piece would be about the same length but would have more of a focus on entertainment, a new play in town, interviews with the cast, a car race, a celebrity speech or appearance. A Cover would be much more extensive, background, interviews, quotes. Generally a Cover story is the centerpiece and its page numbers are flexible to knocking other things out if there's a page limit. There can be multiple features and colours though. ",

            "answer_text": "You may be refrrencing how a good feature story (which is usually a prominent story and a longer read) will often have \u201ca lot of color.\u201d This generally means vivid description\u2014scenes that a reader can visualize. To add \u201ccolor\u201d to a story, set the scene for us: Describe how the person you are writing about picks up a book, how they dress or speak, what their office or home looks like. Share a story they tell about their past. A good feature makes the reader feel like he or she is there with you. The more we can \u201csee\u201d the scenes in the story, the more engrossed we are and the more we will want to keep reading. Hope that helps! ",
