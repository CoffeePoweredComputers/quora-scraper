            "answer_text": "Before we figure out how to redirect someone to email, let\u2019s consider the nature of your relationship. If the person calling is a work contact or business associate, especially someone with more seniority than you, you should consider maintaining contact by phone. In those situations, you do what\u2019s convenient for them, and if they repeatedly reach out to you by phone, they\u2019re telling you what they prefer. If we can rule out the issue of seniority, then I\u2019d wonder why they prefer to get in touch with you by phone. Does it have something to do with them: Is this person always on the road and unable to respond with a written answer?Or does it have something to do with you: Maybe when they call you, they get a quick answer, but sending an email results in a long delay.If you haven\u2019t given them reason to prefer phone vs. email contact and this is a peer we\u2019re talking about, the next time they call, let them leave a voicemail. When you call back, mention that\u2026 You\u2019re away from your desk a lot right now;You get spotty cell reception;You\u2019re in meetings where you can\u2019t answer your phone;Or some other reason that makes phone calls inconvenient for you.Then, ask whether it would be okay to continue communication via email: Hi Bob, I\u2019m sorry I missed your call. We\u2019ve got clients coming in and out all week, so I\u2019m not at my desk a whole lot. Would you mind emailing me if you need to get in touch since that\u2019s the best way to reach me right now? Of course, make sure you actually reply in a timely manner to reinforce that communication via email will pay off for them! Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Sorry, I can't offer you a polite solution, but can offer you a few thoughts. Manners are about saying and doing things that make the 'other' person feel comfortable. Try to reverse the roles for a moment to view your request.  You want to make a quick call to someone, but they have requested VERY POLITELY that you not call them but to, instead, email them.  It is inconvenient for you to do this because; a) you are not at your desk, b) don't have a cell phone, c) don't like typing on your cell phone because you have big fat fingers and it is clumsy for your, d) are the slowest typist on planet earth or e) list any other legitimate reason here.  What do you think of the other person, given the circumstances?  Selfish?  Why does this person thinks the world revolves around them?  Both are valid possibilities. Then of course, it may be no big deal where none of the above apply. I think, though, you have to carefully consider the potential inconvenience placed upon them by your request.   But to answer your original question as how to politely ask, its the one you're already thinking of -- \"If you don't mind and if it is not too much trouble, I'd appreciate it if you could email me if you need to contact me.  Often times, I'm unreachable by phone and it's just easier that way.\" ",
