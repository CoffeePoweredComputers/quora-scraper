I've taken the liberty of re-working yours, since you asked me to answer this question.  \"When he was satisfied that there weren't any clues in the bedroom, he searched the adjoining bathroom. Finding nothing there, he went back to the living room and checked under the sofa. That yielded no results; his search of the apartment was finished.\" ",

            "answer_text": "It is acceptable (in the sense that it's intelligible and breaks no obvious grammatical rules), but since this is creative (vs purely utilitarian) writing, I think you ought to be aiming for \"good\" rather than \"acceptable\". So let's try to pick it apart to identify some aspects of un-goodness: 1. Repetition The phrase \"when he\" is used three times, which is both a little boring and somewhat redundant. Providing you've managed to engage your reader at all (and if you haven't, then the game is already lost), he / she will automatically *want* to make sense of what you write order to discover what happens next. As such, there's no need to explicitly identify the actor (\"he\") in every sub-clause; neither is it necessary to explicitly specify the order of events (\"when\"). Continuity of protagonist and forward procession of events are both natural default assumptions, so you can trust your reader to join the dots. 2. Shorter sentences are more exciting / compelling for action sequences. Your protagonist is clearly looking for something, and (as your reader) I imagine you'd like for me to be experiencing some sort of excitement / tension about each step of the search. However, your single lengthy sentence reports fact-of-search and outcome-of-search at three locations in a way that is almost dismissive (meaning that as your reader I feel little involvement in your protagonist's experience - and am disproportionately aware of you, the author, as the architect of this fellow's fate). What things *were* present in the apartment and what thoughts were passing through your protagonists mind (for example) ? Remember that your protagonist is living moment-to-moment, and neither he nor your reader should know anything about future you've mapped out him until it happens. ",

            "answer_text": "First, you should turn that example into 3 sentences. Second, do not use more than two 1 sentence paragraphs consecutively. Third, one sentence can be one paragraph, but often it's bad writing.  Bad writing:\"I hate her. She is a witch. She should die.\" Good writing: \"Where did he go?,\" said Jack \"I don't know,\" answered Melinda. \"Did you check the basement? If he isn't upstairs, he could be in the basement. Make sure to check there.\" The second example uses one sentence paragraphs but it serves to convey quick dialogue. ",

            "answer_text": "  If you don't lose your reader, and if running on supports your artistic style then how is it a problem? The intention of the conventions of sentence structure is to establish a standard. The purpose of that standard is to help all writing to be more easily understood. If your writing can't be understood it will fail to engage and lock onto the reader's focus. It's okay to deviate from the conventions of standard English, but it's up to you as a writer to decide what balance of structure and expression will best serve your interests. Mind you, Ayn Rand was the queen of the run-on sentence -- and her writing was horrible. ",

I think \"adjoining\" is a more suitable word than \"bordering\" in this context. In addition, the second hyphen should be replaced with \"and\".  Come to think of it you should use semicolons instead of hyphens if you really need all this to be in the same sentence, but it would be best to split it up. It seems a little inelegant in its present form. ",
