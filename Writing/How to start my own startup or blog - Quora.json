            "answer_text": "There\u2019s five main steps you need to do in order to start a blog. If you follow this guide exactly, you\u2019ll have your own blog set up in 30 minutes or less. Choose a great blog platformChoose a web host for your blogHow to Set up a blog on your own domainDesign your new blogUseful resources for bloggingStep 1 \u2013 Choose your preferred blogging platform Choosing where you want to build blog is pretty much the first thing you have to do. I\u2019m going to take a leap and assume you\u2019ve heard of WordPress, and this is the platform I advocate. It\u2019s massive. It\u2019s by far one of the biggest blogging platforms in the world, with countless plugins and add-ons and almost infinite ways to design and layout your blog. Step 2 \u2013 Self-hosting or a free alternative? Whoa, slow down there! This is the biggest decision you\u2019ll have to make before we go any further. You need to decide whether to pay for your blog or grab a free one. WordPress, Tumblr and Blogger all offer free blogs for anyone. Awesome, right? It\u2019s perfect for those of us who aren\u2019t super serious about blogging. But it does have downsides: 1) You won\u2019t be able to get your OWN domain name On a free blog, your blog\u2019s web address (your URL) will be butt-ugly. Like, really ugly. In short, create a free blog with any other the above free blog services and it\u2019ll look like this: All about youyourblog\u0411\u0435\u0437 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044fI know, ugly right? 2) Limits and more limits There are some limits to free blogs. You can\u2019t fully monetize it, and you don\u2019t have the possibility to upload all those videos and images you want to show everyone \u2013 it\u2019s all limited. Worse still, you won\u2019t even have access to the free themes offered by WordPress. 3) You DON\u2019T OWN your blog It might sound silly at first, but you don\u2019t actually own your blog. It\u2019s hosted on someone else\u2019s web property and they can delete it if they want so. They have done so in the past, and keep doing it in the future. Which means all your hard work on your blog, all those countless hours of writing blog posts might be vanished within seconds. Sad\u2026 On the other hand, with a self-hosted blog on your own domain name \u2013 you are the REAL owner of your blog. You\u2019ll be able to name your blog whatever you want, for example \u201cyourname.com -&nbspThis website is for sale! -&nbspyourname Resources and Information.\u201d or \u201chttp://YourAwesomeBlog.com. You can end it with .com, .http://co.uk, .net, .org, or virtually any other web suffix. Add to that unlimited bandwidth for videos, images and content plus the free themes and you have a winning combo. So how much is hosting and a domain name? Not as much as you\u2019re thinking, fortunately. It usually works out to about $5 to $10 per month, depending on your hosting provider which is less than a couple of coffees. If you still have questions, here\u2019s some further information for you to look at: Should I Choose a Hosted or Non-hosted Blogging Platform?Step 3 \u2013 Start a blog on your own domain (if you chose self-hosting and a custom domain)  I\u2019m going to push ahead based on the premise you\u2019ve chosen WordPress, and if you haven\u2019t, you should. Seriously, it\u2019s the best. If you\u2019re still a little confused by what a self-hosted blog is, allow me to explain and how you can go about setting one up for yourself. You\u2019ll need to come up with a domain name you like and also choose a hosting company that can host your blog. Domain: The domain is basically the URL of your website. Examples: Google (Google is the domain), Log In or Sign Up (Log In or Sign Up is the domain). See? Simple!Hosting: Hosting is basically the company that puts your website up on the internet so everyone else can see it. Everything will be saved on there. Think of it as a computer hard-drive on the internet where your blog will be saved.Disclosure: I recommend using Just Host for web hosting. If you click through one of my links and make a purchase, I will receive a commission, which helps me keep Blogging Basics 101 - Social Media & Blogging Tips up and running. Personally, I use Just Host (for my blog domain and hosting), and I\u2019ve got nothing but good things to say about it. It\u2019s probably one of the cheapest (less than $3 per month) hosting providers out there. A domain name will cost around $10-15 a year, but with Just Host they throw that in for free :). Big smiles for that! They\u2019re the providers I use for all of my blogs, including the one you\u2019re reading right now. If for any reason you don\u2019t want to go with Just Host, feel free to choose your own hosting company. Most, if not all of them, should have a \u201cone-click\u201d WordPress install solution on their admin panel. That button will automatically install WordPress on your blog. Did I say it was simple or what? All you need to do is sign up with Just Host (or your chosen provider), choose your hosting plan and a domain name and look for the one-click WordPress install button on the admin panel. WordPress essentials aren\u2019t often needed, but I\u2019d recommend whois privacy (that will keep all your personal details private) and definitely automated backups (this\u2019ll save your website just in case anything fails or disappears, so you won\u2019t lose any or very little of your blog). Step 4 \u2013 Designing your WordPress blog Now, the fun bit. Let\u2019s make your blog look exactly how you want it to. To choose a new theme, you can either head to Appearance > Themes and install a free WordPress theme or you can head to a premium theme website like ThemeForest.net and buy a theme for around $40. I usually choose something that looks professional and pretty easy to customise. WordPress also has this awesome feature that allows you to change themes with just a few clicks. So if you start getting tired of your current blog template, you can just switch to another one without losing any precious content or images.
