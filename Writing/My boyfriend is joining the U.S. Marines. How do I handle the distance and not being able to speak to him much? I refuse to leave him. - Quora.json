            "answer_text": "How you handle it is by considering your options and making a decision. You have to understand this is his decision, and support him one way or another. Supporting him doesn\u2019t mean you have to stay with him, just that you aren\u2019t angry and understand his need to join up. Should you choose to stay with him, there\u2019s more to consider. The life of a significant other for our troops is very different than others. If you love him, like really love him, stick it out. He will be gone for a while training, he will be stationed somewhere that\u2019s probably not home. Deployments last anywhere from 6\u201314 months. Many of our troops opt to rush in marriage so they can be with their significant other and get out of the barracks. Rushing into it is not a good idea, I don\u2019t know about other branches but for first term Marines the divorce rate is 110%. Seriously. Many of my friends came home from the war to find their wives/girlfriends were not faithful. Some of my friends had excellent wives/girlfriends, who supported their man through thick and thin. Being a significant other for our troops is a job of its own. The ones that do it right are greatly appreciated. Many wives/girlfriends lean on each other during deployments and training, and there\u2019s things you can do like joining auxiliary support clubs to find others in the same situation. It doesn\u2019t take a strong woman to do this, it does take one that is in a really loving relashinship though. So you can say you want to stick it out and live the life of loving and supporting significant other for one of our warriors, or you can say this is not the life I want and cut your losses. Remember that you are both making a big decision and there doesn\u2019t need to be any anger on either side. Just if you decide to try it and see how it goes, build the foundation of your relashinship on faithfulness and DO NOT rush into a marriage. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, easy option is to lean on your family. Lean on your female friends. When he deploys and is in real mortal danger, that feeling is only going to get more intense. The good news is the longer you do long distance, the better you get at it. I\u2019m married now. When I was deployed, my girlfriend and I at the time broke up 3 or 4 times. That\u2019s pretty normal. Some guys get cheated on. Military relationships do tend to end in failure because of the stress, so be aware of that. In the meantime, don\u2019t get coffee or lunch with other guys. Even if they are really good friends. Stay loyal. If you can\u2019t handle that, be honest and send the breakup letter to your Marine-to-be. He will recover, but your integrity won\u2019t grow back. The most common story goes something like this for cheaters at home: \u201cI met a friend after class, we had a good time. He was so sweet and totally respectful of our relationship. I went over to his place to study one night, and we held hands. I was thinking about how lonely I was, then we kissed and one thing led to another\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d Heed that warning, 100%. Your real friends and family are the ones who will hold you accountable to the relationship. That\u2019s where all of your focus can be. Send him letters and stand by the phone when he is due to call you. You\u2019ll get through it. ",

            "answer_text": "Now\u2019s the time to get your social life booming. Make yourself busy - find people to give you a sense of community and belonging while he\u2019s away. Rely on friends and family for emotional support, and good friends for platonic hugs and affection when that\u2019s something you require. If you\u2019re too busy with great people to feel genuinely lonely, missing your BF will hurt much less. You\u2019ll be a much healthier and happier girlfriend when he does come home, and he will appreciate that. There are also support groups for military families and partners. What you\u2019re facing is a big part of being a military spouse or the \u201chome\u201d end of a dating partnership (heck, even in being a child of a military parent!). There are loads of people who can commiserate with you and you might find a tight community of people who know exactly what you\u2019re going through. I find that helps, a lot. You can often find support groups in your local town even if it\u2019s not a military base town or the city in which he is stationed. Remember, you are NOT alone! Make plans for what is going to happen after training is over. Knowing a long distance relationship will not *always* be long distance helps keep your heart and mind on the right track. ",

And after 3 months of being at a USMC recruit depot will change him. The he will go to his job training school. Than his actual first station. Unless you intend on marrying him and moving around with him, you'll be stuck doing a long term relationship. People are going to tell you do find hobbies, lean on your family, all that stuff. But the simple fact is, you'll probably forget what his face looks like before he gets out of basic. Yeah, you'll recognize when you see him, but you may have a hard time bringing up that image in your head. The distance will be rough, and the emotional immaturity, no offense, just isn't conducive to a long lasting relationship. Tell you what though, after you've been apart for a while, and he's done some cool US Marine stuff, meet back up and see if there's anything still there. If so, then you have a real shot. ",
