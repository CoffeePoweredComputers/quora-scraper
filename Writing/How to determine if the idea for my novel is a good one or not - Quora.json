            "answer_text": "Ahem! Ahem! * rolls up sleeves* First of all, give yourself a pat on the back for choosing writing as a mode to express your voice.. readers and writers everywhere really appreciate this. Now, I don\u2019t know which stage of writing you are in; Planning , Outlining, Drafting or editing.( You can tell me in the comments section) When writers and screenplay writers begin to etch their story outline on a piece of paper or just plan a rough outline in their heads , it is clear that they already have an idea of where the story is going. Yes , I am referring to the Ending of the book. It sounds funny at first, but sometimes, writers have to put the readers\u2019 emotional responses reactions at top priority. It\u2019s really impossible to tell whether your idea for a novel is a good idea or not, because a majority of what decides that will depend on your audience : the readers. But hey! No need to be discouraged! As someone already working on his first draft, I can boost you a few hacks! Familiarize yourself with the category: What genre are you writing in? If you are writing in ..let\u2019s say Fantasy/ Sci-fi , you need to first read many\u2026and I mean many titles under the same genre. You must familiarize yourself with world-building skills, imagery and pacing of your story. The same applies to all other genres as well; Biographies, memoirs,poetry, fiction, non-fiction,etc. Read as many books under your genre of choice and familiarize yourself with multiple themes, premises and settings.Read..read..read a lot!: When you understand how the publishing industry looks at fresh manuscripts, you can outsmart them by preparing beforehand.If I asked you to name five of your most favorite books, they\u2019re your favorite \u2019cause there is something about them that moved you the first time you read them. They probably enticed a certain emotion within you and set their place in your heart and mind. That\u2019s what a good book is.I get visibly infuriated when I see newbie writers wanting to just jump into writing their own book and have their name on it just because they scored 10 on 10 on an English assignment. THAT IS NOT HOW YOU BEGIN TO WRITE. You will end up with a nightmare if you forge your first draft right out of the blue with either limited vocabulary or a Shit ton of purple prose! Speaking of purple prose..Screw purple prose!: Purple prose can be one of your worst enemies. Especially in the process of gaining readership. If you dust up the old thesaurus and go all fancy on your usage of words , I\u2019ll bet on my soul that your readers are gonna hate you, however good your story might be. So my advice is, keep it simple wherever you possibly can. That does not mean you have to dumb it down for your readers, that\u2019s quite offensive. It just means not trying to be obvious that one wants to desperately show off their newly acquired vocabulary. so..Keep it simple.Get to writing!: Now that you have a proper outline ready and you have a clear idea of where the story is heading , in order for your novel to be actually read is to get to writing . If you\u2019re determined enough you can squeeze in enough time everyday on a regular basis and make a habit out of it\u2026Set up a word count limit for the day and do it! Write , write and write !!!EDITING: In order to make your book work, you need to polish it and scrub it and trim it a countless times, forging draft after draft until you are left with this spotless diamond of a masterpiece, and you're probably gonna burn through a lot of paper or your eyes if your using your computer. If you thought writing itself was hard, this will make you think twice. Most of the novices in the art don\u2019t bother revising and editing their manuscripts more than two to three times and publish their works confidently while risking their pride..not that rejection is bad or anything. Speaking of which\u2026Embrace rejection and learn : Without having been rejected at least once, one cannot become a master in their art. So accept it with a smile and give thanks to the one who signed your rejection letter, \u2019cause that just means it leaves you more room for improvement! Realizing that is an improvement in itself, as most people just frown at criticism and grumble like a sick turkey being singed in the butt and give up on their writing dreams.DO NOT GIVE UP I hope I helped at least a teeny bit on your journey. I would love to hear about whatever you are working on and will be glad to help you out ! Happy writing! ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm\u2026let\u2019s see. What was it that exactly made you think it? What was it that eventually put the seed of \u2018I want to write this\u2019 in there? Now, after you get past that, put it out there. In words and out of your head. Trust me when I say you\u2019ll never find out whether the idea inside your head is a good one or not unless you get it out of its safe haven aka your brain. After you\u2019ve actually emptied it out on paper, reading it yourself a few times and showing it to someone you trust is eventually going to tell you whether you want to continue or not. If it\u2019s an idea that made you ask this question, then I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably worth getting called a good idea. If you ask me, all ideas are good ideas. What matters is how you express, expand and add on to them. A brilliant idea can be a\u2014excuse my language\u2014a shit one if executed badly. And an idea that seems like it\u2019s a crap one can go places if you work with it and around it carefully enough. So, stop asking why it\u2019s a good idea and make it a good one. Thank you so much for the request! Have an amazing day ahead and don\u2019t let your ideas escape. They\u2019re precious. Always. So don\u2019t hide them. Cheers. ",
