            "answer_text": "\u201cFive hundred twenty-five thousandSix hundred minutesFive hundred twenty-five thousandMoments so dearFive hundred twenty-five thousandSix hundred minutesHow do you measure - measure a year?In daylights - in sunsetsIn midnights - in cups of coffeeIn inches - in milesIn laughter - in strife\u201d Wow, what a cheesy intro to your question. But the point I\u2019m trying to make is, a week\u2026or time for that matter, is what you make of it. More specifically, how you allocate it\u2026and prioritize the things you need to do. Let\u2019s tackle this bit by bit. There are many types of college applications, with the two most prominent being Common App and UC (debatably, depending on your schools of choice). First, consider the length (word limit) of your essays. Then, consider the prompt(s). Can you address the prompts instantly and quickly, or is it a slog of a struggle with nothing coming to mind? That will make a huge difference in time. Second, how quickly can you write? Think about all the standardized tests you have ever taken in your life. The AP English test is around 3 hours. The SAT writing section was 20 minutes and now 50 minutes I think. Under such time constraints, YOU WILL write it, lest you simply give up on yourself and take that score that you know is less than what you can achieve. If you think like that, there is no doubt you can complete the 650 words or so required by each essay. In fact, if pressed enough, you could probably write both in a day. But don\u2019t let that be an excuse to put it off to the last minute, because the quality will suffer, as will your admissions, as will you, ultimately. To provide a more cogent, direct, and applicable plan for you, break down the week into 7 days. Then break down the 7 days into 24 hours. You sleep 8 hours. Then you have 16 hours, 8 for school. The rest is up to you to allocate. HOW you allocate the hours will depend how important these college applications are to you and how motivated you are to get it done. Next, address the prompts. If it\u2019s Common App, there are 5, choose 1, 650 words. If it\u2019s UC, there are 8 choose 4. There are also many other supplemental essays. Finally, just get to writing. The fact that you came onto quora seeking advice/guidance means that you just need a little push to get you moving, or else you would be writing right now instead of reading about how you should write. I\u2019m going to cut and paste some resources I\u2019ve compiled/written to help you get started. Good luck. Traditionally, college admissions essays/personal statements are written as a story that show character, qualities demonstrated such as leadership and perseverance, overcoming hardship, etc. That\u2019s the WHAT, or the content of what you will be writing. In order to address the HOW, there could be several techniques you could utilize. Brainstorm-Brainstorming is something we\u2019ve been familiar with since those worksheets we got in fourth grade, but the process can be daunting when you feel as if you have very little content to work with. The quickest way to start the process is to simply take a blank sheet of paper and in the middle, write down \u201cME\u201d, or your name, or whatever the focal point of your personal statement should be. (It should be you.) Then, simply write down words that are offshoots of you. Focus on the positive and the qualities you\u2019ve demonstrated in your life, but if it is negative, elaborate on how that has allowed you to grow and change and develop. Remember: the events in your life are objective. The interpretation of those events become your subjective reality, as you process your life through cognition.2. Mindmap-Next, take those words and try to find the links between them. For example, if you wrote down ME in the middle, and the offshoots were a) track and field b) NHS c) social acceptance d) AP English composition f) Your family This is quite like a jumble without any kind of coherence initially. As it should be, because you\u2019re just getting started. Now let\u2019s look for the links. I have no idea what your background or personality or how you want to \u201cangle\u201d yourself to the colleges, so this has to be purely hypothetical. These 5 offshoots that I thought of off the top of my head represent sports, extracurriculars, a larger scope of HS life, academic courses, and background. Always think about what your words, sentences, and paragraphs represent. The meaning is more important than the literal words. Now, going deeper, what can we extract from these topics? Sports-leadership, teamwork, dedication, passion, achievement, competition, spirit, growth extracurriculars-going above and beyond, volunteering, sustaining excellence, balancing multiple obligations, potential leadership social acceptance-insight, analysis, relationships, humanity AP English composition-academic excellence, dedication to academics, focus, industriousness, will, interest, potential family and background-Connections, support, love, hardship, learning, growth, forgiveness, understanding 1. Layered depth-If you want to get a little fancier, we can go with something I\u2019ll call layered depth, which would be a kind of technique where you go deeper and deeper in a particular topic until you reach something so deep that it resonates and connects beyond a standard essay. Let\u2019s use the social acceptance example. a) School is tough, hard to fit in, like Mean Girls b) Why is school structure like that? Then you notice cliques c) How do people behave in cliques? Each person has a role in each group d) What is the function of each role of each person? e) How can one enter an established group or become expelled from a group through violating social norms From here, you have the opportunity to transition into a more academic and mature discussion of topics related to anthropology and sociology to show that you are more than just a typical candidate. f) How similar are humans to animals in the animal kingdom? Wolfpacks, bonobo monkeys, flocks of migrating birds, etc. (zoology) g) in-group out-group theory (psychology) h) How society functions (sociology) 1. Micro/macrocosm Lastly, microcosm and macrocosm can be used to take one tiny microscopic event and use it to symbolize a grand universal theme. Let\u2019s use sports in this example. You constantly finish last place. That\u2019s a normal occurrence. Somebody has to finish last in every race. But how does that feel? What does that mean? What did you do in response? Did you languish and accept it? Did you analyze it? Did you feel inferior? Is Darwinism the be all end all of land, or does man possess the power to harness his or her own strengths to overcome a situation through force of will and perseverance? That\u2019s one example. Another example could be SOMEONE ELSE constantly finishes last and gets bullied and picked on all the time. You, as an observer, do not contribute to the bullying nor do you aid this person. Meanwhile, you observe, and sit, and watch. How do you interpret this situation? What does this mean? What will you response in the future? Will you do anything? Did you feel compelled to help but felt powerless in the situation because of the power of the social situation? Or did you accept that such is life and one person can only do so much? These are the questions that will reveal your character, and the way you present your answers is the revelation of your own nature. There is no falsifying of content because you are who you are and nobody else. And nobody can be you. But just know that every instance, moment, event, or situation, no matter how mundane (such as Newton\u2019s apple falling from a tree), or cataclysmic (natural disasters, the terror you see in the news ever day), can represent and symbolize the essence of who you are. If you can present it well enough, and it\u2019s a good fit with the school, luck will be on your side. On that note, there will always be a factor of luck. But that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have the means to put yourself in the best position to become the best that you are capable of becoming. Also, here\u2019s a free personal statement book that I wrote, but it\u2019s extremely difficult to write a full length, polished, and satisfactory book to my standards. But it\u2019s free so why not! Free Personal Statement Book Here\u2019s a script I wrote for a video regarding the writing process\u2026 In this video, we\u2019re going to skip a lot of the counseling process and move towards the personal statements because that\u2019s where a lot of the value is. In order to hone your editing skills, you should employ a technique I\u2019m going to refer to as \u201cThe 5 Point Check\u201d. It is essentially a checklist of key aspects of the writing in your student\u2019s essay. They are: 1) Tone 2) Structure 3) Grammar/Mechanics 4) Flow (transitions+diction) 5) Content Tone-Tone is the way something sounds. It can have a serious connotation, feeling, or vibe. This can be conveyed through periods and curt statements. Or\u2026it could be suspenseful\u2026and maybe even animated! The reader should try and stay consistent though, or else it can very difficult to establish the voice of the writer. Structure-The structure is the skeleton, template, or mold of the essay. The statement must progress forward in a way that is coherent, logical, and progressive. The classic way to ensure that structure exists before starting to write is by OUTLINING using a 5 paragraph essay. A 5 paragraph essay consists of: 1) Introduction, including the thesis statement at the end of the paragraph 2) Main Idea 1 (Body) 3) Main Idea 2 (Body) 4) Main Idea 3 (Body) 5) Conclusion that summarizes the essay and ties up loose ends That\u2019s the most BASIC structure though. There are many different ways to create form out of your substance, but as long as the essay makes sense as a cohesive whole, then structure has been established. Grammar/Mechanics-Grammar and mechanics are the rules of conventional writing. For a more in depth review of grammar, please check out this supplemental video. Please keep in mind that language is constantly evolving, so rules can be broken if it somehow appropriate. An example would be colloquialism, or if you want to sound friendly, as if you were talking to a peer. Flow-Flow is progression. Flow is smooth. It could be jagged if that\u2019s what you want to establish, but you want to put grab the reader with a hook, then put the reader in a trance with your articulate thoughts and your eloquent style. Simply progress naturally towards an eventual end of your story. Content-There is the ability to write. And then there\u2019s content. Content is the material with which you write. If you are a swordswith, your art is making swords. Your tool is a hammer, or whatever you forge swords with. Your MATERIAL is steel, or whatever you MAKE swords with. If you are a writer, your art is writing. Your tool is your pen, rhetorical devices, and your mind. Your MATERIAL is your content. Content is what life is made of. Your content is the steel with which you\u2019ll carve your character into the minds of your readers. It is most likely the most important component of the five aspects of writing we cover here. Content is important. Because content is king. Just write. That first step is always the hardest. Once you get started, it practically writes itself. Peace.
