            "answer_text": "This is an amazing question. Thanks for asking this. The moment my eyes fell on this question, my spirit jumped up and said to my writing self, come on tiger, write an awesome answer!  [image source: Pinterest] Just like our everyday life involves moving into the unknown, writing too is journey of faith in a blank sheet of paper, creating an excellent prose, poem, or a catchy one-liner. You don\u2019t know how to begin writing or don\u2019t how in which way to think. What about grammar, word choice, paragraphing, and the many other zillions of self-doubts and inadequacies felt? but still you courageously move forward to write. It is faith in yourself and the courage to start inking or typing few words is what ignites writing an amazing content. You developed faith and you have mustered up your courage, now what? You should read and re-read several times the question to understand what answer the reader expects. See the question from the answer-seeker side. Put yourself in their shoes. Think this way: If I were this person (the answer-seeker), what I look for in the answer? What is the person\u2019s age? Is he student or professional? What is their level of reading comprehension or their vocabulary skills? Asking these questions to yourself will propel your mind to quickly form some connections. OK, you have done all you could in understanding the question and understanding the person who asked this question, now what? Think again for a while regarding how you could write an interesting answer. A short phrase, a one-liner, a story, a illustration, a movie scene, metaphor, anything to keep your reader aroused. Keep that idea somewhere in your mind. OK, you have got some vague idea to express your answer, now what? Write all your ideas (preferably in a short form) in a paper or type out the same in a PC. Start playing around them, ponder a little deeper about each piece of ideas. Now suddenly you cannot help yourself but drown in fresh streams of ideas gushing our of your mind. From nothing to overflowing is what the journey of writing takes you. Isn\u2019t that exciting? You move from \u201cYou don\u2019t know what to write\u201d to \u201cyou did everything right to write aright\u201d. Between these two phases, you do the grammar check, paragraphing, rewriting, deletion, polishing etc. to make your writing as appealing as possible to the prospective reader. your letters becomes words, and your words becomes paragraphs, and your paragraphs becomes an exquisite piece of writing!

            "answer_text": "OKAY!! When I have to begin to write I always ensure to have get a stimulus, now it could be either a photo, drawing, thought of necessary energy, in fact sometimes just a partner to have spoken of a thought. These things come long way with me to produce a great piece of writing. Once I\u2019ve rights found the stimulus then my immediate next step it to think it in a manner to create a vision of that idea or a concrete impression. Usually when I find that especially from a picture it becomes easier, in a sense that its right in front of me. next to this step I bring my pen and copy and write down every single detail. I mean it!, every single detail which I got to mention in choicest words afterwards. I take sufficient time to collect right set of scenes I want the writing to be written in and progress with it gradually. I often keep a theme for the writing which makes it comfortable for me to start it and later on, once am into the flow it\u2019s really hard to stop until it is done. I literally love the steps I follow. These are so systematic and nothing is left which I don\u2019t mention. Once I\u2019ve written in rough I fair it neatly on another sheet. With every another reading, maximum 2, I check content and grammatic as well as sentence formation. AND TADA! Here is the final piece of writing! ",
