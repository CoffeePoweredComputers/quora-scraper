            "answer_text": "As a fellow student who tends to get [appropriately] close to my teachers, I love writing letters of appreciation to them. Because I\u2019m still in touch with many of my high school teachers, I know that they really loved getting these letters too. Focus on how they have helped you, in and out of the classroom. If you were going through a personal issue and they were very understanding, mention that specifically. Hold off to actually say the words \u201cThank you\u201d to the end of the letter, because it will force you to be introspective on how they have influenced your life. Teachers are shapers of the world, and almost never get the recognition they deserve. Write the note in a card, specifically so it doesn\u2019t get lost amongst the loads of papers they are around every day. ",

            "answer_text": "As a teacher, a card with a message showing gratitude is a treasure. It is better than a note on lined paper because it shows you put more thought and effort into it. Also, be thoughtful while writing it and try to use good grammar and spelling. He or she will also appreciate that very much, because it implies success on the part of the teacher. ",
