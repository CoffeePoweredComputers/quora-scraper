An art form that has many applications. And has been used for Likee.. Evvaa. That's another thing I love about writing. You can have so many voices, develop characters with unique personalities, explore your imagination. Overall, writing is a way for me personally to convey stories, experiences, thoughts, and actions better than anything else. Its only you and the words you write. You are free, to be free. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me rephrase your question, \u201cWhy did you keep writing?\u201d and the answer is to keep myself sane. Every now or then, we go through a situation where we cannot share our thoughts with others (or not at that moment), but we need to get them out of our system. That is the time, you start writing. In the end, writing is not a choice, it is that one thing that keeps me alive everyday. This is how I find someone to hear my side of story. ",
