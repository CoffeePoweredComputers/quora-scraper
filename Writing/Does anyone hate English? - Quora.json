            "answer_text": "I am from America and I hate English. I wish I would have learned a better language as my native language instead of English. Why do I hate English? Unlike Latin, Greek (the various forms of it, excluding modern greek), and especially Sanskrit, English is a sloppy, inconsistent, inelegant, cumbersome language. We use language to communicate ideas from one person to another, and this is ultimately how we can judge a language\u2019s quality - by how effectively, efficiently, and ergonomically it enables us to communicate ideas. Some say that \u201cno language is better than another language\u201d, but this is rubbish. Some also say that \u201cthe language that enables you to speak to the most people is the best\u201d and this is also rubbish. The fact that so many people speak english simply means that a lot of people are using an inferior tool to communicate. I truly think the world would be a better place if the number of people who speak English, Spanish, and other colonial languages spoke fine languages like Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin. The shortcomings of English are hard to identify clearly but profoundly significant anthropologically. Just think how much bumbling around that people do because of the lack of clarity in communication. Countless effort-hours of work/labor, countless unnecessary disputes and mistakes that arise from miscommunication, not to mention the copious amount cognitive dissonance that has come to underpin modern culture. Like the computer scientists say: \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d. People tend to think in the language they speak. Now consider the inherent lack of precision, elegance, clarity, and versatility of the language itself, and try to imagine how that might affect the way we think. I have noticed a strong trend of egoism associated with English itself and most of the literature written in it. And egoism is indeed the insidious disease that afflicts the modern world. Also, it is worth noting that the way english was made to be so widely spoken was by a massive, sustained campaign of punitive carnage and violence. The language was used as a means for iconoclasm, assimilation and hegemony. Meanwhile the educated and elite have been privileged to learn Greek and Latin. Hmmmm. If the English language were a plant, it would be a weed. If it were a restaurant it would be McDonalds. Some people like McDonalds, lots of people eat McDonalds, but that doesn\u2019t make it \u2018good food\u2019. I know a lot of other commenters are going to be upset with my answer, and that is fine. To each their own. They can speak english, eat McDonalds, and listen to Nickleback all they want :) ",

Im not an English native speaking person, The thing with english is the terms, and the use of those terms, and the way you interpret then translate what you are trying to say in sentence, in your non english language would have different meaning to a english native speaking person, when translated to english (the whole meaning of the sentence is lost) and the english native speaking person will not understand what you are trying to say, even the grammar is correct. They could not. Unless if you use the english that the english native person does then he will understand you. This is why i hate english. It is hard to communicate on times to an english native speaking person when you are trying to say deeper sentences in your own native language english translated with correct grammar. you had to repeat what you have said and then use an alternate sentence that is shorten that has same meaning on your non english native language after wards, and they would be \u201cOh that one, you just had to bla bla\u201d ITS PRETTY ANNOYING.
