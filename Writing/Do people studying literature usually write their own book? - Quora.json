            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Millions of people study Literature. Universities all over the world are filled with degrees, diplomas and doctorates in Literature. However, those millions of students don't come out intent of=n writing books! I guess, the knowledge gained, a deep study of the great classics, comparative literature, new trends in writing and the different genres of literature may not be everyone's forte. The study of literature can be applied to a whole lot branches which need that study. It is really not directed tow writing books as the end result. Among the millions that gain degrees you may have a handful of people who contemplate the value of writing their own book. The returns for the effort they put in do not match their expectations. That is a real pity. Even more specific are the ones who contemplate writing one but never get down to it. It is not an easy task and I have said this before, many times. The passion to write must sustain itself over a long period, more so, during the research and writing period. This could be months or years with sight of a steady income. The study of literature opens many doors to employment. Writing book is just one of them. It would be nice if all were expected to write a book as a top of for the qualification. AS for me, it took well into 4 decades before I wrote my first line towards a book. In the interim I was busy doodling around with words. Thanks for the question. ",

            "answer_text": "I double majored in English and Theatre. At no time in my life have I even considered writing a book and most certainly never a play. I briefly flirted with the idea of being a journalist, but ultimately decided it was not for me. However, I was quite content to use my degrees to teach high school English where I did my best to instill an enjoyment of literature and an understanding of the way it holds a mirror up to our society. A few years ago, I got my Master\u2019s in school library and Information technology, so that I can continue to help kids enjoy reading, just in a different way. ",
