            "answer_text": "Hi if you are using WordPress you can use the Akismet Anti-Spam Plugin that was built and maintained by the same people behind WordPress - Automattic. The plugin goes by the name Akismet Anti-Spam. How is Akismet better than other WordPress plugins for anti-spam? Well, it maintains a global database of spammers. Remember when we said you are not the only one who receives spam comments, every other blogger receives their fair share of spam comments every day.  It makes all the more sense, doesn't it? No spammer will narrow their domain by targeting your website only. They will try to increase their reach. But little do they know this practice can be used against them. Once we have a global database, every website that has Akismet Anti-pam on its website will be safe from the global spammers registered on its database. This plugin automatically checks all comments and filters out the ones that look suspicious. Moreover, it places a status history against each comment, you can see misleading links hidden with the comment, you can block the worst spammers using the outright discarding feature. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Nicolas, Thanks for requesting me. Spam comments can definitely be an annoyance. Often people turn off comments altogether to avoid being bombarded by spam comments. Other people turn off comments after just a month which is an option for you too. Most comments come in inside the first month of publication. I use the Akismet spam catcher. It\u2019s a great plugin which catches hundreds of spam comments for me. The others, I delete when I get up in the morning. I trash or label them spam. Janice ",
