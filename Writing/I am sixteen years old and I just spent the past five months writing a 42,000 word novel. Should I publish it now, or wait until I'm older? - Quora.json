            "answer_text": "First of all, a 42,000 word piece is not a novel. It's called a novella and it will be very hard for you, a first time writer (in terms of publication), to find a traditional publisher willing to print it. Unless you are Ernest Hemingway reincarnated. Yet, Christopher Paolini, author of the Inheritance series, published his first book (Eragon) when he was 16. I am pretty sure there are other examples I don't know of. The thing to keep in mind is that before Knopf bought the rights to his book, he was being published by his family's indie press. So your best bet would be to find a small indie press (Beware of vanity press masquerading as an indie.) Your next option would be to self publish (online, preferably to keep costs low). Try Amazon KDP. It is currently the favoured platform for most self published writers. So now that we have explored the option of Can you publish it, let's answer your actual question, Should you publish it? The answer to that depends on only one thing: How good is your story? And by that, I mean, your story must fulfil the following things: The plot is watertight.The main character(s) and his primary supporting cast are not one dimensional. They should be more than their assigned roles. For e.g. The designated badass is allowed to have emotions and can string together thoughts other than Hulk, SmashThe characters should be their own persons and should not exist only to service the story.The writing follows basic rules of grammar. You are allowed to make a few mistakes but the lesser you make them, the more your story shines.Your story is not plagiarized, either in parts or as a whole.In case you are not sure of the above things, let a select few, trusted people read your story. Often we lose objectivity for our own work and a third person can help with that. Hire an editor to help with grammar problems(Though I suggest brushing up your basic grammar from a book. After all, why spend money on something you can do on your own). If your work fulfils all the above criteria, go for it. Query agents. If you get tired of rejection, self publish it. After all books are written to be read. Age is never a barrier or should even be considered for a creative undertaking. ",

            "answer_text": "Most stand-alone novels have a lower average of around 50,000 words, but you shouldn\u2019t be too upset at that. In my experience (as an amateur editor), the first novel-sized document you write is your official first draft. Now, I\u2019m certain you\u2019ve looked over it many times. You\u2019re confident in your ability to succeed, in your prose and style and flair. You love your characters, and you are dead certain that the public will love them, too. But you\u2019re going to rewrite it. Maybe it\u2019ll be grammatical errors here and there at first, but there are many things your need to double and triple-check before sending it to a publisher. You need to ensure all your characters stay true to their personalities, that they\u2019ll react in character to each situation you\u2019ve put them in. You need to make sure you\u2019ve filled in every plot hole. You need to be certain that you\u2019ve made the world you created as understandable to the casual reader as possible. You need to keep your writing style absolutely, 100% consistent. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen the most trouble with, even with experienced writers. When you spend months writing a book, your emotions during different moments will influence how you write, or how you make a character react that seem wildly out of sorts when you look back at it later. It\u2019s your job as the narrator to stay impartial and to let the audience draw their own conclusions. I strongly recommend getting several people to seriously read your story and give you advice. You need quite a few different points of view-almost a test audience-to ensure your book will be as understandable and engaging to as many people as possible. You cannot shy away from criticisms. You will have friends or family who don\u2019t like it, or who say an entire section or plot point needs to be changed. That is okay. You have the time and drive to improve, and their remarks are stepping stones in achieving a brilliant finished work. 42,000 words is crazy impressive for your age. But I think you can do even better. I sincerely wish you the best of luck, and hope you\u2019ll message me if you need any advice. -Lorel ",
