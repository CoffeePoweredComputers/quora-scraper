            "answer_text": "Having tutored now for 5+ years, I believe that one of the primary benefits of being a tutor is that you\u2019re really helping the parent or loved one connect positively even more with their child for the rest of his/her life. This child, if he/she has any ounce of self-reflection and analysis on his/her childhood later on in life, is going to connect even deeper with Mom and/or Dad as he/she gets older and perhaps has kids of his/her own someday. I truly feel blessed that I am increasing the odds of strengthening and improving the relationship between parent and child over time. How can a kid not be grateful for a parent who hires him/her a personal tutor to come to the house and help the kid with Math or the such? I always say that I love these kids, but I REALLY love these parents, man. Any parent who would hire a private tutor to come into their home weekly (sometimes two or three times a week) for many, many weeks, sometimes years is almost always an unbelievably amazing parent. Of course everyone is a highly-flawed human. But these parents are to be admired for their sacrifices for their children. It just so happens as well that these kids oftentimes are running around with braces on their teeth or who are getting chess or violin lessons as well. Mind you, some might posit that these kids are privileged and that tutors only work with the upper crust. No. I posit that these parents KNEW when they were very young that they were going to work diligently and sacrifice so that their kids will not want. Of course there are exceptions and there is still elitism in some circles and there are still admissions scandals and that sort of thing. But you can bet that those aren\u2019t the types of parents I\u2019ve come across. Nope. I feel very blessed that I\u2019ve come across the types of parents who understand the value of a well-rounded education, of one-on-one help, and of an outside adult who can share with their kid some of the vicissitudes of life even as we are going over the quadratic equation for the umpteenth time. And lastly, the kids; well, the kids. I truly believe that a lot of them might ignore some or even much of what I taught them. They won\u2019t use Khan Academy and/or IXL daily though I keep gently reminding them that they need to; maybe Jonny from next door doesn\u2019t need to, but THEY need to. They still don\u2019t think putting their last name on their homework or circling their Math answers or \u2014 gasp \u2014 triple-proofreading their paper before they turn it in makes a big difference in their grade. But I will remind them everyday even if I\u2019ve told them 100 times. But you know what? So what? This is my job. I am being paid to do the best job that I can for the parent, not necessarily for the kid. It\u2019s that parent. That parent who wants desperately for their kid not to be homeless strung out on crack one day with no marketable skills and no way back to the main road. I think it\u2019s paramount to remember that you are doing this for the parents. For those parents. Who are spending hundreds of dollars a month to help solve this problem. And others. For their kid. Thousands. But for each kid\u2026Well, you have to let them know what the world has in store for them. That we live in a real marketplace. Not a metaphor. A real one. With REAL people competing for that college you want to get into (or not), that job you desperately want (or at least that paycheck), that house or apartment you desperately want to live in or buy, that girl or that boy who you want to be with or marry, and the list goes on and on. And then at the very, very least, you know in your heart of hearts that you told them the truth. Life isn\u2019t always fair. It\u2019s tough. But it\u2019s amazing. And yes, it\u2019s tougher if you\u2019re stupid. Academically. And in terms of discernment (a topic I discuss regularly with each pupil at any age). And hopefully, maybe wayyyy down the road, they will come to a cross-roads and maybe, just mayyyybe\u2026just one thing of the many that you shared many years ago might help him/her make the right decision that helps his/her life trajectory. Being a tutor is a huge responsibility and also quite a privilege. To go from perfect stranger to many times a friend of the family for at least a few months and sometimes years is a real gift. This is something that needs to be valued by someone who is humble and hard-working, but also tough and honest with the kid. And of course with the parent. And it doesn\u2019t hurt if you bring some cool stuff every now and then even if the kid does ignore you half the time. Because, after all, weren\u2019t we all a bit selfish and naive when we were young? Quite possibly, indeed. ",

            "answer_text": "Will depend a bit based on the model of tutoring you\u2019re doing, but there are many benefits. Reinforce Your Knowledge Tutoring will help reinforce the knowledge you know. Nothing makes you understand a concept more than having to explain it to someone else in a way that makes sense to their brain. Since everyone\u2019s brains are different, you\u2019ll also need to find new ways of explaining concepts and making it engaging, meaning that you\u2019ll perfect your expertise in those areas. If you\u2019re really driven, you can also use tutoring as a way to re-learn and teach some concepts. When I first started tutoring, I hated math as a student and avoided it like the plague. After a little while, I learned I could build more security into my income by adding in some math because it was in such high demand. So, I began re-teaching myself all the concepts and it\u2019s one of the things I spend the most time doing these days at all levels (and I\u2019ve come to love it). Flexibility Tutoring is an extremely flexible business and can be a great way to add some extra income outside of your primary job (or as a full time gig like I do). The most flexibility comes from working as an online tutor, though you can get a lot of flexibility as an in-person tutor and maybe brick and mortar (depending on how they do things). Depending on the age range of students you see (and where in the world), you can find students to work with at any time. When I was just starting, I used to tutor home schooled kids and college students in the mornings, public school students in the afternoons, and kids across time zones online at night to really squeeze the most out of it. At the same time, I control my schedule, so if there\u2019s a day I don\u2019t want to work, I just block it off or tell clients I\u2019ll be unavailable. Naturally, you still need to work with them to adjust so that you\u2019re not leaving them behind while you rest (or whatever you\u2019re using the time for), but clients are very willing to work with you and your schedule. Help Others I think this is obvious, but one of the greatest things about tutoring is the ability to help others achieve their goals. I chose to get into tutoring partially because I wanted to work with individuals on a longer time frame towards achieving something important to them. You can help make a real difference in people\u2019s lives as you prepare students for tests to get into their dream colleges, reinforce concepts and build a good educational foundation for younger students, and help adults train for certifications for a career change, promotion, and more. You Can Literally Tutor In Anything As long as you have a skill that people want to learn, you can be a tutor. When most people think \u201ctutor,\u201d then tend to think school and academics, but the field really extends to any non-traditional instruction. My company focuses on the former, but you could be a tutor for teaching people how to hit the perfect notes while singing too (probably referred to as a coach but same thing). Easy To Start One of the reasons people get into tutoring is because it\u2019s an easy way to start earning money. If you have the knowledge, you have demand for it. You likely have the tools you need to get started - either a computer and internet for online or a car for in-person. Alternatively, you can also have clients come to you if you prefer. Getting started as a tutor can be extremely low cost. It Gets Easier Over time, as you tutor and build up a client base, it gets easier to maintain your business. Clients that work with you may need your help for years (especially if you do a variety of subjects) and will recommend you to their friends if you make them your fans. That means less time spent selling to maintain the same level of income as time goes on. Additionally, if you\u2019re intentional about it, you\u2019ll find ways to be more efficient as your knowledge grows. ",
