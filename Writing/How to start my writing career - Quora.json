            "answer_text": "You are more likely to be struck by lightning than to be able to make a living at writing from the very beginning. When you start, you will suck. No one has ever been a good writer without writing about a million words of crap first. You have to learn how to write well by writing a lot and studying writing. This will take years. Of all of the members of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, only about 10% make a living from writing. Only about half of the ones making a living from writing are making a living from writing fiction exclusively. The odds are worse than that for screenplay writing. Get a day job that doesn\u2019t suck; there is nothing harder to do than to sit down to write after a day so exhausting that your brain has turned off. This is the job you are going to be having for a while, so make sure it\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t make you want to open a vein rather than go to work. If you are really serious about wanting to make a living from writing, decide, right now, what the minimum amount you can live on is, because that is probably what you\u2019ll be doing for years and years. Learn how to make and stick to a strict budget. If you are really serious about wanting to make a living from writing, you will be sacrificing your social life. You will not be able to play games, hang with friends, go out for drinks, go to the movies, watch the Big Game, or watch television, much less binge. You will be writing every hour before or after work (some people write better when they first get up, some write better after work) and every weekend, or whatever free days you have. There is an entire 10 year swath of popular culture I know nothing about, because that is what I was doing. You will be ready to quit that day-job and try full-time writing when you have five published books or screenplays that someone else paid you for, each one has paid better than the last, you have contracts in hand for three more books or screenplays, and you have a year and a half of expenses in the bank. Why the bank account? Because shit goes wrong, and without that cushion you could wind up unable to keep the lights on. You might decide that you can\u2019t do all of that. That\u2019s fine. Remember what I just said, only ten percent of most writers write full time for a living. There\u2019s no shame in being part of the ninety percent. ",

            "answer_text": "I would start by reading Stephen King's excellent \"On Writing.\" It's about the best guide book out there for aspiring writers. You should know that the business side of writing is always tough no matter what level you're at. What improves over time is your craft. The best writers are voracious readers. Also, you have to write every day. Hobbyists wait around for inspiration to strike but professionals can't afford such a luxury. Another reason you must write every day: good days of writing often result from previous good days when you're on a roll, but they can also result from a bad day of writing when everything feels clunky and expository and your output is low. Unfortunately, good days never come from a previous day of not writing. Essentially, writing is like a muscle and requires constant exercise (or exorcise!) and training.  When you've had a good day, stop a page before you complete the chapter or scene. Leave that section for tomorrow so you can pickup where you left off and start on roll. Early on, I attended many writers' groups that were invaluable to the process. Don't worry about someone else stealing your ideas because everyone in the room is secretly thinking their ideas are brilliant and yours are less so. I also had a system of five trusted readers to vet a script or manuscript. Three is too few opinions and seven is too many. Odd numbers are better for tie-breaker purposes when you're looking for people to weigh in on a specific story element. Finally, the essence of professional writing is rewriting. I've been involved with projects that required dozens of drafts before they appeared on screen. Agents, publishers, producers or studio executives will be looking to see how you handle receiving notes for these rewrites. Even the worst comments and suggestions I've received usually resulted from a structural flaw in the story. Finally, if you sublimate your ego in the service of the work, you can accomplish wonderful things and other creatives will want to collaborate with you.  Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Writing professionally can be both exciting and rewarding. However, it is important to realize that writing for a living can be a challenging career choice. The options for professional writers are numerous and varied, but all require extensive knowledge and skills, as well as years of actual writing experience. Anyone seriously considering the life of a professional writer must answer the following questions for themselves: What style of writing am I best at and who will hire me to do it? Do I need a formal education in writing to succeed? How do I showcase my talents to potential employers or clients? Do I want to work at home as a freelancer or do I prefer a more traditional employment environment?Following things to be considered before pursuing a career in writing. THINK ABOUT YOUR SPECIALTY:Probably no other profession offers more career options than writing. The variety of career paths available for a professional writer is almost limitless. Choosing the right one requires an honest assessment of one\u2019s specific talents, creativity and skills. Not all professional writers are novelists. In fact, the vast majority of professionals make a living writing non-fiction for businesses or publications. Some of the most popular and lucrative writing fields include: Article WritersNewspapers, magazines or websites hire article writers to research and pen short, nonfiction pieces on specific topics. Some writers specialize in subjects such as food, travel, politics, local issues and more. Article writers may be employed as staff writers or work as freelancers.CopywritersCopywriters write copy, that is, text for commercial advertisements and other marketing-related materials. Copywriters must be able to write concisely, holding the attention of a potential customer, leading to the purchase of the subject product or service. Copywriters receive no personal credit, but the best writers work consistently and for good pay.JournalistsNewspapers, magazines and online services may hire journalists to investigate and report on people or events. Journalists must be able to write quickly, effectively and meet deadlines.Nonfiction Book WritersNonfiction book writers typically work with book publishers or other businesses on freelance or contract basis. They often write general-knowledge or technical books on an almost limitless range of subjects. Nonfiction book writing often, but not always, requires the author to possess specialized knowledge of the subject field. This is particularly true for technical writers. Nonfiction book writers are rarely members of a writing staff, but instead are hired to write one book at a time.Other writing categories include translators, screenwriters, reviewers, speechwriters, columnists and game writers. And, of course, novelists. PURSUE A FORMAL EDUCATION:A formal education is not required to be a professional writer, although a solid degree in a writing-related discipline can hold tremendous value. Completing college-level coursework at the post-secondary level helps to hone writing skills. Writers seeking a formal education should consider degree programs in English, the humanities or creative writing on both the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s levels. Quality, fully-accredited degree programs are available at most reputable colleges and universities in the United States, as well as online. Most colleges have school newspapers and magazines where students can research, write and publish stories and articles. Many schools also offer internships in cooperation with local newspapers, magazines and advertising agencies. WRITE ON SPEC AND COMPILE A PORTFOLIO:The key to improving your writing and getting hired as a professional is to write. It is unlikely that someone is going to hire a writer without any previous experience or presentable work. Therefore, most aspiring writers begin writing in their chosen area on \u201cspec,\u201d that is, for no pay or certainty that their work will be published. Spec writers can (and should) shop their completed work around in the hope that someone will purchase it, but it is more likely that a quality spec piece will lead to being hired to write something new. GET AN AGENT OR MANAGER:One of the biggest hurdles for a writer, particularly a novelist or screenwriter, to overcome is finding a publisher or producer to read his or her work. In many cases, publishers and producers refuse to read any material that is not submitted to them through an agent or manager. Unfortunately, getting an agent to read your work can be tough without a little know-how. Therefore, if you have a personal connection to an agency, use it. If not, start by sending out query letters either by email or traditional mail. Never submit your novel or screenplay with your query, but only when you are asked to by the agent. And never submit any material until you are confident it is of professional quality. If you think that a career in writing is a good match for you, you may be curious as to what kind of salary to expect. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics America, the median annual wage for authors and writers was $55, 940 in 2012. Income amounts vary depending on the type of writing position. Technical writers tend to earn the highest salaries. Freelance writers are usually responsible for paying their own health insurance and pension. ",

It\u2019s a possibility that no decent amount of people will ever read it, let alone like it, period. Once you\u2019ve made peace with this fact, you\u2019re ready to write. The second step is simple: Write. It doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re writing, but practice. Set a goal for yourself with regards to the amount of writing. If you write screenplays, commit to writing one page a day towards an established story or perhaps brainstorming one new concept. The same with novels, or perhaps one blog post a day, so on and so forth. Even conservatively, let\u2019s say that 80% of it is crap, 15% of it is passable, 4% of it is good, and 1% of it is gold. Once you\u2019re used to churning out material, you can find that golden yarn, identify it, and tug on it a little further. Perhaps it\u2019s a certain tone, a certain approach, or a particular idea you think is golden. Find it through practicing, and then pursue it. The third step: Share. While the only guaranteed fulfillment is that of pursuing your own creative ends, ultimately we all want to be able to share our creative visions with others. Share your work with family, friends, coworkers, strangers on the internet, whoever. You have only seen a small portion of the human experience, and reinterpreting your own work through the lens of others can actually provide for a more meaningful work. It\u2019s painful and personal, but it\u2019s crucial. Lars Ulrich of Metallica, who is not the traditional paradigm of creativity I realize, once had a very helpful point to make with creativity. In crafting songs, it was never a singular process from start to finish. The best songs the band had crafted were analogous to a match of tennis. Somebody has an idea and \u2018serves\u2019 it, spurring creativity in somebody else who returns it, and this process continues ad infinitum. The process is different for everybody, but find somebody to share the process with. The fourth step: Tweak. You\u2019re probably feeling differently about your original work, good. Don\u2019t scrap it, save it. But start creating iterations of it. Writing something final can often feel like a dark room where one has to stumble around to find the furniture. Over time, you can eventually start to feel out the locations of the major pieces and assemble an accurate picture of the whole. While having a broad mindset and juggling projects may actually be helpful to the process at previous points, during this step I would recommend a monomaniacal approach. Laser in to what the essence of your story is, what do you have to leave in to keep the core of the piece and what can you remove? This process of tweaking helps you identify the purpose and thusly refine it. Wash, rinse, and repeat prior steps 2, 3, and 4. The fifth step (optional): Business The art of pitching, making connections, and so forth is beyond the scope of this post. However, without proper hustle the best stories will never get exposure. I wish I could help with this part more but I\u2019m sure there are other sections on Quora that answer this. Disclaimer: this is what I have seen interacting with other writers and what has worked the best for me with the creative process. Everybody\u2019s process is different and best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "WRITE.Then... WRITE MORE.Then... WRITE EVEN MORE! The career part comes from finding someone to pay you for writing. That is going to vary widely across the niches and fields and genres. What do you want to write, and for who? My advice is kinda structured towards feature writing, but can be interpreted to fit current news or fiction.You will want to get hugely successful, of course, but before then you have to pay your metaphorical dues. You'll have to write boring bad stuff, and you'll have to approach strangers, but as you work you'll develop a network of contacts.You should absolutely start with a writing class. Talk to your library or local educational facility. Then you'll write bad stuff that no one cares about. This might be for your class's publication, or for something you found on textbroker.com or fiverr.com or craigslist or elance. You'll start at the bottom of the food-chain, writing website filler content and ad copy that no one wants to read. This will give you good practice dealing with requirements and deadlines and research and all that. Once you've worked your way up within those sites, you'll start finding better assignments and being able to do better work. Much of this work will be ghost writing blogs. This is not really getting published - but it is selling your writing. Maybe, with some of that under your belt, you can find a blog or site that is willing to post your work under your own name. This is the lowest form of publication, so congratulations on making it this far!You can also work on your own blog. If you do this, and want to show it off, you'll need quality content, a professional look, and consistent postings. Take it seriously.Then you can find a real publication. Local newspapers and magazines, blogs and art circles in your region, and whatever else catches your eye. Send them samples of your work and tell them why they should pay you to write for them (there are often editorial points-of-contact, or submission guidelines, so be sure to follow their protocols).Work your way up the publications within your area. Start with the free local paper - then get into the daily that people actually have to pay for. Do the same with local suburb magazines, working towards the big glossy publication named after your city.Now you can start looking for regional or national work. This is where a portfolio of published work, and a network of editors, becomes important. Ask around, and show your stuff, and be willing to work hard.Good luck! Alternatively you can write something huge (expose, novel, screenplay) and try really hard to find someone to buy it, but even this will be easier if you have publication experience (for your own practice as well as for proving that you're worth their time). A network of editors and publications will help you here, too, because it'll get you in touch with people you wouldn't otherwise find, and will help you learn about various opportunities. Good luck!

            "answer_text": "When I was sixteen I was an aspiring author with a nearly-complete manuscript. I\u2019d already managed to meet several semi-famous wordsmiths at launches, signings, classes. I\u2019d been told, \u2018Write what you know!\u2019 and 'Show, don\u2019t tell!\u2019 and once, memorably, 'The road to hell is paved with adverbs.\u2019 But the very best suggestion came from a writer named Brendan Mackie. He was a dishevelled but fresh-faced hippie-type with a faint North American accent, often found performing poetry at indie music festivals held in vacant dance studios. He\u2019d usually be sandwiched on the program between a teenage ska band and an acapella hip hop group. His words\u2014and the passion with which he recited them\u2014always left the audience spellbound. I sometimes saw him selling monochromatic hand-photocopied and stapled books of his poems on street-corners around Canberra. I was at the launch of Mackie\u2019s first book of short stories\u2014Lonely In Crowds\u2014which had proper binding and an actual publisher\u2019s name on the spine. I was awed. This was somehow more impressive than the work of the famous writers I had met, who presumably had decades of grooming at posh universities in New York or Paris. Brendan Mackie was a guy not much older than me. We lived in the same town. We had been to some of the same schools. How had he done this? After the speeches, I approached him and asked for advice. How could I become him? 'Well, first, you gotta join a writers centre,\u2019 he said. Before I heard those words, I hadn\u2019t known writers centres existed. (I suspect many aspiring authors don\u2019t.) Perhaps this is because they are usually not-for-profits, scraping by on tiny budgets and using every dollar to provide services to their members rather than to advertise themselves. Or maybe it\u2019s because writers\u2014including me, these days\u2014like to pretend that they are naturally gifted rather than taught. I wish more authors were like Mackie. We are constantly asked for advice, and 'Join a writers centre\u2019 is the most useful thing we could possibly say. It\u2019s more practical than 'Write what you know\u2019 or 'Use the active voice\u2019 because a writers centre will teach them those things, and more. Writers centres provide workshops, manuscript assessments, mentorships, researcher accommodation. They provide a place for writers to research books, launch them, or just hang out and critique one another\u2019s work. A university will charge you $20,000 for a creative writing degree. A writers centre will charge you $65 dollars a year, and any profits will be spent helping other writers. Last I heard, Brendan Mackie was teaching English in Istanbul. I hope his students know how lucky they are. Yes, I still have my battered copy of Lonely In Crowds. No, you can\u2019t borrow it. ",

            "answer_text": "Back in 2017, I saw a friend talking about freelancing and I was baffled. Back then, I didn\u2019t know what freelancing was, or how people made money from it. The concept was totally new to me, and thankfully I\u2019ve learned about it then. At first, I didn\u2019t know what to do, nor how to start. I didn\u2019t know what to search, nor what talent I had. My mind was completely blank, and that\u2019s how it was for about 2 months. Then I decided to start translating, a month after, I realized translating wasn\u2019t for me and I turned to writing. Writing just seemed to come naturally to me, and so I started freelance writing. At first, I was freelance writing part-time, but then, I gradually started writing more and now that I finished studies, I\u2019m finally able to work full-time. But, I\u2019m going to be completely honest, it wasn\u2019t easy to start freelancing. It wasn\u2019t easy to land jobs, and get people to hire me at first. Every time I applied for a job, I\u2019d get asked if I had any experience, and every time the answer was the same. I didn\u2019t have a lot of experience back then, I still didn\u2019t have any articles published in my name, and I still wasn\u2019t popular. So, it was quite hard to start a writing career from scratch. But that didn\u2019t stop me and look where I am at now. So, you\u2019re probably wondering the same. You\u2019ve probably wondered how to start a writing career once too many time but still didn\u2019t get the answer. And I\u2019m here to finally show you how. How To Start A Writing Career Starting a writing career isn\u2019t all sunshine and good vibes. It can be quite hectic at first as a lot of people would want examples of your writing skills and proof that you\u2019re a good writer. Some will want to pay you peanuts for long-format articles and for even eBooks, and some will want free article tests. Some won\u2019t like your work, and some will tell you that you\u2019re better off without writing. What\u2019s important is that you remind yourself day after day of why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. There are going to be a lot of downs, but also a lot of ups that will help you with the pain. So, now that I\u2019m done speaking like a coach, let\u2019s get to the \u201chow to start a writing career\u201d question. I\u2019m going to give you access to a number of steps which you\u2019ll have to follow one by one if you want to become a writer. So, here goes nothing. Step Number 1: Specialize Or Generalize A lot of bloggers wonder if they should specialize or generalize, and honestly, you should ask yourself that question as well. A general writer is a good way to start before you find out what you like writing about. It\u2019s also a great way to make income on the short and long term, a lot of writers choose to stay general writers even after long years of experience. But I personally recommend specializing. A lot of people will hire a specialized writer than a general writer any day. That\u2019s because specialized writers know what they\u2019re doing and what they\u2019re talking about, unlike general ones who have to do research. They also know what tone and what things to say, and that is why specialized writers are paid better than general writers. Although the opportunities for work are not as many as the one general writers have, you can still make a full income of specialized writing. Step Number 2: Build A Portfolio A lot of other bloggers will ask you to start applying for jobs but I\u2019m going to say wait. First, you\u2019ll have to build a portfolio. A portfolio is the first thing clients are going to ask you about. You\u2019ll need to have examples of your writings ready by the time the clients ask you or even by the time you apply to your first job. To build a portfolio from scratch, it\u2019ll be quite easy. Here are all the things you should do: Create pieces of writing from your own imagination.Rewrite existing articles.Criticize pieces that already exist out there.Enhance pieces that already exist out there.By doing this, you\u2019ll have a rich portfolio that you can show your fist client. Having a portfolio, even if is only filled with samples written on \u201cgoogle doc\u201d, will make you seem more professional than those new writers who don\u2019t. Step Number 3: Research Your Potential Clients\u2019 Needs This is something I do when I have quite some free time on my hand. What I do is go to writing forums or subreddits and see what potential clients say. I take a look at what they\u2019re saying, I analyze their needs, I see their past experiences with freelance writers, and I build a base of information from there. I try to find out how I can enhance my writing skills based on their experiences and opinions. I also take a look at what they like to see on cover letters, on resumes, and on portfolios. I apply all of these tips on the next job application I do, and I usually get amazing results. Step Number 4: Start Applying For Jobs If you do all of this, then you\u2019re ready for the next step of how to start a writing career. And it\u2019s applying for jobs. If you created a portfolio, learned what potential clients expect from you, and have chosen a niche or two, then you can easily start looking for jobs. Look for all the job opportunities that exist either on: Freelance writing sites like ContenaFreelance platforms like UpworkSocial mediaCold pitchingLinkedInThese platforms will help you find a job even as a beginner and will help you build a successful writing career slowly, but steadily. Step Number 4: Start Building Your Experience If you start applying for jobs, then you can finally start building your experience. It\u2019s not going to be easy at first, but it\u2019s going to be worth it. What helped me improve in writing is mainly my job experiences. I had clients that have helped me learn new things about new domains including SEO. I had clients help me enhance my writing skills. I had clients that have made my work get published, and so on. So, the best thing that can help you become a professional writer, is to get jobs. ..Read More. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what kind of writer - ghostwriter, journalist, copywriter, poet, non-fiction writer, fiction writer? All those paths are slightly different. That said, as somebody with a side business of fiction writing, I found three factors very helpful: acquiring the skills, actually doing it (versus talking about it), and doing a lot of it for a long time (aka consistency). The skills will allow you to produce text that people want to read and pay for. There are many writers who already fail at this hurdle. Writing is a pretty complex set of skills, and you learn it by observation, trial and error, and feedback (from editors and/or mentors). Actually doing it will set you apart from all the people talking about writing - the \u201cI have a book in me\u201d crowd. Yeah, I have one (or a hundred) in me to, but the difference is I\u2019m actually letting it out. Which means sitting down and spending hundreds of hours on talking to people that never existed except in my head and agonizing over whether I should trash chapter 4 or where I can tell the story the way I see/hear/feel it. And yes, that can mean getting up early, not going out with friends every day, and not watching all the content on Netflix, because I\u2019ll be up in my study, working. Then, one book won\u2019t (likely) change your life. Careers are built on doing it all year, every year, just like a job in the office. I aim to write 3 new novels a year, and I have about 70 stories written so far, not all of which are still available, but they all earn me a little every month, leading to a second income over time.

There are lots of ways to do this \u2014 it can be really useful to set yourself a challenge of writing a certain amount every day (there are tools that help you do this, like 750 Words - Write every day. and others), and the act of just sitting down and making yourself write, whatever it says, however it reads, will help more than anything else I can think of. I started my writing career by having a blog, and sitting down and writing endless amounts about the most boring things that happened to me that day. That was how I found my voice though, just writing and writing and not caring if anyone was reading. There comes a point though where you have to learn how to edit that \u2014 to give feedback to others, and to receive feedback on how you can do better. Be prepared at some point to give what you have to someone you admire and ask for their feedback \u2014 ask them to give you things that you can work on though, not nit-picking, but broad constructive advice is always better structured as \u201ctell me what you\u2019d like to hear more about, and where I lost your interest, because that\u2019s a good indicator of what isn\u2019t working.\u201d But mainly?

Try to fill out one journal per month - write down words you like, diary entries, poems, prose, fragments of conversations you hear on the commute to work, memories you never want to forget, your dreams \u2026 Take time to write every day. Become it. If you haven\u2019t already, set up a blog or website, get your name and work out there. Attend poetry readings, maybe even reach out and see if there\u2019s any local coffee shops, theatres etc that would let you share your work. Send your poetry, prose or script into local competitions too, anything to get yourself noticed. Education-wise, it is really helpful to take classes at a university. Of course many writers haven\u2019t done this, can\u2019t do this (financial reasons) and of course it isn\u2019t vital. But for example, I am in the UK and we get student loans so I have been able to attend uni. The university I am graduating from has a lot of ties with local establishments and agencies, and there\u2019s a lot of professional writers who can guide you. I am applying for the masters in creative writing as I too would like to pursue a career in writing. A lot of it is word of mouth so it\u2019s important to try to mix in with the poetry / prose community, even if this isn\u2019t through the uni route. It\u2019s really difficult to get yourself out there and it takes a lot of confidence but as said and quoted from The Rocky Horror Picture Show: \u201cDon\u2019t dream it, be it\u201d Best of luck ",

            "answer_text": "First, figure out what genre you want to write in: i.e. Drama, fiction. Sci-fi, fantasy, Romance, etc, etc. Then discover or develop a style of writing and your own voice. Figure out whether your writing material is more message driven or experience driven, or about raising awareness to issues that you believe so strongly in that your audience needs to know about it. Following this, do your best to avoid cliched writing: i.e. writing stories that have already been told before, because more often than not, new writers end up taking the easy way out and believe that what they are writing is unique and will get famous for this, which is simply not true. A perfect example of this is writing the typical boy meets girl story with what is perceived to be a different angle when it isn\u2019t. Before you even write down a single word down on a piece of white paper, ask yourself, is your idea unique enough for your audience to be vested in? Is your idea commercially viable (if you are serious about writing and want to make a career out of it)? Practice writing. The more you write, the better you get at the craft of creative writing. Improve on what you have already written, because you don\u2019t simply write once and be done with that particular written works. When you submit for feedback, the reader (be it a friend or a stranger), he or she will let you know what he/she doesn\u2019t understand or when they point out problems in what you have written. The key to successful writers is to keep writing and improving on what you\u2019ve previously written until you get it right. When you get the worn out advice of: \u201cwrite what you know\u201d, question it. You really should be writing what you don\u2019t know that interests you or something that inspired you that you don\u2019t know much about. This will encourage you to go out and do some research it. And finally, join a writers group of some sort that is established in your area. It doesn\u2019t have to be well established, but a group that you find and or feel will give you useful feedback and encourages quality writing while cherishing your creativity. You don\u2019t want to sacrifice either the way the producers in big business may want you to. Be creative and always strive to put out quality work or your best foot forward as another saying goes.

            "answer_text": "I want to eventually pursue a career in writing. How should I start? Hmmm \u2026 what kind of writing? Journalism \u2014 i.e. nonfiction articles and reporting? Novels of fiction? Instructional material? Without specifics in your question, you will not get specific answers. The \u201cuneducated natural\u201d is a fiction created to support entertaining stories. The ignorant NEVER perform well. As with all careers, you therefore start by obtaining the right kind of education. Have you taken any writing courses? Have you sufficiently mastered the language in which you hope to publish? After all, words are the tools you use to create a work of art. Knowing the mechanics of writing and how one constructs the type of writing that interests you is a good beginning. Be aware that the writing courses that teach you to write for actual publishing are rare. You will still have much to learn. Beyond that, it is a matter of practice and getting up that learning curve. Get up the learning curve. Write about what you know (or it won\u2019t be credible). Write, write, and write some more. Create a work and then set it aside for at least a month. Then maybe you can evaluate it more objectively and see it from the reader\u2019s perspective instead of the writer\u2019s perspective. Critique it, then revise it, or trash it and start over. Learn to eliminate all the words you can while still making your point. I am not a fan of writers\u2019 workshops. Skip them, as they are full of other junior writers who create questionable critiques \u2014 a case of the blind leading the blind. Once you have something that satisfies you, submit it to appropriate publishing companies. Web based publishing is more open to unknown and junior authors, so start there. Learn to abide by their stylistic requirements. Especially at first, the responses to your submissions will be nothing at all or the occasional rejection slip. Be prepared for a lot of rejection slips. Some will come with an editor\u2019s critique. Pay close attention to those critiques and take what they say to heart. Use them to improve your writing and make it more targeted for publishing. That\u2019s the learning curve. Eventually, you\u2019ll have your first acceptance (which will probably come with a list of things the editor wants you to change) \u2014 then your career is off and running and then you will really improve by leaps and bounds. Finally, do all this while planning a parallel career in another field. The sad fact is that few writers today can make enough money from writing to support themselves. Even then, those who live on writing income have written for decades and receive residuals from a large body of published works. Unless you become a writing superstar (and there are only a handful in the world), writing will never do more than supplement your income. Knowing all this, if you still want to be a writer then good on you! The world needs more good writers. Writers pave the way. In nonfiction, they sew words upon the fields of society to illuminate the human condition, lead us to clarity, and help us understand what is right and what is wrong with the civilization we have built. Only with understanding can we make it better. In fiction, they provide the imagination and inspiration to do what we have never done before. If this is you, then lead on, new writer! ",

            "answer_text": "Write a lot. Practice makes perfect! You don\u2019t have to have a complete idea to get started either. You can start off with short blog articles or short stories. This can help you get an idea what genre and topics you\u2019re interested in. Maybe you\u2019ll find that even though you love urban fantasy, your work will steer toward sci-fi. Writing whatever comes to your mind is a great way to figure out who you are as a writer\u2014your interests, your narrative style, your voice. Don\u2019t be afraid to write. You might be afraid to pick up the pen because you think you\u2019ll suck. That\u2019s okay. Every single first draft sucks. And along those lines, don\u2019t be afraid to edit either. Once you start getting the hang of writing, you might go back to earlier pieces and thing \u201cwow, this is awful, it needs a complete overhaul\u201d and that\u2019s perfectly okay\u2014in fact, it\u2019s great, because it shows you\u2019ve improved as a writer! So don\u2019t be afraid to start and suck at it, because it\u2019s the first step toward getting better at something. The only truly bad first draft is one that is blank. Read crafting books and articles. These will help you learn how to craft a novel or an article or whatever type of writing it is you\u2019re interested in. Just for the sake of this answer, I\u2019ll stick with novels. Anyone can slap together a story and call it a day, but some of the crucial things that make a story work are structure, and character and plot arcs. Of course this is a gross oversimplification\u2014as a writer, we do a lot of fiddly bits behind the scenes that readers never actually see. I know writers who will outline, who will create extensive chapter maps, who will set goals in their books to make sure they hit the inciting incident 5% into their novel, if not sooner. All these are tools that the writer uses, but not necessarily something that the reader will ever see. Do your homework. Whatever you choose to write, whether it\u2019s fiction or non-fiction, do your homework. If it\u2019s non-fiction, then obviously do a ton of research. For fiction, it may depend on the genre, but generally, most fiction books will also require a certain degree of homework. Sci-fi, in particular. You don\u2019t want to sink hours and hours into developing a virus for you world only to find out that that isn\u2019t actually how viruses work at all and you have to change some critical elements and upend all that work. If you decide to include characters from marginalized/minority backgrounds, do your homework. Find out everything you possibly can about the group your character comes from, and if you\u2019re able to, find authenticity readers\u2014real life people from those groups who can read your work and tell you if you\u2019re getting the details right. Don\u2019t write alone. Writing sounds like it\u2019s probably a solitary activity, but in fact there are tons of communities where writers can support one another. Look for local groups in your town, or if you can\u2019t, there are tons of online communities you can join. Wattpad, for one, is a great place to host your work if you\u2019re looking for light feedback and to bond with other authors who are also just starting out (mostly.) Look for critique partners\u2014I actually found mine through Twitter. They can turn a critical eye on your manuscript and point out areas where they feel you need improvement. Together, you can all help each other improve and hopefully land one of those ever elusive publishing deals. Read. Kind of in-line with the crafting books, but this is just advice to read broadly. Read in your genre, read outside your genre. And when you read, don\u2019t just passively absorb the story\u2014study the book\u2019s structure and characters and voice. Once you start writing and learning the craft, you\u2019ll be able to pick out how other authors are putting their stories together. You\u2019ll be able to see xyz motivates a character, and how that motivation fuels them to reach their goal, despite the conflicts that stand in the way. You\u2019ll notice when act I ends and act II begins. You\u2019ll be able to figure out exactly where the inciting incident occurs and why it is that particular scene that kicks off the story and not some other. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. Hi there, The original stated question was - that you can write, so how do you start your career. I\u2019m not sure I can give a decent answer, considering I\u2019m beginning the journey myself. Just to share my thoughts and experiences, once you\u2019re done with drafting and editing, you begin the process of submitting your work if opting for traditional publishing or putting it up for publishing as ebook if your opting for the self-publishing route. Do check the answer below, it contains useful insights. Indra Neel's answer to What is the procedure of writing & publishing a book for a fresher, and how does one become a writer? How do they start? Does anyone one have any tips on writing, and tips on English grammar? Here imho, it is important to keep your writing career relevant. A harsh truth being, you don\u2019t really have a market value and this is where you start building one. Write free stories. Wattpad is a great option to explore. There are others too. A very very small factor depends on how your luck clicks. My earnest suggestion would be don\u2019t gamble on this by thinking you\u2019ll end up with a zillion sales. I\u2019m unaware of how other writers approach this, but I individually focus on the marketing aspect too. For my present book, I\u2019m keeping a minimum sales target of 2000\u20133000 units spread over a 12-month period. That means 200\u2013250 books/month on an average = 50-odd books/week = 7\u20138 books being sold daily. The daily and weekly sales are what one needs to crack. That\u2019s critical, again imho. There maybe tough periods, so you\u2019ll need to be prepared. There could be a month long period with no sales or maybe even months. The best way, if you\u2019re not keen on spending money is, interact and develop a reader base who like your work. You can also explore how to develop and utilise a street team:  Go through her (Jenna Moreci) videos (Suggestion: Ignore the way she speaks. It\u2019s what she says that\u2019s more important). So summarily, with respect to the answer, this is more of a post-writing things-to-do suggestion for beginners. Don\u2019t stop at one book. Write as much as you can. Give yourself a 4\u20135 year period to get established. If it\u2019s not clicking or working for you, try reassessing your style, market/readers base, genre selection. Track your sales, this is important if you\u2019re starting out on your own. A suggestion would be to keep-up a good engagement with your readers. More than anything else, listen to what they have to say by the way of feedback. Do not disregard them, as they are the ones that are responsible for your livelihood as a writer. A Summarized List SubmissionsInteraction with readers + Networking*Marketing. (Here, I\u2019d like to suggest, have a blog at least, if not a website and a blog. Quora does have a blogging option.)Street TeamSalesIt\u2019s an inter-connected life-cycle. *Attend as many writing-related events, i.e - book-fests, participate in writing contests. Any publicity is good. Good Luck and Don\u2019t Give Up ! ",

But don\u2019t write just about everything. Find out what interests you the most, and write about it. You can deviate from your niche occasionally but try to stick to it.  For example, I love to work on travel articles and tech too, so I put only those blog posts on my website - The Lazy Writer. Rest of my articles are posted in different accounts like Medium and LinkedIn. Now, when you have something to show off. LinkedIn has been pretty helpful to me to find clients who need freelance writers. You can find clients on other social media websites too but remember, it takes time. You know, one of my friends got a writing project because of a Zomato review she wrote. Some hungry CEO liked her writing skills and talked her into working for a one-time project. So, explore everything you can. Back when I started about 2 years ago, I used my Tripadvisor reviews as samples to apply for travel writing projects. :D I got a one-time website content project after a tour operator read my Andaman travel diary on my website. So, expose yourself. My LinkedIn connections have helped me a lot, recommending me to clients if I seem fit. I present myself as a Tech and Travel writer who puts a splash of humour in whatever he writes. :) I hope this is helpful. By the way, check this out too. Might be of some help - Grab the chance\u2026 and write! Regards, The Lazy Writer ",

Check if you can deliver on such jobs. If yes, go to next step. Otherwise, train yourself to gain the confidence to deliver such jobs. If you are sure you can manage writing projects, set up your LinkedIn profile, talk with your network, and sign up on freelancing websites (and bid on projects) to spread the word that you are in business.

Post once a week on things that interest you. Try to find a niche. Share your content to social media. See what kind of response you get. This lets you practice your writing in a tangible way, to a real audience, who will hopefully give you real feedback. It also lets you practice digital marketing, which has become essential for any budding writer, regardless of if you want to be an author, a poet, a journalist or even a technical writer. Everybody needs a portfolio. Everybody needs practice. Everybody needs a commitment. Starting your own blog, either through Medium, Wordpress or elsewhere: it\u2019s the best place to start. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way is to learn your craft. Start out small and work up. The man on top of the mountain didn\u2019t just fall there. Things take time. If you wanted to fly a plane, what would you do? You'd find a ground school and take lessons. If you wanted to play the piano, what would you do? You'd find a piano teacher and take classes. What makes writing any different? Writing is an art, but it\u2019s a learned art. To ask someone how to write a story is like asking \u201cHow do I climb a mountain?\u201d You don\u2019t, unless you\u2019ve had the training. And no, it\u2019s not rocket science, but writing is something that needs to be studied and practiced. Anybody can sit down and write crap. You see it all the time in self pubbed books. Most people will tell you to just start writing, and keep writing, but I don't agree. It's not enough to just write every day if you don't know what you're doing or how to improve something. That just means days and weeks and months of useless writing. It's like not knowing how to knit so you just keep making loops with the yarn. You can't get better, you can't turn that into a scarf ... you have the desire, but you don't know how. I'm going to give you my stock answer that I give everyone who asks me this question. I'm going to give you some good advice on how to learn the craft, and give you a place to send in some of your work when you're ready. In order to write stories that people want to read you will need to understand how to put one together. There is a definite pattern and rhythm to it. And there are certain expectations from the editors and publishing houses as to how your story is laid out. You will need a good imagination, one that can look at a situation and picture all sorts of different scenarios. You need to be able to ask 'what if' and come up with twists and lines that are new and fresh. You will need to be able to research things. For example I wrote a story set in Iran where there was a wedding. I had to research how the wedding would take place, the food, the customs, common Iranian names, clothing, etc. in order to write an interesting yet correct story. Take classes in writing; grammar and punctuation (very important... lots of self published books are swimming in glaring errors and typos), character building, dialogue, plotting, pacing, point of view (POV), inner and outer conflicts, subplots, scenes and sequels, genres, story boards, twists, chapter hooks, suspense, killer opening lines, and satisfying endings. If you're going to write sci-fi you will need to take classes in world building. Each genre of book has its own set of expectations from the reader that you will need to fulfill. For example a murder mystery must have clues for the reader to try and solve. A romance needs a happen ever after ending, known to writers as an HEA. A thriller needs fast pacing and danger. There are classes in short story writing. Where to find these classes? Local community colleges often offer writing classes. My local library has classes seasonally. Best of all there are hundreds of classes you can take on-line. They run about $25-$35 each and range from 2 to 4 weeks. Google on-line writing classes and you will get lots of sites. Try www.oirwa.com or www.savvyauthors.com. They have classes year round. You don\u2019t have to join either one but if you do you get a discount on their classes. Just because a class might be about writing romances, writing is writing; many of the same principles apply to other genres. So don\u2019t hesitate to take a course on character building or writing scenes just because the site caters to romance. There are sites that offer expensive classes, so be careful. I\u2019d recommend starting with a few less expensive ones to see if you really like writing and want to continue. IMO it is not necessary to have a degree or to take an expensive course to write well. Read a lot. Get a feel for how a story is told; how it starts, how it progresses through the story to a satisfying end. See how your favorite author keeps you interested. I don't know your age, but when you are able join some writing groups, even online groups are helpful. Oftentimes these groups offer lectures and classes in writing. They share their work and critique each other. Once you start taking classes and get a good feel for how to put a story together, write some short stories (800 - 1500 words). The more you write, the better you will become. You will make new writer mistakes, we all did. But that's how you learn. I say start with short stories because they are, well short, and don't take years to complete like a novel does. You can share your stories with others and get feedback. Take the feedback and use what you feel is constructive for you and ignore the others. Some people don't give good feedback, or there is a motive behind their negative comments. You have to learn which ones to take and learn from and which ones to disregard. And when you are reading and critiquing other's stories, be kind, give good feedback, and find something positive to say to them. It's hard to hear harsh things about your writing. It's tough love. But it works when you get it and understand why the comment was made and you go and make your piece better because of it. Submitting to contests is another way to get good feedback because the judges are usually editors and agents who have their finger on the pulse of good writing that sells. Once you feel you have written a great short story, be brave and submit it to a magazine that publishes fiction in the genre you wrote. Don't worry about rejections. They will come. Oftentimes it's not because your story is not good, it's because the story doesn't fit their needs. They are running a business after all, and they pick the stories that they feel will best entertain their readers. All authors get rejections. It's part of the 'hunt'. Here\u2019s a place to start submitting. Check out their guidelines carefully. FLASH FICTION ONLINE http://flashfictiononline.com/main/submission-guidelines/ We publish stories from 500 to 1,000 words in length. They\u2019re very short, but they are still stories. That means the best ones have strong, interesting characters, plots, and (to some extent, at least) settings. We\u2019re not that concerned about genre. Many of us have a fondness for science fiction and fantasy, but we also like literary fiction; and in any case, great flash stories aren\u2019t always easily classified. If you wrote it, and you love it, then submit it. No erotica, porn, graphic sex, or violence. Pays $60 per story. Buys reprints at two cents/word. (I checked this site on 10/12/18 and it\u2019s still operating and the details are correct.) Once you are good enough to sell a few short stories, then you will have the skills to think about plotting out a whole book.

Also, every sentence you write and combine it with another sentence, and another and so on, is original, and you created it and nowhere else are those sentences strung together to form a thought like you did. Write every day. Even if you only have a minute, tell Siri to take a note, and make a few comments. Easy, 30 seconds, whatever. Also if you can\u2019t figure out what to write, just sit down at your computer and begin writing. If you truly have talent, your muse will appear and take over. I have had this happen where at 9:00 am I sit down to write, not having any idea what I am going to write, and the next thing I know it\u2019s 5:00 pm and I have written a thousand words. I have traditionally published several books but back in the day it was very, very hard to find an agent and a publisher. I was lucky enough to have found both. But today. anyone can write anything and publish it on Kindle and the knowing that you can do that will be motivational. It\u2019s hard to write when you think nobody will read it, but if you blog on your Facebook about that which you are passionate or blog on Quora you will not only get noticed, but you will get practice. Join a writer\u2019s critique group. This is important because you learn where the holes are. When you write a scene, you have a picture in your mind you are trying to convey to your readers. But if you have someone read it and say \u201cwhat does this mean?\u201d you know you need to work on it because authors cannot stand behind every reader and explain what they meant when they wrote that. Clarity from the beginning is crucial. Don\u2019t use big, multi-syllable words when simple words will do unless you feel it is absolutely necessary. Ie: My Siamese cat talks a lot. or My Siamese cat is verbose, vociferous and has a lot of opinions. You see, the second sentence conveys more of a chaotic feel. My cat talks a lot is ho hum, but if you are saying he\u2019s vociferous, you can almost feel the annoyance that may create. But then again, don\u2019t say \u201cThat was a very jejune thing to do\u201d when you can say \u201cThat was a really juvenile (childish, immature) thing to do.\u201d I hope you can recognize the nuanced difference. Also, read, read, read, read. If you\u2019re not a reader, you\u2019re not a writer. ",

This is why many people are shifting towards writing nowadays. This has increased a lot of competition in the sector and a lot of the competitors are really talented and good.

The perfect solution to this problem you are encountering here is a certification on a course related to writing. It is possible that your competitors with whom you will be competing for one vacant content writer position might also be able to acquire a certificate. So you need to acquire a certificate from a better institute with international acclaim. I have shortlisted a few institutes from which you can get a certificate like I mentioned earlier. Out of the ones I have shortlisted IIM SKILLS is better than most of the other institute as far as my opinion after the research I have done. They provide a lot of features that makes them better and the best in the industry over the last 5 years. Some of the features the course provides are: IIM SKILLS provides an internationally acclaimed certification which provides you with better recognition.The tutors of the institute are industry experts and hence you get to interact with the best of the content writers in the industry.The course can be taken online and you can also use the life time access option.Also they provide placement training and places the students with the best caliber in companies like amazon, Flipkart.They also provide internships if you are not looking for a full time job.Hope this interests you as well. If not there are other institutes you could approach to help you in starting a career in writing. UdemyEdXCourseraUrbanProAll the best!! ",

For a career in journalism, you can try the column of readers\u2019 letters first, then send in samples of articles to your preferred newspaper. In my case, I simply called up school material publishers and sent samples of my ideas and landed little fun jobs with dossiers, albeit for learning foreign languages, i.e. some parts are also grammar and vocabulary. I\u2019m not good at fiction, not like Rowling or Tolkien or London. One writer I know spends money on self-publishing, which involves quite a bit of dad\u2019s money and many heavy boxes in the attic of unbought books. He\u2019s studying on the side. There are also workshops where you can acquire extra skills. They are certainly helpful in the beginning. Good luck! ",

The moment we say writing career, we are trying to cover anything and everything that comes between content writing to writing scripts and even lyrics. I won\u2019t say go with something you are good at. Instead write something you love to write. Improvisation is a never ending process in a writer\u2019s life. We often start with writing things people love to read and soon end it due to lack of interest. However, writing what we love ensures that the ink will imprint better words on paper. Now that you know you pen better Once you know what interests you the most, never let your thoughts and pen stop. Dive in the depths and keep writing. While writing noted scripts or songs may initially require a degree, being a novelist is considerably simple. If you wish to be a technical writer, start publishing guest blogs on your name. This will help you build a better profile. In fact, having an online profile can be helpful in every industry. Read and connect Writing is a vast deep ocean, connect with people from your genre and industry. Interact with them and be a good listener. Our body is designed with perfection. Listen through ears, filter and accept the useful words, soak them in your soul. Regarding rest, your brain and hands will take care of it. I\u2019d be able to answer more precisely if you can let me know what exactly you want to write and the industry where you wish to use your words. Thanks for reading. ",

Writers have seen an dramatic income fall in the last twenty years and over 50% of UK writers now earn less than minimum wage. And that\u2019s only \u2018successful\u2019 writers - writers who have had books published by traditional publishing houses. Most writers do something else as well as write. What the something is, again, depends on the kind of thing you are writing and what else interests you.

            "answer_text": "To make a career out of writing\u2026 Well, I can\u2019t speak as someone who\u2019s been there, done that. However, I can speak as someone else who has wondered about that question. I, too, have had dreams of being a popular writer, of writing that next big hit, and maybe I will, one day. I\u2019m not counting on it though. I went through a phase where I wanted to write novels for a living, for about three months. And I wrote some great stuff during that time, which I still enjoy going back and reading, wondering how each of those half-finished drafts would end. I didn\u2019t know I could write like that before I started, and it\u2019s time I don\u2019t regret spending. But I put the rest of my life on hold. Family, friends, study - they didn\u2019t matter to me. I was going to be a writer, and I was going to write a famous novel, and after that I would live comfortably and my family would all look up to me. It sounds childish, I\u2019m sure, but probably familiar. Looking back, I prefer the way I go now. I have a solid future. I\u2019m in no way dependent on the gamble of success, and I know it. I still write a lot, mostly in the evenings. I write a lot of fanfics, and when I post some of them, I get positive feedback. Writing is not my career. It\u2019s my hobby. One day, this might change, but I won\u2019t be heartbroken if it doesn\u2019t. Writing is now something I do for fun. I enjoy it. To me, there is nothing more fun than typing on my computer as I drift off into a daydream, entering new worlds while recording them for later. I\u2019m not a successful author, and I don\u2019t pretend to be in posting an answer to this question. Instead, I look at it as one who asked it before. ",

Then write as much as possible, then rewrite and rewrite until your work says all you need to say and does it in a way that moves your audience. I got started with John Gardner\u2019s The Art Of Fiction. He discusses many of the tasks a writer has to fulfill and also gives excellent exercises. I also like the books of Natalie Goldberg for a beginner. Don\u2019t let anybody terrorize about how you can only do it if you will die if you don\u2019t, how difficult it is, how you have to be talented, etc. That is all Hollywood hysteria.

I got a part-time job as a bowling machine mechanic in my last year of high school. Because electricity was involved, I became interested in electricity and joined the US Navy where I became an Electronics Technician and earned diplomas in Electrical/Electronics Technology. One day I was talking with a friend, and said \u201cI know I will be a writer, but I don\u2019t know what kind of writer I will be.\u201d I went to college for a year to study engineering which included a year of College English where I did well and earned an A in both semesters. At the end of the year, I went to Alaska for work as a Radar and Communication Technician. While there I spotted an advertisement in a magazine offering a course in Technical Writing. Then it hit me; I used technical manuals in my work and I could be a Technical Writer! I\u2019ve had a great career as a Technical Writer and if you look at my profile, you\u2019ll see that I also like to write about spirituality and self-help topics.

If you want to make this a career, first make sure you have the basic skills down. That is, that you can write grammatical sentences and organize them into coherent paragraphs and larger blocks of text that get your message across clearly. (I shouldn\u2019t have to mention this, but I have come across too many people on Quora and elsewhere who want to be writers but who produce poorly worded questions and answers.) If at all possible, take a college-level class on that specific kind of writing. (I think that a physical classroom where you can interact with other writers face-to-face is more effective than an online class.) Find a way to build a portfolio to show to potential employers or clients. The work you do in the college class would be a start. And you can do some work for free for a non-profit organization\u2014preferably one you already support. Join a professional organization, or at least start attending their meetings. This is a good place to meet other people in the field who can offer advice on improving your craft and finding work. For technical writing, look into the Society for Technical Communication; for corporate communication, the International Association of Business Communicators. (Those are two I happen to know about\u2014other fields should have their own.) Good luck! Oh, and if by \u201ca career in writing\u201d you really meant \u201ca career as a fiction writer,\u201d I will direct you to Mercedes R. Lackey\u2019s excellent answer. ",

Have you taken any writing classes, especially those that extend over a series of weeks? That's a great way to have deadlines for yourself, get feedback, and work on your craft. Writing, having work completed, is where we all begin. Depending on what type of writing you want to do, your career make look very different. If you want to do freelance that includes articles, essays, online writing, etc, that will be different than creating a career writing novels, screenplays, etc. Take classes, attend workshops and conferences, get involved with freelance and other writing organizations online and in your area to become familiar with what's required and involved in your chosen areas of writing.

The only additional advice I have is to decide if you want to get paid for writing. You mentioned \u2018career\u2019, which suggests that money might be an object. If you want to get paid for writing, focus on writing non-fiction. I call fiction writing the literary equivalent of lottery tickets: fun to dream about but not much help when you have to pay the rent. Being paid to write also increases the time you will spend writing, because it becomes all or part of your job. I know a lot of people recommend starting a blog. I do not because most of my paid work isn\u2019t about expressing what I think. It is about helping other people express what they think. A blog doesn\u2019t help you develop that skill. I started as a print journalist when that was a viable career\u2026yes, I pre-date dinosaurs. (grin) Given the advance of technology, I\u2019d look for smaller, online niche markets and query those.

In case a career in writing doesn't work, you have an option to revert back and do a job. Also, the earnings, in the initial stages, may not be enough to sustain you. So i would suggest dont jump the ship right away and work till you have to find some time to write. Coming to making a career, writing a script for media(films, short films, daily soap n so on\u2026), first of all read some scripts available on the internet. By doing so, you yourself will know what your favourite genre is. Start writing after that and once finished, register them. Share nothing if unregistered!!! Share your scripts with producers, production houses. I can elaborate more on this but its a different question to tackle. Know your minimum fees so that no one takes undue advantage of your situation of being a newbie. In case you are thinking about writing books, i would suggest meet a lot if people. Visit different places, study different cultures and then start writing. Adhere to some rules to write a novel. Again, send your registered story to publishing houses. Know that a new writer makes only around 5% in royalty. Slowly and steadily, your career will shape up. All the best! ",
