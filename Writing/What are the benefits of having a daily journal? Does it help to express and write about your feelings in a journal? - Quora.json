            "answer_text": "Yes, it definitely does help to express your feelings. Even more: it helps you to understand what\u2019s going on with you in the first place. I discovered the power of journaling by accident when I was 16, after my first heartbreak. I was just drawing some lines and scribbling random words. At some point, my hand just started to write questions like \u201cWhy does it hurt so much?\u201d And without answering them, I felt a short relieve. So I continued, or better to say: let my hand continue. And it felt great! So I started a journal. Now, some twenty years later, I am still doing it. Though I don\u2019t use it daily \u2014 except for times of turmoil, when things are changing or big things are happening. However, I realized that when I don\u2019t write at least once a week, I start to feel worse, somehow detached from myself. So I try to not skip for long, and write not only when I feel bad, but also when I feel great. :) Journaling is a powerful way of self-discovery, and I can\u2019t imagine who I would be without my journals\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes It does it is a way to process your feelings I find if I write them down or what I need to process it helps me to sort out my feelings I can think more clearly and your journal is private you can express anything you need to. I have been keeping journals since I was a kid, having taking creative writing I have always expressed myself this way I have several and when I need to process my feelings on what I am going through it takes the stress feelings off somewhat I have journals where I have handwritten in them and I have an online one as well Penzu is a great source for an online journal.
