            "answer_text": "Dictionaries are amazing! If you look in a dictionary and read the example sentences you will find not only the answer to your question, but you might learn something extra. The Oxford online dictionary, Lexico, gives plenty of example sentences that students can read to fully understand how native speakers use words. Some, if not most entries have over 15 example sentences! Raise | Definition of Raise by Oxford Dictionary on Lexico.com also meaning of Raise  Rise | Definition of Rise by Oxford Dictionary on Lexico.com also meaning of Rise  As you can see in the many example sentences and in the definition, for \u2018rise\u2019 there is \u2018no object\u2019. \u2018Voices\u2019 would be the object in any sentence you wanted to form with your example, so you need to use \u2018raise\u2019, which has objects in all the example sentences and the definition says \u2018with object\u2019. If you were a carpenter, would you go to work with a hammer? No? I didn\u2019t think so. Apparently your job is to study language. Why aren\u2019t you using your most important tool, a dictionary? ",
