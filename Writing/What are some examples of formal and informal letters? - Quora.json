            "answer_text": "A formal letter is not \u2018casual\u2019. It has a formal greeting\u2026. like Dear Sir: The body doesn\u2019t speak in familiar terms, like \u201c hey, you know\u201d. Likewise the ending is formal: example: Respectfully yours, NOT See ya. An informal letter pays much less attention to form and formality. ",
