            "answer_text": "This is a challenging assignment because it is a complex and highly controversial topic with many points to address on both sides. As a teacher, I would not encourage students to choose this topic for an argumentative essay. I would encourage instead a comparative research essay in which you describe points of view of gun owners with those of gun control advocates, without advocating either position yourself. That project gives you an opportunity to educate yourself and your readers on the topic, but does not lead to the kind of fuzzy-headed argumentative writing that the topic invites a student writer to indulge in. (I personally think it is a great weakness in the U.S. educational system that we encourage students to write this kind of argumentative essay, leaping to staunch opinions based on limited information.)
