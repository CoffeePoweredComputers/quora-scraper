            "answer_text": "This question, sadly, is much too general. A \u201cliterary term\u201d is a word or phrase describing a technique which a writer employs. When writing a poem, many literary techniques can be used, and we have names (terminology) we use for all of them. A literary term is the vocabulary, the words, we use to talk or write about what the writer did. Literary terms (the words) themselves are not generally used in poetry. Alliteration is used. Simile is used. Metaphor is used. All three of these are \u201cliterary terms.\u201d For example, we don\u2019t say, \u201cHow do medical terms contribute to a report\u2019s meaning?\u201d nor do we say \u201cHow do news terms contribute to a new\u2019s article\u2019s meaning?\u201d The question should be more specific, referencing the term or terms (techniques/words) in question. Poets are very exacting\u2026so should a question about poetry be. ",
