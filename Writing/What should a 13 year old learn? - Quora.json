            "answer_text": "First, Understand yourself. Your personality type. There\u2019s an extensive personality typing system made by Carl Jung and some others\u2019 contributions. \u201cThe Analytical Psychology\u201d. OR you can simply begin by taking the MBTI TEST from maybe here -> Free personality test, type descriptions, relationship and career advice. Then after that, go to YouTube and search for your type (1 out of 16 different types) and see a video from a channel called \u201cCS Joseph\u201d. Knowing about personality type will tell you your strengths and weaknesses and EXACTLY how you can be the best version of yourself unlike the vague motivational videos online. Second, after knowing and researching about your personality type, steadily work to better yourself\u2026take it slow if you may. Third, Don\u2019t be a Drifter. The greatest problem with the modern society is that most people are \u201cdrifters\u201d - Aimless and susceptible to peer pressure. Don\u2019t follow trends for the sake of following it. Think a bit more indecently. Lastly, Aim to be the best at whatever which excites you. That which you are perhaps passionate about, or your goals. No one is more respectable than someone who focusses to better him or herself constantly in his or her domain. Whatever you do, become the best at it. World-class. ",

            "answer_text": "It's very important to share things with your parents(especially girls).Keep a relationship with them as friends not your enemies.They are rhe only one in this cruel world who care for you the MOST.One should keep good companions and must learn difference between good and bad company.Do good deeds you would be rewarded by the almighty God later.Focus on other activities and sports should be given equal importance along with studies.Sports would keep you fit and activities would increase your confidence and experience.Healthy food not only keeps your body fit but also keeps your mind fitSmoking and drinking would not make you look cool.The only reason I put this point is many teens do this at this age or even when they are younger(I am a victim of it).Start inculcating good habits in you this may help you further.Exapnd your General Knowledge and be up to date with the current affairs.Bad habits comes as a guest and stays in you as the owner.Stay away from it.Many changes in body physically and mentally take places so there's nothing to worry.And if at allThings like relationship,love, romantic and other stuff are not your childish games you played when you were a kid.Undestand this.You are still young for this.Use social media and play e games as little as you can ibecause excess of anything is harmful if don't use it then it's well and.Play indoor and outdoor games atleast for an hour.Last but not the least enjoy this phase but academics and sports should your first priority.These were some things I neglected when I was 13 and I have to face the consequence and I am following these points now.For all the teens take it as a advice from me as your friend,a big brother,a well wisher. Follow these things and stay happy.All the best. If you agree with me give it an upvote and If I have made any mistake or wish to suggest me comment below. THANK YOU\u2026\u2026.. ",
