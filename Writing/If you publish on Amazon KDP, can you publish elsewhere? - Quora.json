            "answer_text": "If you enroll your book in the KDP Select program, where Kindle Unlimited members can read your book for free, then you can\u2019t publish your EBOOK elsewhere. You can publish your paperback anywhere you want. Now, if you want to \u201cgo wide\u201d and bypass the KDP Select program, you can use an aggregator like draft2digital (ebook) or Ingramspark (print), but just remember that there\u2019s a reason the KDP Select program is good for new authors. It offers great promo features - free days, countdown deal, etc, and Amazon pushes your book to KU readers if you get a lot of downloads. For me, KDP Select really worked when I managed to get 500+ downloads for my book and then it started pushing it to people, and my keywords were strong (I use PublisherRocket), and for a while, I got consistent sales. Even though I thought it wouldn\u2019t be a lot of money since they pay you for reads, not buys, KU reads amounted to 70% of my income. So yeah, for beginners, I recommend KDP Select, and you can do it for 90 days, and then you can go wide if it\u2019s not working. Just remember to do a few free days and really push the downloads so Amazon can start pushing your book onto all kinds of lists. There are free book promotion sites for that, book bloggers, social media, etc. Good luck!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can also publish on Kobo, B&N, Smashwords, D2D, Apple...BUT, if you enroll your e-book into KDP Select, you cannot publish the book anywhere else for 90 days. That's the period of exclusivity. During these 90 days you can choose Amazon's promo tools, which are only available if your book is in KDP Select. Promo tools include:Making your book totally free for 5 days and giving away free copies. This might help you gain visibility. You can use all 5 days in a row, or split them during the 90 days.Or (you have to choose between these two options)Starting a countdown for up to 7 days. You put your book on a sale and the price slowly goes up. Again, might be a way to boost sales. In KDP Select you can also use Amazon's newest tool: advertising (doesn't work for Erotica). You set up a budget and pay for the clicks. A bit like FB ads. You can have 2+ books, but only enroll one in Select, it won't affect the rest of your books.  If you have any other questions about KDP, feel free to ask them. ",
