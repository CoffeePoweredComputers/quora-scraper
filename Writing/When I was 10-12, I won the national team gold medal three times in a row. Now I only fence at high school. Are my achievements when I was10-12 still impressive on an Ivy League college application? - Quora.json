            "answer_text": "Disagree with these two. You Absolutely mention this somewhere--almost anywhere really--that you want. You'd be Nuts not to mention this. Why? This is Texture. The third key element you need in your applications--the most fun, the least understood, and the most important to winning over your judge into your advocate. Anything you can give me to make you memorable, you include. I was a one-time hand model for Stratego at 12. Bizarre. But I was nuts not to include that in my application. You better believe convos like this happen: \"Have anyone interesting this year?\" \"Yeah, a Statego hand model.\" \"A three-time gold medal fencer.\" \"A kid who runs an ice cream truck.\" Etc. These gems are like a little buoy that floats your application to the top of an ocean of similar-sounding applicants. Quirky details--presented correctly--make me like you. I probably put you down as my Hand-Model-Philosopher when I prep you after my read. Then months later at committee: I pull up my prep notes ... Oh, yeah I remember this student: \"You guys are gonna love this kid, he's my Stratego hand model ...\" Humans are reading your application. Be human. And there really are hardly any \"rules\" for what you can put down and where. Go for it. Smart, interesting, fun--you will always get rewarded for that wherever it appears. --Admitium ",

If you still participate in this sport, you list it as an activity. You can mention in your essay that you were on a national fencing team as a child - if this detail is important for your story. ",
