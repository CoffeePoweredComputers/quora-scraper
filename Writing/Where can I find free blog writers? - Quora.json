            "answer_text": "What qualifies me to write answer to this question? I have been writing consistently, have written 70+ articles so far on Harry Ven \u2014 Profile Few of my articles have been published on a third party website that has 100 K followers on instagram. I published the articles there for \u201cfree\u201d.  Its not free. Do not call it free. If, as mentioned, you have traffic, then you are not asking the content for free, you are asking it in return for attention span of your viewers, the biggest currency in internet world today. So what you are offering is valuable, its a fair exchange. Now lets get to how and where. Where? Medium. Why? You can see aspiring writers on the publishing platform.You can find bloggers publishing posts every day in spite of very less traction. This takes care of aspiring part of your need.You can reach out to writers who write decent enough but have very less following because of the way social media is skewed towards the top 10% on any platform. [Rich getting richer]You get access to writers - especially the beginners and intermediates from all around the world. You got a big pool to choose from.You can find bloggers who desperately want their content to be read.For an early blogger, writer, publisher - ultimately what it counts is if people are reading their content and engaging. This takes care of so called \u201cfree\u201d part of your need.Creating content is easier, building the distribution network is where 80% of a blogger goes. If you can solve that problem for content writers, you are providing the value they need. How to get these writers provide content for you? 1. The sales pitch : Do you have good number of followers on any social media or on your own website? Highlight it and reach out to bloggers on Medium.com. Read a lot of articles to find content and people you like, then do your sales pitch. A typical sales pitch (reaching out to the bloggers on email) below: Hello ,I am the managing editor of XYZ and I was wondering if you would be willing to let us re-publish this piece on our site with full accreditation + links to your site. We have over so many followers on so and so platforms. Please let me know if you are interested in having this shared on our site. You can reach me at so and so email id. Simple, neat, no too much of sales, shows your value for the blogger. Fair and simple.  2. Medium has something called Publication. You can create your own publication on medium and invite different content writers to publish their articles on your publication. Collaboration with writers is easy on the platform. But your following matters, the better your following, the better content writers you will get. 3. Engage and interact : Follow writers you like on Medium, comment on their blogs, create a rapport. This is a less used but really effective strategy. How to choose the writers? This hugely depends on the kind of content you are looking for - technical, fiction etc. But other than number of likes and shares, there are few qualitative factors that can help you choose the right blogger. 1. Frequency - People who have written a lot irrespective of how big or small their audience show their passion for writing, and that they are not worried about short term indicators of success. 2. Find writers who read a lot - Medium has a section called Highlight in every one\u2019s profile. You can see all the highlights a particular blogger has done on content within medium. Good readers have a good chance of being better writers. 3. Length of posts - A recent research of 1000 bloggers show that 6% of bloggers differ from remaining bloggers in terms of how long they spend to create each blog, how big the articles are, different media used, how many articles they post in a week etc You can use these metrics to see if a particular blogger is serious about what he or she is doing.  4. Research, Facts - Are the articles laden with facts, supporting articles and evidences? Do you see deep research done for the article? 5. Variety of posts - One way to understand the depth of the writer is to see the different topics on which he or she writes. Medium has a tagging mechanism, by which you tag an article in different areas like entrepreneurship, life\u2019s lessons, creativity etc See what all topics the author has written the posts on. 6. Story telling - Writing is just a part of telling a story. Is the blogger using other media like images, audio, video to improvise on his or her story? 7. Uniqueness - Is the blogger just copying all the fads and supposed success hacks to get more viewers or genuinely trying to create value for people out there? Is the content based on their own experiences? Studies show that people are more interested in learning from others mistakes and life. Conclusion Focus on building your following and reach out to people who are passionate about writing quality content. If you have good number of followers you would get good writers\u2019 content.  There is a huge talent in writing out there. The quality of writers you get this way hugely depends on what value you can bring them. ",

            "answer_text": "What kind of traffic do you currently have? What are the themes your blog is striving to cover? What will you be doing to promote their work (that is, to promote your bog)? There are plenty of writers in the world. Do you want quality? Is quality important to you? If yes, then you must understand that quality takes a bit of work, and there has to be a motivation or incentive for writers to write for nothing. When I was first writing I produced a few articles for free because I was (a) practicing how to capture ideas in print and (b) I was writing to help people. Money was not my aim. Later, I wrote articles for the bylines, but even then did it for pay. It wasn\u2019t much but it was an incentive. It put food on the table, and more importantly it helped build a portfolio that led to a writing job. If you do not have quality content on your blog, you will not be able to achieve sustained traffic and the one thing writers would like to get \u2014 if you are not paying them \u2014 is readers. What is the aim of your blog? What is the purpose of this effort? The theme? ",
