            "answer_text": " I would suggest that you ask your teacher for more information. Your next step would be decide what you think the question is.  I must admit that I have no idea what your teachers wants with \"listening is harder discuss\". Let me start by suggesting a comma after \"harder\": \"Listening is harder, discuss\" My English as a Second Language students don't understand this usage of \"discuss\" so here is my quickly-thought-out definition. Discuss in an essay: Choose an opinion based on the title and imagine talking about this with friends.  Some agree with your opinion while others disagree.  Your task is to write the arguments for both sides and convince the reader that your opinion is best.  One important point is that you usually can disagree with the statement. \"Listening is harder\" could mean different things to different people.  Listening to a person complain is harder than complaining. Listening is harder it seems.  Listening is harder than reading....  Or, \"I don't think listening is harder than reading\" or similar negative statements. I like to use a mindmap or other form of note-taking to prepare myself.  Write down some ideas that support your opinion and some that conflict with your opinion.  Here is an important point: Now that you have written these points, you can change your opinion and defend the opposing side. I don't want to go further.  You write your own essay and good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Approach this topic with an open mind. In the first paragraph introduce the topic. Begin with an interesting sentence and dive straight into the issue. Do not write too much, be clean and brief. E.g \"Speaking and listening are the essences of human communication, while both are vital, there is prevalent controversy in which is more difficult...\" (and so on) Proceed to support or disagree with the topic. (Most choose to support first). Why is listening more difficult? Consider situations where this is true. Be sure to include statistical evidence (research) supporting this, hopefully there are plenty on the internet. Then discuss occasions where listening is easier than the latter. Perhaps speaking demands more thinking and creativity than listening. Be sure not to include your personal opinion and have equal amounts of content for both the 'for' and 'against'. In the conclusion you may summarise your points and state your opinion if you wish. I hope this helps! Good luck on your essay.  ",
