            "answer_text": "At this point the examples that spring to mind are those which serve the dedicated rather than casual audience. For example, Star Wars is a highly transmedia property, where the story has been enhanced to the point of spawning multiple equally authoritative lines of canon! This includes books and comic books to games -- particularly those like \"Knights of the Old Republic\" that both told their own story and enhanced the overall universe 'story.' Another example is that of the Riddick franchise, where a game (Escape from Butcher Bay) forms a prequel to the second movie focused on this character, revealing more about him and the universe he inhabits. Finally, Joss Whedon's Firefly is an excellent example of transmedia storytelling: the ill-fated 14-episode TV show was strangled in its crib, but nevertheless gained such a following that a movie was made (containing essentially the storyline for the second season, much compressed), and then a series of successful graphic novels have been made. These eventually revealed several key story points alluded to (and much speculated about by the fans) in the original TV show. (Semi-disclaimer: I led an effort to resurrect the property in the form of an MMOG, to continue telling the story but in an expansive way -- see Is there any chance that Firefly could be revived? if you want more on that.)

            "answer_text": "Apart from the above mentioned, as a person interested in this field, it hard not to mention two major ones that used transmedia very brilliantly...but were not without faults - First is the Matrix Series. Leaving aside the fact that the convoluted plot and ambiguity of last two movies of the trilogy almost ruined the brilliance the franchise, the introduction of 'Animatrix' and the PC game 'Enter the Matrix' did not just stretch the storyworld for those keen enough to explore, but rewarded them with the knowledge of plot points and backstory of a character that were crucial to the films. This is some sense, deepen the experience and engagement to the primary story. Second one is Heroes Franchise. Again, here the mediocre plot and confusing character motivations in the later season faltered the show's rating leading to its cancellation. However considering how intertwined storylines of characters in the first season was further deepened by the graphic novel series that ran parallel to it, featuring backstories or in-between events. This for the audience was highly satisfying as it answered questions and explained situations that might have not even conceived. For a show with the major theme of 'inter-connectedness', the use transmedia narrative across the medium gave the audience the privilege to experience it first hand. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the best designed transmedia story would be the swedish project The truth about Marika. It starts with a girl, Adriana, going to festivals during the summer, holding posters of her missing friend, Maria. On september, a TV channel announces their new TV series about a girl\u2019s disappearance. Adriana, who had managed a blog for a few months to gather a community that would help her find her friend, claimed that her story had been stolen by the TV channel. She asked for a debate after the TV series\u2019 premiere. The writers used the TV series, multiple websites, TV debates, ARG, actors appearing randomly in swedish towns to blur the lines between reality and fiction, and so on. The project is fascinating and worth studying. (see this blog) ",
