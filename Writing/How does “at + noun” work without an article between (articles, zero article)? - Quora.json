            "answer_text": "There is zero article when at is used to refer to a particular time of day: at midday, at noon, at midnight, at dawn, at sunrise, at dusk, at sunset, at night, at daybreak, at breakfast time, at lunch time, at dinner time, at supper time, at meal times, at break time, etc. There are a few cases where at refers to a particular place; they often have a meaning beyond simply referring to a location. You simply learn them as exceptions. For example: at home (= in your house, but also means \u201cready to receive visitors\u201d or \u201cplay a match on your home ground\u201d) at work (= at your place of work, but also means \u201cworking not necessarily at your place of work\u201d) at school (= in the school building as a pupil, but also means \u201cbeing of school age\u201d) at church (= attending a church service). Finally, there are some special phrases with zero article, which again you simply have to learn as exceptions. For example: at rest (= relaxing, but also means \u201cnot moving\u201d for an inanimate object) at risk (= being exposed to danger) at fault (= in the wrong). ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cAt\u201d with an article refers to a location. Without an article, it is either a time of day, or one of a small number of idioms, related to activity or status, rather than location (as listed in another answer). A similar idiom is \u201cin hospital\u201d. Of the people currently located at my local hospital, you may note that the doctors, nurses, and other employees are \u201cat work\u201d, but the patients are \u201cin hospital\u201d (i.e. for treatment).
