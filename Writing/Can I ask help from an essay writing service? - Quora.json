            "answer_text": "Somehow, \u201chelp\u201d in relation to essay writing has become synonymous with custom writing. If you mean that - yes, you can ask them for \u201chelp\u201d and they will write your essay for you. However, if you have ordered a paper and want help with clarifying some choices, understanding the text, etc. - no, you can\u2019t. Writers are paid for the writte papers, not to provide explanations to the clients. I work as a tutor and I am ready to assist students on any stage of assay writing starting from helping to understand the instructions and finishing with editing and proofreading of the paper. If you think you might finish the work on your own, but you need a push, a clarification, an explanation, or any other help, feel free to contact me here. ",

Or, instead of committing academic fraud, you could do your own work. You\u2019ll get more out of it and won\u2019t get kicked out of school. Oh and you will, eventually, get caught if you cheat, so don\u2019t. ",
