            "answer_text": "Growing your audience as a blogger is probably one of the most often asked questions amongst anyone with a website or a blog. Without question, there's no doubt that the one thing we can never seem to get enough of is \"traffic\". So with that said, lets talk about some of the things that you can do to get more traffic to ultimately grow your audience to your blog.   Blogcatalog is a great resource for traffic and blog promotion. By simply registering with the website and participating in the converstion and sharing your link can lead to getting help from other bloggers in promoting your content. You can also use their premium services for additional visibility. You have probably heard of Triberr. The reason why it's talked about so much is because it's one of those scratch your back and I'll do the same for you type websites. I particularly enjoy these types of websites beacuse everyone there has content to promoe that they are hoping will resonate with other bloggers that are there too. Actively participating and promoting other users content will result in the same being done for you. Copromote is another one that I would recommend because it ultimately increases your reach online. There are two options that you can utilize through Copromote. You can use \"boosts\" or you can promote and share other users content which in turn leads to acquiring greater reach and your content getting shared too. All this can be done for free, but you can also upgrade your account for even greater reach. Video promotion has also been added to their platform that can be promoted too. You can utilize paid ad options too such as the following: reddit ads, stumbleupon paid discovery, youtube paid advertising, google adwords ppc campaigns, pinterest promoted pins etc. Utilize blogger outreach. The most effective route that I've found to get this done to reach out to other bloggers especially if you're struggling to find their contact information is through Linkedin and Twitter. Start getting your name out there to other bloggers and share their content and develop those relationships so that it may in time lead to you pitching your own content that may get shared by the larger bloggers in your niche. With that said, lets not forget the most common ways to grow your audiences such as using Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin, Google Plus, Reddit, Stumbleupon, Youtube and other video sharing networks.  Nevertheless, all of these avenues can grow your traffic and your audiences but it will take a concentrated investment of time and energy to get better than mediocre results for your blog and website.

Does that sound like something you want to achieve and can commit to wholeheartedly? Okay, then let\u2019s do it. I\u2019ll walk you through a 16-step process for growing your blog to 100K monthly visitors (or more) from scratch. Growing from 0-10K Visitors Launching a blog and getting it off its feet by building an initial following of a few hundred and then a few thousand regular visitors is quite often the hardest part of the whole process. Don\u2019t be surprised if going from 0-10K monthly visitors takes longer than going from 10K to 50K, and 50K to 100K. In this section, we\u2019re going to cover how to set yourself up for both early and long-term success. Specifically I\u2019m going to talk about: Choosing (or narrowing) your nicheDefining your target audienceHow to choose the right topics for your blog postsThe quality of content you should be aiming to createHow to optimize your blog posts to maximize their visibility in the search resultsFeaturing industry influencers in your contentBuilding relationships with influencersOptimizing posts for readabilitySo let\u2019s start from step one. How to \u2026 1. Choose (or Narrow) Your Niche The right niche can make a big difference in how easy (or hard) it is to grow a blog to 100K + followers. What is a Niche? Ryan Robinson said it best in his guide on how to start a blog: \u201cA niche is more than just a topic. It\u2019s the approach you\u2019re going to take, the audience you want to go after, and the way you\u2019re going to talk to them and position yourself as an expert.\u201d The Ideal Niche The ideal niche is one with enough consumer interest to ensure 100K potential followers actually exist, while having minimal competition from other bloggers. \u201cWhatever topic you pick, you need to love it, and naturally curious about it. If not, you\u2019ll run out of ideas quickly. Most importantly, you won\u2019t be able to consistently create content that will build your audience.\u201d ~Neil Patel Make Money with Affiliate Marketing  ParkerDeen/E+/Getty Images Affiliate marketing is one of the easiest ways to make money online and the great news is that it's pretty hands off. The way it works is you simply find other great products and services that would be of benefit to your audience. In most cases, you can promote these products on your website and get paid a commission anytime a sale is made. You don't have to create the product, handle the transactions, deal with customer service, or anything else. You simply recommend the product on your blog and get paid when a sale is made. Make Money Blogging with Ads  Credit: FingerMedium/DigitalVision Vectors/Getty Images Contextual ads give you a way to monetize your blog content by showing readers relevant ads that may interest them. If they click through, you earn a small fee (commission) as compensation for showing the ad on your website. Small fees that add up over time\u2026 Don\u2019t Depend on Blind Luck When I started my first blog back in 2003 I had no idea what I was doing. There really wasn\u2019t such a thing as blog strategy back then. You simply wrote whatever you wanted and just kind of hoped for the best. At least I thought. There were some bloggers, even back then, that understood the game and were able to drive large amounts of traffic to their site. I depended on blind luck to get me by and that is how a lot of bloggers today approach things. They see a number of different tactics to help them drive traffic to their site and they figure that they will give each one a shot once to see what happens. Maybe they\u2019ll get lucky. That is the wrong way to go about it. Getting traffic to your blog requires a plan. One that you know you will execute and follow down to the detail. This guide will help to show you a number of different tactics for driving more traffic to your blog and you can decide which tactics you want to use. ",
