            "answer_text": "Rule 1: don\u2019t listen to rules. :-) Too many people encourage blind adherence to style rules. They\u2019re *guidelines*, nothing more, to be digested, considered, and applied intelligently. Many of them were not even voiced as absolute rules when they first appeared, but have morphed into that after being filtered through countless web site summaries. For example: \u201cDon\u2019t use adverbs or adjectives\u201d \u2014 this comes originally from Strunk and White\u2018s Elements of Style, Fourth edition (which all new writers should read. ) When I went to find a copy, I ran across web pages raging about how Strunk said to never use adjectives or adverbs, what an idiot he was. But he never said that. Here\u2019s what he ACTUALLY wrote: Write with nouns and verbs, not with adjectives and adverbs. The adjective hasn't been built that can pull a weak or inaccurate noun out of a tight place. This is not to disparage adjectives and adverbs; they are indispensable parts of speech. Occasionally they surprise us with their power, as in Up the airy mountain, Down the rushy glen, We daren't go a-hunting For fear of little men ... The nouns mountain and glen are accurate enough, but had the mountain not become airy, the glen rushy, William Ailing-ham might never have got off theground with his poem. In general, however, it is nouns and verbs, not their assistants, that give good writing its toughness and color. In short, the original advice was: adverbs and adjectives are weaker than nouns and verbs, but sometimes they\u2019re uniquely effective. Likewise, most of the other \u201crules\u201d you will hear are typically overstated and/or oversimplified. Show, don\u2019t tell. Never use \u2018said.\u2019 Never use \u2018was\u2019. Avoid sentence fragments. All of these reflect guidelines that are appropriate in moderation. Telling instead of showing does not make for powerful storytelling, but sometimes it\u2019s the proper choice. Don\u2019t overuse \u201csaid\u201d, but there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with the word. Sentence fragments can be powerful when used sparingly and creatively. \u201cWas\u201d, when combined with an adjective, is telling, not showing\u2026.but see above note on that. In truth, I\u2019ve seen more bad pieces of writing by beginners bending over backwards to avoid using \u201csaid\u201d by substituting synonyms than I can count. Surprise! Good writers use \u201csaid\u201d when it\u2019s needed\u2026and adverbs, and adjectives, and passive form, and sentence fragments, and (gasp) exclamation points\u2026you name it. The fact that you should not rely on something or use it too often does not mean you should never do it! So when people post lists of \u201crules\u201d, and they include instructions to never do something, treat that as advice to minimize your use of that element, and try to understand the reasoning behind it. Then apply that understanding to your writing in an intelligent way. For those unfamiliar with Strunk and White, it\u2019s considered by many writers to be the ultimate guide to writing style, with practical guidelines to make your writing clearer and more impactful. It\u2019s also in the public domain, so here ya go: http://www.jlakes.org/ch/web/The-elements-of-style.pdf Now my notes on two \u201crules\u201d listed elsewhere in this thread. Don\u2019t use \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe.\u201d Uh\u2026no. Pronouns are used so that we don\u2019t have to keep repeating a name. There\u2019s absolutely no reason not to use them. Just make sure it\u2019s clear who you are referring to. Don\u2019t use gerunds (ing verbs) Here\u2019s another example of details being left out, since the rule only refers to one type of usage. Thousands of gerund uses exist that do not offend. Regardless, the proper guidleline should be don\u2019t overuse gerunds. Sometimes they\u2019re the right choice. ",

            "answer_text": "The mistakes I most often find in my own early writing and the writing of ambitious peers of mine who are just starting off, is trying too hard to explain and justify yourself and being afraid that the audience won't be able to figure something out.  For example, I'm currently refining the rough draft of my first novel, which I wrote when I was about 12, and I just finished a scene where I'm describing a minor character's injuries, and in my rough draft, I had felt the need to explain that the reason he's having trouble walking because the backs of his knees were slashed is because there were important muscles back there. (I dunno if that's actually true, but the character isn't human anyways, so it's fine.) There were also scenes where I labeled this group of characters as the dictators of the society, and then felt the need to go on and try to explain and justify the fact that they're ruling over an anarchic civilization, and yes, I know anarchies don't have leaders, these are just people who take what they want and everyone listens to them because they're scary and strong, etc. I was recently reading a friend's first attempt at writing, and he was all around SUUUPPPEER clumbsy with exposition. Every. Single. Time. He introduced anything- A character, a setting, a piece of backstory, a concept - he went on to deliver all the information about it at once, and he was writing it in first person, so it was as if the author had just ripped the book from your hands and started casually, but kind of desperately, explaining the concepts to you. On top of that, if he wasn't sure that a term was gonna be familiar to the audience, he explained the term in parentheses. An actual sentence from his work: \"...stabbed her in the sternum (Sternum: a bone in the center of the chest, where the ribcage comes out of.)\" (that wasn't the exact wording of his definition, but that's what he did.) I think this is because new writers are insecure, so a lot of us want to try to make sure the audience knows exactly what we're trying to do, so they know we at least have a vision in mind. New writers mostly need to learn to have faith in their audience's ability to infer, to use a dictionary, and to wait more than half a sentence before having something explained to them. ",
