Okay. something that would reference in how he/she makes you smile mention that every minute away makes you feel ____ and that whenever you\u2019re together _____ Sometimes \u201cI love you\u201d is a great closer. (Just as long as you\u2019ve told her before, unless this is when you\u2019re going to say it) If it\u2019s the first, DON\u2019T put it in the ending, place it in the middle somewhere, BUT make it still stand out, maybe ALL CAPS. Write something that shows him/her your someone that they can always look to and know you\u2019ll be there. Comfort is really the best way to warm the heart at the end of a love letter. Because you want to make him/her feel warm and fuzzy, just not too mushy or sappy. Hope that helped! Blogger/Writer @ RACCOON DADDY : Father, Husband, FAMILY, and Gaming ",
