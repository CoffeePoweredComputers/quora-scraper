            "answer_text": "Welcome to the wonderful world of Russian classical novels\u2026 I mostly jest, but there\u2019s a kernel of truth there. Some branches of literature are notably more about the themes and movement of society within the novel, while others \u2014 including most of US and western European lit \u2014 tend towards protagonist-centered character-driven tales. But there are multiple ways to approach your question. Perhaps there isn\u2019t \u201ca\u201d main character, but rather a group or ensemble cast through which the narrative cycles. That way, characters get equal time, making it difficult to say who is the \u201cmain\u201d one. Maybe the novel is written in vignettes, or is essentially a series of closely linked short stories. Likely there is a central plot element, a maguffin or a dominating theme around which everything else orbits, just to tie things together somehow. In fact\u2026 Let\u2019s have an example. Die Haarteppichkn\u00fcpfer, translated into English by Orson Scott Card under the title The Carpet Makers, is the sort of novel you are suggesting. It has no main character, no central protagonist, and often its chapters are seemingly unconnected vignettes, but everything eventually leads back to the titular carpets, the galaxy-spanning culture that produces them, the history and mystery of their making, and in the final chapters the true tragedy of the situation. It\u2019s quite an interesting novel, though I can\u2019t speak for the English translation. I read it in French, originally. You might want to check it out sometime, though. ",

            "answer_text": "Is it okay if a novel is without a main character? As long as there are anchors for the readers to follow. You can say there are five protagonists (5 viewpoints or 20 or a 100)\u2026 no matter what YOU do \u2026 YOU will favor one over the others. It\u2019s just the way creativity works. One will be more fun to write, or resonate more with your own view, and they will get favorable creative energy from you. So, you might want there not to be a main character\u2026 but one will end up being the main. Best just to recognize it up front and embrace it. ",

            "answer_text": "Your story can focus on multiple characters who have their own goals or the same. If not, your readers will not care about your story. People want something to latch onto in your story, and characters are the driving force. Without a driving force, why should your readers care? Nobody has to be the main character, but they have to be the driving force. ",
