            "answer_text": "For many students, the ingenuity (or \u201cinterestingness\u201d!) of the topic could be an impediment to their ability to finish up an academic career with a \u201csuccessful\u201d final project. In that case, choosing something conventional like \u201cLow-income Housing\u201d or \u201cCreating a Sustainable Home for the Aging Third World Population\u201d may be ideal. BUT, if you wish to choose something rewarding that you will look back on with pride, years from now after you\u2019ve become a successful practicing architect, I\u2019d suggest trying to think \u201coutside the box\u201d, so to speak. For which you can\u2019t really seek \u201cideas\u201d from others. You need to stop thinking conventionally, search deep inside to get an understanding of where your own passions lie, and think away, reading, writing down ideas, refining and discarding, until you get there\u2026. I graduated from Architecture in the late 80\u2019s during the early days of 3D modelling and was a keen adopter of that technology, but it made me very aware of the fact that architecture (and the experience of space) could become even more virtual and less \u201ctangible\u201d or physical over time. An earlier thesis I proposed was that 3d modelling could provide a virtual \u201carchitectural experience\u201d without ever building anything. William Gibson\u2019s Neuromancer was a popular book at the time, but in those days the technology just wasn\u2019t there yet. It was long before Alex Roman\u2019s film The Third & The Seventh which was made over 10 years ago but is still a \u201cmust watch\u201d for me in terms of creating a convincing virtual space!  However, then, as still, I was desperate to build things, rather than just document. My final thesis project was \u201cEphemeral Architecture\u201d. It posited that Architecture was more about \u201cthe experience of space\u201d than about \u201cthe documentation of proposed buildings\u201d. I proposed to create a physical experience of space for my final work, rather than the usual drawings. In the end I capitulated and produced drawings, as well as \u201can experience\u201d but at least I had ambitions! (see in comments below for a better explanation of what \u201cEphemeral Architecture\u201d meant). As a rule, architecture students live in a world of dreams, drawings, and unrealised projects, but I wanted to break through those restrictions and create an environment that appealed to all the juror\u2019s senses, not just 2D visualization. I tried to choose a thesis subject that was current, highly conceptual, and close to my heart, rather than exploring say \u201clow income housing, urban renewal, or environmentally friendly building\u201d like many fellow students chose. This is not to say those are bad choices, just not always as conceptually challenging. A thesis should go way beyond the practical and should question \u201cideas\u201d rather than just \u201cpractices\u201d. Ideally students should explore the edge of what is being done, rather than just research what others are already doing. It may be the last chance you\u2019ll get to be theoretically crazy\u2026 Luckily I can now say I look back on that final project with great pride. ",

I get same question about thesis and dissertation topics from a variety of academic disciplines A great dissertation topic, project idea, or thesis statement is one that interest you,interest your advisor, andinterest your committee within the resources available to you.It is the process, apprenticeship of becoming a scholar, researcher, or credential professional that matters, not the topic. Do a literature review. It is part of the written thesis or dissertation (or an executive summary for a project) so it is not a waste of time. Use deductive reasoning to find a topic of interest. It needs to be personally interesting because you will be married to it for a long time \u2014 it\u2019s like picking a spouse. Selecting the topic is an integral step of the process, taking a broad topic and narrowing it down. It wiil be the same process for research or project design. Start with https://scholar.google.com Do not forget trade association publications, white papers, government reports, and Non-governmental organization (NGO) - publications. Don't limit yourself. Most papers or books will end with research questions for further investigation. They will also point you to scholarly publications, researchers, or professionals that might not have occurred to you such as these examples about digital applications or creating an environmentally safe ecosystem. Look at trending topics for your discipline. Look at cross-disciplinary ideas such as architecture and brand marketing.
