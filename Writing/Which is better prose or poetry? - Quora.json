            "answer_text": "I think it depends on what you\u2019re looking for. If you want to know more about history, science, philosophy, etc., the prose is probably better. If you want to \u201cfeel\u201d what you\u2019re reading, and to be moved by what you\u2019re reading, then poetry is better. Here\u2019s an example of when poetry is better than prose. This is a poem Oscar Wilde wrote for his sister Isola, who died at age ten: Requiescatby Oscar Wilde Tread lightly, she is nearUnder the snow,Speak gently, she can hearThe daisies grow. All her bright golden hairTarnished with rust,She that was young and fairFallen to dust. Lily-like, white as snow,She hardly knewShe was a woman, soSweetly she grew. Coffin-board, heavy stone,Lie on her breast,I vex my heart alone,She is at rest. Peace, Peace, she cannot hearLyre or sonnet,All my life's buried here,Heap earth upon it. ",

            "answer_text": "Prose is defined as a form of poetry in literature. Prose simply lacks precise rhyme structure that account for many forms of poetry. So, the question is a bit misleading. Perhaps, you can reword it as follows: \u201cdo you prefer structured or unstructured verse?\u201d That's a difficult question to which to respond. Why so? Consider great works such as Milton's Paradise Lost (prose) and Tennyson\u2019s The Lady of Shalott (rhyme: aaaabcccb, that switches from iambic to trochaic tetrameter). Both works are important, and beautiful, while the form is varied. Indeed, by in large, their delivery and structure are part of their brilliance and beauty. NB This is a long-winded way to say \u201cit depends.\u201d ",
