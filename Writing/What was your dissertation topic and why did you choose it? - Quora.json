            "answer_text": "The topic of my dissertation was related to programming. I decided to decide on a topic here https://prohighgrades.com/personal-statement-writer-service. When choosing a topic, the following points should be considered: 1. The relevance of the topic. The topic you have chosen should not be previously investigated by someone. Otherwise, you will do the same work and get similar scientific results, which is unacceptable; 2. Scientific development. The topic you have chosen should be unique and not be previously explored by someone; 3. Independent choice of research direction. You should not use topics that you will be offered at the department, or supervisor. Determine the direction of the study yourself. This will characterize you as a person who is extremely serious about the process of obtaining an academic master's degree. ",
