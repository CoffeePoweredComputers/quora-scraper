            "answer_text": "How many words are in 1500 characters? That depends on the size of a word. Now, I will assume \u201ccharacters\u201d is referring to text\u2026 So there could be 750 one letter words (like \u201ca\u201d with a following space). But a lot less if it has things like \u201csupercalifragilisticexpialidocious\u201d in it. Now in computer terms, it still depends on the size of a word. 1500 words, if a word is 8 bits each. 750 words, if a word is 16 bits each. 375 words, if a word is 32 bits each. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming you want an average, it depends on the language. In English, the average word is about five letters, so it would be about 300 words. In German the average word is about seven letters, so it would only be about 215. In Chinese, it could be anywhere from 750 to 1500 \u2014 some words need one character, some need two. ",
