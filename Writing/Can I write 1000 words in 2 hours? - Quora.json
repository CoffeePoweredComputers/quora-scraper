            "answer_text": "I personally would say it depends on what you mean when you say \u201cwrite\u201d If you are \u201cwriting\u201d a paper using your computer or laptop, certainly. You could write well over 1000 words in 2 hours' time. Especially with an imaginative and active mind. I have personally done this many times. However, if you're doing the old school paper and pencil, It may still be possible. Just much less so, in considering a few factors. The speed with which a human hand writes is much slower than typing on a keyboard.The human hand is a living thing filled with muscle and many other complicated things. It can only do an activity like writing for so long before getting so tired it needs to stop. A machine doesn't get tired. A machine is not a living thing.If your mind is not as imaginative, you will take more time trying to come up with what to write. When you ask this question it also depends on if you mean writing a paper/story, or just writing 1000 random words hot off the thinking press.",
