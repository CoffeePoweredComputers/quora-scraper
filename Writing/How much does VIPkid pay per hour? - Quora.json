            "answer_text": "VIPKID pays $18-$22 per hour. It\u2019s set based on how much experience you have and how well you do in the interview process. If you\u2019re an experienced teacher and you interview well, you\u2019ll earn $9 per each 25 minute class. If you\u2019re less experienced and interview okay, you\u2019ll start with $7 per 25 minute class. Then, for each class completed successfully, you\u2019ll earn $1 per class. For each class you fill out a review of what you taught the student, you\u2019ll earn another $1. This equates to the total of $18-$22 per hour. After two successful contract periods (6 months), they will raise your pay. If you\u2019re interested, you can apply here :) ",
