            "answer_text": "LinkedIn has become a place to stand out professionally and of course find jobs. Since I made a dedicated effort to spend time on LinkedIn in the last 60 days I\u2019ve: Had over 2100 people look at my professional profileSpoken with some of the largest names in my industry including Jason Feifer the Editor in Chief of Entrepreneur MediaHad over 200,000 views on my posts on LinkedInApproached by a number of recruiters and picked up 4 new clientsConnected with 3000+ people who are in my target marketHow does this happen? Start by creating a profile that people want to look at, connect with the people who you want to hire you and finally spend a bit of time some automation tools. Create a profile that people want to look at Here is where you need to share some of your best attributes which are: a) A professional headshot (you\u2019re 14 times more likely to have your profile viewed when you have a photo) b) A banner photo of you in a professional scenario or showing some of the press you\u2019ve received c) The gold LI premium button which you have to pay for (or sign up for a free 30-day trial) d) Just underneath your name you need to have the key terms and relevant key searches that you want recruiters to find you for As you can see with the first section of my profile it\u2019s optimised to attract the attention of the people who are my target leads.  The second part of is introducing yourself in your summary and the type of work you\u2019ve done previously and the type of work you offer. This is followed by my media credentials and my own personal address with direct links to my emails. Then I place the two most compelling media stories on the tail end of my profile and I now have a profile that people want to look at and read through. 2. Connect with people at scale Now that you\u2019ve got a profile that people want to look at it\u2019s time to reach out to your ideal contacts at scale and start automating your outreach process. Download the free 14 day Chrome extension tool called \u201cLinkedIn Helper\u201d. Once you\u2019ve installed this for Chrome it\u2019s time to head back to your LinkedIn profile. a) Go to search the bar in LinkedIn and select the \u201cPeople\u201d drop down\u201d and from here you\u2019ll be shown thousands of connections b) From here select \u201cAll Filters\u201d  You\u2019ll be presented with the above screen. From here you want to select the tick boxes for 2nd and 3rd+ connections. After this selection the location of your target leads and fill out the rest of the information. Once you\u2019ve got the information you want select the \u201cApply\u201d button.  You\u2019ll be presented with a list of leads to connect with. In the bottom right hand corner you will see your Chrome extension \u201cLinkedIn Helper\u201d. From here you need to click on this and open this next screen.  Where the box has the hamburger menu select this to open the menu and you need to select the option that says \u201cCollect, Select & Invite 2nd and 3rd contacts\u201d.  From here it will allow you to collect contacts for inviting. What you need to do is select the \u201cDEFAULT_LIST\u201d and select \u201cCREATE NEW\u201d. Name the list of people to do with the geographic region of the people and the target market they\u2019re in. From here select \u201cCollect contacts for inviting\u201d. This will scroll through the list of people on here just make sure you leave the window open to allow it to collect the contacts you want. After this you need to select the message tab.  From here write out a message that is targeted at your consumer audience here is what I use. \u201cHey {firstname}, My name is Kale and I run a growth marketing company with my business partner in the US and I'm a personal trainer too. I'm wanting to grow a stronger community of marketers and health professionals here locally in Otago and thought you would be a great connection to have. \u201c Hit save. Now select the Invite tab.  From here it will automatically invite 60 people a day on the free trial version and send the message you typed out to your leads saving you from having to do this manually. You can expect about a 40% acceptance rate when your profile is optimised. In a week you should be able to connect with over 200+ people and all for free. If you\u2019re finding success with this approach you\u2019ll probably want to pay to upgrade to the Enterprise License of LinkedIn Helper. 3. Create content that resonates 5 days a week I use my posts here on Quora and repurpose them for LinkedIn. What makes great content? Anything that is well written and has impact in the first two lines of text.  As you can see this post is enticing because it provides a question in the readers head and forces them to click the \u201c...see more\u201d. The other types of posts are gratitude posts that thank the people you\u2019ve learned from. This type of posting allows you to get in front of the audiences you\u2019ve connected with and allow you to establish some form of thought leadership. I plan my posts on Sunday\u2019s and have them pre-packaged throughout the week. 4. Getting in front of the right people Now that your profile has been optimised, you\u2019re connecting with people at scale and you have content that is getting views it\u2019s time to reach out to the people you want to work alongside. After my first thirty days of auto connecting and posting I started my outbound process. I would message ten people in my connections everyday to tell them about my business and asked them if there was anyone they knew who they thought I should get in contact with. Voil\u00e0! After the outreach process I began to pick up leads and was introduced to three new clients. By simply asking people for help they introduced me to people who they thought would be a great fit for me to connect with because of the content they had seen and as a result I was offered jobs and contracts. The second part of the equation is that LinkedIn had started boosting me organically to other people as a profile people needed to see. With this method I\u2019ve been able to secure more income and connections far above my pay grade. By using this method you\u2019ll be able to find a job in the city that you want in little to no time. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "There are three steps to find a job on LinkedIn: Find the job you want and apply for itResearch and connect with hiring executives directlyStay in touch with your contactMy LInkedIn success story It\u2019s thanks to LinkedIn I got my first job as a new immigrant to a country, just 2 weeks after I landed. The odds were against me due to a lack of local experience. The job was posted on LinkedIn. It was for a large telecommunications company in my field. It was perfect for me. Fortunately, the recruiter generously left her info on the posting, a setting that most recruiters turn off due to privacy. I contacted her directly thanks to LinkedIn Inmail (I was on the free premium plan). She replied. Turns out she wasn\u2019t the recruiter at all for this position. There was a goof up with HR, so she forwarded me the email address of the actual recruiter. One thing led to another and I got the job. A year later, I bumped into the real recruiter who hired me and asked him why he considered my application. He said the only reason he did was because he was contacted by email directly. I got my first job in Canada because of LinkedIn. But the tool alone will not help you. It\u2019s up to you to have the courage and drive to reach out to decision makers directly if you want to win the job from your competition (the hundreds of other applicants also applying for the same job as you and yes, also using LInkedIn) Step #1 Find the Job This is the easiest part. Find the job you want, and apply for it following the precise instructions provided on the online job application process. Step #2 Find the decision makers Here is the fun part. The part that most people skip. The part that will make the difference between you getting the job or being ignored. You have the company, you have the job title. Figure out who the hiring manager most likely will be by doing a people search and filter based on \u201cCurrent Company\u201d, \u201cJob Title\u201d, \u201cLocation\u201d. So if you\u2019re applying for a financial analyst at TD Bank in Toronto, search for the \u201cFinance Director\u201d whose current company is \u201cTD Bank\u201d and location is \u201cToronto\u201d. If you\u2019re not sure about the job title, just use the keyword \u201cFinance\u201d in the title. But be prepared to scroll through a longer list. Once the contact is found, send them a direct inmail message. Step #3 Stay In Touch Any one of three things can happen now: They respond positively and a conversation beginsThey tell you they are not the hiring manager, and you respond by asking who most likely is. Or they refer you to a contact in HR.They ignore you.If #1 happens, this is the best case scenario. If this happens, stay in touch with the person by constantly adding value to them. Share articles, news updates about the industry and their organization. People are busy. The only way to be remembered is by keeping touch. Even if an opportunity does not exist now, it will somewhere down the road. If #2 happens, not the best, but now you have pointer in the right direction. AND just as importantly, you have referral to the person they sent you to. You can introduce yourself to the new person by opening with, \u201cHi. John asked me to speak to you\u2026\u201d - much more powerful. If #3 happens, you screwed up your messaging. If your message sounds generic and copy pasted, senior execs can sniff that a mile away. They don\u2019t bother giving their attention to someone who has not taken the trouble to do a little bit of homework before reaching out. My quick suggestion is to research a little bit about the company or the person and inject that in your message as well. But that\u2019s a whole other topic on it\u2019s own. So now that you have the methodology down, you can confidentally apply for jobs on LinkedIn knowing that you can get a higher response rate. But remember, no matter how much effort you put in your job search from LinkedIn, it won\u2019t matter if your profile is not up to the mark. Here are some quick tips: No pic, no trust A representative from LinkedIn stated that having a profile picture increases your chances of your profile being viewed by 14 times. In certain parts of the world, like here in North America, it\u2019s considered discriminatory to add a pic to a resume. But one has to admit, there is a certain merit to a picture. It let\u2019s the recruiter and hiring manager get a perception of your personality just a little bit more than on paper. And that\u2019s really what they hire for. Make sure you get a professional head shot of you on LinkedIn. Recruiters are looking for you. But can you be found? According to the JobVite Recruiter Nation Report 2106, 87% of recruiters use LinkedIn to scout for candidates. This fact alone means you need a profile that shows up when they do a search for keywords. Recruiters will use their paid LinkedIn plan called LinkedIn Recruiter Lite and use it to type in keywords. \u201cSix Sigma\u201d \u201cPMP certified\u201d \u201c Chartered Accountant\u201d \u201cLeading Teams\u201d \u201cCollaborate\u201d - whatever skills and experience that the hiring manager conveyed s/he wanted to the recruiter, when they created this role. So you have to make sure that your Summary section and Experience and Skills has got these keywords they are looking for. This will get you organically showing up in searches. 3 Cs - Completeness, Connections and Consistency After you got the right keywords for your critical sections, you now need three other things to help you show up on searches. An All-Star profile. Fill in everything LinkedIn guides you to fill to get that all star profile upThe more connections you have, the more likely it is you will be found. By default, LinkedIn only displays up to 3rd degree connections for free, so the more connections you have, the more likely you will be found.Be active on LinkedIn helps you rank hire. You can use a tool like Klout to see how popular you are on LinkedIn.Establish your brand Now that you\u2019re getting found, you want to make sure that recruiters who are finding you are getting the right impression of you. If you are trying to get a job in IT, they should see technology all over you. If you are trying to get a job in healthcare, they should see medicine and health all over. This is where you activeness on LinkedIn comes in. They articles you share, the posts you write, the groups you join, the skills you have - all of these things form the brand that is you. For me personally, I\u2019m in the job search industry. So when you look at my activity, you will see me sharing posts about career advice, tips and tools you can use in your job search and resume writing guidelines. People who visit my profile are confident about what it is that I do, and that\u2019s what you want recruiters and hiring managers to feel when they visit your profile. Make connections the right way One of the most common (ad worst) mistakes I see people making on LinkedIn is connecting to people without a personalized message. This is a recipe for rejection. If you are on a desktop, click the Add Note Feature. If you are on iOS, click the 3 dots If you are on Android, click the little arrow. You have to personalize every connection request. You wouldn\u2019t see a movie without at least knowing something about it right? So don\u2019t send blank requests to people hoping they would connect. Provide some context and you will increase your chances of their approval 10 fold. Learn More A job search is a challenging time for anyone. But LinkedIn helped me get my dream job because I put in the effort to use it. It\u2019s now, more than ever, one of the most effective ways of being discovered online. It\u2019s the next best thing to networking in person. Considering that creating a stellar profile will take one weekend, and only one hour per day to effectively use it during a job search, you are well positioned to get that next job you deserve. The list above is by no means exhaustive and there\u2019s a lot more to cover. If you want to learn more, check out my blog post here, where I have highlighted step-by-step details of how you can achieve the above, and more. Anyone can put up a LinkedIn profile, but you need to be aware of the most common mistakes people make so that LinkedIn works for you. And remember what I said about having the right messaging in your InMail so that the decision maker does not ignore you? Here is an article I wrote with a structure you can follow on how to do that.
