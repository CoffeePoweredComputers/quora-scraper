            "answer_text": "Just focus on writing good content naturally. You will often find that you will have the focus keyword mentioned enough times for Google to search and index your page. You can mention the keyword a few times in your headings if needed, and a couple of times in your article where it makes most sense to use it. A lot of SEO people make it sound like this is harder than it actually is. I always found those requirements on freelance sites like Textbroker where people ask you to unnaturally mention a keyword 5\u20136 times to be quite ridiculous and unnecessary to be able to develop good SEO content.

            "answer_text": "In all honesty, the old rule of having the keyword repeated X amount of times in the content is the wrong way of optimising a page. Don\u2019t get me wrong, definitely make sure to get repetitions of the keyword in place, along with synonyms, but don\u2019t write the content thinking \u201cright, I\u2019ve got to get 5 repetitions of \u2018x\u2019 phrase in place\u201d I guarantee you, if you write the content for the purpose it\u2019s supposed to be on a website for, which is to give visitors information and provide an actual service, then you\u2019ll naturally have the right amount of repetitions in place without any effort and it\u2019ll read much better - which is what Google looks at. Focus on writing good quality content that actually serves a purpose. ",
