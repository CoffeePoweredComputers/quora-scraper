            "answer_text": "To show you the benefit of leaving comments on other blogs, I decided to run a test in which I left 249 comments on other people\u2019s blogs in the month of October. Those 249 comments resulted in 3,973 visitors and 6 consulting leads. And although I don\u2019t do much consulting, I was able to turn one of those leads into a $25,000 corporate speaking gig. A few basic stats The majority of the comments on the web are spam comments. Akismet, a tool that helps stop spam comments, sees over 7.5 million spam comments every hour. The other major group of comments is basic comments, when the commenter is just saying \u201cthanks\u201d or \u201cawesome blog post.\u201d I put in a custom URL in the \u201cURL field\u201d so I could track the number of clicks and leads I was generating, and my experiment confirmed that leaving either of those types of comments won\u2019t help you. Out of the 249 comments I left, the first 25 were basic. I only wrote a phrase or a sentence such as this one:  They didn\u2019t add any value to the conversation, and they only generated 82 visitors. In essence, I was generating 3.2 visitors per comment. The remaining 224 comments drove 3,891 visitors. These comments were 4 to 17 sentences long. They added value to the conversation and took only 1 to 2 minutes to craft.  These comments were generating 17.4 visitors per comment. So, if you are going to leave comments, make sure you read the blog post first, and take your time to craft a thoughtful comment. Don\u2019t expect your rankings to skyrocket Even though I ran this test during the month of October, I\u2019ve actually been commenting on other marketing blogs for years. When you comment on these blogs, they \u2018nofollow\u2019 the link going to your website. These blogs are telling search engines such as Google to not count that link when ranking your website. I\u2019ve seen this to be true. When you comment on other people\u2019s blogs, you won\u2019t see a ranking increase. Or at least it\u2019s been my experience with all of my blogs. So when commenting, don\u2019t do it for higher rankings. Instead, do it for traffic, branding, and conversions. Be careful which blogs you comment on If you are trying to gain traffic and business like me, don\u2019t just comment on any blog. When I commented on marketing-related articles on popular blogs such as Huffington Post, it didn\u2019t do much. It drove visitors but no conversions. Why? These popular blogs write about every topic out there, and their visitors aren\u2019t nearly as interested in any particular topic as the readers of niche blogs are. In addition to avoiding commenting on generic mainstream blogs, you should also avoid commenting on competitor blogs as a common courtesy. Sure, there may be rare instances where it may be all right to comment on competing blogs, but in general, you should avoid them. So, what blogs should you comment on? Not all blogs produce the same results As I mentioned earlier, out of the 249 comments I left, 25 were basic\u2026 so that leaves 224 comments. Here\u2019s where the 224 comments were left:  As you can see, I left 52 comments on mainstream blogs such as Huffington Post, 100 on industry blogs, and 72 on guest posts that I wrote and published around the web. From a traffic perspective, each of those channels drove anywhere from 6 to 59 visitors per comment. What I noticed is that if I wrote a comment within the first hour of the post being published and my comment was higher on the page, it drove more traffic. From a conversion standpoint, all of the leads came from commenting on guest posts that I wrote. So, it is worth commenting at all? Every month, I guest-post on sites such as Entrepreneur Magazine, Hubspot, Forbes, Inc Magazine, and a handful of other blogs. So, I decided to check how many leads came from my guest posts that I wasn\u2019t commenting on, which is the majority of them. Shockingly, it was zero! That\u2019s right, when I write a guest post and I don\u2019t respond to comments, it typically generates no leads. Sure, I generated traffic and maybe even some backlinks, but no leads. But when I commented on my guest posts, I generated 7 leads. That\u2019s a huge difference, considering that one of the leads resulted in $25,000 in revenue. From a branding perspective, commenting is worth it. I\u2019ve had two people mention to me that they have seen my name pop up more often on industry-related blogs. Plus, your comments will help you generate traffic, brand your business, and mark you as an expert within your industry. If you happen to write guest posts, make sure you respond to comments as it generates leads and loyalty. Whether you guest-post or not, you should consider commenting on blogs within your industry. You don\u2019t have to do it at the volume I did, but doing it even on a smaller scale can help you with branding. I know I will continue commenting. And when possible, I will comment more on the guest posts I publish as the preliminary results look good. ",

            "answer_text": " Is blog commenting still effective in 2018? Abso-frickin-lutely. Think about it - Google loooooves long posts. It rewards long posts with higher tankings, especially when you have lots of relevant keywords within your posts. Everyone knows this, it\u2019s SEO 101. But, what\u2019s harder for you, as the content creator, is coming up with the ideas, time and creativity to write looooooong, informative posts that Google loves. The solution? Blog comments! You write a post that\u2019s say, 500 words. Google would prefer one that\u2019s 5,000 but hey, who has time for that? So what do you do? And how do you make up the gap of 4,500 words Google wants to see in order to reward you with better page rankings (which brings traffic. Which brings sales. Which brings you money\u2026)? You let other people write all the other words through blog comments on your post. I\u2019ve been doing this for a while now and believe me, it works.  I write a post that\u2019s 1,000 words or so, then woth all the comments it soon becomes a post of 4\u20135,000 words. Happy days. I get the page ranking rewards yet I only wrote 30% or less of the content. Little ripper! So how do you get the comments? This in itself is a little trickier. I\u2019ve tried lots of (white hat) ways but I\u2019ve settled on one that never fails. I use a community blogging system that gives credit for all sorts of contributions on the site. It\u2019s a minefield for learning about earning online so I\u2019m on it every day. Whenever I make a contribution, I get credit. Then I can trade those credits to get targeted, insightful comments on my blog posts. Happy days. I do that for every post I write. And I\u2019m currently on page 1 of Google search rankings for over 60 keywords. You can imagine the traffic that comes from that. If you\u2019d like to learn more about the online community system I use, I\u2019ve written a long, informative post about it. Just click here to access it. ",
