            "answer_text": "Read my answer here. I have given a complete steps to get your app on both Google Play Store as well as Apple App Store. How do you get your smartphone app onto Google Play and the Apple Store after development? Note: Google has changed the app approval time from instant to 3 days minimum. After you submit your app for approval you may not see the app on Play Store for 3 days or until approved by Google. This is to ensure quality of the apps. If it is rejected for some reasons and you apply for a review it might take even longer. So ensure that your app is up to date and completely bug free. Also ensure that pricing is correct or at least on par with competition since poor ratings may lead to the app from removal in the store. Happy coding!!! ",
