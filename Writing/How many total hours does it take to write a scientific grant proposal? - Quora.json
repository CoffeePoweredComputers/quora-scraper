            "answer_text": "As a \"rule of thumb,\" expect to devote 1 week of your life to writing a R01 equivalent grant application. That does not mean you will write it in a week, but that you should carve out 40-60 hours in your schedule.  If this is your first time at the rodeo, then double that number--expect 80-120 hours. That is truly a daunting amount of time, but you will get faster in time. Also, you may not have to do all of that work. Collaborators, partners, graduate students, post docs, staff scientists, and even your family members can pitch in to help.  Because the likelihood of winning funding is low, most early stage investigators submit multiple grant proposals per year until they win a large grant. For tenure track faculty at research intensive universities, it is not unusual to write 4 or more federal grant applications and a few smaller proposals to associations or foundation.  Now the time adds up. Grant writing takes a month out of scientists' lives each year. That is what makes the process so onerous. The relentless treadmill of grant writing, which must be done in researcher's scarce free time on top of publishing, teaching, and doing actual work in the lab. I have a few suggestions to help you save aggravation and make a better quality application: Talk to the Funder (Call/Email Program Officers) Talk to your program officer at the funding agency. This should be something that you want to do. I have seen program officers give important information that saved an application from rejection. Program officers want to help applicants and are usually responsive. Sometimes they get overwhelmed, so reach out multiple times.  Program officers can only help you if you've done legwork. Prepare questions and send them your specific aims, if available.  Bring Mentors on Board The secret weapon that applicants have is their relationships with scientists who have won grants. One reason that some departments have success is that they read each other's grants and give useful feedback. Often, scientists who have won grants sit on grant panels. They can tell you how your Aims are weak.  Sometimes new investigators say their senior faculty are busy. Yes, they are, but you'd rather get feedback from someone who is productive. By asking for help, you are establishing a relationship. Then, over time, it will be easier to bring others on board to review your drafts.   There truly is sharing among scientists, but you won't see grant proposals shared on the internet. Ask people to see their work and offer to sign an NDA. They are not only helping you. But, you are helping them because they read your work and get fresh ideas about presenting work.  Use Your Institutional Resources Some of the indirect costs in your project budget goes to research administration. You may be surprised how helpful your sponsored research office is. They are very good at establishing timelines because they know a late grant is heartbreaking--wasted time and effort.  If you are in a private company, you can consult with the Chief Financial Officer to develop a budget, the office administrators to compile documentation, and the Chief Scientific Officer to review the aims and serve as a collaborator on the grant.  In summary, the amount of time to write a scientific grant proposal is A LOT! But, you have a lot of control in this process. You can take the shortest road possible. ",
