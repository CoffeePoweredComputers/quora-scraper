            "answer_text": "It's ten cents a word, which is not terrible by industry standards. The other question to ask is whether $50 makes the assignment worthwhile for you. Can you write it in an amount of time that will also let you hit your daily income goal? For instance, if your goal is to make $200 a day, working four hours, and you can write this particular piece in half an hour, take it. It fits perfectly in your time versus money plan. But if this piece has a totally unfamiliar topic you'll need to research for four hours before you even start writing, it doesn't fit your system and you should not take it. Even though ten cents a word is okay for the industry, ten cents a word for this particular article is not okay for you and your system. ",
