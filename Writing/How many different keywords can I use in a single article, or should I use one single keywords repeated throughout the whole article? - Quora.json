You do not want to keyword stuff at any point because both the user will figure it out and so will Google\u2019s algorithm. In all honesty it is all about the article. Is it answering a question or providing value to the user who reads the content within your website or blogging platform. As long as you are not forcing the keywords into any content that is being created you will be ok. The flow of the story is going to be important no matter how long the article is. You do not want to create a blog with 300 words and 8 keywords forced into the content. Flesh out the content to work so your keywords compliment your content. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to ensure that you are reaching the right target audience for your article then it is best to include various different keywords within it. If you use the same keyword too many times within an article it could have an adverse affect on how search engines such as Google see it. In many cases you may find that your article doesn\u2019t show up as how in the rankings as you hoped as they look at it being somewhat spammy. I hope this helps with answering your question and if you require any further help then please don\u2019t hesitate to leave a comment. ",
