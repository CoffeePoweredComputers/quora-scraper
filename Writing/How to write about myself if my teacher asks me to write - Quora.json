            "answer_text": "Your teacher is likely to be in possession of certain basic facts about you; such as your Name, Class & Section, Roll No., Date Of Birth, etc. So, apart from your name, you can safely skip most of the above. Try for an informal conversational tone in the first person while writing about yourself. While doing this, try to avoid overuse of the personal pronoun \u201cI\u201d. Get a family member to vet your written profile for factual accuracy afterwards and to further ensure you don\u2019t end up sounding pompous or self-important. Are there any amusing/interesting anecdotes about your life experiences outside school, your hobbies and interests that help illuminate your character and personality? if so, use these. A good model for this kind of writing were the brief write-ups on authors that prefaced Penguin Books in paperback. ",

            "answer_text": "If you write nothing except the boring facts, name, date of birth, where you went to school - it won\u2019t be interesting to read. Try to make it personal - things you remember about your birthplace, anything that happened to you growing up that was unusual, bring into it other family members and your relationship to them, how they influenced you - the more interesting details the better. Every person is unique in their very special way - tell about how that applies to YOU. Use spell-check - teachers notice misspelled words. Keep it to one page, double-spaced. ",
