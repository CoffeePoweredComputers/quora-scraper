            "answer_text": "For two reasons people enjoys comedies. Reason 1: Human brains are chemically wired (as it is bound to the human DNA) to feel good or relaxed (thus enjoying) when they laugh and comedies or any humorous contents are thoughtfully made for causing the audience laugh. Now, there might be questions, \u201cHow laughter causes the feeling of relaxation?\u201d and \u201cHow humorous contents work to make people laugh?\u201d. Answer to the first question is, when a human brain laughs (brain! yes, actually the laughter happens in the brain, then we express that with our face and sounds), it releases Endorphins and Dopamine, two organic chemicals, which are neurohormones for Happiness and Pleasure respectively. Answer to the second question is, you have to know how Humour works, humour is like a three-phase movie, where the first phase has to have a certain situation set-up, the second phase has to have an action or expectation set-up and the third phase has to have an Unexpected result or Opposite ending to the ending the audience would naturally expect. So the comedy writer or material creator would plan the acts or the jokes as if the ending will not be commonly or scientifically obvious. Also, the comedy act or joke must be Sense-making at the end, not like an unrelated or non-understandable movie. The Relief Theory of Humor supports this concept. When the brain tries to understand the total scenario, it suddenly realizes the ending was twisted and all of the psychological tension that it has accumulated for the expectation becomes useless, in other words, the spare mental energy is still available to use, it relieves its nervousness as a form of laughter. The Relief Theory of Laughter and Homeostatic mechanisms in humans support this idea. Reason 2: Humans are born curious, in other words our brains are chemically wired to feel the urge to know about something they still don\u2019t know. Which means, whenever a human finds a topic or information is not known to him/her, he/she tries to explore or investigate on that topic. Curiosity is a function and emotion of brain to develop itself and as the Dopamine releases (again! yes curiosity initiates pleasure hormone to make you feel comfortable to know more), the brain tries more to know about the unknown. It becomes a habit of the brain and whenever we find another probably unknown topic, our brain releases dopamine and jumps into exploration. Thus, curiosity requires homeostatic regulation, which means we can\u2019t be mentally stable without knowing about the topic. So, whenever we find a piece of comedy or humorous content, as we know it will make us laughing and bring pleasure, we watch it or hear it to find if it has anything to know that we didn\u2019t know. Also, whenever we find a new piece of comedy, we want to know about the context and ending of that new movie(!), that we don\u2019t (or may not) know. For the same reason, we watch or hear another piece of comedy soon after the first one and another one, until we become tired or thoughtful about any other subject of our daily lives. The sense of humor can be different from human to human and the comedy structure or result can be different (may fail to make people laugh) but the common human behaviors (to laugh at a humorous content and to explore the unknown) will be always existing.

            "answer_text": "Everyone needs some comedic relief. Imagine you had a long, hectic day. You want to unwind. You want to forget about what happened in a meeting, something stupid someone did, something absolutely wrong that someone said. You turn on the television. You choose a comedy or a stand up comedian to watch. In the film there are so many silly things you cannot help but laugh. Even if you think something is stupid, you will laugh. The protagonists are nerds with no chance for the hottest girl, or someone too stupid for their own good that makes you wonder how they are a CEO of a large corporation. The sequence of events just gets better, your smile gets bigger. Soon enough, you forget all about your day. The best part is watching a comedian, and they will rip on themselves! It takes a strong yet honest person to be able to make fun of themselves in front of so many people. What does this do for the person watching? Makes them realize it can be funny to beat themselves up instead of being so serious. We should laugh at ourselves all the time. Try watching one! ",
