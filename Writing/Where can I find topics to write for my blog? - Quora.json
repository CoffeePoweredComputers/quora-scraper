            "answer_text": "I agree with Paige Turner. When Newton discovered gravity by observing a fallen apple, there were unpublished writings trying to debunk the idea that he was the pioneer behind this discovery. In other words, the same thoughts and ideas may generate from different people. It's a matter of timing or circumstances that make one original and the others sequels. JUST KEEP WRITING. 1. Observe the Crowd I watch people in the middle of a long traffic and I thought about writing how poor the government is. This is of course a broad topic to start with but I write not like reporter and a few viewers may find it interesting because I explain not just facts but emotions. 2. Read a book I love reading Paulo Coelho and Michael Crichton. After reading their book, I felt so inspired to write my own. I rewrite the plot in my mind and created a different ending. Sometimes, when I edit the entire story and read it to a friend, they never knew it was inspired by another author. But I guess, that\u2019s basically what we do as writers. We don\u2019t have to compete with each other but we inspire one another. 3. Watch a movie I am amazed by motion pictures. I always find joy watching movies. Although the usual comment is that motion pictures are so much different than the real plot in the book, I tried to do one thing \u2013 skip the book and watch the movie or vice versa. Either way, you will see how people react and from there, you will understand how you want your audience to capture your story. 4. Write about what you love most. There is no easier way to find ideas than inside your own cup of coffee. Find something you enjoy and soon enough all the words will start coming out your head. Besides being an easy topic for you. It\u2019s a good starter than trying to deal with topics popular but not in line with your experience, learning or even taste. Identifying yourself as a literary writer, a reporter, a book author, a poet or short story writer is also something to choose from before going through topics of your choice. That way, you know basically what you want to write about and the topics most interesting in your line of thoughts. Hope these tips help. ",
