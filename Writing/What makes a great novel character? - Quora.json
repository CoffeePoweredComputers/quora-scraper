            "answer_text": "It is very important that the reader falls in love with your hero/heroine.  A reader must worry and care what happens to them.  Without that, your story will be flat.  All good books are character driven.  You can have the best, most wonderful story in the world, but if the reader doesn't care if your hero dies or not, they won't read the book. The hero drives the story. (And I use the word hero, but it could be a man or a woman.) He has to have a visible goal,which is his outer motivation for what he does, and an inner goal, which is something in his past that is holding him back. The inner turmoil could be a longing or need, a deeply held desire that he is afraid to go after; or an old wound from the past that your hero suppressed but is still affecting his life; or a strong belief such as \u2018if I love I will be hurt\u2019; or a fear of experiencing the pain he has felt before.You must have him conquer this inner torment by the end.  The hero has to grow in order for you to reach a satisfying ending to your outer story.  Let's say our hero was hired to blow up a building.  In this version we don't know anything about him, his background, why he even took this type of job.  We don't like him very much. If he sets the bomb and completes the job, that's not a very interesting read.  But what if he falls in love with the lady who works in the coffee shop on the first floor, and finds out there's a day care center on the 10th floor with 42 little kids in it?  Now, he's conflicted. He saw kids being hurt in the war and he wants no part of this. He tries to back out, but the bad guys are pushing him to complete the job or else they're going to hurt his own daughter.  Now we have a good story going -- and the reader's attention.   There are five ways to initially draw your reader to the hero. Chose two to work with and be sure to include them in the first few pages of your book. Hook the reader right away.  1) Create sympathy, make him the victim of something or some undeserved misfortune.  2) Put him in jeopardy, make us worry about him.  3) Make him likable or liked by others.  4) Make him funny.  5) Make him powerful in some good way.   In order to createa memorable character you, as the writer, must know him inside and out.  Know what makes him tick, what makes him mad,what makes him act out.  Then you willknow how he will react when you put him in danger, or threaten to ruin hisbusiness, or have his lovers leave him. Create a background story for him. There are lots of character checklists you can find on the Internet, but don't spend too much time on it.  His favorite color is probably not all thatimportant to the story. Focus on the items on the list that carved out his personalityand/or made him the man he is today. Think out your characters.  Did they have a crappy childhood?  Were they rich?  Poor? Mom was a drunk?  Dad was in jail?  Did they have a privileged life?  Were they in the military and saw despicable behavior?  Did they take part in it?  All these things will shape who they are and how they deal with the situations you're going to put them into,and how they will react to others, especially the love interest.  Make them interesting and not clich\u00e9d.  They can be tough but remember we have to like them, so don't make them too cold. Give them a soft side.  A hero always does the right thing, even if his behavior is not always perfect.  Make sure your character cares passionately about what is happening.  Give him emotions.  If he doesn't care, why should the reader?  Also give him a flaw.  Nobody is perfect and we hate reading about perfect people.  We want to relate to the character; we want to become them. And we want him to solve his problem.   Just a quick note on naming your characters.  Don't use a name so difficult the reader can\u2019t pronounce it.  Don't have a John and a Jake and a Jerry.  Too confusing.  Use names that fit the personality and the time you are writing in. For example very few young girls are named Gertrude today but that was a popular name in the  20s. ",

            "answer_text": "Excellent question! A good character, especially the main character, is observant (seeing they\u2019re your camera) and has an essential problem within themselves. They want two contradictory things, they have contradictions within their natures which might be hidden until pressure is put on them. A good character is strong enough to stand up to the other characters in a novel\u2014this is called \u201ccharacter orchestration.\u201d They should be strong enough to stand up to pressure, but not so strong that they can\u2019t be touched, pressured or wounded by life. Even if they\u2019re very sensitive, they have something in them that doesn\u2019t completely give up under pressure. Secondary characters can be anything at all. It\u2019s a broad generalization, but antagonists generally need to be stronger than protagonists. They\u2019re often more vibrant and sure of themselves. Protagonists struggle to stand up to them, and often change as a result of the struggle. Antagonists know who they are and generally do not change. Protagonists have to get stronger if they want to wrestle their antagonists. As in a dream, my characters are usually all pieces of myself. I take certain qualities of myself and hand them to this or that character, and then watch them fight it out. So, for example, in my new novel\u2014The Revolution of Marina M.\u2014I give my dogmatic intellectual idealism to one character\u2014 Varvara\u2014and my passion and risk-taking and self-confidence o my protagonist\u2014Marina, and my good-girl A-student self to another\u2014 Mina. Then watch them interact. A good character is like a good actor\u2014you can\u2019t stop watching them. ",

            "answer_text": "Several things: 1) Clear motivations. There\u2019s a purpose behind what this character does, whether good, evil, or somewhere in between. He or she doesn\u2019t just go kissing or killing people for no apparent reason. Motivations may appear vague at times, but as long as they\u2019re explained at some point, you\u2019re golden. People dislike loose ends. 2) Change. Good characters experience changes. They don\u2019t just remain static and unchanging\u2014people, experiences, and situations force changes in them, whether for the good, bad, or whatever else. Along the ride, characters should be changed by the events that occur. They need not experience grand revelations, but there should be apparent changes between Chapter 1 and The End. Maybe the hero saves his brother and becomes world renowned. Maybe he discovers he\u2019s not cut out for a life of adventure. Maybe the queen discovers she loves life on the road instead of being pampered by her servants. Maybe the sheep learns that not all wolves are bloodthirsty sheep-killing monsters\u2026.or the sheep learns that his belief in the goodness of wolves was ill-founded, because he finds all wolves ARE bloodthirsty sheep-killing monsters. And, as always, \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell\u201d. Not so great: \u201cHey Mary, you know what I learned during this adventure? That I hate quests.\u201d Better: Jack ripped off his backpack and kicked it down the basement stairs. \u201cGonna stick around awhile, Jack?\u201d Mary said, fiddling with a loose strand of hair. \u201cI was thinking I\u2019d spend the next year or two at the pub. I\u2019m probably way behind on the local gossip,\u201d Jack said, sinking onto the sofa with a tired sigh. Not so good: \u201cPermit me to open the door for you, Your Majesty,\u201d the servant said, bowing. \u201cNo,\u201d Queen Ellen said, \u201cI don\u2019t need you to do that for me anymore. On my travels, I discovered that I prefer doing things for myself instead of letting servants wait on me hand and foot. I also learned that it\u2019s wrong to treat people like I\u2019m better than them just because they\u2019re peasants and I was born into a royal family.\u201d Better: \u201cPermit me to open the door for you, Your Majesty,\u201d the servant said, bowing. \u201cNo need,\u201d Queen Ellen replied, pulling the door open. \u201cBut if you\u2019re free this afternoon, I\u2019d enjoy your company for a game of chess. How\u2019s your Schonfeld Defense these days, Martin?\u201d \u201cQuite\u2026quite good, Your Majesty,\u201d Martin stammered. \u201cThen I\u2019ll meet you in the garden at two,\u201d Queen Ellen said, touching the servant\u2019s shoulder lightly. \u201cAnd by the way,\u201d she added with a grin, \u201cMy name isn\u2019t \u2018Your Majesty\u2019. It\u2019s Ellen.\u201d They don\u2019t have to be drastic or crazy changes, but they should be in some way notably different. Let your imagination fly free. Let the events inspire changes in people\u2019s thoughts, words, actions, and decisions, and you\u2019ll do just fine. 3) Agent of action. Your main character should be the agent of action. He or she should be the one who drives the plot forward. Don\u2019t let them sit around wondering what happened, or crying \u201cWhat do we do now, Sheriff?\u201d Your main character should be the one springing into action, having ideas, making bold moves, having zany ideas, etc. This is especially true in children\u2019s literature. Your main character is the leading man or lady\u2026everyone else is playing supportive roles. Unless weakness and indecisiveness is part of that character\u2019s persona, of course\u2026then you can flip the switch and make that wobbly personality work for you. Maybe their waffling nature IS the reason the plot moves forward. Maybe the president needs to make a decision, and he or she doesn\u2019t\u2026so The Enemy drops The Bomb. Maybe good Sir Edward is usually strong and decisive, but he was drinking at his brother\u2019s birthday party the day The Enemy invaded, so he\u2019s temporarily indecisive or not thinking clearly\u2026and all hell breaks lose. Above all, use your creativity. For every trope, there\u2019s an anti-trope\u2026for every tired old approach, there\u2019s a way to flip it around and make it work for you. If you commit to it and think it through, just about any method can work if you believe it can. Just remember: you can do ANYTHING in fiction. There are no boundaries and no limits. Your imagination can make anything great. There\u2019s no such thing as bad writing\u2026.there\u2019s only ordinary writing. Make it crazy, make it sad, make it fun, make it zany, make it dramatic\u2026just don\u2019t make it mundane. ",

            "answer_text": "A great novel character is one who is thought-provoking and realistic. They feel the same emotions that we do and they make the same decisions that we make, even when they know that the action that they are taking is wrong. Sure, a hero who makes an important sacrifice, such as Sydney Carton from A Tale of Two Cities, is exciting, but would he have been truly that memorable if he wasn\u2019t depressed or an alcoholic? What makes his sacrifice most noble is that he was the character that no one would\u2019ve expected to take the fall. Let\u2019s look at another literary example: the Count of Monte Cristo. Now why does he stand out? Why are so many English teachers bent on analyzing his persona? Let\u2019s look at the facts. He was initially a kind-hearted man who was unnecessarily alienated by three greedy men (all for different reasons of course). Now what is the first thing he does after escaping a hellish life and acquiring much wealth? Take revenge on all the men who wronged him in a very calculated manner. He didn\u2019t do the \u201cright thing\u201d at all. The right thing would\u2019ve been to forgive and forget as they say, but yet Edmond Dantes failed to acknowledge the saying \u201can eye for an eye makes the whole world blind\u201d. This is evident as he did bring a man to ruin by destroying his credibility and another by ripping apart his family. He even led one to commit suicide. Dantes was the anti-hero. He served justice to three characters who committed wrong towards him. It\u2019s likely that most people would\u2019ve felt the same way he did when he discovered that he was unduly wronged. Would we have served such twisted justice? I certainly hope not, but his emotional response was one that most people feel. He was angry and upset, unwilling to forgive. That\u2019s what makes him memorable. He was a human in every way. While I am willing to admit that Atticus Finch, one of literature\u2019s most upstanding people, is a character that really stood out to me, I will say that the majority of the characters that I find GREAT were people who faced dilemma, who occasionally led a less than ideal life, and maybe did some \u201cbad\u201d things. It\u2019s because we too have these same struggles yet in the end have positive motives. Unfortunately, in this imperfect world, among every Atticus Finch, there exists a countless number of Bob Ewells. However, within this world, there also exists imperfect people, like Dantes and Carton, whose inherent good make society a better place. ",

            "answer_text": "Realistic - whatever 'good' personality traits you give them, they must also have flaws. A character with no flaws whatsoever is boring, unrealistic, and unrelatable. However, you can play with this expectation in that their lack of flaws IS there flaw. I wouldn't recommend this, however, from personal experience.Name - I personally don't care about a character's name unless it's something RIDICULOUS or difficult to pronounce. But I received flack about names that were a bit too uncommon, such as Charmaine or Lysander in my FANTASY story. Make sure the names matches the genre and time period of what you're writing.Backstory - A good backstory and motive can be enticing. How to bring this about effectively will depend on your skills and style as a writer. S/he doesn't have to have dead parents or anything, but we would want to know more (unless the character works better with a strong sense of mystery - it all depends on the genre and type of character!)STORY - No matter how great your characters are, they can't reach their max potential unless you have a good story for them to be in. It's the same the other way around - no matter how awesome your story is, if your characters aren't resonating with the audience, you won't have a 'good' novel. ",

            "answer_text": "A measure of a character in any medium can be broken down into three things: Their need: A three dimensional character is going to need something personal and compelling. For example, I could want a new pair of underwear (personal), but it isn't going to matter to anyone (compelling), unless I translate the situation into a universal experience (like a dreamscape where I find myself naked in a public place).Distance from their need: a good writer will place her characters as far as is reasonably possible from their objectives. The more central the character, the greater distance the goal should be. The distance should also fit the genre. Short stories, novels, feature films, or series all should have different distances to travel. This is why many tv series' plots tend to fall short in the second season (or reset themselves). The protagonists have often achieved their goals.How they deal with obstacles: whether you are writing a saint or a devil, there are always things your characters will or won't do. Stay true to that. Give them tactics that they rely on. Give them weaknesses to overcome. The most important thing to remember, though, is: Be Consistent. Stories are about people being put in situations where they have to decide whether or not to do that one thing they would never normally do. You need to earn those moments by being consistent. Your character will ultimately choose to do or not do that thing (and his decision will be based on your theme), but that is what we pay our $20 to read about. We just spent a week, absorbed in this person's life, building up to the question: will they, or won't they?",

            "answer_text": "1. I think if the character is unique, he will become memorable to the reader.  2. The name of the character must fit his/her/its personality.  3. The character's personality/appearance/traits should be convincing. Example, if writing about a character in the 18th century Britain, some keywords are: wore knee-length trouser like garments called breeches and stockings, waistcoats and frock coats etc. enjoyed chess, drafts, dominoes, rode horses etc. 4. The character's background/history helps to develop him/her. Answer questions like: how did the character come to this point? what happened in the past that made him/her change his/her personality. 5. Let the reader know what are the character's goals, what problem has he/she faced, how will he/she solve it? More importantly, let the reader see the character's view from his/her perspective. 6. Let the reader relate to the character in some ways. 7.Remember to be unique and appealing.    ",
