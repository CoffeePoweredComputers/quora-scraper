            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t say for sure, but if I had to guess, I would answer Pashto, or one of the Pamiri languages, owing to their close proximity to where Avestan is thought to have been spoken in north-eastern Iran. Yaghnobi might also be a candidate. Persian arose further south, and would likely be more distant to Avestan than any of these other guys. In linguistics, this sort of \u201cclosest\u201d questions are very hard to answer, since languages usually exist as dialect continua, and a single standardization might share some features with one part of the dialect continuum, and other features with another. Even western Iranic languages, like Persian or Kurdish, and especially the Caspian languages, might share significant features with Avestan. If I had to choose one at gunpoint, however, I\u2019d go with one of the Pamiri languages. ",

It belongs to the same branch as Pashto, but it would have been more similar to Pashto\u2019s ancestor than to the modern language itself. And since Avestan was close to Old Persian, it would be somewhat true that Persian would most likely be the closest language to it. If we talk about languages which are generally considered to be close to Avestan, then it would be Vedic Sanskrit and the Old Persian language, which was used during the Achaemenid empire. Vedic Sanskrit and Avestan are considered sister languages and to be very similar to each other in multiple parts. EASTERN IRANIAN LANGUAGES AVESTAN LANGUAGE I-III Vedic Sanskrit ",
