            "answer_text": "A common noun is a name that can be used for any member of a class, such as \u201cbook, knife, tree, water, beauty\u201d etc. A common noun is not the name of one particular person or thing. Yes \u2013 rules of English grammar compulsorily require the usage of the definite article \u201cthe\u201d before a common noun. Let us examine some: 1) when the situation is sufficient to make clear who or what is referred to: Eg: (1) Please take these letters to the post office .. (the nearest post office or the one regularly visited); (2) Please close the window (the window that is open or that is close (near) to a person whom you are asking to close it). 2) with a noun when it stands for something unique: the Sun, the Moon, the Year 1997 3) before seas and oceans \u2013 the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, The Atlantic (Ocean), the Indian Ocean 4) before rivers and canals \u2013 the Suez Canal, the River Thames 5) before plural geographical names \u2013 the Alps, the Philippines, the West Indies, the Netherlands 6) before certain other geographical names \u2013 the Sudan, the Congo, the Sahara, the Sundarban. 7) before nationality adjectives / nouns to talk about people \u2013 The Japanese, Americans, and even the French and Germans, judge economic policies by result. 8) with nouns such as sea, sky, wind etc. (used when the situation is sufficient to make clear who or what is referred to Eg: the sea was calm; there is an aeroplane in the sky; Isn\u2019t the wind strong? See how the sentence changes with the use of an adjective before the noun (definite article the becomes indefinite article a/an): Eg: There was a calm sea. / What a stormy looking sky! / There was a strong wind. 9) with superlative adjectives or adverbs: Eg: the best way to get there is \u2026\u2026. / the tallest of the five men / the most interesting book I have ever read. Note: when the superlative \u2018most\u2019 means \u2018very\u2019, the definite article is omitted: Eg: The story was most exciting / This is a most useful reference. 10) with each of two comparative adjectives or adverbs: Eg: the longer you have been in shape in the past the quicker you will regain fitness in future / the more confidence you build up in yourself, the greater are your chances of success. 11) with a singular common noun to denote the whole class: Eg: Is it true that the owl cannot see well in daylight. Note: In informal English the use of the plural without the definite article is more usual. Eg: Is it true that owls cannot see well in daylight. 12) in front of some nouns that refer to something in our general experience of the world: Eg: the future, the darkness, 13) in front of nouns that refer to people, things, services, or institutions that are associated with everyday life: the doctor, the phone, the train, the electricity, the police, the fridge. 14) instead of a possessive determiner (especially when you are talking about someone\u2019s parts of body, family etc.) Eg: How\u2019s the family? (instead of how\u2019s your family?) / I patted him on the hand (instead of on his hand) / 15) Before words such as \u2018rich, poor, old, unemployed\u2019 etc. to refer to all people of a particular group. Eg: Conditions for the poor in certain areas of the country have not improved. 16) before certain noun clauses: Eg: the top of the blackboard / the left side of the road / the books I have in my collection 17) before certain adjectives: Eg: the impossible 18) to refer to a married couple or a family as a whole: Eg: the Mehtas, the Modis, the Trumps 19) before some title nouns: the Times of India; the Hindu; the BJP, the Parliament House 20) before ordinal numbers: on the fifth May; the twenty-first century; for the first time 21) before numbers referring to decades: in the thirties 22) before music instruments: Eg: to play the piano / to play the violin Note: The definite article is not used before the names of games: Eg: to play tennis / football, cards, chess, billiards etc. Finally, (1) note the change from the indefinite article to the definite article: An old man and an old woman once lived in a small hut by a river near a forest (all indefinite articles a/an). One day the old man left the hut and went into the forest to gather wood. The old woman went to the river to wash clothes (all indefinite articles changed to the definite article the). (2) You can omit the in many phrases: Eg: from beginning to end / from (the) top to (the) bottom; in future.
