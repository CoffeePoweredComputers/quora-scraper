            "answer_text": "Hi there.. I can tell you of English Olympiad. However, essay writing competitions won't help you to write on any topic. It will just mark you. Why? Their evaluation is shrouded and obscure.You only get to know how much you scored.And I feel, unless I know where I went wrong, what are my weak and strong points, and unless I am advised personally by my teacher, I can't improve.  For instance, at school, we had to write essays in our exams. Those were unseen and unknown topics which we had to write on the spot. Our teacher used to correct and read through those essays and you will be surprised that she talked with each student on the faults and strong points. What she told me~ My strong points- I use simple words.I make less or no grammatical mistakes and spelling mistakes.I write short sentences.I refer to proverbs and sayings.My weak points~ I tend to repeat the same word and point.I should improve my stock of words.This was her assessment in Class X.  I think I have improved because today, after I write a paragraph, I always check whether I have repeated a word. If I see that I have repeated, I replace a word carefully with a close synonym.  Hence, it will be my humble suggestion to you, To concentrate on the process of evaluation by a teacher.Get your essay checked by a teacher and ask him/her about your mistakes.Think of ways to reduce your mistakes or ask him/her on measures to improve. Good luck:-) ",
