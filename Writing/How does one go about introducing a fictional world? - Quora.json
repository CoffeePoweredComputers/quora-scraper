            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll just add the iceberg analogy, which goes for world building as well as characters. Only 10% is visible to your reader, while you know the other 90%. That 90% is still important, because it informs how you write your plot, your magic system, and your characters, but the reader doesn\u2019t need to see it because it\u2019s not relevant to the main plot line. Brandon Sanderson\u2019s third law of magic/world building is to expand on what you have already, before you add something new. This means that the writer identifies a relatively small number of the facets of their world and portrays them in great depth throughout the story, rather than shallowly visiting many different aspects of their world. So again, you don\u2019t show all of the iceberg below the waterline, but you do show a few thin slices of the iceberg all the way down. If your world were real, it would be just as complex as our own. Think economics, religion, courtship, food, war, technology, folklore, music, magic, languages, flora and fauna, astronomy, geology, weather, politics, diplomacy, clothing, etc, etc, etc. Then realize that you need to multiply many of those topics by however many different cultures exist in your world, AND then create the history of all those different fields for each culture. Is your brain spinning yet? Now imagine how your poor reader would feel if you tried to tell them about all that stuff in your book. Even if you avoided the infodumps and tried to spread it throughout your books, even if you had a 10 book series, even if you only showed all these things through direct interaction with your viewpoint characters, it would be way too much. Leave the 90% below the waterline to the fans who will create wikis for your work, and dole out cool details from behind the panel tables at cons. So Sanderson\u2019s third law is saying you as the author and creator of your world should have at least some very, very general idea of all these things, and then based on the nature of your story, pick a couple of them that are most relevant or interesting to your character and plot, and really dive deeply into them. This approach actually makes your world feel more real and complete, even though you\u2019re completely ignoring most of the topics I listed above. This works because when you prove to the reader that you\u2019ve really put thought into and done your homework on a few of these facets of your world, they\u2019ll trust that you\u2019ve done the same with all the others. If you don\u2019t tell them in detail how something is different from what they know in the real world, the readers\u2019 minds automatically default to assuming that thing is similar to what they\u2019re used to, perhaps with some cool twist you may have thought of. In the Wheel of Time, for example, Robert Jordan never described in detail what the grass looked like. Because he created the world, he may have known that grass is purple there, but it wasn\u2019t relevant to the story, which means there is no harm in the reader just assuming it\u2019s green like grass here on Earth. The same works for characters\u2014JK Rowling always knew Dumbledore was gay, but again, it wasn\u2019t relevant to Harry\u2019s story, so she never mentioned it. But it did impact the way she wrote the headmaster. As another example, if you\u2019ve completely ignored food in your world, but then in book 3 you slip a few things about it into your story, the reader will be fine with it, because they\u2019ll subconsciously believe that even though you don\u2019t show it, there are lots of cool things about food in this world that aren\u2019t presented simply because they aren\u2019t relevant to the story. This allows you to get away with throwing in a few extra milieu points that may not be strictly necessary to the story, but that add to the richness of your world. Wow, I was expecting this to be a short answer\u2026 And this is obviously most relevant to fantasy of the epic variety. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two major schools about introducing a fictional world: The Waterboarding method: Grab the reader\u2019s head and dunk it into the world\u2019s backstory! Tell pages and pages of stuff about it, even things that do not play the faintest role in the current novel. Show the reader that you really thought about the world\u2019s history, and if he comes up, gasping for air, add another page of details that are only important to you, the author. You would not want all that time you spent working on the world never to appear in the book, would you? Neal Stephenson\u2019s early works suffer from this. I remember as if it were yesterday, when I read his novel Snow Crash for the first time. I had fallen in love with the setting, his characters, and his narrative style. But when he stepped back for the umpteenth time, to tell me some unimportant long drawn-out details that could have been compressed into two sentences, I actually howled \u201cMercy!\u201d The second and third time I just skipped those passages. Thinking of another classic - can you imagine how many people never started to read Frodo Baggins\u2019 adventures, because they did not make it past the extensive description of the hair on hobbit feet, right before the tale actually started? (JRR Tolkien\u2019s The Lord of the Rings) The light-footed method: Mention few details about the world, and only when it makes sense to the reader. Let the reader discover the world together with your protagonist. You want to prevent readers from running into \u201cHuh?\u201d moments on the one hand, but not bore them, either. So, you ask your beta readers to mark each paragraph where they were confused about the world. Markers (felt-tip pens) are great for this. Obviously, earlier you have gone the 325th time through your manuscript, checking each time you mention something about the world. Have you given readers enough information to accept it, but not enough to bore them? Centuries can be condensed into one sentence. Or do you answer each \u201cWhy?\u201d of a child with half an hour of monologue? An example where it struck me that I understood the world without being given much background was a few pages into The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. Mercedes R. Lackey estimated, if I remember right, that for each book she publishes, the same volume of words is never seen by the reader. These words stay in her notes\u2019 cabinet. The art lies in choosing which words to include in the novel, and which not. ",
