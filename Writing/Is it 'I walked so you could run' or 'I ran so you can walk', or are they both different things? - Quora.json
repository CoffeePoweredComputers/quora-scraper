            "answer_text": "These two sentences have different meanings. \u201cI walked so you could run.\u201d implies that one person, possibly a parent, did something for the benefit of another, possibly a child. He or she walked so the could would have the opportunity to run. On a less literal level, this sentence could mean that the parent worked very hard so that the child could have a benefit that the parent didn\u2019t have, possibly higher education. With the second sentence, \u201cI ran so you can walk\u201d, the meaning I take from that one is, \u201cI worked very hard so that you don\u2019t have to work as hard as I did.\u201d For example, a parent may have worked at a job involving difficult or tiring manual labor so that the child would have the opportunity for higher education and a profession that was not as physically difficult as the parent\u2019s job might have been.

The meaning of the sentences depends a lot on the specific meaning of both walk and run. \u201cI walked so you could run\" could mean: \u1173 I got things started so that you could succeed more quickly. \u201cI ran so you can [could] walk\" could mean: \u1173 I participated in a fund raising marathon to benefit organizations looking for solutions for your disability \u1173 I did more than I needed to do so that you can work at a leisurely pace. Would be glad to be more helpful if I had more context. ",
