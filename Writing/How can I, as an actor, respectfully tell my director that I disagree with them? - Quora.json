            "answer_text": "In the specific example you provided, you can't do this in a way that is respectful. Sorry. If you disagree with your director about what they are doing with you, as an actor, you can say something. For example, if you wish that you were not dancing, because the actor playing Curly and the actor playing Laurie are better dancers than you, that is a concern you can bring to your director. If you want to play up the sympathetic elements of Judd while your director wants him to be pure villain, you can bring that up. But it is absolutely not your place to make a casting decision, and that is what this is. I'm going to guess based on my high school drama experience and the fact that my wife is a drama teacher who faces casting issues like this constantly, that there are many more women who are interested in drama in your school, and one of the most important parts of high school drama is inclusion. I can soapbox for this for hours, so I won't bore you here, but the big musical is the easiest way to get the most people involved, but it is also the best way to tell a kid that can't sing or dance that s/he isn't good enough to do drama, which simply isn't true (I'm proof of that). But it is the way most programs do it. In this case, it sounds like there are two talented women who the director wants to give parts to. One is probably a better dancer, the other a better singer. Or one has more time to devote to the production than the other. Or it is simply a way to tell one more girl that she is good enough to be a part of it, and to have a featured role. Dramaturgically, if you'd rather that than a practical answer - this is a fantasy moment. It is Laurey's dream. Is the actor who plays Laurie the rest of the play onstage, as she frequently is when all the dream characters are separate actors? Then she needs to be able to see herself between Judd and Curly. Many people dream in the third person, and it's also a clear way to tell the audience who is dreaming and that it isn't real. In professional, community, and educational productions, I have been approached by actors who have an issue with the production. Most often, they are concerned about an interpretation of their own character. Once, an actor's back story for herself included an affair with another character. When that other actor found out, he came to me incredibly concerned that I had allowed that to happen, and he had no idea. For my part, there were no references to it onstage, so I allowed each actor to have a different backstory, as it yielded the performance I wanted. They didn't need to have the same backstory, because how on earth would the audience ever know? It helped the first actor, and wouldn't have helped the second actor. One more anecdote. A year ago, I was directing a play where it became necessary to fire an actor. I went through a lot of channels to make sure that it was done professionally, correctly, that it was a real problem, and that a replacement was ready. During that entire process, I did not let the actors know that I was working in that direction, and none of them complained. After, several actors came up to me and thanked me for doing so, and the production was much better as a result. But NONE of those actors asked me to fire that actor; if they had, I probably would have then considered firing the complaining actor as well, and several of those concerned are actors I've worked with for years and with whom I have very fruitful working relationships. Keep in mind that your director is probably juggling many things: a need for inclusion, probably a school mandated level of student involvement, a full teaching schedule including grading, and likely not a social life for the entire time that s/he is giving to your production. And on top of that, s/he probably wants it to be a good show, to express the student's talents and his/her own artistic voice. Casting is one of the very few jobs that belongs exclusively to the director (less so in some for-profit professional instances) and many directors believe that if you cast the show correctly, 80-95% of the work is already done. It is one of the very clear places that it is NOT the actor's place to comment on. Finally, if you challenge this sort of decision, as an actor, after the casting has already been announced, and likely after work has begun, I highly doubt that director will ever cast you again. Suck it up, and have a good time. ",

            "answer_text": "It is often said that film is a directors medium and stage is an actor's. At the end of the day, you're the one who has to go out there and do the show, so of course your opinion matters, even at a high school level. Just so long as you're respectful and approach the director with tact, and with the goal of getting on the same page about everything. \"what the director says, goes\" can be a really toxic environment to work in. Obviously they're the one with the vision, and at the end of the day it's their call, but if they're not open to other suggestions, it can put the show at risk. Theatre needs to be flexible. The job of the director is to create a world for you to exist in every night. My suggestion is that you find a time after or before rehearsal, where there are little to no other cast around, and ask to speak to the director privately (not with any great seriousness, just say you have a question about the show). Don't tell them you disagree with them outright so as not to spark any conflict, but ask about why they did that. Suggest why it might be better another way. Come up with a possible practical solution. Tell them your approach to the scene and where you were working from, as an actor, and how that links in to what is happening on stage. If they're relatively savvy, they'll at least be impressed that you've been doing your actor's homework, and if they can't change the scene to suit what you were working with, they may at least be able to help you come up with a different interpretation so it works for you. Most importantly, don't harbour any resentment if you don't get your way. Sometimes in theatre, stuff just has to be. It may be out of the director's hands, a safety thing, or a practical thing, or a part of the director's vision that simply won't be shaken. Remember, everyone is there to support each other. Theatre is a family. ",

            "answer_text": "Given the specific details of your question: that it is a high school musical and that it is a directorial/casting decision about someone else there is only a limited opportunity to discuss your issue. In general, actors often discuss the role with directors. Actors bring their own role-specific ideas and creativity while directors have an overview. It is a collaboration not a dictatorship. In professional screen productions some actors (usually those in the largest roles) will push their interpretation or ideas quite hard and directors will listen. Screen work involves multiple takes and on set the actor can offer something different to the way the director sees it. In the edit suite the actor is not there though. On stage the director is not there during performance. Actors need a mindset change. Directors have an overview, a vision, but they are not dictators and do not micromanage every aspect of an actor\u2019s performance. They collaborate, see what an actor offers and suggest adjustments based on viewing the performance from the outside. Actors cannot see themselves objectively - it is the director\u2019s job to do this. Actors have been around for thousands of years. The job of directing is about 150 years old. In a high school environment the director is almost always a teacher too. She or he will have a dual responsibility - to both the show and to the development of each student. You should be able to have a private word with your teacher/director and tell them how the decision they have made affects your ability to play the part. You probably should not challenge their decision - just inform them how it affects you and ask what you should do about it. Ask them for help. ",

            "answer_text": "The director is tasked with managing the \"look\" and the interpretation of the music and the script for the show. He or she has a vision of how they want the show to look, and they are in a position to be able to actually see how the show comes across to the audience. They are held accountable for the choices they make, good, bad, or indifferent. You, as an actor who isn't in every scene, and who has a narrower perspective of how the show actually \"looks\", cannot see the product as the director will see it. And you are not going to be held responsible for it. Your responsibility as an actor is to represent your character within the confines of the show, and to deliver a performance that the audience can buy into. The rule I'd use when approaching directors about their choices is this: If the director's choices impact how you create and protray your character, and you have alternate ideas based on your understanding of how the character should be portrayed, I'd say it is acceptable to suggest to the director your ideas and collaborate since your performance will be affected by any decisions he/she makes. Phrase it in such a way that comes across as a different idea or a clarification, and not an outright disagreement with the director. However, the final decision is still the director's, not yours, and if you really cannot accept what he/she is trying to do and it is causing major problems for you, then you might have to leave the production.  If the director's choices do not impact your  character, then stay out of it, and let the director do his/her job. You might be a lead actor, but you are still subordinate to the director's choices. If it is a bad choice, it's on him/her, not you.  You are responsible for those things within your control, and whom he chooses for different roles/functions within the production is strictly within his discretion. So, to answer your question, it is the director's perogative in this case. Back off, and let him do his job. ",

I'm sure your director has their reasons and unless this is something that you have a particular knowledge about and can offer some helpful suggestions I would let it go.  In most situations, especially at a high school level, it is inappropriate to disagree with a director or at least to express it.  The director has a vision and a clear idea as to how to achieve a certain result from the production. That is their job and an actors job is to be one piece of that puzzle and follow direction. At a professional level there are times when a director may offer more opportunities to collaborate and take suggestions as to how you can mold your character but when they want your feedback they will ask for it. Offering your opinion without prompting is generally seen as disrespectful and unprofessional. Unless you are being told to do something unsafe or unethical you should follow direction and use all of your energy and resources to give the best performance you can within the boundaries set by the director. Listen to them and be open to the process. You might just learn some valuable lessons. ",

The direction we are taking the character now is in conflict with how I see the character, can you help me resolve the conflict?\u201d Communicate and converse. What a lot of actors might not realize is that directors (those with a clear vision anyway) are exposing themselves just as much as an actor might be just through a different process. And that vulnerability makes them susceptible to personalizing disagreements and judging their visions and confidence. A director who lacks confidence in what they are creating will snowball into chaos as it makes it way through the production team and cast. ",

That\u2019s how it works. If s/he has an idea or interpretation that differs from your own, your best bet is to let them see their idea first. They may realize it\u2019s wrong on their own. Otherwise, once you\u2019ve done it their way, you may be able to ask if they\u2019ll allow you to try something else (assuming the schedule and logistics will allow for it.) If your idea is better, you\u2019ve made it easy for them to change their mind without losing face. If they still prefer their idea, it\u2019s your job to accept it. Actors who want control over directorial decisions have two options\u2026 become directors, or become producers responsible for hiring directors. Otherwise, take comfort in knowing every actor has been in your situation. It\u2019s part of what we sign up for. ",
