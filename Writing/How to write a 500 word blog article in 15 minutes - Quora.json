            "answer_text": "Okay, so here you go. Minute 1: Come up with a general idea of the topic. An idea. Minute 2-3: Come up with an outline. It doesn't have to be very detailed. Just divide your article into 4-5 categories/subheadings that you're going to write about, and it will do just fine. When I write a 500-word article, I come up with 5 different headings/points/ideas that I want to discuss in that post. I try to write 100 words explaining each of those ideas. This approach takes care of the total word-count. At this stage, you may or may not come up with a finalized title for your article. If it comes naturally to you, by all means do it. However, if you're spending too much time on it, leave it for now. Given said that you must have a general idea of the topic you're writing about. The exact structure of the title may wait. Minute 4-5: Write the introduction for your blog post. 80-100 words should be sufficient for a 500-word blog post. The tip is to not only introduce your article to your readers, but also to make a promise to them. What are they going to learn from your article? Include it in the introduction. For example, \"In this post, I'm going to discuss 5 different ways that will help you get high-quality and powerful backlinks.\" This helps you define the rest of the blog post. Minute 5 - 15: Write the rest of the post. By the end of it, you would automatically know an excellent title for your post. P.S: I have answered your question, but I do not recommend that you write 500-word blog posts in just 15 minutes. Blog posts are important and must be given appropriate time and attention. I wrote this answer in a hurry (in 3-4 minutes), and I could have done so much better. But because I rushed through it, I must have made tons of mistakes here. I'm not even going to proofread it -- just to make my point. The things you write in a jiffy will be always half-baked (like this answer).  Spend more time on it and make your posts better. Proofread them over and over again until it all makes perfect sense. Argue with yourself over each sentence and word. Make something beautiful! ",

            "answer_text": "What a crock of ....!   My mother taught me. \"If it's worth doing at all it's worth doing well\" spend some time on all your blog posts and make them great posts, then market them well and they will serve you well. Everything else is a waste of time.  I don't often quote my mother but this is one piece of advice that's server very well.  If your writing a blog post its for people to read or its for search engine fodder.  Either way 500 words in fifteen minutes isn't going to be worth much for either situation.  Just typing that many words in 15 minutes and editing them is beyond most people's capability.  Actually having the words form a logical argument or discussion worth reading without research or intimate understanding of the subject matter would again be beyond most people. During an exam regurgitating well rehearsed scenarios and topics I'm sure it's possible to write 500 words or more in fifteen minute free hand and have them make sense. But who wants to be under that pressure all the time. Even if your just writing search engine fodder. SEO articles have the ability to provide great value for a very long time, write ever green stuff, research it well and make it great to read and attractive to search engines and it's going to serve you (or your client) well for many years. Anything else isn't worth the effort. A waste of 15 minute and you only have a limited number of 15 minute epochs to waste, I'd advise not wasting too many.    If it's a matter of money then work on your business model it's not quite right yet. ",
