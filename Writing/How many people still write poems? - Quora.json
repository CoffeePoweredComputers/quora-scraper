I wrote this poem on my birthday :) My dear birthday,I am sorry forNot lighting up my home a little more,Not getting cake and candles to blow,Not wearing the your famous cap for long,Not finding people to sing your song,Not celebrating you the way other kids do,Making you feel desolate, I never meant to But let me tell you honestlyI hate youBecause of you, I have toImagine blowing of candles and enduring the silence that would followAssume delight and fulfillment when deep inside I feel so hollowAccept your wishes from people who don\u2019t wish me morning otherwiseFake a smile at people who would walk past without saying HiFeel dejected waiting interminably for people I wished at midnightJust hate people and you, because I don\u2019t want to alleviate my plight You don\u2019t go like a day mundane,You are on phone, taskbar, social media and mail..You shroud my universe with unforgiving disdain,You conspire to inflict misery and pain.. I wish I didn\u2019t know when I was born,Amid abrading expectations a kid\u2019s wishes are tornIgnorance is bliss; the bliss is long gone,I wish I could live it by like any other day, truly, a man unknown via I hate my birthday | Poem ",

            "answer_text": "The correct answer here is both: \"more people than ever\" and \"hardly anyone anymore.\"   Poetry used to be a fine art, a refined form of literature that resonated potently with the most quintessential questions and emotions of existence and the universe. If our deepest and most sublime human expressions were a bell, poetry was created to ring it.  But somewhere in the contemporary era (post 1950's is my best estimation), it seems like everyone wants to be on the creation side of poetry, but without the rigor and refinement of the art. Everyone wants to write poetry, but almost no one bothers to read it. If poetry has died, it was the multitude of contempory poets that killed it.  So now here we are today; everyone is a poet and almost no one is a scholar of poetry. Almost all \"poets\" these days have abandoned form and meter and have capitulated to the most base type of indulgent and trite emoting. I recently read a few pieces published by the poetry editor of a major literature magazine and my heart sank as I was confronted with little more than bad, whiny prose full of functionless profanity that had been chopped up haphazardly into unreadable clusters of lines.  There are however, a few left out there that have the gift and have put in the time. There are still a few great poets writing. I promise that you will have to search them out and most of them will die without the laud and prestige that their predecessors enjoyed. ",
