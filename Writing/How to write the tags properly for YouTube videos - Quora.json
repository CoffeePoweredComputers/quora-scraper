            "answer_text": "First, insert your title in your tags. ALWAYS. Then alter your title to create two more video tags for the second and the third. For example, the first three video tags for a video called \u201cHow to Fix the toilet\u201d could be: 1. How to fix the toilet, 2. Fixing the toilet, and three 3. How a toilet works. Next, insert ANY trending topics that are related to your video. For example, if it had been in the news lately that a woman cut her hand off and flushed it down the toilet, definitely put her name in the next tag. The next 10\u201312 tags should be related to your video, but be creative with these and ask yourself \u201cif I wanted to fix my toilet, what would I search for?\u201d If you need help with this, use a keyword generator (my favorite is Google Adwords) and type in the title of your video to see what's hot in keywords. The best keywords in the results of Adwords are the ones with medium to low competition but over 10,000 hits. Separate all of your tags with commas, and there you should have it. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Writing tags according to me is science mixed with some creativity. You have to put yourself in other\u2019s shoes. Think what people will keyin while searching for some thing. Also look at what\u2019s trending, have your keywords in title and in first two lines of description. Have those keywords in the first place. For eg..if you are making a video on 10 Must Watch Movies of Tom Hanks You have to have a permutation, combination of these words such as 10 movies of tom hanks, 10 super movies of tom hanks, 10 must watch movies , 10 movies and try all combinations and what comes to people mind when they think of tom hanks. This is the basic structure for writing good tags according to me. Experts can answer much better ",
