Regarding my experience, it is better to select some all-in-one tools based on your SEO needs and get paid version in order to get more accurate and detailed results on your web.  My favourite tools are Google Keyword Planner ( for keyword research), Mention (for brand monitoring), Ahrefs (for backlink monitoring), SE Ranking (for website rankings and website audit) and Piktochart (for inforgraphics creation).
