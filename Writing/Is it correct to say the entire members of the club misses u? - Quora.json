Plus, I know it\u2019s popular, but it is strongly discouraged to use \u201cu\u201d instad of \u201cyou\u201d. You should say \u201cthe members of the entire club miss you\u201d or \u201call the members of the club miss you\u201d. Or, if you want to leave your sentence as intact as possible. \u201cThe entire membership of the club misses you.\u201d ",
