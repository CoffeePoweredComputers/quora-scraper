It is the only typing training software that uses Implicit Learning to increase typing speed. Implicit Learning (Remembering Patterns (e.g. Keyboard) by Repetitive Subconscious Exposure to the Pattern) - is how we learn all repetitive complex muscle memories as children - walking, talking, cycling etc. i.e. with no teaching Hypnotype was tested on 20 random Uni students in a Top Rated University. Please see (below and attached papers) for typing speed increases during the research. * 10 students improved by 30% with 30 hours over 5 weeks * 10 students improved by 43% with 30 hours over 6 1/2 weeks i.e. the more time and the longer the period spent using the software the bigger the improvement. FYI any user who wants to use the software will get a free key if they email before Jul 4.   ",
