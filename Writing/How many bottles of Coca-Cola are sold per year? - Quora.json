            "answer_text": "I don't Google my answers or I could probably provide an actual dollar amount. Possibly even a production, distribution amount or however it would be put. The soda industry is making billions of dollars per year I'm assuming. They, the soda maker, keep dentists working. Again they, the soda maker keep doctors working. I say this only because soda, pop, tonic whatever you choose to call it is not good for you. Yes, everything in moderation. Unfortunately many people are addicted to soda. It can cause many health problems, just above I mentioned the dentist. You can cause yourself cavities. They can be costly to fill. The diet soda that one thinks is so good for themselves I've heard and read is not. You can apparently gain more weight from diet soda than regular soda. Soda is an addiction. If you must drink it and you don't have that addictive personality issue going on drink it only once in awhile, if you care to care for yourself. Some are so addicted to soda it seems worse than drug's, from my standpoint. My friend very good one drinks over 48 cans of Coke and Ginger Ale a week. Not good, she's young and she's starting to put weight on. Everything I've just said is my opinion only. You are the best judge of your own wants and needs. All I can say is far too much is produced and sold. Maybe organic soda or some healthy soda will be mass produced one day. ",

Estimates from this website (https://www.statisticbrain.com/coca-cola-company-statistics/) says that 1,800,000,000 Coke bottles are sold everyday, and 10,450 Coca Cola products are consumed every second. That is a crazy amount of product. ",
