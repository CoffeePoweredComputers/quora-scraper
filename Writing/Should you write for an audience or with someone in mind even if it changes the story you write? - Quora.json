            "answer_text": "There\u2019s not really a one-size-fits-all answer to this one. Extroverts often find it much easier to write very deliberately to an audience, even to a specific person\u2014like having a conversation\u2014while introverts may slip away into their private imaginary worlds to write. I seem to remember Vladimir Nabokov saying he wrote to a generalized idea of a very sophisticated and intelligent older woman, and even though I\u2019m an introvert of the \u201csecret imaginary world\u201d variety, one of my most enjoyable writing experiences was writing a young adult novel very specifically for a young writer (and friend) who read my drafts at the end of every day\u2019s writing. I\u2019m pretty sure the only way to solve any writing problem or answer any writing question is not to think too much about it but to write your way through it. Experiment\u2014try writing today while keeping someone specific in mind and tomorrow by closing the door to your fantasy world behind you and keeping everyone out. For every writer, and even for the same writer with every different project, you may get a different answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Anything one writes, if it is to be published is for the public to read. eg. An audience. Also, more often than not, story's are baced on certain characters, beit yourself or someone close to you or other participants that play a role in the story. What's important to remember when one writes is to translate your thoughts and facts in a manner that flows so the readers get a concise understanding of what your trying to deliver. What changes the story is, whether you write it in the first person as in an Autobiography or in the third person. Whether is fiction as in your imagination or fact, as in a true story. ",
