            "answer_text": "For the U.S. legal profession, it\u2019s ultimately nothing more than historical habits and convention. However, no state law has stipulated that \u201cesquire\u201d (\u201cEsq.\u201d) is reserved for any profession or class. Nonetheless, some states have some kind of written or unwritten rule to protect the use of the term \u201cesquire\u201d to denote legal licensure \u2014 so the net effect is that anyone using \u201cEsq.\u201d after the name is tantamount to unauthorised practice of law. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard to fathom how \u201cEsq.\u201d got adopted by the legal profession as a professionalised courtesy title. American society isn\u2019t replete with formal titles like UK society historically has with various peerage, non-peerage and other official titles. When official titles do come up in American society, they\u2019re rather functional and nondescript. UK professional titles tend to sound just a little \u2018grander\u2019:\u2014 Head of the U.S. judiciary \u2014 Chief Justice of the United StatesHead of the English judiciary \u2014 Lord Chief Justice of England and WalesHead of the Scottish judiciary \u2014 Lord President of the Court of Session and Lord Justice-GeneralThe American legal habit of using \u201cEsq.\u201d to mean a lawyer probably started with the U.S. diplomatic service \u2014 because \u201cesquire\u201d in full is/was typically used as a complimentary title for a Foreign Service commissioned officer. That American diplomatic usage probably came from general British secretarial practice. In the UK today, using \u201cEsq.\u201d has no precise and no special significance overall \u2014 it\u2019s just a general courtesy title for any MAN (not woman) in formal or professional correspondence. In the UK, it has no specific connection to the legal profession. ",

            "answer_text": "I use Esq (or Esquire) when it is appropriate. My email signature in both of my professional email addresses uses Esquire. In my personal email account, I do not use Esquire. If I write a letter when I am acting as an attorney, I tend to use Esquire.  I do this so people know they are communicating with an attorney. I feel it is important that I properly communicate my role in whatever I am handling, and using Esquire is a quick way of doing so. I don't want people to feel as if I sought to fool them. If whatever I am writing is not related to a legal issue, I don't generally use Esquire. I don't use Esquire (or the fact that I am a lawyer) in my day-to-day life. By that I mean, I don't sign personal correspondence with Jennifer Ellis, Esquire. If people want to refer to me as such, they may feel free. But it is not necessary and I don't care one way or the other. ",
