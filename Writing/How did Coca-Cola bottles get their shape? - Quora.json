            "answer_text": "In the early 20th century, every bottler had their own bottle design. In 1915 the Coca Cola Company decided to standardize on a single bottle design, and help a contest among the bottlers to design it.  The winning design was created by the Root Glass Company of Terre Haute Indiana. The design made Chapman J. Root, owner of the Root Glass Company, a wealthy man.  The Root Glass company was later sold to Owens Corning, and the Root family invested in Coca Cola bottling companies. In 1982, they sold the Associated Coca Cola Bottling Company back to Coca Cola, which formed Coca Cola Enterprises. The patent awarded for the bottle states that the inventor was Alexander Samuelson, the plant superintendent for the Root Glass Company.  However, Earl R. Dean, a foreman and bottle designer at Root Glass Company has claimed that he was the designer. Examples of the original Root bottle can be found in the World of Coca Cola museum in Atlanta, GA.

            "answer_text": "Hello Adam Tsou, 1894 - A modest start for a bold idea Mississippi shop owner Joseph A. Biedenharn began bottling Coca\u2011Cola after he was impressed by its sales. He sold the drink to his customers in a common glass bottle called a Hutchinson. At the time Biedenharn sent a case to Asa Griggs Candler, who owned the Company. Candler thanked him but took no action. One of his nephews had already urged that Coca\u2011Cola be bottled, but Candler focused on fountain sales. 1916 - Birth of the Contour Bottle Bottlers worried that a straight-sided bottle wasn't distinctive enough and that Coca\u2011Cola was becoming easily confused with \u2018copycat\u2019 brands. Glass manufacturers were approached to come up with a unique bottle design for Coca\u2011Cola. The Root Glass Company of Terre Haute, Indiana, designed with the famous contour shape, which won enthusiastic approval from Coca\u2011Cola in 1915 and was introduced in 1916. Regards, James. ",
