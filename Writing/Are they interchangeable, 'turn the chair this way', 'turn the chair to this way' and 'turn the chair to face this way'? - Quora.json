            "answer_text": "You can delete the second variant immediately: we never say \u201cturn it to this way\u201d. The other two may be interchangeable, but it is not absolutely necessary that turning a chair in a particular direction will make it \u201cface\u201d that way. Suppose I have a chair with its back against a wall and its seat facing me. If I move to stand by the wall myself and say, \u201cTurn the chair to face this way\u201d, then of course you will turn it so that its seat is facing me and its side is against the wall. But if I merely say, \u201cTurn the chair this way\u201d you would not be wrong if you turned its back towards me. ",

            "answer_text": "They are not interchangeable. The second statement is incorrect, so the comparison applies to the other two. The third, with face, has a single and specific meaning: you are instructing someone to orient the chair. The first sentence can mean the same thing, but it can also be used to show someone how to turn the chair. In this case, the speaker is doing the turning, not the person spoken to. You cannot use the third statement for this meaning. Thanks for the A2A. Enjoy the view from where you put the chair. ",

The second example would not be said by a native speaker; the inclusion of the preposition \u201cto\u201d makes it sound odd. But, after thinking about it for several minutes, I confess that I cannot say that it is grammatically improper. Perhaps the reason is simply idiomatic - that a preposition is just not used with \u201cturn\u201d + \u201cway.\u201d (The \u201cto\u201d would be fine, for example, in \u201cTurn the chair to the right.\u201d) ",
