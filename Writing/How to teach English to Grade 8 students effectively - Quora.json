            "answer_text": "I'm not sure there's a concise answer to this good question. The first challenge in effective teaching is achieving a settled, focused and hopefully attentive class. If a teacher has achieved that, it's an excellent foundation for effective teaching. The next question is - what's meant by effective? Students would do well on tests administered to them? Students would demonstrate oral competency with English? English has become the world's international language and students who understand that are often self-motivated - they very much want to be effective leaners. If your students are eager to learn English, it makes your job much easier. If your class is fairly motivated, settled and focused, establish reasonable goals. Share those goals with them. By the end of this year, I'd like you all to be able to - hold a conversation in English on a topic of your choice. To have a vocabulary of ____ number of words. etc. All that said - there's a wealth of research that suggest cartoons are a powerful teaching tool for language learning. Cartoons speak in short sentences and offer visual reinforcement for what was said. Look on youtube for English language cartoons and a wealth of other activities for teaching English. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess a lot of people assume you're referring to non English speakers, so I'm going to suggest 2 things that are hand in hand based on those students who already \"know\" English. Make word/grammar/sentence games that are entertaining. Make English fun, because lets face it, most 8th graders that already speak English think they know it all already. Why do I say this? Because I could write fictional stories but I was 2 years into college before my class research papers made any sense. Not that I hadn't had TBI's before but as you might tell, I can't write very well now because of my most recent head injury. But I still remember my fiction part of the classes I did phenomenally, but anything research related, I might as well have not shown up because the teachers made it harder to follow then a polar bear in snow.

Music, comics, mangas( spanish for japanese comics) and their characters, tv shows, etc. anything that could really catch their attention, look for some interactive material about those topics on the internet and that was the best way I found to teach them the basic tenses. Hope it will help you. ",
