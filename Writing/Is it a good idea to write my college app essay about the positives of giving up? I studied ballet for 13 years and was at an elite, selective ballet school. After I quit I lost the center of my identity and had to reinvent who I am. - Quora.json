Then I read a few hundred law school app essays after graduating from law school. Don\u2019t brag about your intelligence or the people you know. Be real, and be human. Be funny, if you can. The better you demonstrate deep qualities like insight and empathy, the more impressive your essay. Overcoming a challenge like yours is impressive. Be careful not to stress too much the exclusivity of your ballet school. Say it once. Perhaps mention the name of someone famous who went there, then move on. Ask us again when you have a draft! ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly not; colleges do not want quitters, they want students who will graduate. I suspect you did not just \u201cgive up.\u201d You quit for a reason; maybe not a very good reason or maybe for a very good reason. Either can be a very strong subject for your essay. If, in hindsight, your choice was poor, then you write about the lesson your learned from your mistake, and, how you have moved on. Craft your essay about how you now make decisions and point to how you reinvented yourself into a student who intends on getting a college education. If your reason for quitting still holds \u2014 financial/family/medical or realization a career in ballet is not for you \u2014 then craft your essay about how moving on has addressed that/those issues.
