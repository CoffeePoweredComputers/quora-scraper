            "answer_text": "I can give you insight about diction. Poetry, to me, is knitting. You give chance for words to entangle with one another, creating patterns, and eventually a picture. What common mistake that I saw from my students are the tendency to use too simple choices of words, or even too difficult ones, that makes the \u201cpicture\u201d blurry, i.e, makes the reader to get confused by the meaning, misinterpret (not multi-interpret), and in the end get bored and probably hate poetry in general because of one bad experience. Poetry, to me, is all about patterns. Repetitions. It can be in the form of: Direct repetition. Repeating the same word again and again. It is necessary to make a point. You don\u2019t need to try to find more synonym for the same concept if you want to make sure the reader gets it.Partial repetition. Call it rhyme, assonance, alliteration, and other things, but basically it\u2019s when you repeat part of the word. So, when choosing the right word, you can consider this, and not just exhaustively choose the \u201cbig word\u201d just to sound cool.Invisible repetition. You can repeat the same concept with different words, but again, not because it\u2019s a big word that only a handful of people understand (especially for non-native speaker. Hell, I\u2019m Indonesian and I sometimes found new words in Indonesian poems that I have to find in dictionary). For example, you want to personify sunlight as some creepy crawly. First, you can say, \u201cIts ray slithers in\u201d, then when you repeat it, you say, \u201cIt crawls into my eyes\u201d. You don\u2019t really see the repetition, but to your brain, you read the same concept.Grammatical repetition. This probably sounds like teaching middle school students, but yes, sentences sound better if you use the matching part of speech. Instead of saying, \u201cThe rain is pouring. My shoes are wet.\u201d you can say \u201cThe rain is pouring. The shower is dampening my shoes.\u201dPoetry, for me, is self-expression. Don\u2019t get tangled in big words, but get drown in familiar ones, which you can put more meaning into. ",

            "answer_text": "The writing stage continues to the editing stage and if all goes well to the publishing or sharing stage. So it\u2019s not as easy as it\u2019s first thought. We can knock off a dozen poems and think we\u2019ve done well. An expert comes along and reads each poem. He or she can then point out the basic errors and as for the content continue with valid suggestions. The poet then decides to accept the genuine feedback or argue each point in turn. Another expert comes along and checks everything and offers different errors as well as different suggestions. So we can\u2019t expect a perfect understanding of what really works and what doesn\u2019t. Only God can make something so perfect that every expert could see the sense of His feedback. Till then, many poets will do their best and hope for the best. Spelling and grammar checkers could offer advice or point out a query here and there. The human touch is still useful. Even so, there are some topics of interest that require specific expertise. When I\u2019m almost done with a new poem, I\u2019ve still got to read it again and again till I can\u2019t see any more errors and Grammarly dot com can\u2019t point out any queries. I\u2019m still thinking about how the poem sounds. I want to have it read correctly the very first time. So I must make a real effort not to accept every word as final. Each phrase could be subject to different ways of speaking the text. I choose the number of syllables eg 8, 6, 8, 6 but some words as pronounced as 2 or 3 syllables eg hist-ry or his-tor-ry\u2026 These can\u2019t always be avoided, but if compromises come into play, then they can assist each reader so as not to stumble over difficult words. After all, we\u2019re not all talented celebrities reciting famous poems on YouTube. I am or I\u2019m word preferences can alter according to the different characters and how each speaks, yet for poetry, it helps to keep checking for abbreviated words and seeing if we can edit the different styles to suit the need for a more consistent poem. Compromising being necessary for the sake of the good of the majority of readers. Another aspect of when writing a new poem is its background story. How the title and the verses were motivated to produce a combined effect. For the poemhunter-dot-com website submit a poem form we see this extra option, explain about the poem\u2026 When I write poems I can add an extra note to explain the reasons behind writing it or add some extra website link for more info. This applies more to our own websites and blogs that mean we don\u2019t get prevented for adding website links. Poemhunter offers us our own opportunity to upload a video or a recitation for the new poem. So it isn\u2019t always the writing that gets feedback on the errors. Sometimes it would be for what wasn\u2019t included to provide better understanding. Did the poem get written because of a famous celebrity, or historical event, or a philosophy being considered as worthy of sharing, or some quote Jesus made that changed a person\u2019s point of view? Did the poet feel led to write the text following a traumatic event, or a miracle happening? Was there some insight that transformed the poet\u2019s life from then on? Unless the general public or the website visitors get informed, who can help them to appreciate the poetry even more? Poets should provide the poem and provide info, too. Whatever golden opportunities the poet received, there are times to explain these, or to add a free-to-use picture from websites like unsplash-dot-com because photographers can enhance a poet\u2019s work, just as poets can enhance a photographer\u2019s work. Free website resources inspire poets to write even more. Who knows what great poems are yet to be!? ",
