The reason for this is because of the ability to be able to do SEO (Search Engine Optimisation). This means you will have more organic users finding you in Google over time. This is critical for having your website around for a long time. For hosting your blog I would suggest using Siteground. These guys have been around for a long time, are fast, come with a ssl certificate and integrate with cloudflare. Here is a handy guide for setting up your Wordpress blog on Siteground.  After your website is setup, check out one of the SEO groups that are on Facebook such as Superstar SEO. You will get a ton of ideas to build a good, solid foundation to ensure your blog stays profitable in the long term. Good luck! ",
