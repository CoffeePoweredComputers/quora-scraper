            "answer_text": "It would be easy to make a joke about it in the turmoil of the last five years. Too many books have been written about him already in the heat of the moment. When a serious book is eventually written, probably not in my lifetime, it will reflect his most defining moment. Personally, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had time to process his most defining moment yet. He has had enough \u201cacts\u201d in the past 48 months, coming one after another, after another that historians will have to spend years, putting them into chronological order, looking at the connection points. The points that are both criminal, and those that are just in bad taste. The line might be too emotional at this point to tell which is which. We have had over forty years of trump being in the public eye. We have seen countless interviews, long before he was President in which he lied to the interviewer and it was proven he lied. We have seen his many business ventures that ended up in bankruptcies. His university where countless students were cheated out of their savings by unqualified \u201cprofessors.\u201d We have seen him as a man who has partied with known crooks and pedephiles and made friends with dictators. Despite all of this I don\u2019t think we have seen his defining moment. Not yet. ",

            "answer_text": "Leaving the jokes aside, when serious historians take over from polemists and contemporary political writers arguing for their side, the first biographies will have boring descriptive titles like Trump: The Presidential Years, Trump: The Reality Television President, or Right Wing Populism in the Twenty-first: The Trump Presidency. That last one was a tenure book adapted from the writer\u2019s dissertation and will only be read by other historians. The big challenge for historians will be, like Nixon, putting him into the context of his times and avoiding the temptation to over psychoanalyze him. ",
