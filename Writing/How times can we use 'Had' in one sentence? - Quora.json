            "answer_text": "I remember answering a very similar question before. I have come across a case where the word \u201chad\u201d was used 11 times. Yes, you heard that right. 11 times. And, what's more, the words were all consecutive. I will write that here without punctuation and it will look like nonsense. After you punctuate it, it will make perfect sense and you will have two sentences where the word is used 7 times and 4 times consecutively. John where James had had had had had had had had had had had the teacher's approval. John, where James had had \u201chad\u201d, had had \u201chad had\u201d. \u201chad had\u201d had had the teacher's approval. I am writing this answer using Google dictation on my smart phone. When I get back to my laptop, I will try to locate the link to an old detailed answer, that explains this fully. Edited to add: I located that old answer I had written. Gopalkrishna Vishwanath's answer to How do I use three \"hads\" in one sentence? ",
