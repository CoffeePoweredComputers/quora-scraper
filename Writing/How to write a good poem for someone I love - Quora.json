            "answer_text": "Put a lot of thought into it. Start off by asking yourself, \u201cIs this supposed to be a funny, cheesy poem or a thoughtful, serious, and romantic poem?\u201d If you want it be funny, all the cheesy lines you can think of are welcome, but if it should be serious, then cheesy lines should not be included. If it is cheesy, then you should not get very serious, but if it is serious, then yeah, be serious. When you know what kind of poem you want to write then you will have a better idea of how you should write it. If you write a cheesy, funny poem then have fun with it. Throw in every dumb romantic joke you can think of (as long as it fits). Make it funny and make a good impression. If you write a serious romantic poem, you will have to have a completely different mindset. Think about this special someone and write what comes to mind. Only you know what your love is like, only you know which type of poem would better fit your personality (and the personality of the person you love). But as long as you mean what write and you write it from the heart, you cannot go wrong (the person may not necessarily appreciate it but that does not mean you did it wrong, rather it is probably an indication of what they think of you). Put your heart into it and you will create a beautiful poem. Express yourself. That is the key. ",
