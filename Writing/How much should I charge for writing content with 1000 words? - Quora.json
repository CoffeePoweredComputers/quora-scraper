            "answer_text": "It is depending on two matters. First, the quality of your content. Second the demand of your clients. In fact, a good content writer does not think about the rate. It is your ability that makes your demand and rate for the content and how it accepts by your clients. Now, if you are a fresher, it is not easy to get a higher rate in the initial stage. As at the beginning phase you have to build your market and if the jobs are coming regularly, then you may ask for the higher rate. Hope as the time progresses your rate will increase. The question of how you fix your rate for a 1000 words content at the beginning stage. It should be USD 5 for niches like social, real estates, web contents, sports etc. If it is technical content or academic content it should be at least USD 10. If the content is SEO optimized with at least 3 keywords you should charge for USD 7 & 12 respectively. Now if your clients are satisfied and after an experience of 3\u20135 years, you may go for a higher charge. Finally, you are the best judge of your contents. Hope, your query is clear now. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "The amount you charge for a 1000 word blog depends on a lot of factors. I have tried to elaborate a few of the most important ones below. Take a look. Domain: A blog of 1000 words in let's say lifestyle domain will not be paid the same amount as a blog of 1000 words in the healthcare domain. The same goes for all other domains such as technology, finance, food and beverages, education and many more. The pricing for each will be different.Experience: Your domain experience matters when it comes to how much you are paid for each blog. This is for the simple reason that experienced writers know how content marketing functions and have more insights. You should always get more experience in one domain instead of trying to get it for multiple domains. This helps you become an expert in the chosen domain. Later you can again proceed to gain more knowledge of other domains.Research required: The amount of research required for the blog is a crucial decider of the payment. If you have to do an in-depth exhaustive research the pay will obviously be higher.As you can see, quoting an exact amount is not possible as there are a lot of variables. Always pay attention to these factors before deciding to take on a certain project. Hope this was helpful. Good luck. :) ",
