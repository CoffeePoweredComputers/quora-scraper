            "answer_text": "Medium currently uses the Stripe platform, so people in some countries might be ineligible to earn money. This is an exciting opportunity for many individuals, especially those who enjoy writing or are passionate about sharing their subject. If your writing is good and you have something to share with the world, setting up a blog is the right way to go. You could monetize on pretty much anything, from sharing your daily life to writing about your interests. What your goals are and how to realize it. If you're looking to make it a full-time job, then probably not (unless you're willing to invest a lot of time), but if you're looking to build a following and develop your skills, then it's probably worth the time. Based on the stats, only something like 7% of active writers makes more than $100 in any given month. Why don\u2019t you try to Make money online with WiredBucks?
