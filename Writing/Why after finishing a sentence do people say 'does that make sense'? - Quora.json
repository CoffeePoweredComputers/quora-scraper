            "answer_text": "I actually just recently read the answer to this in an English grammar book. Ending a sentence with, \u201cDoes that make sense?\u201d Is a form of mitigating speech: for native English speakers, it's a little nicety that we tack on so that whatever we just said won't sound patronizing or too instructive or bossy or arrogant. By asking, \u201cDoes that make sense?\u201d We accomplish 2 things: First, we deprecate ourselves ever-so-slightly, hinting that perhaps we, as communicators, didn't do such a good job of getting the message across. The psychological takeaway is that the other person feels deferred to and consulted, and possibly even sharper than us, even if none of that is true. The second thing it accomplishes is getting the listener to subconsciously buy into what we're saying. Studies show that if a salesman can get a person to nod or say \u201cyes\u201d while talking to him, the salesperson is more likely to clinch the deal. So when my boss says to me, \u201cI'm going to have to ask you to pick up an extra shift next weekend because blah blah blah\u2026does that make sense?\u201d it comes across as softer than the command that it actually is. It forces my acknowledgement that I understand my boss's predicament and helps me feel a sense of importance or equality in being appealed to by her. And by saying \u201cyes\u201d [it makes sense to me] I'm already halfway to accepting my fate willingly. ",

            "answer_text": "I first want to say, I understand some will use that way of speech but i honestly feel, it makes some of us feel like we\u2019re stupid. Just in my opinion. I honestly dislike when people do that. They do that cause they\u2019re so in their own head. It\u2019s such a weird annoying habit, in their head, they think that they\u2019re not explaining things enough and they want to make sure, the person that they\u2019re interacting with, they want to make sure that they\u2019re understanding them. The kitchen managers at my job does that too. Like when they\u2019re explaining a task, they go into this long long long talk, when all they can do is make it simple. Then after they\u2019re are done (Here it comes, let\u2019s say it all together) \u2018Does that make sense,\u2019 lol. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m being talked to like i\u2018m stupid. The other thing I can\u2019t stand is when the manager says, ok, after explaining everything again. I\u2019m shaking my head like, ok I understand, but she is like, repeating herself and saying ok. \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b ",
