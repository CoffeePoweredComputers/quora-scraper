            "answer_text": "Well, sort of. I'm sorry, I know that's terribly vague, so I'll try to clarify a little bit. The sentence, \u201cIt\u2019s its.\u201d conveys the meaning, \u201cit belongs to it,\u201d albeit in a nonconventional way. While the sentence is technically grammatically correct, there's a few problems with it. First, let's break it down into its sections. \u201cIt's\u201d is just a contraction for \u201cit is,\u201d so we'll look at it that way for simplicity: It is its. Here,\u201cIt\u201d is a pronoun and the subject of the sentence, \u201cis\u201d is the verb of the sentence, and \u201cits\u201d is a possessive pronoun that the verb relates to the subject. Structurally sound. An example of a similarly structured sentence would be, \u201cI'm yours.\u201d The only difference is which personal pronoun is used. So, structurally, the sentence is grammatically correct. However, there are still a few issues with it. First, \u201cits\u201d is not generally used as a possessive pronoun in English, mainly because things we call \u201cit\u201d generally aren't considered to be owners. So while a book might be mine, yours, or his, it's probably not its. Another reason for this is that the pronoun \u201cit\u201d can cover such a wide range of objects, so it's often more practical to use a specific possessive. Instead of saying \u201cthe book is its,\u201d where \u201cit\" refers to a library, one might say, to avoid ambiguity, \u201cthe book is the library's.\u201d Because of this, it's awkward to use \u201cits\u201d as a possessive pronoun, such as in your sentence. Note that this is not to be confused with the widespread use of \u201cits\u201d as a possessive determiner, which is totally normal usage. The odd times when it is okay to use \u201cits\u201d as a possessive pronoun happen when there are enough context clues to make it clear what is being said. Your example sentence has really no context clues. Another problem with your sentence is that because of the ambiguity of the word \u201cit,\u201d when it refers to a noun, it's important that the noun is clarified so there's not ambiguity in the meaning. Your sentence uses \u201cit\u201d twice, first as a subject personal pronoun, then as a possessive pronoun. With no promises referent in the sentence, it's assumed you're referring to something in a previous sentence. The problem is that both instances of \u201cit\u201d have the same referent. An example of another sentence like this would be \u201cHe\u2019s his.\u201d It's grammatically correct, yes, but it doesn't quite make sense. The implied meaning of your sentence is: [referent noun A] is [possessed by [referent noun A]]. This same idea can be expressed with much less ambiguity, and less awkward phrasing, with the sentence, \u201cIt belongs to itself.\u201d Of course, if you just like the sound of \u201cIt\u2019s its,\u201d and don't care about how understandable it is, then yes, it is grammatically correct. And it makes a whole lot more sense than the (also grammatically correct) \u201cBuffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is that it is grammatically correct. And that\u2019s your answer. Now if \u201cit\u201d is gender neutral here, then that\u2019s perfectly fine to use. If \u201cit\u201d has a gender, then it\u2019s preferable to use the gender instead just for clarification. Then, there\u2019s two \u2018it\u2019s. The first is indicating one object and the second one is indicating another. So essentially, object one is possessed/owned by object two. Overall the sentence makes sense and in casual/normal conversations it can be understood, but they may ask you to clarify what is the object that possesses the item. Examples: It\u2019s its, can be replaced with \u201cThat ball is the dog\u2019s\u201d, but do keep in mind dogs also have genders, but animals can also be referred to as \u2018it\u2019. It\u2019s its, could be replaced with, \u201cThat [tyre] is the truck\u2019s [tyre].\u201d ",

As a whole sentence, it\u2019s its is just as correct as it\u2019s yours, it\u2019s ours, it\u2019s hers, it\u2019s his and it\u2019s theirs, but it lacks the elegance of, for example, it\u2019s his, and it would be more likely used as part of a sentence. As part of a sentence, the possessive its would be followed by whatever it is that belongs to it. For example: \u201cIs that part of the car\u2019s wheel lying on the road?\u201d \u201cYes, it\u2019s its hubcap.\u201d ",
