            "answer_text": "I will use two poems I have written as examples. In this poem I use a four line stanza, also known as a Quatrain. The Blues Man She left him with a broken heart  He walks alone, confused. Lost without her by his side He softly sings the blues.  In the darkened stormy night He sings his solemn tune. Tears roll from his reddened eyes As he strums, and drums, and croons.  The joyful music he once had sang Only causes him to weep. He thinks of the love he once had, And how he set her free.  His fear of loss caused him to lose The only love he's ever known,  And now he has nowhere to go, Her arms were once his home.  So he strolls down an empty street In search of a reason to hold on. She is now his only muse, And her memory is his song.  \u00a9A. Lee Chambers In this poem I use a three line stanza, a Tercet. One Night Stand I could hold you close, And tell you \u201cI love you\u201d But it would be a lie.  I could say that You\u2019re all I ever wanted, That I need you in my life,  But the truth is I\u2019m broken and I\u2019m lonely, I know it isn\u2019t right  To use you to ease the pain And to feel alive again, You\u2019re a distraction from my mind.  In the morning I\u2019ll be gone So don\u2019t try to hang on, Because I\u2019m only yours tonight.  \u00a9A. Lee Chambers I hope you found this helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "In poetry, a stanza is a division of four or more lines having a fixed length, meter, or rhyming scheme. Stanzas in poetry are similar to paragraphs in prose. Both stanzas and paragraphs include connected thoughts, and are set off by a space. The number of lines varies in different kinds of stanzas, but it is uncommon for a stanza to have more than twelve lines. The pattern of a stanza is determined by the number of feet in each line, and by its metrical or rhyming scheme. Stanza Examples in English Poetry On the basis of a fixed number of lines and rhyming scheme, traditional English language poems have the following kinds of stanzas: Couplet Tercet Quatrain Quintain Sestet Let us make ourselves familiar with the above mentioned kinds of stanzas: Couplet A couplet consists of two rhyming lines having the same meter. Consider the following couplet stanza examples: Example #1: Essay on Criticism (By Alexander Pope) \u201cTrue wit is nature to advantage dress\u2019d; What oft was thought, but ne\u2019er so well express\u2019d.\u201d Example #2: Sonnet II (By Edna St. Vincent Millay) \u201cWhether or not we find what we are seeking is idle, biologically speaking.\u201d Example #4: To Science (By Edgar Allan Poe) A rhyming pair of lines in iambic pentameter is known as a \u201cheroic couplet.\u201d Initiated by Chaucer, heroic couplets are commonly used in epics and narrative poetry. Among the well known examples of stanza, we find Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s sonnet To Science: \u201cDo not all charms fly At the mere touch of cold philosophy? There was an awful rainbow once in heaven: We know her woof, her texture; she is given\u201d Tercet A tercet comprises three lines following a same rhyming scheme a a a, or have a rhyming pattern a b a. Sir Thomas Wyatt introduced tercet in the 16th century. Example #1: Second Satire (By Thomas Wyatt) Read the following tercets from Wyatt\u2019s poem Second Satire with a rhyming scheme a b a: \u201cMy mother\u2019s maids, when they did sew and spin, They sang sometimes a song of the field mouse, That for because their livelihood was but so thin. Would needs go seek her townish sister\u2019s house. Would needs She thought herself endured to much pain: The stormy blasts her cave so sore did souse\u2026\u201d Example #2: The Eagle (By Alfred Lord Tennyson) The famous Romantic poet, Alfred Lord Tennyson employed tercets in his poem The Eagle with a rhyming scheme a a a: \u201cHe clasps the crag with crooked hands: Close to the sun it lonely lands, Ringed with the azure world, it stands. The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls; He watches from his mountain walls, And like a thunderbolt he falls.\u201d Quatrain Quatrain is a form of stanza popularized by a Persian poet, Omar Khayyam, who called it a Rubai. It has common rhyming schemes a a a a, a a b b, a b a b. Example #1: The Eagle (By Alfred Lord Tennyson) \u201cCome, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring Your Winter garment of Repentance fling: The Bird of Time has but a little way To flutter\u2013and the Bird is on the Wing.\u201d Example #2: Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard (By Thomas Gray) \u201cThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day, The lowing herd wind slowly o\u2019er the lea, The plowman homeward plods his weary way, And leaves the world to darkness and to me.\u201d Quitain A quintain, also referred to as \u201ccinquain,\u201d is a stanza of five lines, which may be rhymed or unrhymed, and has a typical stress pattern. Its invention is attributed to Adelaide Crapsey. Example #1: November Night (By Adelaide Crapsey) \u201cListen\u2026 With faint dry sound, Like steps of passing ghosts, The leaves, frost-crisp\u2019d, break from the trees And fall.\u201d Sestet Sestet is a kind of stanza that consists of six lines. It is the second division of Italian or sonnets of Petrarch, following an octave or the first division comprising eight lines. In a sonnet, a sestet marks a change of emotional state of a poet as they tend to be more subjective in the second part of the sonnet. Example #1: The Better Part (By Mathew Arnold) \u201cSo answerest thou; but why not rather say: \u2018Hath man no second life? \u2013 Pitch this one high! Sits there no judge in Heaven, our sin to see? \u2013 More strictly, then, the inward judge obey! Was Christ a man like us? Ah! Let us try If we then, too, can be such men as he!'\u201d The poet answers the rude inquirer passionately as soon as the sestet commences. Short Examples of Stanza in Sentences As I behold the beautiful sunrise It is like seeing a lovely surprise. A fox and an ant and three dogs Sat on a gravestone shooting dice. The fox slipped and fell on ant \u201cOh no!\u201d said the ant, \u201cthere\u2019s a fox on me!\u201d Oh old man, play one, Play knick and knack with your thumb, With knack, knack, and paddy whack, Come and give the cat a bone. White birds on the shore: A broken hoarding banging On the door. Raindrops on my page Cold breeze blows my paper away Oops! I need it! I once met a fairy who lived on a star. From a stranger prospective I had to move far. I asked her once why she lived on a st ",
