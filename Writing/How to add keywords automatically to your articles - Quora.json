            "answer_text": "How do you add keywords automatically to your articles? I want to start this answer by saying that if you are serious about your SERPs then you should never use any kind of automation or program to physically add keywords is just wrong and I am not even sure if such automation or apps are available but thinking about it they probably are because there is always someone looking to cheat the system. Secondly, all words are keywords. Search engines read all the text on the page. What is important is what people search and their search intent. I have long said that keyword research is overrated and that you should never do keyword research. If you are writing an article just Google what you would search if you were looking for what your article is to be about. If you see endless big authority sites or lots of ads that are very similar to what you're talking about then walk away, too much competition.. Rephrase your search until you find results that are easier to compete with. Next check out the related searches and show and the also ask sections and you have suddenly found all the keywords you need and any synonyms needed. That is about the extent of what you need to to do for keyword research. Now you can listen to this advice or you can listen to the SEO gurus who want you to go do thorough keyword research but then be prepared to pay for something very expensive to use or something you just don't understand how to use, and probably both. There are some that will need all the analysis and analytics because that's just how they are. Others just want to write good content and get it out to as many readers as they can and keyword research is a huge barrier to this. Always remember that SEO and keyword research is included in this, is a business and you are always going to be told you need to do this and do that and you need this tool and that and that is really just about selling something to you. Even free tool, some of which are good lead you to upgrades or other costly programs. All you need to get decent rankings and we are talking page 1 results is a basic knowledge of SEO and Google Search. SEO is not the golden ticket for search success. If your content sucks then it won't. What makes the difference is consistently created long-form content that people genuinely want to read. Then if you add in the basics SEO requirements you will do exceptionally well.  Hope this helps Regards Dexter Infobunny ",
