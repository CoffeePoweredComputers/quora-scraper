            "answer_text": "Do you mean \u201chow can I adapt an existing property or concept by someone else into a screenplay?\u201d If that is the question, the short answer is: acquire the rights. If someone else has created something and you want to turn it into a movie, you have to compensate them. If the question is \u201cconceptually and practically, what is involved in adapting something for the screen?\u201d I'd say that you need to remember that it was probably not originally written with a movie adaptation in mind so you might have to make certain changes in order to make it work as a movie. The conventional model tells us that a screenplay employing three act structure should have an inciting incident within the first ten pages. In a novel, the inciting incident might be 100 pages in. Look at all of the backstory etc. that was cut or condensed when adapted the first Harry Potter book into a film. Similarl, the experience of reading a book is a very different sensation than watching a move. A movie can be a very visceral experience. The way the shark dies in the film version of \u201cJaws\u201d is very different from the way it dies in the book. In adapting a book, you will cut scenes and characters , make up new scenes and characters. I hear that there is a talking dog in the novel \u201cForest Gump.\u201d Wonder why that plot element didn't make it into the movie. ",

            "answer_text": "You first need to learn something about how films are made and the costs that are involved to film certain scenes. Equipped with this information you then choose a book you would like to see made into a movie. Get a copy you can destroy and highlight all dialogue with a highlighter. Transcribe all this dialogue onto your word processor then place the dialogue in the appropriate setting as described in the novel. Note, you do not need to be as descriptive but concentrate on the key visuals and audio that will be involved in the scene. Rewrite the text until you are happy with its flow then set it up in screenplay format. That is the quickest way to adapt a book into a screenplay. ",
