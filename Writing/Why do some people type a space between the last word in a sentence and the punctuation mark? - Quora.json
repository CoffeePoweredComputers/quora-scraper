            "answer_text": "Interesting things, these spaces. I think James H. Kelly has the right approximate idea. Obviously, spaces and punctuation do go together\u2026 a space after a comma, colon, semicolon\u2026 but the whole thing of two spaces after a period ending a sentence or, as you say, one before that period\u2026 I think it's neither typographic nor language-based; I think it's clerical. I would surmise it flourished in the days of business penmanship, when the elegant slant of the script letterform actually would interfere with what came next. Dictation, shorthand and such business practices previous to the advent of mechanical type writing would benefit from such a rule. That said, once a rule, always a rule\u2026 once taught, is taught again. Typographers didn't need it, but I'm sure as typewriters burst upon the scene, the one space before and two spaces after was taught as a clerical rule of import. In truth, it was of no particular benefit except in script. On paper close enough the read, type was no more legible, though to the partially sight-impaired reader, \"elite\" typewriter type may have benefited. In truth, it was too small for those readers, whatever the spacing at final punctuation. By the advent of desktop editing, these old rules seem particularly arcane. In my youth I remember a typing teacher acquaintance of my mother. So many rules this lady knew, and her hands flew across even a manual unelectrified typewriter. She was faster than Mom, who could type, I was told, 60 words a minute. I bet the typewriting teacher (as she was classified) would know of the rules of which we speak, but she is long gone. I remember also she was rather well known as being an early recipient of a prefrontal lobotomy and electroshock therapy. I was just a kid, and I don't remember why\u2026. it has occurred long before my time, but she was always a bit \"Vulcan,\" if you will. ",

            "answer_text": "My only guess is that it is an edit error. Maybe they wrote more, but then deleted the text and didn't realize they left a space? Or they were thinking of adding another word, but changed their minds and forgot they had typed a space. I guess there is a slight chance that they thought they were on an iOS device and typed a double space expecting a period, but upon realizing that they were on the computer instead, they typed the period, forgetting to remove the spaces, though that doesn't account for a space before the comma. If you had noticed it with multi-element punctuation (! : ; ? %) where there is two or more bits to the mark, then I would have said that you were seeing posts from French speakers where that is the norm. Sorry, I can't better account for others' sloppy typing skills. -A2A ",
