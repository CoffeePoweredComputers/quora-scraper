            "answer_text": "News Articles \u2014 (real news articles) typically do not. Occasionally, it happens, but that is somewhat rare, and it should not occur. It may happen is a smaller venue, where a legitimate journalist has written a solid article, but the ownership is also the editor, and the the owner wishes to introduce his or her own partisan \u201cspin.\u201d I suspect, though - what you are referring to is a much larger problem. Some call it \u201cclickbait.\u201d These are instances where the article in not even news, at all. One propagandist has written a story (which may be made up, or fictional, or exaggeration, or an editorial of some sorts). Then, the person who hired them tries to construct an even more outrageously fictional headline \u2014 to entice people to click and read the underlying story (hoping they will believe the headline, regardless of that the article actually states.) That is a pervasive problem. Note, though \u2014 that is not news. That is not a \u201cnews article.\u201d That is an attempt to spread misinformation, and disinformation, and propaganda. Sometimes, it is a resource set up deliberately to help someone\u2019s political campaign. Sometimes, it is a resource set up deliberately to entice you to visit a website, to increase profits (from advertising, or from \u201cpaid for clicks\u201d schemes). Learn the difference between legitimate journalism and editorial content, and advertising \u2014 and you are usually able to avoid such nonsense. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is because headlines are crafted to get as much attention as possible. Most mainstream outlets have limits as to how far to push the line. Clearly deceptive headlines eventually turn people off. The longer answer includes other reasons, including whether you\u2019re looking at an article published by a responsible news organization. In most mainstream newsrooms, a different person usually writes the headlines and some \u201cdeceptive\u201d headlines may be unintentional. It\u2019s possible the headline writer doesn\u2019t understand the story as well as the reporter, or it\u2019s difficult to fully capture a complex topic in a simple sentence. Also, headlines used to be written by senior-level editors with years of experience. Nowadays, it\u2019s more likely to be a much less experienced, overworked, (and low paid) staffer. ",
