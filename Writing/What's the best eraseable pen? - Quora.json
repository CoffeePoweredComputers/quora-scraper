            "answer_text": "I LOVE the pilot frixion pen. Its the perfect pen and erases like magic (always leaving stunned on-lookers). Only issue is that the ink gets used up 4-5x faster than any other pen which makes it frustrating and expensive. I am trying out the Sharpie Liquid Pencil which erases wonderfully but writes scratchily. Hopefully it improves as I get used to it. ",
