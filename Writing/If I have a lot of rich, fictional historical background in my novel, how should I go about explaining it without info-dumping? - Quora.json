            "answer_text": "Resist the temptation to explain it at all. Ever. If the background is truly rich it will inform your entire world, and show up in a million little ways that affect the action. Those are how you show it. The audience needs to see the results, not the background notes. Ask yourself, every time you're tempted to mention any of your background, \u201chow does this fact alter the choices or emotional reactions available to my characters in this scene?\u201d. The answer is almost always \u201cit doesn't\u201d\u2026 in which case you don't need to mention it. Your job is to provide your audience with a well-realised house to live in, not the architect's blueprints of how it got that way. Show the history by the state of the world now. You don't need to discuss the history of the Napoleonic period, however fascinating it is; you just need your character to walk past the statue in Trafalgar Square. (Do not have your character read the plaque just so you can chat about why there's a big stone statue. If it's actually relevant your characters will have reason to discuss it, and if it doesn't force it's way into the conversation despite your best efforts to remove it, you didn't need it.) When your character gets into a gunfight and picks up a laser pistol, that's the absolute earliest moment that you can mention that the invention of force fields in 2035 made ballistic weapons useless. And you shouldn't, even then. Just show characters that take it for granted ballistic weapons are useless, and let the world build up gradually. Make the audience curious about the history before you tell them any of it. When the absence of a certain piece of knowledge breaks the scene, when the character actions and thoughts don't make sense without it\u2026 that's when your audience actually need to know it. Then you can edit it in\u2026 ideally at the time it\u2019s relevant; earlier on if you absolutely must. If it's just that it's breaking your heart not to include it\u2026 tough. That's not narrative necessity; that's just showing off how clever you were. Put it in an appendix for the fans, or better yet a web page where it won't inflate your page count. ",

            "answer_text": "You work it into the background, just as historical background comes up in the real world. For example, I was out the other days and happened to see a man with a cardboard badge on. On the badge was a sort of representation of an hourglass. I immediately recognised that as the \u201cExtinction Rebellion\u201d logo, and wondered if my bus home might be disrupted by a road being blocked by a climate change protest. All of that took perhaps a second or two of thought. If I were to write that scene in a novel, I\u2019d probably give it about that much space on the page, since it\u2019s just background. There\u2019d be no need to include some big screed along the lines of: Harry recognised the distinctive logo of Extinction Rebellion, and remembered that this was a decentralised group of environmental activists founded in 2018 and well-known for a variety of protests about climate change. He recalled that the group had put a green dye in the Limmat River in Z\u00fcrich, had disrupted flights out of London City Airport, and had glued themselves to bridges in Brisbane. Some of his friends had strong views in favour of and against the group, and he tried to avoid putting the two groups into close proximity at social events, since it didn\u2019t end well. He also thought about whether or not Greta Thunberg might win the Nobel Peace Prize. Thunberg was a school-aged activist from Sweden who had been \u201cstriking\u201d every Friday for much the same reason, and had recently spoken at the United Nations. This reminded him that Thunberg\u2019s mother was Malena Ernman, a Swedish singer who had competed at Eurovision\u2026 I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m tired just reading that. Unless the effect is to do a James Joyce on your readers (which it probably shouldn\u2019t ever be), you don\u2019t want to write something like that. It might be a fair summation of what my thought processes were at the time from seeing the logo, but it all goes on in the background. ",
