I would say a handwriting is worse only if I am not able to comprehend anything from a piece of writing. If you identify yourself with any of the instances written above, please slow down. Pause. You must be running out of patience and attempting to write too many words in a given period of time. Go slow and see if your handwriting has got any better! Let me know. ",

Like someone else pointed out, college can be stressful and most likely could affect your peacefulness, therefore: your handwriting is suffering. If your fingers hurt, you may be punishing yourself by forcing your writing to an unhealthy point. Don\u2019t do that. Go to one of those manicure places and have them treat your hands that may be developing callouses (My sister had that problem and precisely due to stress. If you insist on writing under these conditions, I will suggest two different directions to work your handwriting: 1- Start practicing your writing on a whiteboard in big letters, write big and keep practicing. After you have practice enough, perhaps your writing will go back to your normal standard. 2- Write very, very small; practice using a steel point like a 202 (Brause - Assorted Calligraphy Nibs - Set of 6 - in Metal Tin) You will be fighting a big demon inside yourself, good luck Cd ",
