            "answer_text": "Wow\u2026what a question. It\u2019s hard to answer because Bollywood has been in the film industry for over 100 years now and counting all the films made over those years would be tough. Currently the Bollywood film industry is putting out between 1200 and 1700 films each year, depending upon such things as actor availability, cooperation from weather, releases from The Central Board of Film Certification which is India\u2019s film governing body, and other factors. This is about two to three times the number or films turned out each year by Hollywood. If we were to reduce the amount even to say 1000 films per year and multiply that by the number of years Bollywood has been active, we could guesstimate at about 100,000 films, but that would be a conservative guess. I would guess between 130,000 and 160,000 films. ",
