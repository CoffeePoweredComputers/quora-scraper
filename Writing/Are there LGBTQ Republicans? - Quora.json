            "answer_text": "I have to assume there probably are, but after this past year, when the prez completely fucked over the LGBTQIA+ community, I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019re eager to admit it. The PRIDE movement in the past 50 years has been all about an enhanced sensibility and compassion for people who have never had a choice in their sexuality or gender expression. That means emotionally buying into to a special kind of humanity whereby kindness and tolerance and being welcoming is just a part of who you are. Gay or straight, cis or not. Met many Republicans like that lately? I sure haven\u2019t. Loyalty to party apparently is no longer a derivative of decency. So much hate and intolerance and bigotry just below the epidermis of any Republican true-believer. Their pals and spokespeople on FOX prime-time are terrific examples. You know: Tuckie, Tubbie and Tinklebell. They quite cheerily express out loud that it\u2019s just fine to believe and say anywhere\u2014anytime\u2014that LGBTQIA+ people are damaged goods, and not worthy of respect or kindness. Let\u2019s NOT bake a cake to celebrate. And let\u2019s NOT let them die for their country. Gee. They might embarrass some Republican morticians somewhere. So, no. I really doubt there are many out and proud Republicans anywhere these days. Who would want to talk to them? Plus, I doubt any of them actually like rainbows anyway\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "There is one major LGBTQ Republican Community, The Log Cabin Republicans (LCR) They have been around since 1977 and started in California in the early 70s when Reagan opposed the initiatives to ban gays from teaching children. The rumor was that the club wanted to be called the Lincoln Republicans but Reagan recommended a name change as Lincoln\u2019s, disputed, bisexual past might be to controversial. The LCR was a leading force in the getting Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell found unconstitutional (later repealed by Congress and Obama). They are sometimes deemed as moderates in the party by other LGBTQ Republican Groups and a splinter group, call GoProud, represented the more hardcore Libertarian/Conservative Republicans until 2014. The LCR has chapters in 35 states with many states having multiple clubs. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, as far as organizations go, the Log Cabin Republicans may still exist. They are (were?) a group of activists who supported both gay rights and smaller government. This is not an incompatible, of course, as it sounds, since a smaller government, in theory, would not be in the business of overtly denying equal rights to its citizens. Unfortunately for the Log Cabin crowd, that is exactly what the modern GOP is attempting. (Ask yourself which party was in favor of governmental interference in same-sex marriage, and is actively attempting to thwart employment protection for LGBTQ citizens.) If the Log Cabin Republicans still exist, their membership is probably around the size of, say, \u201cJews for Hitler\u201d. The only celebrity that comes to mind would be Caitlyn Jenner, who despises liberals but still publicly opposed \u201cbathroom bills\u201d (see HB2 in North Carolina). It never dawned on her, it seems, that her political tribe proposed them. So either she\u2019s not the brightest bulb in the box, or she\u2019s living proof that you can be both LGBTQ and a shitbag.
