Yeah maybe there is a different between using \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfor\u201d for word \u201cprescription\u201d in vocabulary.

            "answer_text": "There is no real difference in casual conversation. Technically, however, \"prescribed to\" does not really exist. The \"to\" is not attached to \"prescription.\"Example 1: The medicine is prescribed to children.Example 2: The medicine is prescribed to treat diabetes. However, the \"for\" is, in fact, attached to \"prescription\". Example 3: The doctor prescribed this medicine for my husband.Example 4: There are medicines prescribed for diabetes. Let me put it this way. Technically, in Examples 1 & 2, you could end the sentence at \"prescribed\" and still have a grammatically correct sentence. What follows is a prepositional phrase and such phrases are mere add-ons, of no grammatical value. However, in Examples 3 & 4, the sentences would be grammatically incorrect if they left out \"for\" and the words that follow \"for\". There is a difference between merely saying \"prescribed\" and saying \"prescription for\". There is a fundamental change in the meaning. So long as the prescription is correct, in re functionality, it makes no difference to whom it goes. A doctor may prescribe the same medicine to different diabetic patients, for instance. But a prescription for diabetes is very different from a prescription for cancer. I hope that helps. ",
