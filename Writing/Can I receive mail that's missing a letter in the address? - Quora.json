            "answer_text": "I am going to say yes and here is why and how. First the how\u2026 if your mail carrier knows you by name, face and home, then in most cases they will deliver the mail piece to you without delay. Now the why (more so validation)\u2026 my niece sent me a Christmas card last year with ONLY the numbers in the street address, and yet it was still my old address before I moved, the mail carrier was and still is the same one from my old address to the new address and she was able to get it to me in time and without delay. For this reason, I left her something in my mailbox specifically for her, (call it a small token of appreciation for Christmas). My old address was 1170 E Hopson St (on the east side of town), so she had addressed it to me using only \u201c1170, City, State, Zip\u201d, and it still arrived like normal. When I seen how it was addressed, I was amazed and she laughed over it and apologized over and over about it. So in short, it really does depend on your mail carrier and the post office and if they can recognize the address with missing characters. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes if you are missing a letter in the street name or city you should still get your letter. Letters are sorted by zip codes. If your zip code is incorrect your letter will be delayed but eventually you will receive it. If your apartment number is missing you might not unless your carrier recognizes your name ",
