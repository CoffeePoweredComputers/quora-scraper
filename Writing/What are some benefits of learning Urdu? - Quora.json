            "answer_text": "I want to make quite some points here: Urdu is more closely related to Haryanvi through Khari Boli than either Persian or Arabic. Most people get taken in by the script or the vocabulary which is Persian/ Arabic. But the script is not the language the syntax is.Thus Urdu is a living proof of the amalgamation of cultures.This will teach you to appreciate things that are profound and deep and not just get carried away by what things appear to be.The last time we knew when English werent ruling, Urdu was the language of royalty. For a better appreciation of the native Indian culture which wasnt polluted by colonialism knowing Urdu is a must. The last best version of Indian culture is preserved in Urdu.Urdu comes from the same root word as \u201cHorde\u201d . It developed in the market places where Turkish, Indian, Persian troops interacted. That is the power just meeting and chatting each other up.We get to know from reliable sources that \u2018umra e dilli\u2019 the Elite of Delhi used to send their children to Tawaifs to learn the subtle nuances of their culture through their pristine Urdu. The best aspects of Culture can be preserved at seemingly worst places.After learning Urdu you might be pleasantly surprised to know how much Indian Movies and thus Indian art/culture are indebted to it. It is another thing all songs , dialogues are mostly written in Urdu and transliterated for actors and singers to Hindi. One language\u2019s symboitic relation with another helps both thrive.And much more: Tired typing. More for some other occassion.",

            "answer_text": "One of the biggest advantages of learning Urdu along with its writing system is the large number of people you will be able to connect with. Urdu is a language spoken across Pakistan and not easily differentiable from Hindi which is spoken across Northern India. Also, it uses the Arabic script (with a few more letters) and thus you would be able to read, if not understand, most of the languages in the Middle East and other Islamic countries (the list includes Arabic, Persian, Pashto, Dari, Punjabi and Sindhi). Of course, one can say that some of the most beautiful poetry has been written in Urdu but I doubt that would be a good enough reason to learn a new language. Also, this statement would be a very subjective one. ",
