            "answer_text": "This is basically going to outline the differences between Fanfiction and Original Works. Hope it helps! Fanfiction vs. Original Works Original Works You create your own rich worldYou personalize your own charactersYou have to convince readers to read get to know your characters and your worldThere is more pressure to come up with unique plot devices or macguffinsFanfiction The world is already set up for youYou interpret someone else\u2019s characters, trying to understand them the way the original creator understands themYou have a ready audience already familiar with the setting and charactersReady made macguffins you can use to further your plotI consider Fanfiction to be excellent practice for writing my own original works; when I write a fanfiction, I get into English Class mode and analyze the characters in the original work, try to understand them, so I can write them as in-character as possible. I get to know the world that is already set up, and I try to craft a plot as similar in theme and tone to the original as possible. It\u2019s like playing with toys in a sandbox. Original Works, in contrast, are like building your own sandbox, filling it with sand, and constructing your own toy plastic dump truck. You use basically the same process, except you create the circumstances for the character that causes them to do certain things, you craft the world that readers will get to know, and you decide what kind of tone or themes you want to communicate. This is called \u201cdivergent thinking\u201d, a process that, unfortunately, is not being taught in most schools today. We learn \u201cconvergent thinking\u201d, which means we arrive at one correct answer. For example, when we read To Kill A Mockingbird, for example, we recognize that Atticus Finch is the protagonist, Scout is the narrator, and Harper Lee is trying to communicate a message about justice and racial equality. This is convergent thinking; we might arrive at this conclusion by many ways, but very few people are going to dispute that this is the correct answer. Compare divergent thinking; you\u2019re going to write a novel yourself, now. Suppose you start off with a protagonist who is an optimistic fireman, a narrator who works as a barista in Starbucks, and you want to communicate themes of honor and duty. (If well-written), this is a fine novel! But then, you might think, \u201cwhat if the fireman is bitter instead of optimistic, and instead of a barista, the narrator is a school teacher?\u201d This is also fine! Divergent thinking is basically the exact opposite of those reading comprehension questions you had to answer in grade school. It\u2019s a creative process; from one point, you generate multiple ideas, all perfectly valid. Fanfiction, in many respects, has more elements of convergent thinking than writing original works; if Bob, in the original work, is grumpy, then the fanfiction will be definitively incorrect if you portray Bob as a ball of sunshine. However, if in your original work, you decide to change Bob from a grump to a ball of sunshine (assuming you can still make the plot coherent,) then no one can tell you otherwise. Both \u201cBobs\u201d are equally valid. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve had days like that. Writing is hard work. If you\u2019re playing in someone else\u2019s universe, they\u2019ve done all the hard work: the world building, the character building, the reasons things work the way they do, how society fits together, etc. When you\u2019re working in original fiction, then you are responsible for ALL of that. And it\u2019s daunting. I write both. Not published yet. So, I know how lovely it is to take a break and write in someone else\u2019s universe where I know all the ins and outs and just have the story to tell. But, if original fiction calls to you, then there will come a day when that world building falls into place. A world, this one, that one, some world you\u2019ve never even caught a glimpse of before, will catch your eye. All that hard work will suddenly be worth it because, as with any journey, you just have to get to the end of it, regardless of the mountains, the rivers, the oceans or the interstellar distances that loom ahead of you, you need to know what happens. When that day hits, your muse will rock back, stare at you in amazement, roll their sleeves up, gird their tunic to wading length and start throwing stuff at you faster than you think you can handle it. Hiding in a favorite book for a few chapters may happen to take break from the flow. If you think fan fiction is a wild ride, original is crazier. Oh, and if you really want to write original fic, take a writing class, or two \u2026 or several. It\u2019s amazing what hanging out with like minded \u2026 words on paper, words on electrons, I gotta get these things out of my head \u2026 people, not necessarily same genre, can do to help you get started, get going, get the bit in your teeth and run with it. OR, decide that maybe that\u2019s not your cup of tea after all. Whichever road you follow, whatever you write, best of luck to you! and don\u2019t forget to find someplace to share your writing. Your stories are important whether in a fandom or creating your own! To steal from one of my mentors: Write with joy! ",
