            "answer_text": "For a contemporary literal Chinese? It\u2019s gonna be really confusing, since hanzi has been the official written system from time unknown, \u5973\u5a32\u9020\u4eba - creation of human by nvwa, \u4ed3\u9889\u9020\u5b57 - creation of hanzi by cangjie(or at least the simplification of hanzi in the 50s), Chinese people are trained to read hanzi from babies. Pinying is created as a tool to help learning the vocalization of hanzi, not the other way around. Reading an article or sentence made of pinyin would be like having an adult use a baby walker, totally awkward and counter productive. For an imaginary scenario, where Chinese young are forced to learn only pinying for generations? A rather controversial topic, it\u2019s rather hurtful to our national/ethnic pride, just like forcing French to speak English, forcing Americans to speak Persian, etc etc. However in a purely theoretical point of view, I think it could be clear. Chinese is a very contextual language, in case of a real-life conversation, one would use a lot of contextual clue to clarify and pin point the meaning of the sentence being spoken. It\u2019s common to favor a more understandable way of using words to avoid confusion. E.g. \u4ed6\u4eec\u5168\u90e8\u6765(ta men quan bu lai, all of them are coming) is clear written in hanzi, but awkward in spoken language. A better alternative would be \u4ed6\u4eec\u5168\u90e8\u90fd\u6765(ta men quan bu dou lai), both \u5168\u90e8 and \u90fd means all, by repetition it avoids the confusion of \u5168\u90e8 and \u5168\u4e0d, so \u5168\u90e8\u90fd becomes a common expression, even if it means \u201call all\u201d. Meanwhile, you can safely utter \u201cta men quan bu lai\u201d and mean \u4ed6\u4eec\u5168\u4e0d\u6765(none of them is coming), especially if you add in a bit of contextual clue by pronouncing \u4e0d\u6765 together and quickly, separating them from rest of the sentence: \u201cta men quan - bulai\u201d In conclusion, you can put enough verbosity and contextual clue into a sentence to make it understandable, which means pinying version of the sentence would have a clear and sole meaning. But too much verbosity can damage the efficiency and elegance of the language, especially the written form. And any form of culture phenomenon based on the current Chinese language would cease to exist. Poems would be impossible, repertoire of a writer will be severely limited, and any kind of wordplay would lose its charm entirely. Back to our dystopia future, people will be trained to read pinying from birth so awkwardness is no longer an issue, and it\u2019s reasonable to believe that both the language and pinying itself will evolve to improve clarity and support various art forms. But in such a case, the aforementioned language will be rather different from the Chinese language today, rendering OP\u2019s question ambiguous by definition. Some special usage of Chinese that\u2019s based on the written language: \u706b\u661f\u6587: Intentional use of incorrect(but similar looking) characters to self-identify a personality or blend in emotions. \u56e7 : Repurpose of characters to serve as emojis. You can say \u201cjiong\u201d to another person and he/she will understand that you\u2019re embarrassed/shocked etc. It only makes sense because the written character looks like a embarrassed/shocked face.

            "answer_text": "Well, I think it is used to write books for blind people in Chinese Braille. It is used to input text on phones and computers and it is well known , promoted and still you hear quite frequently that it is crap. Despite everything it is a reality for decades, the same way as Chinese characters are for thousands of years. It probably is a very good system to write down certain dialects of colloquial Chinese. Maybe some kind of the Northern ones like the Beijing dialect or some Hui dialects which were even written down in some modification of the Arabic script Xiao'erjing - Wikipedia . For everything too classical or too scientific or too Southern it is a bad choice, because it was simply not designed for that. Well, the Chinese could have decided to used a mixed script like the Japanese or the Koreans at some time. Some women even made their own approach in simplifying the Chinese writing system. N\u00fcshu - Wikipedia However it was again suitable for one dialect. There were even attempts to give every Chinese character a unique spelling centuries ago and it is said that Sino-Vietnamese pronounciation and spelling is coming close to that. Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary - Wikipedia Actually the current solution looks like both a retreat and a compromise to me and computers help a lot to maintain the status quo. It simply isn\u2019t \u201cI think something is good and it shall be done\u201d with writing systems etc. and that\u2019s why a lot of languages like for instance German have a suboptimal writing system or English spelling is that hard to learn. For people with little knowledge , no knowledge or a strong passive knowledge of Chinese Characters Pinyin is the only option to write some kind of understandable message in their mother tongue to someone else. Back in the old days they had to pay someone for that. Maybe now a computer and the internet is sufficient. I remember many Chinese people say that Pinyin is rather an aid or a tool for them than a writing system like IPA should help you with the pronouncing foreign words etc. ",

            "answer_text": "The name system will be in a disaster, and nobody will have any idea about who is who. My name is \u6c64\u777f, in pinyin: T\u0101ng Ru\u00ec.There was a girl in my highschool, her name was T\u0101ng Ru\u00ec too, but written and meaning differently: \u6c64\u745e. We're in the same class, and we're good friends. When friends and teachers were calling my name or her name or both of our names, we have no idea if they were calling my name or her name or both of our names.What's worst, I learnt when I was 22 that one of my remote related uncle is named T\u0101ng Ru\u00ec, too! And again, written in different characters: \u6c64\u9510 and means differently.(For those who don't know that every single Chinese person's name has its meaning, well, I'm telling you now: they do! My name means intelligence, my classmate girl's means a type of Chinese jade, my uncle's means acuity.) Okay, up to now it's my own story. It's gonna be very confusing if we three were together in a group conversation, where our names are gonna be called very often. Imagine more people of the same name pronunced exactly the same: T\u0101ng Ru\u00ec. Here there are two more:\u6c64\u82ae\uff0c\u6c64\u53e1. There is a common name in China: Zh\u0101ng Z\u01d0 Y\u00ed. Dude, now you have a lot of names to see. Like, reeeeeeeeeally a lot!\u5f20\u5b50\u6021\uff0c\u5f20\u5b50\u5b9c\uff0c\u5f20\u7d2b\u6021\uff0c\u5f20\u7d2b\u4eea\uff0c\u5f20\u6893\u4eea\uff0c\u5f20\u6893\u9890\uff0c\u5f20\u5b50\u9890\uff0c\u5f20\u7d2b\u9890\uff0c\u5f20\u699f\u6021\uff0c\u5f20\u699f\u8c0a......Oh, I forgot to mention that their are two common Family names of Zh\u0101ng. Instead of \u5f20 as above, we also have \u7ae0. So here you go again, all the above names, you replace \u5f20 with \u7ae0, and you got some more amigos to make!\u7ae0\u5b50\u6021\uff0c\u7ae0\u5b50\u5b9c\uff0c\u7ae0\u7d2b\u6021\uff0c\u7ae0\u7d2b\u4eea\uff0c\u7ae0\u6893\u4eea\uff0c\u7ae0\u6893\u9890\uff0c\u7ae0\u5b50\u9890\uff0c\u7ae0\u7d2b\u9890\uff0c\u7ae0\u699f\u6021\uff0c\u7ae0\u699f\u8c0a......(The first one is the famous Chinese actress, in the movie 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.)Still not enough? Well let me just tell you that these names listed above are just a portion of real names. We have tens of different characters written the same in pinyin, and majority of them could be used in names. Still not enough? Not even with people of a three-charactered names? Don't worry bro, we have people with a name of four, five, six or even more characters. Come and makes friends with us, we promise we'll only show you our pinyin names! It will surely be a fun time for you to remember our names, no? ",

            "answer_text": "Despite the lack of practicability of pinyinising written Chinese, I'll analyse it hypothetically. Let's first look at the common types of words. One-character words are often pronouns and particles.Two-character words dominate in modern Chinese.Three-characters words are common as nouns, adjectives (~\u7684), adverbs (~\u5730) and compound phrases with adjectives (e.g. \u5c0f\u5b69\u5b50, literally little child).Four-character words are also common due to the fact that most \u6210\u8bed (chengyu) consists of four characters. They also appear as compound phrases (often consisting of two nouns, e.g. \u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49, socialism).So how ambiguous are they respectively? For only one character, it's hardly possible to understand it without context. However, for specific pronunciations, you can get the meaning quite naturally. For instance, w\u01d2 generally represents \u6211 (I), you won't think of other characters at first sight. As for others, one pronunciation usually match tens of characters (as you can see from dictionaries), and many of them are commonly used.Two-character words are much easier to understand. Nevertheless, confusions may be made. But it's rather rare for two words to have exactly the same pronunciation (with tone markings, and in modern Chinese). For instance, n\u01cei ni\u00fa undoubtedly represents \u5976\u725b (cow), but for sh\u00ec ji\u00e8 you have \u4e16\u754c (world) and \u89c6\u754c (visual field), although the former is preferred because the latter is far more rarely used. A better example is l\u00ec z\u01d0, you have \u4f8b\u5b50 (example) or \u6817\u5b50 (chestnut), which are both common and have completely different meanings.For most three- or four-character words, no confusions are ever made. You may never find two three- or four-character words that sound exactly the same.The above is a brief introduction of the vocabulary in modern Chinese. So what happens when they're put together? Writing Chinese in pinyin with tone markings is no different from spoken Chinese (from which you only get the pronunciation). Therefore, we can certainly compare this with the ambiguity of colloquial Chinese. Fact is, confusions are seldom made (when you're reading modern Chinese). See some examples (excerpted from the news): \u00c0o d\u00e0 l\u00ec y\u00e0 m\u01d2u ch\u00f9, q\u00ed j\u01d0ng s\u00e8 zh\u012b m\u011bi l\u00ecng r\u00e9n t\u00e0n w\u00e9i gu\u0101n zh\u01d0. \u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u67d0\u5904\uff0c\u5176\u666f\u8272\u4e4b\u7f8e\u4ee4\u4eba\u53f9\u4e3a\u89c2\u6b62\u3002 C\u00f3ng t\u00e0i k\u014dng w\u01d2 men n\u00e9ng k\u00e0n d\u00e0o l\u00ecng r\u00e9n zh\u00e8n j\u012bng de d\u00ec qi\u00fa zh\u012b m\u011bi, d\u00e0n r\u00e9n l\u00e8i du\u00ec hu\u00e1n j\u00ecng ch\u01cen sh\u0113ng de y\u01d0ng xi\u01ceng y\u011b l\u00ec l\u00ec z\u00e0i m\u00f9. \u4ece\u592a\u7a7a\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u770b\u5230\u4ee4\u4eba\u9707\u60ca\u7684\u5730\u7403\u4e4b\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e5f\u5386\u5386\u5728\u76ee\u3002 When special clarification is required, Chinese use a structure \u201cX\u662fXX\u91cc\u7684X\u3002\u201d to indicate the character s/he's referring to (especially for names). For instance, when you want to say \u5e08, you might say \u201c\u5e08\u662f\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u5e08\u201d. As can be seen from the analysis above, we see one important thing. The way in which people understand phonetically written Chinese is completely based on their \"sense\" of the language itself. It works in the same way as a pinyin input method. When you type the pinyin of a full sentence, the input method will provide you with one based on the corpus. Every individual speaker has somehow a \"corpus\" of that sort, which is obtained through reading. When you see a phrase written in pinyin, the characters themselves come to your mind without thought! In actuality, it's even possible to write without tone markings, yet with greater chances of misunderstanding. As long as the context is clear, confusions are unlikely to be made without tone markings. Now for the ancient Chinese part. Unlike modern Chinese, ancient Chinese words are often one character. See some examples with their modern Chinese equivalents: \u59bb - \u59bb\u5b50 - wife \u5b50 - \u513f\u5b50 - son \u53bb - \u79bb\u5f00 - to leave What's interesting is that the phrase \u59bb\u5b50 means wife in modern Chinese but wife and son in ancient Chinese. When reading ancient Chinese, most of the times, you should understand character by character. Now you can guess the ambiguity of ancient poems if written in pinyin. With the special vocabulary of ancient Chinese, it's impossible to understand ancient poems because nearly no context is provided. See an example: Y\u00f9 zh\u012b w\u00e9i g\u01d4 w\u00e9n, q\u01d0 d\u00fa q\u01d4 q\u00ed d\u00f2u d\u00fa b\u00fa l\u00e8i y\u00fa j\u012bn zh\u011b y\u00e9? S\u012b g\u01d4 r\u00e9n \u00e9r b\u00fa d\u00e9 ji\u00e0n, xu\u00e9 g\u01d4 d\u00e0o z\u00e9 y\u00f9 ji\u0101n t\u014dng q\u00ed c\u00ed. For me I'd write (based on my understanding and sense of ancient Chinese), which doesn't make any sense: \u6b32\u77e5\u4e3a\u53e4\u6587\uff0c\u5c82\u8bfb\u53d6\u5176\u53e5\u8bfb\u4e0d\u7d2f\u4f59\u4eca\u8005\u90aa\uff1f\u65af\u53e4\u4eba\u800c\u4e0d\u5f97\u89c1\uff0c\u5b66\u53e4\u9053\u5219\u6b32\u517c\u901a\u5176\u8bcd\u3002 The original text is: \u6108\u4e4b\u4e3a\u53e4\u6587\uff0c\u5c82\u72ec\u53d6\u5176\u53e5\u8bfb\u4e0d\u7c7b\u65bc\u4eca\u8005\u90aa\uff1f\u601d\u53e4\u4eba\u800c\u4e0d\u5f97\u89c1\uff0c\u5b66\u53e4\u9053\u5219\u6b32\u517c\u901a\u5176\u8f9e\u3002 Poems are even more difficult to understand because of \"irregularities\" and lack of context. In fact, one cannot even understand a poem even when written in characters. It should be noted that if you're writing a famous sentence, people can understand you as long as they've learned it. For example, if you write ch\u016bn mi\u00e1n b\u00fa ji\u00e0o xi\u01ceo, people can know that it refers to \u6625\u7720\u4e0d\u89c9\u6653 because it's known to all. Something more... As Feifei Wang noted, there are confusions like \u4ed6\u4eec\u5168\u90e8\u6765 (all of them are coming) and \u4ed6\u4eec\u5168\u4e0d\u6765 (none of them are coming), which can be sometimes rather frustrating. However, I'd say that the latter is seldom used (since people know it causes confusion). If you look deeper into the sentences, you'll find that they're not commonly used. One may write \u4ed6\u4eec\u5168\u90e8\u90fd\u6765 for \u4ed6\u4eec\u5168\u90e8\u6765 and \u4ed6\u4eec\u5168\u90fd\u4e0d\u6765 or \u4ed6\u4eec\u5168\u90e8\u90fd\u4e0d\u6765 for \u4ed6\u4eec\u5168\u4e0d\u6765. What I'm emphasising is that if you seek confusions \"on purpose\", you'll get tonnes of them. But if you don't, confusions become rare (at least rarer than you think). Nearly all the confusions (in modern Chinese) you find sound somewhat unnatural and/or senseless. However, this doesn't mean that Chinese can/should shift to pinyinised written Chinese. That takes much more time for the typers and the readers, which makes the whole process of pinyinisation useless. We don't spend time guessing what character the pinyin exactly represents. Here I'll not elaborate on how destructive and stupid it is to actually put complete pinyinisation into practice. For further reading, see (in Chinese): \u5982\u4f55\u770b\u5f85\u6c49\u5b57\u62c9\u4e01\u5316\uff1f - \u6587\u5316 - \u77e5\u4e4e \u62c9\u4e01\u5b57\u6bcd\u7ec8\u5c06\u6dd8\u6c70\u65b9\u5757\u5b57\uff1f - \u6587\u5316 - \u77e5\u4e4e Update: I forgot to add one thing: the names. Usually, you can't predict the characters of one's name by pinyin. The reason for that is lack of context. Only if you know the connotation of the names will it be possible to do that. The same applies to all other situations that lack context (e.g., single characters or words). ",

            "answer_text": "While I object to pinyinization as well, I feel Feifei Wang overreacted a bit. I think this question is interesting because it specifically mentions poetry (before edition). Perhaps a more confined and less controversial question would be \"Would the meaning of a Chinese poem get across through recitation?\" The answer depends on the type of poetry, as Joseph Boyle pointed out. For contemporary poetry, they often seem like short vernacular essays, and should largely get across when read aloud, but the lack of musical element pretty much renders reading aloud pointless at first place. For classical poetry, most modern people would have trouble understanding the precise meaning even if the characters are shown, let alone with unknown characters, because the language has changed quite dramatically. Furthermore, the musical quality of classical poetry also decays due to sound drift. For example, some classical poems no longer rhyme when read in modern Mandarin, but they should if in Middle Chinese. I guess these reasons explain why the notion of reading poetry aloud is not as deep-rooted as in the Western tradition. What about classical poetry for people in the history? We don't know, but the educated probably got to enjoy both the meaning and the musical quality of poetry. It's said that some classical poems are \"pop music\" in their times. So imagine the enjoyment of a singalong ;) As to the original question, the ambiguity would be manageable if the written Chinese happens to be close to colloquial, but would be rampant otherwise. I discussed this in another post and the comment therein: Meng Zhang's answer to Why do non-native Mandarin learners who struggle with characters refuse to write in pinyin?  To answer the edited question \"When read aloud or rendered phonetically, would written Chinese be more ambiguous than spoken Chinese?\" Let me first quote from Wikipedia:Written vernacular Chinese Since late 1920s, nearly all Chinese newspapers, books, and official and legal documents have been written in vernacular Chinese using the national standard. However, the tone or register and the choice of vocabulary may be formal or informal, depending on the context. Generally, the more formal the register of vernacular Chinese, the greater the resemblance to classical Chinese. To which I'll add: the higher the chance of ambiguity when read aloud. This implies: some formal written Chinese (e.g. in technical papers, legal documents, some types of literature) is not meant to be read aloud. ",

The above is an English sentence written in the international phonetic alphabet (IPA). Try reading that and imagine it's about 3 times harder to read Pinyin. You really need to read out each word to figure out what it's said. And there's the matter of \"characters that pronounced the same\". So not only is it hard to read; even if you read it out, you might get the meaning wrong.  For example: \u4ed6\u4eec\u5168\u90e8\u6765 (all of them are coming) and \u4ed6\u4eec\u5168\u4e0d\u6765 (none of them are coming) sounds exactly the same. So by reading pinyin, you won't know whether they're coming over or not.  So using Pinyin to replace Chinese character is absolutely absurdly stupidly ridiculous, and completely unnecessary. Chinese use Chinese characters to communicate very well. There's absolutely ZERO reason (other than some ridiculous Westerner's dream to learn Chinese easier) to write Chinese with Pinyin.  The sooner people stop with this line of thought the better off we'll all be. ",

            "answer_text": "Classical poetry would be pretty difficult not only because of homonymy but because a lot of words are no longer used, or are used differently, or only in compounds. Prose written in a really colloquial style would probably be fine. Phonetic writing would discourage semi-classical prose with literary expressions not used in spoken language. Chinese poetry However, even today, the concept of modern poetry is still debated. There are arguments and contradiction as to whether modern poetry counts as poetry. Due to the special structure of Chinese writing and Chinese grammar, modern poetry, or free verse poetry, may seem like a simple short vernacular essay since they lack some of the structure traditionally used to define poetry.

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s an interesting question. You can tell a lot by context (for singing, most songs can be understood just be hearing the pinyin even without the tones)There are a ton of meaning for each pinyin word and even each pinyin word with the same tone.Just to prove a quick point. When you type in Chinese characters on your phone, you can just type the pinyin and it will list several characters for you to choose from. There are definitely MOST COMMON characters used for each pinyin and these are listed first.  So for the pinyin \u201cni\u201d it will list out a row of about 8 common choices. However if you click the up arrow then you will see just how many \u201cni\u2019s\u201d there are too choose from.  There are dozens of characters to choose from! For some common words, they\u2019re could be way way too many to choose from. This is where using just pinyin-ization will falter. There\u2019s no way to clarify all these characters well or just through context. This is an individual point, not to mention the point about losing the cultural value and history of using Chinese characters. Keep learning Chinese! Good question. ",
