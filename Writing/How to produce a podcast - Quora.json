            "answer_text": "I launched my first podcast in 2013. I had no idea what I was doing. Through mostly trial and error, emulating other shows, publishing just over 100 episodes, and purchasing a few online courses about podcasting, I finally figured out how to do a few things properly. When I launched my second podcast in 2015, I was much more experienced and had an actual launch strategy in place. I\u2019ve also helped several other people successfully launch their podcasts using this same process. I shared the process for launching my second podcast on my blog and in my online course, but here is a summary of the main steps involved: Branding: Before buying any equipment or software, or recording episodes for your show, it\u2019s important to spend some time on your branding. The brand you create for your podcast serves as the foundation upon which decisions about episodes topics, guest interviews, episode format, publishing schedule, etc. will be made. Create a persona (aka avatar) for your ideal listener. Who do you envision listening to your podcast? Be as specific as possible. If you try to appeal to everyone, you will likely appeal to no one. If the goal of your podcast is to help you attract clients for your business, create a persona for your ideal client.Give your show a title (and subtitle, if you want). Be clear instead of clever. Your title (or the combination or your title and subtitle) should clearly articulate what your podcast is about.Write a one paragraph description for your show. Describe what it is about, who it is for, and the benefits of listening.Hire a graphic designer to create a cover art / logo for your podcast. This square image should be grab the attention of your target audience and be readable as a small icon on mobile devices, laptops, etc.Intros & outros. Most podcast episodes have standard intros and outros (music + voice) at the beginning and end of each episode. Write the scripts for your intros and outros, record them (or hire voice talent, Fiverr has lots), and find royalty free music to use (Audio Jungle has lots). Save the final files to place in your episodes during the editing process.Your show\u2019s title (+ subtitle), your name, your cover art and your description will appear on iTunes and whatever other podcast directories you submit your show to (Stitcher, Google Play, etc.). Together, these elements help \u201csell\u201d your show to potential listeners. See example below:  Equipment & Software: Once you\u2019ve got your branding sorted out, it\u2019s time to purchase the necessary equipment and software to create your podcast episodes. At a minimum, you will need a laptop or desktop computer, a microphone, a pair of headphones, recording and editing software, and a media host (to host your audio files). Here are some recommendations: Microphones: Behringer Ultravoice Xm8500 ($)Audio Technica ATR 2100 ($$)Heil PR-40 ($$$)Any pair of noise cancelling headphones (for interviewing guests and editing) Recording & editing software: Skype + MP3 Skype Recorder, Ecamm or PamelaZoomAudacity, Sony Sound Forge, Adobe AuditionAccessories: Mic pop filterMic suspension scissor armsMedia hosts: LibsynSoundCloudShow Format: Next, decide who will host the show, what type of episodes you are going to record and how often you are going to publish episodes: Host options: Host it yourself (self-hosted)Host it with someone else (co-hosted)Common episode types: Topic basedGuest interviewsQ&A (answer questions your audience submits to you)Mix of any of the aboveCommon episode lengths: 5-10 min (great for Q&A or quick tips)20-30 min (great for cover specific topics or short interviews)45 min (common length for interviews)60+ min(for very in-depth episodes or long interviews)Episode frequencies: Daily episodes (hard work, but lots of content for your audience)2-3 episodes per week (not easy, but a good amount of content)1 episode per week (manageable and most common option)2-3 episodes per month (easier, but less content for your audience)Media Host: Once you have your branding and your first few episodes ready, you\u2019ll need to create an account with a media host. This is where you will upload your audio files and schedule them to be published. Your media host will provide you with a specific URL/link to your show (aka a feed). This is the link you will submit to iTunes when you are ready to launch your show. From that point on, iTunes will essentially \u201cscan\u201d your show\u2019s feed for new episodes and display them on iTunes automatically as they are detected. Very hands off. Submitting to iTunes: To submit your show to iTunes, simply open the Podcast section of the iTunes store, and look for the words \u201cSubmit a Podcast\u201d in the right menu. From there, just follow the instructions and be ready to paste your show\u2019s link into the box. It doesn\u2019t take long for iTunes to review and accept a podcast submission (often 24\u201348 hours during the week).  Launch (via iTunes): Since iTunes is the most popular platform for podcasts (over one billion podcast subscriptions and counting), I recommend focusing your launch efforts there. Plus, they have a New & Noteworthy section where any new podcast can be featured, and in the process be exposed to thousands of potential listeners in multiple categories. To get featured on New & Noteworthy for your show\u2019s categories, you need a combination of downloads, subscriptions, ratings, and reviews. Although your listeners may eventually get around to doing these, by the time they do you will probably have missed your opportunity to be featured in New & Noteworthy. My recommendation is to assemble a \u201claunch team\u201d (a group of people ready to help you out) and have them subscribe to your show, download a few episodes, and leave you positive ratings and reviews immediately after you launch your show. A large amount of these in a short period of time will help your show climb the rankings on iTunes. After your initial launch, go ahead and submit your show to other platforms such as Google Play, Stitcher, etc. for additional exposure and listeners. I hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "These days it doesn't take all that much to get started.  First you need to decide how portable you want to be with your setup. If you have a space that will work as a studio where you'll all convene for recording, I'd suggest investing in a small (four- to eight-channel) mixer, four good large-diaphragm condenser mics (good quality mics make a huge difference, and this is where you'll want to spend money), four boom stands or tabletop stands for microphones (depending on whether you want to be at a table recording), windscreens and cabling for them. If you want to get fancy, you might want to invest in pre-amps for the mics, but that's probably not necessary.  Your mixer should have a Firewire/USB out for recording on your computer. One powerful and free piece of audio software, very easy to learn and sufficient for all your needs, is Audacity, but even Garageband, which comes installed on any Mac, is absolutely sufficient. You'll want to record in a quiet room, and while you don't need to fit it out with complicated baffling or staple egg cartons or foam to the walls, it'll help if it's a carpeted room with lots of drapes and cloth upholstery. The more acoustically dead, the better.  Alternatively, if you want to be portable, one great piece of gear is the Zoom H6. Actually you might want to use the recorder in lieu of the mixer+computer setup described above, especially if you're going with something relatively high-end like the Zoom H6. It's a four-channel portable (battery-powered) recording device, and has the wonderful ability to export each of the channels individually as an audio track to your audio editing software. That makes editing way easier, you'll find.  The Zoom gives you that portability that lets you go out and record in the field\u2014interviews if you want to drop some of that in, besides the studio recording. Equipment is one thing, but no matter how good the production quality, you'll obviously want to focus more on the actual content. Few people are able to actually speak completely extemporaneously and be engaging and funny through the duration of podcast, so the trick\u2014for me at least\u2014is loose scripting. GIve yourself something to work off of; the art is to never sound like you're reading, but instead talking off-the-cuff in your natural voice even if you are in fact reading. Getting your podcast onto iTunes and Stitcher and the other podcasting apps is fairly straightforward. Google for it and you'll find loads of advice. Here's one link selected more or less at random, which seems kosher: The 27 Steps To Get Your Podcast Into iTunes - School of Podcasting - Learn \"How To Podcast\" with Podcast Coach Dave Jackson ",
