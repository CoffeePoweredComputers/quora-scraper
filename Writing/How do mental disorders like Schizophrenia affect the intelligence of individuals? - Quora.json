            "answer_text": "As I stated in a previous response to a so called pyschologist it is not the intelligence of a person who suffers schizophrenia you should be concerned about. When I was diagnosed with schizophrenia looking back it was no wonder I ran from the diagnosis and ruined my life in the process. Every doctor and pychologist I talked to had treated me in a way that made me believe my life was over and I was a legal assistant at the time of my diagnosis. They made me fill out this piece of paper that asked what you did for a living. I proudly put down Legal Assistant which I had been for two years. I was newly diagnosed and not even as having schizophrenia at that time just as having a brief pyschotic episode and she wanted to lock me in a rooming house with \u201cothers who were like me\u201d. That attitude scared me by a woman who didn't seem to care that I had never been in trouble before and I had a good job. She just wanted to lock me somewhere. I lived with family and it made me question had they expressed a desire to have me live somewhere else? Being in a \u201cward \u201c for the first time was scary and to hear this woman say she wanted to lock me somewhere with people I don't know was even scarier. I denied having a disease for a long time because of the way I was always treated inside one of these facilities. My intelligence didn't just magically dissapear because I had this diagnosis yet I'd never hear any doctor or pyschologist say this is temporary. The symptoms are temporary as long as you take your medicine you can still have a full life. You can have your career. You can get married. My two biggest concerns. Instead I always left the hospital feeling unloved and unwanted and like all my dreams and hardwork were for nothing. I was even attacked once in a hospital by security because I was distraught over police treatment of me. I won't go into detail but it left me emotionally scared. The police and the hospital staff pretty much attacked me because I didn't want their help. I refused treatment. The doctors talked down to you and looked down on you. And normal actions that a normal person might have done were now attached to having a mental illness. It was like I was no longer a human being. I was a subject to be dissected. I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia for six years. I'm as intelligent as I've always been. I still have a high appetite for literature and books. I'm still curious. I'm still working and best of all I still work meaning the functions of my brain and body still work. Yes I'm a little sluggisgh to get out of bed in the morning but that's alot of people without an illness. I can talk fast sometimes, which I've done my whole life but other than that I don't have symptoms while on medication. And I realize this is not all people diagnosed with schizophrenia. I find there are alot of pyschologist therapist and pyschiatrist who have low opinions of people with schizophrenia and if you let them insert their opinion of you or the disease into your life you may create a self fulfilling prophesy that manifested because someone told you you were this or that. Schizophrenia has nothing to do with intelligence. Take the medication and you can do whatever you put your mind to. If you have a therapist pyschologist or pychiatrist you see and that say things like this one pyscholosigt said on this answer thread trying to sound smart fire them these people are suppouse to be here to help you not hinder you. Had I believed in myself all those years ago I might be married now. I might have finished my degree and most of all I would've never gone to jail for not taking medication. My father and i butt head sometimes but one thing he always says to me is to not use excuses some of these so called doctors incorrectly don't have a high opinion of you will give you an excuse to lay in bed and mope and let your life pass you by. That's another stigma your feeding by listening to them. Go out there and conquer your dreams one at a time and remember to take your medicine regularly. Ignore all naysayers. ",

            "answer_text": "Although I am not an expert on this topic, I believe there are some general trends between intelligence and schizophrenia but no clear cut \u201cgiven.\u201d There is a negative correlation (guessing moderate in strength) between IQ and schizophrenia. This is largely due to not just an absolute measure of \u201clow\u201d intelligence but an individual having a lower intelligence than expected based on comparison to genetically related relatives\u2019 IQ and environment. However, this is by no means a cause and effect relationship and there are exceptions\u2014for example, Johnny Nash who is very intelligent had schizophrenia. Also, schizophrenia is largely genetic, so lower than expected IQ on its own is not enough to predict schizophrenia. How 'A Beautiful Mind' Got Schizophrenia Wrong \u201cAccording to Encyclopedia Britannica, intelligence consists of a person\u2019s ability to learn from experiences, adapt to new situations, understand and handle abstract concepts, and use knowledge to manipulate his environment.\u201d (see source above). However, related to but not the exact same thing as intelligence are cognitive abilities. Many individuals with schizophrenia have cognitive impairments/deficits of different severities depending on the individual. This can make it difficult for some in terms of occupational functioning and independent living. Cognitive impairments may include executive functioning (sustaining attention on a task/topic, planning for the future, task-switching), working memory (temporarily remembering info while manipulating variables, etc. while solving math problems, story problems, etc.). Some may have verbal language difficulties and utilize incorrect word choices in sentences. Hope this helps. ",
