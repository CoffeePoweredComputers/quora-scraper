            "answer_text": "We all have our own processes. I recommend finding your own through experimentation. Try a bunch of different ways. That said, here are a few that have worked for me: The Nano method: I came up with this for NaNoWriMo when I first started doing it. The way it works is you take one (and only one) piece of paper, and jot notes on it. Figure out your setting, your main character(s), and a few bits of plot. Keep this paper next to you when you write. Refer to it as often as you like, and feel free to change things. It\u2019s just a very basic bit of information. The Complexity equation: It\u2019s not really an equation. I just like the name. The way this one works is by making a series of charts. You chart out the major factions in your world, including their goals (both immediate and end), some of their more prominent members, maybe even a location or two. You also chart out your main character and your main antagonist. You create tension and conflict points between all these charts, and use that to make your novel. Often times, when describing characters, I will both give them a brief description (physical and personality) and then include a few quotes by that person to help sum up their voice. The Empty Stage: This is actually my favorite method. I start out with a very basic idea. Maybe a single image. Maybe the basics of a character, maybe just a narrator. Then I let them on an empty stage in my mind, and let them tell me the story. I let them go off and do what they want. I often have no idea what I\u2019m going to write in my next writing session, though I may think about it a lot. Interviews: interview your characters. Seriously. Write out a dialogue. Ask them about themselves. Let them ramble if they want to. Let them be suspicious of you. Just let them talk, and they will tell you where they belong. There are so many different ways. You can write with piles of notes, you can write with a post it that says \u201cmonkeys fighting aliens?\u201d You can write to see your own take on a book you\u2019re enjoying reading. You can write out a gaming session. It can come from anywhere, and you can plan it (or not) as much as you want to. ",

            "answer_text": "First off, decide your language. Let\u2019s assume it\u2019s English. Decide whether it\u2019s fiction or nonfiction. I\u2019m giving advice for fiction. Next, get an idea. That scratch. There are many ways to do this. You can think, listen to music, take a walk through nature-anything that inspires. If that\u2019s not working, google up writing prompts. You\u2019ll find thousands of these, just decide on the type. Romance, action, comedy, thriller, fantasy\u2026 whatever you want. Once you\u2019ve got that idea, write a bit. Brainstorm. Think or write about what you can do to expand this. Write a small scene to get yourself started. Think about characters, setting, theme, genre. Plot all that out. Names, places, things, situations. Now, you can go two ways. You can plot everything out, beginning to midpoint or as far as you can go, fleshing out characters and everything necessary. Or you can start writing straight off, discovering as you go. Give it your all. And that\u2019s how it goes. You write/brainstorm/think/research a little everyday. Look up other books with the same theme, do some internal research about your location, flesh out character history, personality, hobbies, age, family and all the necessary stuff. You reach a dead end, it\u2019s okay. Leave your draft for a few days, let your mind relax, get the creativity going. You may not find new ideas, it\u2019s okay; thousands of other ideas are waiting for you-just don\u2019t delete/scrap/tear/throw/burn your draft. Let it be. You might get a new idea for it sometime. Most important, write. Write. Write until you can\u2019t think anymore. Read. Read until your eyes ache. And never give up. ",
