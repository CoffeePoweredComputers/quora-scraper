            "answer_text": "I'm a fountain pen addict and I have bought about 20 this year so far, mainly since I wanted to start using them again after I briefly stopped when I started university. At the time I only had a red Lamy Safari that my dad had bought me and although it was good I was on the ballpoint bandwagon due to its cheapness and because our school provided really low quality paper. This year I have been buying Pilot metropolitans, a couple of Sheaffers, a Cross Bailey, Faber Castell basic, Lamy studio, TWSBI Eco, Lamy next and a few more Safaris. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on mood, need, or fancy. If I come across a nice vintage fountain pen on eBay or at a fountain pen show, it's more analogous to shoes. I'm probably wearing shoes when I'm at the shoe store, but if I see something I like, I go down the checklist: do I have one; do I like it; do I need it; is it unique; cost; value. This past calendar year I\u2019m probably around 80 or so. ",
