            "answer_text": "Most of my points have already been mentioned by one or more of the other answers, but I will attempt to summarize. There is a problem with the meaning of the sentence. Guarding someone is not the job of a \u201ccompanion\u201d and not even of a \u201cguardian\u201d; it\u2019s something a bodyguard does. Whether or not you use \u201cto the extend that\u201d or just a simple \u201cif\u201d, the sentence will not make sense for that reason.Replacing \u201cto the extent that\u201d with \u201cif\u201d will change the meaning of any sentence.\u201cIf\u201d allows for only two possibilities (either he will allow himself to be guarded or he will not)\u201cTo the extent that\u201d, on the other hand, allows for an infinite number of possibilities, i.e., all the various situations and conditions under which he may allow himself to be guarded, and the different \u201cdegrees\u201d of guarding intensity (or closeness) that he may be willing to accept.",

In theory, \u201cif\u201d leaves open the question of whether he\u2019ll accept a guardian at all, and \u201cto the extent that\u201d assumes he\u2019ll accept a guardian in at least some small way. Most readers and listeners won\u2019t give any thought to that distinction. There\u2019s a third way of saying it that will work if you allow yourself to use a somewhat rare old word, \u201cinsofar.\u201d \u201cI am his companion and guardian, insofar as he will allow himself to be guarded.\u201d It\u2019s not the word most people would use but I think most people understand it.

If cannot be replaced with to the extent - and the example sentence is awkward as well. You're mixing tenses. I am his companion and guard to the extent that he allows himself to be guarded. I will be his companion and guard to the extent that he will allow himself to be guarded. ",
