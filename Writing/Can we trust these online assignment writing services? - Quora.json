            "answer_text": "Gee, I mean you are asking if you can trust a \u2018service\u2019 that literally helps people cheat. Heck, why stop at paying someone to do your homework? Why not get someone to write all of your tests and exams? Passing someone else\u2019s work off as your own is fraud. Don\u2019t do it. You will, eventually, get caught. When I catch people cheating the smallest penalty they get is a 0 on an assignment. If someone used one of these services I\u2019d do everything in my power, in line with university policy, to have that person expelled. So, I mean if you think trusting a service that helps people cheat makes sense, then fine. I know I wouldn\u2019t. ",

Therefore in the case of thesis writing service the role of reviews will be a most important one. The genuine review sites would lead you in the right direction.
