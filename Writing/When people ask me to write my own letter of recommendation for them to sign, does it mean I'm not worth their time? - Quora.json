            "answer_text": "DEFINITELY NO!!  This is from my own experience. I was applying for graduate school and requesting a letter of recommendation from one of my previous supervisors during internships. After sending him an email to request, he replied and asked me to write it by myself and he will then modify it. He told me that this was from his supervisor back in his student time and seemed to be working out so he continued this tradition. The reasons I think, are: You know better than your supervisor on what you did during your internship (the process of some of your work, the difficulties you had and how you solved them)You are the only one who knows what you gained the most from this internship and which is the part that is important to you for the thing you are applyingIn general, you will have a better letter of recommendation if you are one who is providing the details.  One example that screw up your application:I heard from a professor that once there was a student asking for a letter of recommendation for graduate school application. But the professor barely knew the student since the student almost never came to the office hour or trying to let the professor know him/her. Therefore, the professor wrote something like: \"I barely know this student and I don't know what is his research direction. He/She just came to me for a letter of recommendation and I don't know what to write about.\" And you know what will be the result. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. Writing a letter of recommendation takes time, yes. But many people don't see themselves as writers so they do everything they can to avoid the task.  One suggestion, provide a list of attributes you would like to highlight. They can agree or disagree. For example, provide:-diligent worker and resourceful-a strong team player-really has a talent to develop and nurture programs. The person can take these and write a few paragraphs or ask you to provide the copy anyway. ",
