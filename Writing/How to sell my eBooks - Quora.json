            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t a \u201cbest\u201d way to sell eBooks. It all depends on your primary goal. Your overall goal, whether that be to make the most profit or get in front of the largest audience, or whatever, will probably determine which platform you choose. Amazon  If you want to get your book in front of as large an audience as possible, then you\u2019re going to want to use Amazon and their Kindle Direct Publishing platform. Using KDP allows you to potentially get your book in front of the hundreds of millions of people who download Kindle books. However, it\u2019s important to note that Amazon takes a decent chunk of each sale, meaning that your overall profit margin will be less than it would otherwise. The only way to compensate is to increase your prices, which has the potential to lower sales. Additionally, you can\u2019t actually sell Amazon books through your own website. You have to direct people to Amazon. This can hurt overall branding efforts. Gumroad  Gumroad makes it incredibly easy to upload an eBook and then begin selling it. And unlike Amazon, they only take a small percentage of each sale (3.5% + 30 cents). This can be a solid option if you already have a decent sized audience and don\u2019t need to tap into the power of Amazon\u2019s search engine. You can also embed your product directly into your website, meaning that you don\u2019t have to send people away from your site in order to make a sale. This is definitely a plus when it comes to building your personal brand. Wordpress / Weebly / Wix / Squarespace  If you don\u2019t have a website and want to sell your eBook on a personal website, then obviously you\u2019ll need to create one. Wordpress, Weebly, Wix, and Squarespace are all relatively simple, yet powerful website builders and they all offer eCommerce functionality. The downside is that building an eCommerce website can be a bit tricky since you need to not only build the site, but also include a way to take payments. It\u2019s not overly difficult to build a website with the builders mentioned, but it is a time commitment and requires a bit more technical knowledge. If you\u2019re trying to get to market as fast as possible, this probably isn\u2019t your best option. Paperform  Out of all the options mentioned, Paperform is, by far, the most flexible. (Side note, I am a bit bias in that I sometimes work with them and have had more time with their platform than the others) If you don\u2019t have a website, you can quickly create pages on which you can sell your books (it\u2019s like working with a document editor). If you do have a website, you can integrate Paperform pages directly with your site. You can take payments directly through Paperform pages, either through Stripe, Braintree, or PayPal. If you want to embed additional media that will help the sale of your book, such as a video, you can easily do that with the Paperform builder. If you want to get to market fast AND not give a big cut of every sale to Amazon, Paperform is probably your best best.
