            "answer_text": "news writing sheds light upon the facts. as with concrete words, they carry a specific meaning. it comes to no question that you need to keep the views balanced so to maintain the importance of the event. creatively speaking, writing stories, poetry or a novel is more satisfying as it gives a voice to your thoughts. what one writes is more sparkling and can encompass the varied emotions as well as situations which come to mind. the problem that may not be realised is that news writing deals with real events and require a different stand. it creates constraints within which the writing has to proceed. with creative writing, the constraints are meant to be learnt, practiced, broken and re-created to bid to the writer's nature. he has to re-ignite it with his vision \u2014 difficult to understand, and based upon instincts. logic has to be torn apart to stimulate the artistic vision.
