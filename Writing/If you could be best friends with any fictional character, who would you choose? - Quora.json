            "answer_text": "To protect me? Ra\u2019s al Ghul.  Reasons: #1. Ra\u2019s al Ghul is one of the greatest warriors on the planet, almost entirely unmatched in strategy and tactics (there\u2019s always a bigger fish), etc. Even some of the greatest assassins like Deathstroke are given pause when his name is mentioned. And while the Joker may be Batman\u2019s greatest nemesis, Ra\u2019s is Batman\u2019s greatest adversary. #2. He commands an army of warriors who will do what he says TO THE DEATH. If he so much as says \u201cgo get Alex an Oreo McFlurry from McDonalds and a triple baconator from Wendy\u2019s\u201d, they will go and do it even at the risk of their own lives. They will literally DIE following even the most mundane order if it becomes necessary. So of course those are the people I\u2019d want protecting me. #3. A man like Ra\u2019s al Ghul respects the desire to master oneself. So while I was under his protection, I would ask that he train me to fight and to think like him, so that one day I would not require protection and could be as free as possible in all situations. I would pour myself into the training, even facing death, because death would be facing me no matter what choice I made; death from whatever or whoever I was being protected from, a living death to be under constant guard and living in fear, or death from Ra\u2019s al Ghul\u2019s training methods. At least if I died in training, it would be on my own terms; fighting to be alive and free. And of course there would be a wealth of books to read, and without the pesky nuisance of the internet I would be free to really curl up in front of a fireplace and get lost in the pages (though not TOO lost, Ra\u2019s would probably instruct his men to periodically attack me in order to train my awareness). I suppose I could have picked Batman to protect me, but he\u2019s far too brooding and distant, and lacks the overwhelming forces to keep an individual safe from harm. ",

Frank Castle AKA \u201cThe Punisher\u201d.  Robert McCall AKA \u201cThe Equalizer\u201d.  Dexter Morgan AKA \u201cThe Bay Harbor Butcher\u201d.  The Expendables.  Need protection and/or need/want to wipe out a bunch of super scumbag criminals? Look no further. They\u2019ll get the job done. Part 2: Goku.  I\u2019d hang with this extremely famous and beloved goofball fighter, and main character of the entire Dragon Ball franchise anytime. Also, I would want to see who could eat the most and the fastest between me and him (yeah, I already know it\u2019s going to be a severe loss on my part, but I\u2019m going to give it a shot anyway lol!!!!). Bulma.  The other main character of the entire Dragon Ball franchise who teamed up with Goku, and kicked off the Dragon Ball adventure in the first place, and my anime crush, Bulma. I can learn all sorts of mathematic, scientific, engineering, and technological facts from her. Zeno.  Why not have the most powerful character in all of the Dragon Ball universes being your best friend? He can set up multi-universal martial arts tournaments. I\u2019d just ask him nicely NOT to erase the fighters who lose, and their entire accompanying universes, completely out of existence. Part 3: Last, but not least, my very first fictional crush ever, Jessica Rabbit.  She\u2019s extremely sexy, sassy, and smart. She can be my super best friend with benefits. For obvious reasons. ",
