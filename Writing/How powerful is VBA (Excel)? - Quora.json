            "answer_text": "In both Excel and Access VBA is there to do whatever the built-in tools can\u2019t. In Excel that\u2019s things formulae can\u2019t do like deciding whether to update another field or fields depending on one or more conditions, and lots more I haven\u2019t explored. I use Access a lot, and there VBA is doing what SQL can\u2019t like keeping track of past values or setting other fields to a value that depends on what just happened. So in both cases the interplay of a program with two more languages adds considerable extra power. As a fun example in Access here\u2019s the form I use when I get home after grocery shopping twice a week - I live alone. I copy current prices from the checkout slip and untick Buy.  Here\u2019s what VBA does with that single untick: updates last purchase date, average time between purchases and any \u201ctime to buy\u201d alertsupdates price, last price, average, max and min prices and price trendif there\u2019s a Next or Later tick, updates those ready for next timeif a daily bit of fruit (like mandarins) has quantity 4 or 3 switch to the other so the quantity will be right next time for twice-a-week buying.All with one click! I use those in a variety of screens when deciding what to buy. Usually that takes less than 2 minutes as I will have pre-ticked most items in the preceding day or two. Here\u2019s the shopping list I clip to my trolley, sequenced in the order I walk round the supermarket. (Seq field in the other screenshot, I can change it if a product\u2019s been moved or I can switch to another supermarket\u2019s layout.) The price is what I paid last time so I can watch for specials:  You can do all that and much more with as many fields as you wish in serious applications, so it\u2019s very powerful. ",

            "answer_text": "VBA is quite a powerful procedural programming language in-built into Microsoft\u2019s Office products since the mid-1990s. Best known for its macros, VBA can do so much more. You can build complete applications using any of Microsoft\u2019s Office products which is incredibly attractive for many businesses running Microsoft Office as no additional licencing costs are needed as the software has already been installed. VBA is a great tool to learn. If you wish to take up a VBA course, you can do it from Edu4sure. Good Luck ",

            "answer_text": "Because VBA can use API calls its possibilities are therefore unlimited. However that said there is a limit to the memory and handling capacity of Excel which a 3rd party API might not integrate too well with. In other words the API can make your Excel crash! Oops. Now that Excel integrates with Azure Machine Learning Web Services as well as being able to source data from Azure the future, for Excel, is not only evolving but excellent. ",
