            "answer_text": "POSITIVE ORIENTED SEES A RAY OF HOPE EVEN IN HOPELESS SITUATION AND CONDITION. We term ourselves as positive ones when we believe that something will come out fine even when we are in dire straits. For instance, in the current situation of NOVEL CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, there are people who are hugely worried about the infection, though, in fact such a person may or may not come in contact with already infected person. This unreasonable worry about infection may cause more problem than the actual infection itself since by turning ourselves negative we are negatively impacting our defences of our system. On the other hand a person with positive orientation, even though getting infection through somebody, if he/she keeps himself/herself in isolation with positive orientation will be cured quickly. A NEGATIVE ORIENTED FEELS HOPELESS EVEN IN CLEAR HOPEFUL SITUATION On the other hand, if a person always gets jittery if he/she is placed in inappropriate situation and condition. A negative oriented person always have the negative oriented in any event. He is skeptic and suspicious and sees conspiracy against him/her though there may not be anybody against that individual. Trait of a positive oriented person:- Have the attitude of \u2018I can\u2019.Never gives up even in dire situations and condition.Faces the any situation with determination.Such a person creates appropriate environment wherever he/she goes.Sees hope in even hopeless situation and condition.Faces challenges of life with positive orientation,When such a person fails due to some reason, he/she does not feel let down but tries again. He/she failure as an experience.Positive person is a KARMA YOGI,Traits of a negative oriented person:- Has the attitude of \u2018I cannot\u2019.Have no guts to try.Have not got any initiate to act.Never sees light at the end of a tunnel.Never face challenges of life.If he/she fails, he/she loses courage to try again.He is a not a KARMA YOGI but does not want to follow such traits.emulateme.wordpress.comm ",

A person with positive attitude think \u201c I CAN\u201dA person with positive attitude find \u201cGOOD HABITS FROM PEOPLES\u201dA person with positive attitude see the \u201cpossibilities\u201dA person with positive attitude \u201cFind the solution of problem\u201dNegative attitude: Lets try to understand how negative people think. A person with negative people think \u201cI CAN\u2019T.A person with negative people find the \u201cFault from other people\u201dA person with negative attitude see the \u201cLimitations\u201dA person with negative attitude \u201c Blame on other people( God) for problems.[Attitudes are a secret power working 24 hours a day, for a good or bad] Example: X) A famous shoes making company send their marketing engineer in countryside. His job responsibility was figure out the scope of the shoes selling.Whether company should construct their shoes stall at that area or not? With question mark engineer set foot into small town.He started his analysis. He ramble around town and after some day he come on his conclusion. He gave his report to top management.He write that \u201cThere are no scope for shoes stall because all the dweller wear flip-flop slippers\u201d. Y) After year back another shoes making company send their engineer at same place where first company sent.After all the analysis he handover his report to top-management.He write that \u201cHere is lots of opportunity to sell our product,We can earn handsome amount profit from this place because all the dwellers wear the flip-flop slippers. Just see difference between thinking process of two engineers. In X example engineer think that, Here all the people wear flip-flop slippers so they never wear shoes because they are not habitual to wear shoes. He think negative ( We can\u2019t).He see limitation too. In Y example engineer think positive. He think that,If we have got the habit of wearing shoes,we can earn lots of money.Here engineer think positive(WE CAN) and also he saw possibilities in that small town. [They can because they think they can] Thanks ",
