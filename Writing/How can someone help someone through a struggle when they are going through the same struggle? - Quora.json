            "answer_text": "This is the best time to help someone else, when we are dealing with the same issues. This was, and still is, the principle behind twelve-step programs. Let's make sense of this, shall we? If I wish to truly learn something in-depth, what should I do? As I begin to learn something, whatever this may be, the absolutely best way to do so is to teach others because in so doing I will always learn more than my students. Moreover, in the process, I will be taught both by God as well as my students, so my increase will be far greater than any I teach. This is a true principle ALWAYS! Therefore, help those in need, especially those with the same need as you have yourself, and watch this principle come alive in your life. Next, understand the critically important principle of empathy. We best empathize with the troubles of others we ourselves now experience. Therefore, we are best equipped to empathize while in the midst of similar problems. Empathy is a very strange tool and catalyst for healing both the giver and receiver of this empathy. In empathy, the one who emotionally connects with the troubles, pain and damage within the other person becomes a direct conduit for this trouble, pain and damage to be released directly to God through the empath. People fear empathy because they fear that being thus connected with somehow damage self, but it never does; it always heals both self and other while connecting to the source of healing, God Himself. If we can maintain that connection, then we can become a continual open conduit to this healing power of God, and this is always key to real revivals whenever and wherever they have occurred throughout human history. Of course, it is an emotionally taxing experience to be thus continually connected without breaks from this, so this must usually be a shared experience rather than just one person carrying this entire load. This is why true revivals occur and/or continue so infrequently. Nevertheless, whenever and wherever we are able to thus connect to the hurts, wounds and damage of others not only do we become healers ourselves, but we are also healed as well. Marshall Rosenberg's Speaking Peace on youtube is the best practical method for empathy training I have ever discovered. His method really focuses in on this critically important gift and ability. We can develop this ourselves, of course, just by continually practicing selfless giving and helping others, so this is really an intense training shortcut with great practical merit, particularly in developing and approaching the development of this gift.

            "answer_text": "How can someone help someone through a struggle when they are going through the same struggle? This is \u201cexactly\u201d what happened to me. Just because I was ambitious everyone leaned on me when I was trying to finish high school and did have a part-time job to help out my parents but they took it to another level expecting me to quick high school so I could bring home more money? That\u2019s when I put my foot down said \u201cno!\u201d They didn\u2019t care if I never got a diploma since my mother never finished beyond 9th grade and careless about educating all of her daughters when she clearly would take us out of school whenever she wanted to travel to visit her own country without any consequences of her actions. I remember feeling guilty for being older in one class and couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of what happened? Until I realized the absence of being in school made us vulnerable to repeat the same grade over. The only reason why she accepted my decision I said without a diploma the chances of getting a better job will not be as good plus not enough money earned. Also, I was 18 years old an adult and still had another damn year due to her lack of responsible behavior in taking us out of school so much in the past. So using logic on my narcissistic mom proved to be positive. Otherwise, I would have a hell of a time trying to finish up high school at my own leisure while still working a full-time job if I got hired? I pray that any parent that does this to their own children for extra money for the family please reconsider what you are doing to your child\u2019s education and lack of skills not to have the opportunity to get a decent job even a diploma is worth more. Plus when the adolescent or adult find themselves without a diploma or skills they will get angry at their parents for not thinking of their welfare because someday they will be parents too! I speak in behalf of my younger sister who when we went to New York City and since my mother worked at a factory, and older sister and I worked too - my younger sister was taken out of public school to babysit our brat of a half brother. So she never finished high school which was always her greatest regret. ",

            "answer_text": "that can be very difficult to do. you have to be able to balance it and not cause yourself more aggravation. when i was working with people online with personality disorders or other trauma, there was a young lady that i had been working with for a few months and both of our mothers that were narcissist died close to the same time. i thought it would be helpful for both of us without realizing how much worse it would make me from trying to be strong for her in that situation, i had good intentions towards both of us and it made me worse. about a week before her mother died, i had gotten this girl to go to rehab for cocaine addiction and her mother that always insulted her and pissed her off wanted to come there and it wasnt to support her in that way but to make herself look like that caring mother. she asked me what should she do and i agreed with her that letting her come there was a mistake. they found her mother dead in the house from an overdose of drugs and this made the girl feel horrible that she didnt let her come to the rehab to see her and i reminded her that if she had and they got into a fight, this girl did not bite her tongue with people and was rather violent,i told her if she had come there and something happened between them with nasty/ugly comments said, she would feel even worse about what happened and at the time she made the better decision for herself by doing that. she was thankful i reminded her of that. she was very angry at herself for not forgiving her mother for everything that happened, and she knew i did that hours before mine died in hospice care, all of the situation triggered me into thinking more about most of my life and i went into a depression for about 9 months from thinking too much and i nearly shot myself. it was not this girls fault at all, i also never considered what it would do to me either. you have to be very careful when you are doing this and always take time to yourself and back off when you feel yourself getting upset in these situations because its not helpful to the other person when they feel like they made you worse. its difficult doing this.

            "answer_text": "To struggle with something, really means that you are attempting to try and take a step forward or come out of something forcefully. You are not trying to understand exactly what is going on and what you are going through. That\u2019s where the problem is at. The approach. The truth is that, in this life, we struggle because we don\u2019t know what we need. What we need is what we will consistently require throughout our period of existence. What we need is usually long term and it\u2019s insufficiency or it\u2019s absence causes us to struggle. So for you, and the person you want to help, the key is to understand what you both need to help them overcome the struggle. How? Define your struggle. Do you find yourself saying that you \u201calways\u201d do this or that? The word always is a great word to identity inconsistency that will locate the root of the struggle. Example, say, u are struggling with caffeine addiction. When you state the problem, you might end up saying, I always drink coffee every time I feel stressed.After you\u2019ve found out your \u201calways\u201d statements, ask yourself \u201cwhy do you always\u2026\u201d and write as many answers as you can think of. Example, I always drink coffee when I feel stressed because one, it helps me calm down, two, it makes me relax, three, the coffee break reminds me of an intimate time with a family member who I care about so much so the memory of that helps me relax, etc.Once you have all these answers, you will clearly see, from the example, you need to learn how to relax, you need to learn how to unwind or calm down, or you need to find someone to talk to etcI\u2019ve used this method to help me and others through any major struggle in my life and theirs and it has been extremely helpful and effective. It will require patience and honesty but the results are irreversible. You\u2019ll learn something about yourself you\u2019ve never known and learn to appreciate tough times and struggles of life because of the gift of lessons they come with. Heck, this method helped me quit porn 8 months ago! Always remember, \u201cTough times never last, but tough people last\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The reality of the matter is very lousy because it's true, the old saying of charity starts at home. You can't help someone else if you can't help yourself. When you are going through a struggle and you can't seem to get out of it, the last thing you should be doing is helping someone else out. You are a good person for trying, but you really need to get yourself out of your own struggle before you can help anybody out of their struggle. I know this personally because I always helped people who were having a struggle with life. I wasn't doing very good myself, but I didn't want to see them in a real bad situation. I'd help them through it, and I'd end up in trouble with all of my own problems that I should have been dealing with. Then my struggle became much harder on me, and I became in a much bigger struggle myself and had nobody to help me through it. There's people who do it all the time, they are more concerned about the well being of others and they end up in trouble themselves. Then they decide they won't do that again, but they see the next one going through those problems and they can't help themselves, so they do it again. Then the worse part of it all, once they've helped people out of their struggles, they find themselves having problems themselves and they find out they have nobody to turn to for help for themselves. It's very unfortunate that it happens that way, but that's how it goes sometimes. That's why people should understand that helping others is okay, but only if you are in a good standing situation yourself. If you are not doing good then you need to remind yourself that charity start at home, you can't help someone else if you can't help yourself, so I hope this helps you. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question. Your question kind of reminds me of NF\u2019s line in one of his songs (in case you don\u2019t know who that is, he\u2019s a rapper), he says \u201cSometimes I feel like I\u2019ve become what you were scared to be Which makes it really hard to look at you with sympathy \u2019Cause if I\u2019m feeling bad for you, then I have to feel bad for me\u201d Anyway, that was just a side thought I thought I could just share. But to answer your question, yes, you can very much help someone else and you may end up helping your own situation as well. Context is key. Very rarely do we see someone going through the exact replica copy of what\u2019s happening in our lives. All of our lives are different. We all wake up unique ways, we all pour our cereal differently, you get what I mean. So of course, while it still may be related or in the same \u201cgenre\u201d of a problem, you can very much help someone else and maybe, just maybe, you might find the answer or solution to your own problem. This happens mostly in television shows. Where there are two plots in an episode and they somehow tie together and they learn a lesson from each other (I\u2019m thinking of Full House right now, sorry lol). That very much happens in life as well. We learn from each other. So my advice: always help someone else because you might also be helping yourself. Hope that helps! :) ",

I think often times we assume people need saviors when they are hurting, that some heroic character is needed to swoop in. But what i\u2019ve learned is that people don\u2019t need Superman or saviors, not like we think at least. What people who are suffering need is someone they trust to sit there and listen if they want or distract them if they need a break. Friendships save and enrich lives. There is a great medicinal potency to the bonds between true friends. If your friend and you are experiencing struggle you then have an opportunity to lean in and grow your bond through that shared suffering. Oh, and remember, no feeling is final, just keep going. [Regarding the powerful forces of friendship] \u201cThe ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having been seen by someone and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.\u201d - David Whyte Be good to each other.

Let me explain myself. First, and mostly, you know exactly what they\u2019re going through, as you\u2019re fighting the same battle. Second, it\u2019s always easier said than done. So there are times when you know exaclty how to solve the situation but you\u2019re not ready or willing to do what it takes. So, if that\u2019s the case, you can very much help the other person by showing them you know the struggle and telling them how to win. People will always take advice from somebody who knows what they\u2019re dealing with, it\u2019s obvious. I\u2019m telling you from my own experience. I\u2019m very good at helping people with shit I\u2019m also dealing with, even when I\u2019m not capable of getting rid of that shit myself. I\u2019d go even further and say people should not give advice lightly to others unless they have gone or are going through the same. Even though we all experience things differently sometimes, I think that if you are a happy and balanced person, you can never understand what depression can do to somebody, for instance. And when you tell them, from your happy point of view what they need to do to fight it, well\u2026 I don\u2019t think those words will stick. Frequencies will never match.

Sometimes you will have the right things to say when no one else does. You can see what you need and often that person will need the same things. That being said, you have to be careful. For example, if one is dealing with addiction, the other person could end up pushing them back into addiction. If one is dealing with eating issues, the friend could keep them in the same state, whining about being fat but eating unhealthy things (I may or may not fall into this category). You have to be careful that helping that other person isn\u2019t hurting you. I am a preacher. I had a funeral to do for a woman who died of cancer on Saturday. The Tuesday before, my father died of cancer. Now, I could have done the funeral. I KNEW what the family was going through. But I handed it off to another pastor. Why would I put myself through that emotional tornado? I wouldn\u2019t have been an effective pastor because I was just a grief victim like the family. You can do as much for the person as is healthy for you. If, by reaching out to them, you can walk forward in your journey together, excellent. But if you find yourself becoming co-dependent, getting stuck on your journey, or moving backwards, then it\u2019s time for a break. But you can always send cards letting them know you care and understand. ",

There is consolation in number. And being with someone who knows yours struggles would help a lot. This is why support groups (like for alcoholics, and the likes) are effective. Sometimes, we reach out to people who care for us, but sometimes it\u2019s hard for them to really understand what we\u2019re going through when they haven\u2019t experienced the same thing that\u2019s happening to us.

I have always been in awe of how the golfer Phil Mickleson developed his skills to become a professional left-handed golfer! I came to understand quickly why my uncle suggested I go right handed now(early 70's) as the incentive was extremely low for golf's club makers to cater to left -handed players! I can't recall how or who got the credit but I am certain the payoff rewarded him millions beyond what switching to right might have been. With no left-handed instructors to give Phil's game a better chance at the next level, his father took to a mirror to give Phil a true reflection of a left-handed swing, the rest is history! I have an addicted brain that has no eyes so seeing my reflection may be daunting for sure but only helps one to never use. I have been thru enough rehabs to acquire enough knowledge to fix myself, right? It sure makes sense, but like the painter whose house needs painting, go ahead scratch it! I have seen the stare of helplessness of an addict to stop and stay clean. Today, I know my cycle of addiction is near it's end, like Phil's reflections of a golf swing. I don't need a mirror but a greater understanding of how I have been able to make more sense of addiction in layman's terms that help others see some progress and want me on board to to further help others just as The Twelve Steps asks of us when recovery turns to month's and years of sobriety! I read this 3 times, I hope I delivered something for you to chew on? ",

Still, people who are struggling with the same problem, sinking into the same, seemingly unsolvable problems can help each other solving it if the connect to each other. The key is our inherently egocentric, subjective consciousness and perception, our tendency to try solving problems individually, mostly at the expense of others. Most of the time we can't find solutions for our problems as we can't see beyond our very narrow, distorted subjective scope, and alone we are unable to rise above our present state and see things in a more advanced, systematic way. The clearly visible individualistic, nationalistic, self-defeating reactions, \u201csolutions\u201d for the pandemic had portrayed this point very vividly. But if people connect with each other and know how to create a previously non-existent, composite opinion, by selflessly combining their ideas, viewpoints, they can easily find a common solution that didn't exist in either of them before they connected. And since most of our problems are caused by our inherently self-serving, self-justifying, individualistic approach anyway, by building and sustaining the above mentioned connections can prevent any further problems. And the more people connect in such a way, the positive, constructive ability becomes greater, more effective.  ",

I remember teaching History to a Class in Otara, in South Auckland. (It\u2019s a tough area.) I was training to be a teacher and was only a few years older than the kids myself. Nobody likes History and it was a period that I had not studied before, so I was just as uninformed as the kids were. And yet all of us became fascinated by what happened and we learned much. Instead of just memorizing dates and battles we got into the personalities of the main people and felt like we got to know them. As a general rule, I would not advise trying to help someone while you are struggling with a similar problem yourself. If you solve the problem and you understand what brought success, then you might talk to someone else who is battling with it. But it is not a hard and fast rule; sometimes groups of people work together in therapy to solve the same problem for all of them. ",

Especially in a struggle, it can make sense to have someone to talk to about it - this can also be someone with the same problem, the advantage is that you feel less alone with it. This makes the problem seem more tangible, more every day, and usually easier to handle. Above all, you then have twice the power to solve the problem. You can support each other, keep up to date, and try out different solutions. It is incredibly valuable to exchange the things you have already tried and their effects - what works for one person can work for another, but that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. ",

First I had to bike all the way around and up the mountain, by 37\u00b0C and 60% humidity - real feel = 40\u00b0C they say. Then I had to walk up a path to the top. On google map it said 1km, no biking. I thought it was ok to push my bike up there. Problem became: it was actually 1.6km of stairs. So I had to carry my bike. 600m from the top, I really felt a heat stroke coming. Couldn\u2019t make a step, for the life of me. After I had recuperated, I left my bike there, and finished the climb. All this to give you a bit of context. On the way back, I reached the point where I had left my bike. Night was falling. OK here we go, I thought: 1km in the dark, on the way down. An elderly man was in front of me, at the top of the stairs - there is a kind of a plateau there. He stopped and waited for me, engaged conversation as we started walking down together, me carrying my bike on my shoulder. \u201cHow did you get it up there?\u201d He asked. \u201cSame way, I replied. I should have left it at the bottom, but did not realize it would be stairs all the way\u201d. He hesitated, then asked: \u201cCan I help?\u201d. \u201cNo, thanks, I said. My mistake, my lesson.\u201d He didn\u2019t insist, but he stayed with me all the way, silently supporting. Soon I fell into a rhythm, counting to myself: \u201cIch, ni, san, chi, go \u2026\u201d and even bouncing a little, as I had done so many times in Shintaido. It helped that he was there - as, for one thing, I didn\u2019t have to fight with myself (only took one pause, in the middle).. PS: At some point, actually right after I had declined his offer, I told him (don't know how much he understood): \"you know the Korean movie Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter... And Spring Again? There is this monk there, who used to torture little animals when he was a kid, binding them to a stone with rope. Then at the end of the movie he makes himself carry a heavy stone all the way up a mountain. Atonement for his sins, I suppose...\". That got Guanyin's attention too ;) ",

This is a situation where you don't want to be around that person even though they're going through the same struggle as you. Now let's say your struggle is mutual and you're both working to get better, genuinely. Both of you add to the relationship and make each other stronger and you're seeing progress. This could be an example of a beneficial relati Continue Reading",

Having dealt with clinical Depression and being empathic in nature, I can often feel the energy given off by others and am quite certain they are dealing with their own state of depression. Even Robin Williams at his funniest, during his later years, gave off that energy, something I shared with my wife. I could feel the sadness behind the antics and it broke my heart when I heard he had decided to put an end to his internal pain. A psychiatrist or psychologist sitting in a chair has tools  Continue Reading",

The events differ, the people are different, the scenario has elements involved which is not the same. It might not seem that different but usually it is the people who are working through it or those working with the person struggling, will change the outcome.

Oddly, some people think they are the only ones with the problem and no one can understand them. AA can change that.
