            "answer_text": "While I am not sure what you mean by finding a poem stanza, writing your own poem is a process and not necessarily something that you can do in one sitting. I would not call myself an expert on the writing of poetry, but I have written many poems across the past 10 years. Here are some of the techniques I have learned: Writing a poem is often a reflection on something that has resonated with you. It is a form of emotional expression and also, in some sense, communication. As a result, I find that emotions are a very valuable resource. When I feel something stirring inside me, I take out my notebook and I write about how I feel. Sometimes I try to do this in verse, other times in prose. The important thing is that later on, when I am more serious about creating a poem, I have this resource to call upon. As I once wrote down in my poetry journal, \u201cRaw emotion is NEVER useless.\u201dWriting a poem is also a process. I can think of only a few times that the poems I am proud of writing were accomplished in one sitting. Some take days, others weeks, months, or even years to complete. If you are committed to writing poetry, don\u2019t be afraid to sit down and write something that doesn\u2019t satisfy you. It\u2019s just the beginning. Today you can\u2019t find the words to complete the idea that inspired you to write. Next week, however, the words seem to flow in ways you never could have imagined. Write things down, and revisit them over time. Little by little, your poems will grow as you do.A fun exercise I like to partake in is sharing a line with a friend or a poetry community and borrowing from a line from them as well. Using this line as a base, build out your own poem. A line a friend of mine recently shared with me was, \u201cI went to drown my sorrows, but my sorrows knew how to swim.\u201d Another, \u201cHere I leave the pain of a closed time.\u201d Using the words as others as the base or inspiration can be a great poetic activity.Pictures. Look at a picture and try to relate to it. What does it mean to you? How does it make you feel? Can you describe what is happening in a physical or metaphysical sense? Is there some kind of theme that you can put together from it? Think William Blake\u2019s poem The Tyger.Blackout poetry. Find a book, or some other form of text, and create a poem from that text. Highlight all the words that you do not need with a black marker so all that remains are the words that make up your poem. It can be a great creative activity that will start making you feel like a poet.Last, but not least, if you find yourself lacking inspiration I personally enjoy a few cups of wine before I start writing. In the morning you might find that most of what you\u2019ve written is not too great. Other times though, you will be amazed at what secrets the wine has revealed. In vino veritas - In wine the truth will be revealed!Best of luck in your poetic endeavors!  ",
