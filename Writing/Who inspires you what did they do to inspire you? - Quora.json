Made up my own menu of healthy foods and walked the country roads. Gained about 40lbs back, which I'm proud to say I've recently dropped 25 of it. Now I've created a FaceBook group where myself and others encourage one another to eat healthy and keep on track with walking as well as share recipes and photos of our progress!!! Yay Me. ",

They already had no father and they are still smiling beautiful little ladies. And my 2 year old, bless her for being ripped outta her mothers arms for almost a year illegally. May she never remember the things that I did. May she one day be told the truth as well! My forever angels! ",
