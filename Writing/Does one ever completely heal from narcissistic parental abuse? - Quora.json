            "answer_text": "Thank you for this A2A, Christa. Here is my personal approach: 1) I figured my mother is off. To cut the long story short, I eventually ran a Google search for \u201ctoxic mother\u201d and I hit on NPD. That was a revelation that burned my brain, squeezed and wrung my heart, kept me on the shakes for weeks and brought me to a point of extreme mental and emotional anguish that nearly killed me. My entire life had been devastated by that satanic creature. I also figured I had two options: fight or die. I decided to fight, so I moved to step 2. 2) I binged on youtube videos explaining NPD and the impact on NPD victims. Bookmarked those that resonated with me and later watched them again. 3) I found Quora and selected authors and individual accounts that explained the NPD behavior in meaningful detail. Validation does miracles for NPD victims who believe they are crazy, and are ostracized by the Narc and Narc\u2019s allies. 4) I carefully planned and executed my No Contact strategy with my NPD mother. 5) I digested the losses that came with NC. 6) Gave myself time to grieve for the love I had never been given by my parents. 7) I searched for healing sources for: \u201ctrauma\u201d, \u201cPTSD\u201d, \u201ccomplex PTSD\u201d, \u201cvet PTSD\u201d, \u201cco-dependency\u201d and many more. 8) I selected healing techniques I believed could work. In my opinion, policing your thoughts, feelings and behavior is the starting point, because all NPD victims know is how to be invisible and not feel their feelings in order please others. 9) I started to meditate every day. 10) I started to CLOSELY watch my thoughts, emotions and behavior and correct my routine behaviors and my responses to thousands of triggers. I do it nearly ALL THE TIME when not working \u2013 when alone and when interacting with others. It takes a while to learn, because NPDs victims are an emotional mess and don\u2019t know how to recognize and feel their feelings. It takes a lot of self-talk. 11) I started to treat myself as a little child that needs to be nurtured with love. I had never been nurtured in my life, so it took me a while to develop the habit to pause, think how harsh I am treating myself and change my attitude to myself and the way I interact with others. 12) I learned how to ask myself: \u201cWait, tell me how you feel at the moment?\u201d, \u201cWait, why do you do this?\u201d, \u201cWait, why do you feel this way?\u201d \u201cWhy\u2026?\u201d, \u201cWhy\u2026?\u201d Those questions take a lot of repetition every day, and need to be processed in the light of the abuse. Every answer needs to be seen in the light of the self-destructive patterns learned in early childhood. It is very hard to penetrate an emotional world that has been dumped in the basement of your brain and kept there for decades. 13) I learned how to repeat to myself: \u201cYou are number one in your life. You are not responsible for others.\u201d, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to fix other people\u2019s problems.\u201d, \u201cYou are not what you do for others. You are not a worthy person because of the things you do for others. You are a worthy person, period.\u201d 14) I meditate. Every day. Even twice a day whenever I can. I know I have made that point in Step 6, but I can\u2019t emphasize enough how important meditation is. It is the single easy access to the subconscious mind. No other tool gives that easy access to the traumatized mind. I believe my fast healing progress is mostly due to meditation. ",

I won\u2019t address that well light path. I\u2019ll address the feeling inside. The feeling that WTF!! Stop. WAit. NoPE. NOT HaPpEninG. That indescribable Aarrtggghhhhhhh that is muffled and coming from the general direction of those feelings inside you. The avoidance I have inside me that keeps me from truely feeling those emotions. I\u2019m afraid that if I accept that I was never loved and cared for then, it\u2019ll be because I\u2019m just unlovable or what if I am loveable but no one directly around me could bother to give a fuck. They just couldn\u2019t be bothered and because of that I\u2019m like broken as fuck. Wtf is that?? What now though. I know how broken I am. I\u2019d dearly like to try the reciprocal love thing. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted. But I\u2019m scared. No, im not scared. I\u2019m fucking petrified. I don\u2019t know how to be in a reciprocal relationship my normal is apparently abnormal and what if people can see that. Basically every doubt you could have about yourself I\u2019ve currently got and the \u2018I'm a good person\u2019 affirmation that I e been given to counter 47 years of self doubt just isn\u2019t cutting it. How long is this gonna take? I\u2019m almost 50 and I\u2019m starting from scratch. Well worse than scratch cause I don\u2019t know how to live properly and so I\u2019ve gotta fix that and every instinctual response I have needs to be changed and basically if we just change the core of me then I can start over from scratch at 50. Ok. Fuck it! It\u2019s too hard. I try to be mindful, I try to be suspicious of people. But I\u2019m just not built that way. I relax and become open and naive again. It\u2019s my default. It\u2019s too hard to change. I\u2019ve had enough. I have this conversation with myself about twice a month. It talks a fair bit of sense. There are time\u2019s when I agree wholeheartedly. I don\u2019t have a fix sorry. It all seems just so fucking overwhelming. But I put my head down and keep plodding on as always. A lifetime of surviving has trained me well to survive this Ultimate Bonus Round. The championship level that\u2019s awarded to only the most broken of the abused. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHeal\u201d is a tricky word. I don\u2019t think anybody ever experiences emotional abuse, or betrayal, and isn\u2019t changed. Really bad shit happened, and that will always be true. But if \u201cheal\u201d means, despite everything that\u2019s happened and all the damage that\u2019s been done, someone can find contentment and joy and feel like life is much more than just pain, I do. One of the dangers, I think, is striving to always be happy. I don\u2019t think it works like that. I think the expectation should be that bad things and bad feelings are still going to happen, but so will good things. Life is cyclical. If every time we hit a bad patch, the thoughts are \u201coh g*d, here we go again - I don\u2019t know how much more of this I can take,\u201d rather than, \u201coh g*d \u2026 well, I\u2019ll just have to ride this out, it won\u2019t last forever,\u201d we\u2019re not quite there yet. I don\u2019t know what it feels like to be human when one gets a good start. But the people I know who seemed to have had decent starts in life seem to look at life that way. It\u2019s probably easier for them, of course - the worst shit happened to them when they were old enough to have perspective about it. There\u2019s no question that we have to heal ourselves, and that\u2019s the worst part, isn\u2019t it? The people who took on all the shit are the ones who have to then do all the hard work of offloading it. To say it\u2019s not fair is an absurd understatement. Pretty Herculean. So I suspect it starts with grieving. And my g*d, there is so much to grieve. I do feel like, though, every time I let myself sit and have a good old-fashioned wallow, instead of trying to push the grief aside and keep plowing ahead, I feel better and lighter and (odd but true) cleaner afterwards. I\u2019m pretty much convinced at this point that I\u2019m going to have to feel the feels about things, when they come up, and feel them all the way through, to get rid of them. It does seem like doing that means I have long bits of \u201clife is pretty great sometimes\u201d in between them. My gut feeling is that the more grief I wallow through, the more of it I\u2019ll exorcise, and the less of it I\u2019ll carry around, tainting the good bits I do get. And all of this takes a consciousness. It has to be deliberate. Because I don\u2019t realllly want to go to bed at night and revisit the trigger from earlier in the day and pick it apart and have to feel it all until I\u2019m all feeled out. Can\u2019t do it every time, either - sometimes it\u2019s more important to watch Netflix and pass out instead. But some nights it\u2019s worth the investment. ",

Be proud that you\u2019ve taken the hardest step and gone no contact. That alone is HUGE. In my experience, my NEx turned some family against me with his lies as well. Not all of it will last. Some of your family will(hopefully) come to their senses when they start to see holes in his stories. The others? Well\u2026some will never come around. My ex\u2019s mother, brother and late-father all hated me. I never understood it as they never tried to get to know me AT ALL\u2026.even after 25+ years of marriage with him. What I realized much much later was he was bad mouthing me to his mother, who would then tell his brother\u2026then the father\u2026and so on. He was keeping them all away from me on purpose. He didn\u2019t want me to be close to them, nor them to me. All our friends and family(sans my in-laws) have supported me and stayed with me. Here\u2019s my advice. Know your truth\u2026and be ok with that. He will continue with the lies, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Make your peace with that. ",

We build little walls..a small fortress around our hearts and enact stronger boundaries. We become very self protective. I think we choose more wisely people we let into our lives. We become cautious, looking out for hidden mines so we can avoid them. Is there happiness, love and freedom after \u2014yes. It's rediscovering who we are, what we stand for, what we will and won't tolerate in our lives. It's all about looking forward, having good days and bad days knowing that we are okay. It takes commitment and courage and loving yourself along the way. It takes smiles, hugs, and a support system. Have faith in yourself and truly believe there can be healing and that you will find it :) Be the person nurturing you that you wanted in your parents as a child and did not receive. ",

If you are a Christian then God demands that we forgive one another, if you want God to forgive you for your sins then you first must forgive those who have sinned against you, and this will give you some closure to the past. You turned your family away, instead of helping them deal with your sick parents, you cut them off, having bad parents dose not entitle you to be a bad son, that would make you no better then them.I was abused by both parents growing up, and over time I forgive them,actually I was reading the bible and God told me that I needed to forgive them,so that I could move forward. forgiving benefits you, it means your giving it to God to judge them,when I forgave my parents it was like a ton of bricks were lifted from me, I know take care of my mother that abused me for years, and I have no hatred, I will not let my past define the person I am, and I will not repay evil for evil, her days are numbered on earth and I want her last days to be happy ones, so I shower her with love, and compassion. Life is to short to have hatred, I hope you find forgiveness in your heart,for your parents, and come together with your siblings and family, at the end of the day its all about love, I wish you well.
