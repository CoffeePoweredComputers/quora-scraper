            "answer_text": "First I assume you mean blog rather than blogger. It\u2019s important to get the correct terminology right. You \u2018put\u2019 keywords into your content. When you write your posts, you need to think who you are writing for. This will determine which keywords you will use. These keywords will need to resonate with your ideal reader. They also need to resonate with what kind of searches people are making on Google. It would be a waste of time \u2018putting\u2019 in keywords that neither would be interested in. When you write your content, you \u2018put\u2019 your keyword into the title, first paragraph, somewhere in the middle and in the final paragraph. You also \u2018put\u2019 it in the alt tag of your images, and in at least one of the subheadings in your post. This is the simplest way of \u2018putting\u2019 keywords on your blog (not blogger). ",
