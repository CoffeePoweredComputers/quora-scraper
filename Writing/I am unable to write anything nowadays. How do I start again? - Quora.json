            "answer_text": "If you are not able to write, consider various obstacles, including writersblock, which is very common in writers. It could be stress or your current lifestyle, diet, etc. Everything matters but very few writers can know what is the reason behind. I can suggest you to do the following: 1) Clear your mind: Maybe sounds cliche but it helps, trust me. Before you write anything, sit by the window or anything by NOT thinking anything. Don't let positive/negative thoughts come to you. 2) Focus on one object/living/non-living thing or ANYTHING: Try to focus on one object, for example, a tree or a paper, or a notebook, or anything and then make it come to life, meaning, let it live in your imagination. Treat that tiny little thing in your head like your pet. Let it grow. 3) Scribble on a piece of paper: Yes, take a pen and scribble anything on paper. Even if it is BS, or circles or your name or anything. Make a mess with your pen on a paper. Draw/Write anything. 4) Get a fountain pen and an ink bottle. Personally, I use a fountain pens before typing my write-ups on a laptop. If you ask me to write a story/poem on laptop, I wouldn't be able to do that. I need a fountain pen to write something. It's up to you though, but it's just a suggestion. If you really wanna get a fountain pen, I can even suggest you some good pens. When you use a fountain pen (or a pen), it will give you some time to think and write. The flow on paper, is a natural flow for writer who can write by giving some time to the thought-process. 5) Think something weird that is not possible. Try to get Surreal. Read about some Surreal art and surreal books by some surreal authors.  Please note that these are just suggestions and I hope you can get back to your writing. Also, I'd like to see your work. You can share your work with me. Maybe we can publish your work on our website if it meets our writing standards. Happy Writing! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. If you are out of inspiration, don't write. Desire to write should come from within. If it doesn't, it's not going to give you joy. Since you seem to be eager to start again, a good strategy is to begin with just one sentence. Yes, any goddamn sentence that has a hook to it. Let me give you a first line to get started with: Last night, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't fall asleep. Now the above sentence can have so many possibilities. Just start adding lines to it and soon, you'll have a story. Additional suggestion: if you want to write and are not able to write \u2014 basically, suffering from something known as writer's block, then here's a wonderful piece of suggestion for you. In Writing the Australian Crawl, Sanford Pisker interviews the celebrated poet William Stafford, perhaps the most prolific poet ever having penned over 20000 poems, on writer's blocks:  SP: It doesn\u2019t sound as if you are troubled by writing blocks. WS: Writing blocks? I don\u2019t believe in them. SP: But what if somebody has one? Doesn\u2019t that person have to believe in them? You do not suffer from then, but surely other people do. WS: No, I\u2019ve never experienced anything like that. I believe that the so-called \u201cwriting block\u201d is a product of some kind of disproportion between your standards and your performance. I can imagine a person beginning to feel that he\u2019s not able to write up to that standard he imagines the world has set for him. But to me that\u2019s surrealistic. The only standard I can rationally have is the standard I\u2019m meeting right now. Of course I can write. Anybody can write. People might think that their product is not worthy of the person they assume they are. But it is. ",
