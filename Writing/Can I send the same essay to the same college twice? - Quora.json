            "answer_text": "You can, but it is a terrible idea. Even if a college is for some reason asking very similar questions in their essays, it will make you look like you are either lazy or at best made a mistake and didn\u2019t proofread your essays (as you copied and pasted the same essay for two prompts). Take some time to develop unique essays that are actually tailored to the essay prompt. The good news is that the best essays actually come from your personal life experience. Everything you need is already in your head! The best way to write your essay is through a story and the Storybuilder platform offers one of the easiest ways to get started. Best of luck! ",
