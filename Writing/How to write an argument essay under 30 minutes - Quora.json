            "answer_text": "I can share what helped me with all my timed essays. First: Outline. I forget how much time you have, but I'd spend about 1/3 of your time outlining (10 minutes for a 30 minute essay). I know it seems like a long time, but trust me, it'll work in your favor in the long run. Here's how you do it (assuming the 5-paragraph essay): Write your thesis statement. Just one or two sentences. Do not continue until you have a solid thesis statement.Write the topic sentence of your first paragraph (it doesn't have to be perfect, but should have the basic gist of what you want to say).Write 3 supporting bullets for that topic sentence.(optional) Write a concluding statement.Repeat steps 2-4 for the second and third paragraphs.Write your concluding statementSecond: write like your life depends on it. At this point you have all your info, now it's all about writing it in a coherent \"essay\" format. Add in all the filler stuff for your intro paragraph, last sentence should be your thesis. Now all those topic sentences you wrote for step 2, become the first sentence of your second, third, and fourth paragraphs. All those bullet points become your evidence and if you did step 4, great, you also have your concluding sentence too! Now finish off your conclusion with the sentence you wrote in step 6 and you're done! See, when you were outlining, you were actually writing your essay already, but in a quick and dirty format that you were able to make changes to without having to worry about grammar, language, and style. Then all you need to do is convert it to proper \"essay\" format, and believe me, that's the easy part. Even if you don't finish in time, I'd still staple my outline to the test, so the teacher can see what direction you were going in. (I know you won't be able to do this on the actual AP exam, but it may score you some extra points with your teacher). I know it seems like a lot of extra writing that you won't even be graded on, but trust me, it's worth it. Having all your thoughts organized in one place will not only save you time when you're writing your actual essay, but will come across more clearly, because you can draw all your points from your outline and not have to worry about meandering halfway through your essay only to find out none of the points you've provided actually supports your thesis. With enough practice you'll be able to whip out that outline in no time and finish your essay with enough time to spare to check your work and clear up any grammatical/language issues. I hope this helps and good luck! ",
