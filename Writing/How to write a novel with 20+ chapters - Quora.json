            "answer_text": "A chapter is as long as a chapter needs to be. That being said, I change chapters as soon as the focus changes, however long that is. A lot of authors us * * * or lines to delineate a focus change within a chapter, but I consider these to be chapter changes. So the number of chapters is dependent on how you consider each chapter should be. As an example, some authors would consider a space battle to be a single chapter. But for me, if the battle has various changes in it, like fallback, defensive stand, attack, each phase is its own chapter. And if the battle is big enough, each of those might go more than one chapter each. The number of chapters doesn\u2019t really matter. Although I will say with attention spans getting shorter these days, shorter chapters seem to work better for some people. What matters is the length of the novel, and how this meets the expectations of your readers. For some books with 20 chapters, they could easily have been 65. Imo. Especially for an 80k+ word novel.

You do what works for you, and length has nothing to do with that. Try different things out, and see what your Muse likes. Even if it is writing 500 words a day at 3am. Nobody said you have to finish these chapters in a week. George RR Martin takes years. ",
