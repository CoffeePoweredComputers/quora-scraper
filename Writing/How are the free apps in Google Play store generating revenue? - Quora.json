            "answer_text": "According to a research, 90% of consumers spent their maximum time on mobile apps. So the challenging part for your business is to choose the perfect app that will ultimately attract user\u2019s interest towards the app. If you have above 100k app downlaods, you can easily earn around 100 USD to 700 USD only through advertisements. The amount varies as per the location, Active installs, active users etc. So before you put all your money in developing an app, here\u2019s to recognize how it can generate money for your business: Free of charge apps or paid apps- Being a business owner, you have the option whether you want to offer free apps or you can charge per app download. With the business point of view, you would obviously prefer to generate higher returns through charging on per download. 1) In-App Purchases : This is the most popular way of earning. In this method, user will downlaod the app for free and it allows the userr to make the purchases right inside the mobiel app. Example of In-App purchases : a) Subscription : You may have noticed in some applications, that to unlock premium features pay xyz amount etc. This comes under subscription, it can be for short duration of time ot on a permanent base.- Live example you can check with Shaddi.com, they offer in xyz amount for 6 months you will that abc features. b) Consumable : Typically this is used in mobile games. It encourage for repeat purchases such as buying extra lives in Candy Crush, extra gems, extra points inside a game. c) Non-consumable : You might have come across the mobile apps that offer a paid version (withou ads or ad free). Non-consumable products are permanent in most cases. 2) Take the help of Ads :This the easiest to implement (3rd party ad network) and most common too. Types of Ads: a) Interstitial Ads:these type of ads are typically displayed at natural transition points in the flow of the app. Closely related to pop-ups they generally cover up the entire space of the app screenThe uninterested users can click the cross button to stop seeing this kind of ad. b) Banner Ads:These image-based ads (samll strips) appear on the top or bottom of the app screen. These kind of ads are mostly used ads, since they don't hinder the user experience. c) In-app Video Ads:Video advertising is already booming. In-app video ads are automatically placed in the app and are used as an exchange for some in-app reward. For an instance, it can be video that user has to see when he/she completes a level in any game to unlock the next level. d) Native ads:Native Ads are different from other advertisements as they seem like a natural app element.User are not annoyed by these kind of ads which is why these are the most preferred ads. 3) Physical Purchase :You may have noticed many ecommerce businesses publish app for free to sell physical goods. 4) Referral Marketing :This is one of the primary app marketing method, in whcih app publisher promote other third party products/services, This trick can actually work wonders for your app if done right. It helps you attract customers that are loyal and profitable. Different type of Referral Marketing : a) Cost Per Click (CPC ):This type of model is based on a number of clicks on the ad displayed. It includes both text and display advertisements. b) Cost Per View (CPV):This model involves monetization based on the number of ad interactions or video views. c) Cost Per Install (CPI):You get paid for each advertised app install within your free app. There are a number of mobile advertising platforms that aims to drive more users, generate more money and offer a rich personalized experience on your platform.

            "answer_text": "There are lots of ways to generate money from your application. There are definitely some peculiar features in monetization of certain app categories. The main monetization models are the following: Advertising. You choose the ad formats that you\u2019d like to implement, choose an SDK (monetization solution) that you\u2019d like to use and start running ads and earning money. I recommend you to use ad mediation platform because you will be connected to multiple ad networks at once and thus, they will compete for your traffic and you will sell it at a higher price. We\u2019ve gathered the most popular and effective ad formats here - Epom Apps | Ad FormatsFreemium. The app is offered for free, but certain features are unavailable and user has to pay to unlock them. In other words, people have access to an app's basic functionality, but there is a charge for premium or proprietary features.In\u2013App Purchases. This app monetization strategy involves selling physical or virtual goods within your app, and then retaining the profits.Subscriptions. This monetization model is similar to the freemium model except that it focuses on granting content, not features. User can view a certain amount of content for free and then it has to sign up for a paid subscription to get more. This model is best suited for service focused apps.Sponsorship. It requires partnership with advertisers, who provide app users with rewards for completing certain in-app actions. In this model, brands and agencies pay to be part of the motivational system. Your app earns money by taking a share of the revenue from redeemed rewards.To my mind, in-app advertising is the easiest and the quickest to implement monetization model. Due to our experience, it may take like an hour in order to integrate SDK and start earning.If you\u2019d like to start with this model, our team we\u2019ll be glad to help you with that. You may find more information on our website - Epom Apps | Powerful and simple mobile monetization platform for iOS and Android apps Hope this information helps. ",

            "answer_text": "By the following ways Android apps make money. 1. The Freemium Upsell This requires having a second version of your app that\u2019s paid. Typically you\u2019ll see this as the \u201cLite\u201d and \u201cRegular\u201d or \u201cHD\u201d versions of an app, paired together. The free app will have a link that a user can click that drives them to the iTunes store on their phone. It\u2019s kind of a feeder system \u2013 users can download your free app and get a sense of what you have to offer, then they can easily purchase the full version (which will have lots more functionality and game play.) 2. In-App Purchases In-app purchases can also be subscriptions if you were in the market of news feeds. The Newsstand functionality within the Apple framework allows you to set up an in-app purchase that will automatically charge every month. 3. Ads 4.Sponsorship 5. CPI Networks (Cost Per Install) Cost per install is a relatively new marketing mechanism and is the mobile equivalent to CPA (cost per acquisition) in the web marketing world. CPI is exactly what it sounds like \u2013 you pay per install that you get. ",

            "answer_text": "A research by Distimo revealed that in-app purchases through free apps account for more than 98% of revenue generated by the Google Play store in 2013. This indicates that even if the apps run for free, they tend to earn much more money than paid apps , Which explains the phenomenal success of the Freemium model. Many apps and games have the ability to catch your attention with the promise for free, but after your credit card information has been attached, you will not mind spending a few dollars on the game just for the sake of continuity. The remaining 2% of revenue generated by the Android App Center came from paid apps and paid apps with in-app purchases (mostly games). This could be a nice lesson for many Android developers looking to make the most of the freemium model and entice fans to make money for their apps through in-app purchases. This is a trend that iOS AppStore also follows, so don't be surprised when the Google Play Store gets the same result, especially considering the sheer amount of free apps available I advise you to start from here, it will be a great success for you ",

It keeps the morale of the developer high to make something even better for you. At times the satisfaction is someone is using the product you made. It is like social work in the world of coding. People give away lot of codes free as well for the better use of the developers and general public. We should be thankful for such developers who work hard to come up with a product and yet gives it free. ",

            "answer_text": "3 ways  I know for free Android apps to make money on Google Play Store: 1. In-app purchase : (most common) After installing the app or game, users might want to buy some tools to get a next level or some kind of advanced features. Those will require purchase and the users need to pay. 2. In-app advertisement : (most common) The app will display Banner/Video/Interstitial Ads, etc inside. When users are playing app/game, the Ads suddenly pops up and the users might click the Ads and/or install the Ads app. So the developers can get revenue through Ads based on CPCs (the amount of users' clicks), CPIs (the amount of Ads app installs), CPAs (the amount of Ads app installs&registration), etc. 3. Subscription: (Some) Some app companies, Evernote for example, show the app as free. While after install, it might require you to purchase its services.  ",

Google, Facebook all provide banner ad options for your app. Their integration is simple and fairly easy to use. The company gets the clients and pay you a commission based on the number of times that ad was displayed on your app.You can go for the more complex more that is actually favoured by customers. Its the freemium model, which is basically offering the app for free and then charging the customer for additional features once they are hooked on the app. You can charge for additional features, bonuses, add-ons, and to unlock some blocked faturesThe last way is to create a pro version of the app. I won't recommend this as conversation rates in this case is usually low but you can create a pro version which people may buy after having used and experienced the free version.

In-app purchase : The app will be available to all for free but most of its useful and attractive features will be locked ( like extra filter in Photo editing apps e.g. Retrica , extra moves in a game e.g. Candy crush saga ) then the user needs to pay for it. 3. Subscription - Few companies will provide the app for free and then ask you to pay for some more advanced and useful features e.g. extra cloud storage in Evernote.

In app purchases Here the app offers products you can buy in order to boost your experience in the app or gain features out of the app. Apps like Pok\u00e9mon Go, Modern Combat, Candycrush, photo editing application may charge you for new filters or buying poke balls or customizing your weapons in modern combat, often application with in app purchases end up making more money than paid ones. Advertisement You can place adds In your app using Google Adword or other services. Which will pay you for the amount of clicks made in adds, or amount of videos watched, the greater the amount of clicks the more money you earn. However placing ads in you app may create a bad experience for the user since most ads will use a considerable real estate in their app screen or may pop up every time and annoy the user.

Two sources as of my knowledge, Google charges a developer account fee, which is paid once a year, and each app on play store is published by a developer who has this membership.Most of the free apps include adds. Those adds are posted by google ads, for every ad we watch both google and developer will be granted money, obviously bigger cut is of developer, that is how developers as well as google get paid for free apps.

For which you may search Google and also can refer to this link : Ads  |  Google Developers And the Ad offers completely depends upon the number of downloads of your apps by users. For more details of Ads and Ad APIs you may visit above link which I shared with you. I hope you will get most out of the link. Good Luck :) ",

My opinion is quite different from the other writers. If you display an ad from the beginning in your app then people won\u2019t mind it. Although the no of downloads would be low your active number of users will be actually high than if you introduce an ad after 10,000 downloads. Because people will then start uninstalling your app because they won\u2019t be comfortable with your app anymore. My app has just crossed 1000 download and i have introduced a banner ad and i am earning around 0.05$ daily. It\u2019s quite an insignificant amount but as the downloads increases the revenue also increases. Hope it helps. ",
