            "answer_text": "Of course. CDA can be used for analysing any selection of talk and text. CDA tends to be used on political sources, owing to its specifically political aims itself (see e.g., Norman Fairclough or Teun van Dijk on that). Just searching online, there are many examples of this taking place: Teun van Dijk himself has edited a book on literature and discourse and is interested in things like narrative, poetry, drama, myths, songs, letters, Biblical discourse and graffiti (Discourse and Literature).For something peer reviewed, Maingueneau (2010) has written a critical article of the (some she sees as erroneous) uses of DA applications in literature (full reference: Maingueneau D. (2010). Literature and discourse analysis. Acta Linguistica Hafniensia, 42, 147-158. DOI: /10.1080/03740463.2010.482325)While I am unfamiliar with him myself, Mathew Evans, a contributor in 2013 to the website \u2018language in conflict\u2019, seems to have an especially accessible article trying to show how CDA ideas can be used to think about literary sources ('The author and the princess' - An example of Critical Discourse Analysis).",
