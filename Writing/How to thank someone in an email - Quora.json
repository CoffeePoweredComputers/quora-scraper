            "answer_text": "First, can I ask you why you are not thanking them either in person or by snail mail? In any event, how you respond rather dictates the length and degree of your expression of thanks. I always like to write out my answer on the computer as this gives me the chance to perfect what I wish to say without duplicating my words. I then print and sign my letter and mail it out. I think that it is very important to have something tangible that the recipient can hold onto and take where to look at and re-read. But, you should use whatever means you feel in order to express your thanks. Second, Your thanks should always involve what the person did, how it made you feel, and what this will mean for you in the future. This may seem to be a daunting task, but I promise it\u2019s not as tough as it seems. For example, suppose a cashier smiles and gives good service on a particular day. What did the person do? Give excellent service and smiled. How did it make you feel? It made me feel as though I was their only customer. What does it mean for the future? You will use this excellent customer service as being preferable for you to use in the future. Giving thanks to someone should always be personable and sincere. As long as you do this, you can\u2019t go wrong. ",
