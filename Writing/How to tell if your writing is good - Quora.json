            "answer_text": "You can not tell any thing before the first draft is done . However , details tend to be an issue down wrongly they just create extreme exposition . This is often why it's a shame people do not read poetry more often . poetry is often defined as the most Efficient effective use of language particular in rhymed and meter because there are such constraints . That is just a tip to explore for avoiding exposition . As far as detail , it depends on the detail you are talking about , one of the best modern writers for physical descriptions of people and places is Stephen king . So I would recommend reading the Night Shift Collection as they are all short stories the format requires precision and economy of language . two more good ones are : John Irving , john Irving does excellent details of people , places as well as more figurative and metaphysical stuff and has a very good trick if including it as part of the action so that it does not seem like exposition . Tom Robbins is another one to read he does not give description in a general sense what he does and remember he is a satirist is gives you a short history of mundane things that then be come a crucial point . Kurt Vonnegut is another who writes in this style but keep in mind they are both satirist so basically they are setting up a joke . For example Vonnegut has a great line I still remember to day : Paraphrased : her face had a look of puzzlement and bewilderment as she struggled with how to respond , not what she wanted to say but how to say it because the American education system has gone to great length to convince the country no one knew how to speak . however on the other end of the spectrum is Dostoevsky And Tom Clancy who go into exhaustive excruciating detail about stuff . Dostoevsky , he is writing a book that has to last the entire Russian winter . Clancy , for me , is a little arrogant but it does make his stuff easy to translate to film. The best is Fitzgerald , who , well let's face it there is a reason for him being at the top of the short list . He punches through a detail sentence and laces it with poetry : Everyone knows the famous quote from The Great Gatsby : Her voice is full of money,\u201d [Gatsby] said suddenly. That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money\u2014that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it\" Edgar Allen Poe is an excellent study as well . He is another one who builds description without exposition. People often laugh at studying literary criticism as useless But the reason you start first with American writers studying Poe , and every fiction writer should give his work a serious read and by serious read is look at how it's constructed , in your case descriptions but the over all flow too. Poe s work exist as a basic template of how to write a story . He builds them like an essay or a court case . He starts with a thesis , the story then is used to demonstrate the thesis . Every component , including descriptions echoes those thesis . If you want to learn how to do descriptions well I would read , and by read , I mean seriously critique as you read Poe, Fitzgerald , Stephen King and John Irving . Irving and Fitzgerald do physical description as character exposition probably more prolifically than anyone . Poe shows you perfectly how to construct a narrative . Stephen King does descriptions of people so well that you can almost draw a picture . I personally love Fitzgerald because he does it with a punchy , but elegant way that does not wade anything down. First , and most important , is just finishvthe draft , this is my weakness because I will finish the story in my head and lose interest in writing which is why I like to do a rough draft then an outline then re organize to the outline . But I was trained to do journalism academically , so I tend to approach things a bit formulaically\u2026 not that you can tell by my quora answers , but I usually am writing them in the tub on an iPhone and the app does not lend itself to copy editing and reorganization. but just finish the damn draft ! One of the funniest things ever in a movie about writers is Michael Douglas's character in Wonder Boys who has a room full of a book he is writing because he won't just finish the damn thing , I would have to re watch the movie to be for sure , but I think he is at like 800 or 1000 pages and Robert Downey Jr who plays the role of his publishing agent just keeps asking when it will be done and he says I am working on it : so yeah! Finish the draft then worry if it sucks . Keep in mind even the best pitchers in the world walk players , and Michelangelo painted over several versions of the Sistine Chapel , not everything anyone touch is always gold , but until you are finished you do not know what you have . so my advice is do not worry about description just pump it out . Then give it to some one you trust to read. I used to mark up my friends work all the time who was able to sell scripts for a short time before he went into teaching because he said I was a dick , I never meant to be a dick , I just tend to be straight forward about what I like or don't like . You need to find someone like this . It does not have to be some one with stature just need some one who will be honest about what they think. As a digression ,and an annecdote to the last bit , my notes would consist of comments like \" I am bored I am turning the channel \" or \" I think I saw this on \u2026 \" So , finally first finish the draft , if you are worried about doing descriptions well critically read Fitzgerald , Irving , King and Poe . I didn't mention Faulkner or Hemingway , Faulkner is really good at descriptions too I just actually do not like him so much , he and I have conflicting personalities and Hemingway is a sissy . These are not criticism of their work just my own personal idiosyncratic manifestation and hence the reason you find them absent of recommendation for study. ",

            "answer_text": "No writer can ever be totally objective about his/her own writing. Therefore, writers MUST get brutally honest feedback from others before judgment can be made about the quality of a piece of material. This feedback can come in several ways. One can select three or four other writers to read and evaluate the material. The feedback should be as specific as possible. If something is not working for the reader, then this should be thoroughly explained. Suggested fixes are not necessary, but identifying problem areas is critically important. Any improvements will be discovered during the rewriting process. Encourage or even demand complete honesty from the readers. This isn\u2019t about sparing your feelings. It\u2019s all about improving the quality of the writing, developing the most compelling and emotionally engaging storyline, and creating characters that leap off the page. Next, one can join a writers group where everyone is at approximately the same level in their craft. Everyone exchanges material and offers group feedback. In this way, each writer gains feedback from many writers. If everyone is stumbling over the same areas of your material, then you can be pretty sure the story must be reworked at that point. The downside to such groups is getting completely honest feedback. Many writers are nervous about being too critical, for fear of receiving critical notes on their own writing. This is rather ironic, because without objective honest feedback, no one will improve their craft. Another way to get feedback is to pay an editor or a story analyst/ consultant. Again, you as the client, must demand complete honesty or you might not get it. But, if you can handle the truth, then you might find your writing develops to an all new level. The right editor or consultant will help you see things about your writing that you can\u2019t see for yourself. This will help you with not only your current project, but all future writing as well. Hope this helps. Good luck and keep writing. ",
