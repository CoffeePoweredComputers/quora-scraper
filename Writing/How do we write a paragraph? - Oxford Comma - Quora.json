            "answer_text": "First you need to work on sentences. For example, in your question, you need a helping verb to make it correct. I\u2019m also assuming you want the plural form of paragraph: How do we write paragraphs? The answer is, once you have practiced sentences, you can construct a paragraph by focusing on one topic or one idea in that paragraph. To begin your practice, write a first sentence that gives your reader an overall main idea of what the paragraph is about. That\u2019s called a topic sentence, and it makes your paragraph easier for the reader to understand. Then be sure all the sentences in your paragraph are focused on that main idea. The other sentences can elaborate on your main idea with examples, definitions, more details, etc. When you read, look at how paragraphs are constructed and you will start to see the pattern of connecting ideas this way. The best writers are always people who read a lot! ",

            "answer_text": "Writing a paragraph is a stone for some pupils, if not an iron. In writing a paragraph, one has to bear in mind that there should be a thesis statement, followed by supporting sentences. The topic sentence should contain the central idea that the whole paragraph discuses. A paragraph that fully discusses one idea in detail with the thesis statement and supporting sentences makes sense. ",
