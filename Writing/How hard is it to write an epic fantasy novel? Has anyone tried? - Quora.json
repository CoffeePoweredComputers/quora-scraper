            "answer_text": "Epics, by their very definition and origins, have to do with a story told as a poem. The focus of any and all epics is that they are totally larger than life and calls on people, especially those who are heroic, to rise up to an occasion that pits them against something or someone who normally could never be beaten. The hero becomes something of a demi-god and risks or gives, his life for the greater good. The hero is totally selfless, undertaking great trials and tribulations but never giving up. Epics are adventures that go beyond adventure and have characters that are so flamboyant that it would be hard to believe such people could ever truly exist. What I described above can be any story, but does find a clear handshake with the fantasy story genre. My first novel is, for the most part, a fantasy, set far into the future. Much of anything technological described is basically what is available today, and therefore has the idea of science fiction dropped. The story is a crisis that necessitates an undertaking spanning distance and a time interval; a go-to then return to the origin. It is a struggle between good and evil, life and death, and is fundamentally character-driven. What also distinguishes an epic, is the fact that the story is usually longer than an average. When you look at what epic poetry exists, you will sometimes wonder how anyone can keep a thought going over several hundred pages. This is also a challenge when wanting to write an epic novel. Now understand this - a story is only as long as it needs to be, so it is not proper to start with the desire to write an epic then try to fit a story into epic parameters. Don\u2019t be disheartened, however, since if you have a viable story and you design it properly, you can have the story span countless volumes, making it epic. Every single aspect of the story, every character, every story device, will need to be designed to the minutest detail. Before you write anything towards the story, you should already know everything about the story, including what its final length is going to be. In this way, an epic can be designed. I like to view epics as taking place over several generations. When approached in this way then there really is no choice but for the story to take on a grand nature and become epic. Today, serialized books, movies and television shows can be seen as epic, because they keep going on and on without any apparent ending, and things are happening in each episode (crises) that suggests that the hero(es) have to deal with more than they outwardly appear to be able to handle.

            "answer_text": "How hard is it? Writing AND finishing any book, even in its draft form is hard. The problen with fantasy and science novels is the worldbuilding - one reason why these genres are the exception to the rule when it comes to word count. Epic fantasy easily runs fron 80,000 to 150,000 words. Has anyone tried? Let me bang my head against the nearest wall and I\u2019ll get back to you. Hopefully, your location is within range of Earth\u2019s satellites. ",
