When you give a gift the real joy comes from giving. You may have not gotten a thank you from the person for several reason, maybe she sent you a thank you note and it was lost in the mail. Maybe she was nervous which made her forget or maybe she didn\u2019t like you or didn\u2019t like your gift or maybe she wanted to hurt you, there are many reasons for not getting a thank you from the person. Don\u2019t let it bother you too much think about what type of relationship you have with the person now. I\u2019m sure that you already have a idea why the person did not thank you, if she didn\u2019t send you one in the mail. ",
