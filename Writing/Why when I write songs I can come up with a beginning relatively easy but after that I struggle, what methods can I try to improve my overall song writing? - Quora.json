            "answer_text": "A2A: For more background information, search for my answer in this Quora thread: What is the worst beginner musician mistake? I was full-time in the tech industry (or real estate) and spent 30+ years on the side being a self-taught composer before I stepped into Juilliard in 2016 and began taking classes at their evening division focusing mainly on composition (also took classes in orchestration and music production since they were prerequisites for advanced comp). For the first decade as a self-taught composer, I wrote snippets of stuff and never finished anything. In the next decade, I finally started finishing things, and over time the melodies would get longer and not wander around so much. Endings were hard to come by, though, but became easier over time. Feel free to check out the music on my website Eileen Sauer as this shows my entire history as a composer. You\u2019ll see that I had unfinished snippets that were finally finished years or even a decade or more later. When, after writing nothing but snippets, I got sick and tired of it, I hit the reset button and decided to write a little children\u2019s song just to prove I could write an ending, and that was a song called Rosie. (I\u2019m noticing now I don\u2019t have a recording for some of the earlier works, have to re-record those, and Rosie is one of them.) I\u2019d suggest trying the same. I then embarked on writing Peripathetique, pushing the edges of the envelope as far as I could. I think it took me 3 years to write that because I kept wandering around with no idea of how to end it, until after 3 years I accidentally bumped into the beginning of Peripathetique, and it turned into an ABA. Taking a step back, all these years (decades) later, here is a random list of things I would consider, as all have helped me: Hone your craft - as an instrumentalist and vocalist. Master your music fundamentals. This is why I mentioned the first link. Mastery of music fundamentals and instrument will influence the level to which a composer can aspire.I like the flashcard method. There was a TED talk where the pianist Jennifer Lin presented to Goldie Hawn a set of flash cards, and Goldie randomly chose 4 or 5 notes. From those 4 or 5 notes, Jennifer created a beautiful improvisation from this. This technique is not only helpful for getting started, it\u2019s helpful when I\u2019m stuck in the middle of something and can\u2019t continue. Start with flashcards using just the C major scale, and later graduate to the entire chromatic scale.Sometimes if you get stuck and Really can\u2019t go forward, try going backwards. What if you delete the last 2 bars that you wrote? The last 5? Do you end up in a place with different options where you can fork off in a different direction?Analyze other composers\u2019 music, not just as a listener, or even a performer, but as a fellow composer. What do they teach you about the range of the instrument, music patterns, transitioning from one section to another, and yes, endings? Even analyze exercise books with nice short exercises that you find enjoyable, with, yes, lots of endings.With music production, you can cheat and fade away. That is an option and at one point in time everyone was doing that.I learned early on, Never to just slap a bandaid ending on something, assuming I would continue later. Rather, leave it deliberately incomplete. Maybe the notes are ascending to some climax, or descending, and there are lots of options. Then sleep on it, take a walk, let your subconscious soak on it and a solution will surface over time.Do you have a story to tell? I personally find I write the best, and the fastest, when a story comes to mind. Sift through your own experiences for insights, lessons learned, etc.At the bottom I\u2019ve attached an image of the first page of our very first assignment at Juilliard for the Intro to Composition class. Sometimes we\u2019re blocked because there are too many options. It can be a relief working from a set of parameters like in our first assignment, without constraining \u201crules\u201d that may or may not help you creatively.Why might you be having trouble creating endings? The worst ending is one that simply, abruptly happens with no warning. In analyzing masters like Beethoven - they don\u2019t just simply end. Rather, long before, there is some indication to the audience that we\u2019re veering into ending territory. But nope, now we veer off here. Gotcha! And there\u2019s this nice little segue, and we\u2019re going to end, but nope, now we veer off here. When the ending finally does show up, it\u2019s a surprise, and also a relief and satisfying because the audience has been expecting this to end.Because I was a self-taught composer for so long and endings were an arduous and hard-earned journey, I still to this day never look a gift horse in the mouth. I\u2019m afraid my muse will be annoyed that I dissed her and say: oh really? You\u2019ll never write an ending ever again! Sometimes I get an ending and I\u2019m surprised. That\u2019s OK. If that happens, and your muse has more to say, one of two things will happen. You will continue on to a part 2 of what may become a series (I have a Haunted Dreams series that is six parts). Or you will continue on to something that may loop around back to the original material, and become the second half. That happened to me with \u201cMake Up Your Mind\u201d. At the midway point, my high school chorale director told me he loved the last part, and that I should expand it. I didn\u2019t think I could do that, so I shrugged and kept writing. I was surprised later when it looped back around to that really cool part at the end, and so I repeated the ending, with just a little twist to make it more comedic. ",
