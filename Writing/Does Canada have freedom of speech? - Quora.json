            "answer_text": "Firstly, I have to point out that the answer made by User-10890420031709496649 saying that Canada has no freedom of speech because a 50-something year old man (Elliott) who was taken to court for harassing a 20-something (Guthrie) was completely taken out of context. His claims are partially wrong. Why is his answer partially wrong? If he actually read through the same article he posted, it actually said the following: The 50 year old man literally stalked and harassed her account over a period of time. It started off friendly, but when he was blocked and ignored, he started becoming more and more agitated due to the responses that Guthrie made in lieu of her feminist comments. So Elliott started tagging Men\u2019s Rights Activists and created a perpetuating fury of further online harassment from third parties. He didn\u2019t just mock feminism. He started a shit storm of anti-feminism, as well as third party sexual harassment, spam and hate mail.Which at the same time, through the motivation of another feminist, Anita Sarkeesian, a 24 year old man, named Bendilin Spurr created a video game that violently diminished another feminist, by allowing players to \u2018punch her to death\u2019. His followers joined in the fray and the shit storm was now afoot.During this entire scenario, Guthrie felt with all of the online violence and harassment, her life would be threatened. So she took reported Elliott. The court charged him accordingly and banned him from using the internet, using Twitter and not allow him to contact Guthrie in any form. Three years later, after a long and arduous court battle, Elliott was cleared of all charges, as the court could not ascertain that Guthrie had her life threatened by Elliott.While I am sure it seems like this was just a simple misunderstanding between a 50 year old man (Elliott) and a 20 something year old woman (Guthrie), ultimately, this was a circumstance of perceived harassment. Arman\u2019s argument in his answer, pointed out that Canada has no Freedom of Speech, because the courts arrested him and banned him for three years due to voicing an opinion. However, Arman failed to recognize that this wasn\u2019t about the Canadian government arresting Elliott for voicing an opinion. This was the Canadian government reacting on threats of harassment which was the case of the perpetuating shit storm that ensued. Therefore, he was arrested and charged accordingly. It wasn\u2019t until a long court battle, that he was cleared. However, THIS was not an attack on the freedom of speech. That was in fact about a personal attack on another person and the probability of threatening a person\u2019s life. Our government take these things seriously and not whimsically. Furthermore, not only did he not read the same article he linked, but by his logic, if I went into his house and start calling his mother and wife bitches and invited people into his house to incite violent verbal abuse, he would be totally fine with it? He would sit there and say nothing, do nothing, not even punch me or kick me out of his house? He will listen to my harassment? Secondly, Freedom of Speech is specifically about every day citizens and what they\u2019re allowed to say against the government without being censored. However, Freedom of Speech doesn\u2019t protect you from the consequences thereafter. It also definitely does not protect you from defamation, nor harassment of another person. Just because you say shit, doesn\u2019t mean other people can\u2019t call you out for them. Lastly, Freedom of Speech does not include Hate Speech. You can be a Neo Nazi for example, but you can\u2019t go around and preach hate openly and publicly. Doing so will result in the courts charging you for spreading hate speech. So to answer your question, yes, Canada has freedom of speech. However, harassing other individuals using vile remarks, hostile and aggressive activities is not freedom of speech and is not protected by the Charter of Rights & Freedoms.  Thanks to User-10245302339626190140 for pointing out my errors. I have since corrected my answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Does Canada have freedom of speech? Well, let\u2019s have a look, shall we? Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Part 1 - Schedule B Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law: Guarantee of Rights and Freedoms 1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. Fundamental Freedoms 2. Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: a) freedom of conscience and religion; b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication; c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and d) freedom of association. Well, it appears from Clause 2 (b) - Fundamental Freedoms - that Canadians do indeed have Freedom of Expression. Wait a minute\u2026. let\u2019s go back to Clause 1. What does that say? The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. Hmmm\u2026. what sort of limits are reasonable limits? What can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society? It would appear that these things are open to interpretation. It would appear that these things are largely dependent upon the government, and the political climate of the day. That means they could be altered to suit any number of conditions desired by the government currently in power, as long as the public acquiesces to their interpretation. Clause 1 effectively takes all of the power and authority away from Clause 2, given the right conditions. Freedoms are not freedoms unless they are explicitly spelled out in no uncertain terms, and there is no room for manipulation of the said freedom. Canada\u2019s government has already demonstrated their willingness to interpret this document in a way that makes Clause 2(b) untrue, and in spite of considerable resistance from the public it was passed into law, anyway. The majority of Canadian citizens see this abuse of power as a positive step. ",

            "answer_text": "Quora readers may be aware that the US State Department releases a report on every other country in the world giving an assessment (from an American perspective) on the state of liberty all over the world. The relevant write up on Canada, released in 2018, is below - Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including: a. Freedom of Expression, Including for the Press The constitution and law provide for freedom of expression, including for the press, and the government generally respected this right. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combined to promote freedom of expression, including for the press. Freedom of Expression: The Supreme Court has ruled that the government may limit free speech in the name of goals such as ending discrimination, ensuring social harmony, or promoting gender equality. The court has also ruled that the benefits of limiting hate speech and promoting equality are sufficient to outweigh the freedom of speech clause in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the country\u2019s constitutional bill of rights. The criminal code prohibits public incitement and willful promotion of hatred against an identifiable group in any medium. Inciting hatred (in certain cases) or genocide is a criminal offense, but the Supreme Court sets a high threshold for such cases, specifying that these acts must be proven willful and public. Provincial-level film censorship, broadcast licensing procedures, broadcasters\u2019 voluntary codes curbing graphic violence, and laws against hate literature and pornography impose some restrictions on the media. In January a gunman killed six persons and injured 17 more in a shooting at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Center in Quebec City. The gunman was arrested and charged, although the government did not charge him with terrorism. While public and official reaction to the event was overwhelmingly condemnatory, in July an unidentified individual left a package at the same mosque with a note expressing hate and a defaced Quran. In July police charged a Mississauga, Ontario, man with one count of willful promotion of hatred for posting abusive videos and materials against Muslims and other groups on his website FreedomReport.ca and FreedomReport.us - Kevin J. Johnston and other social media platforms. The charge related to a series of online postings over a five-month period, rather than a single incident. In April, Justice Jacques Chamberland opened public hearings in Quebec in an inquiry ordered by the provincial government into reports Quebec law enforcement agencies surveilled eight journalists between 2008 and 2016 as part of internal police investigations into sources of leaked information. Although the police had a warrant from a Quebec court for each case, testimony suggested police might have based warrant applications on unsubstantiated allegations. The electronic monitoring allowed police authorities to track the journalists\u2019 movements and telephone logs. Internet Freedom The government did not restrict or disrupt access to the internet or censor online content, and there were no credible reports that the government monitored private online communications without appropriate legal authority. Approximately 99 percent of households could access broadband services. According to 2016 International Telecommunication Union data, 90 percent of the population used the internet in 2016. Academic Freedom and Cultural Events There were no government restrictions on academic freedom or cultural events. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but it is very different from the one in the United States. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is one of the core concepts of the United States, and it basically means that nothing (especially government) should be able to interfere in the pursuit of those goals. It is judged that those core values are at the very basis of the common good and therefore cannot be infringed upon in any way. This basically means that the belief in absolute freedom means that no speech (however horrendous) should be barred for fear that this would lead to all speech being barred. The basic problem with this is that unfettered free speech can and does lead to a completely toxic political and social environment and virulent and thoroughly harmful ideas are protected in the name of free speech and can therefore spread. In contrast, the Canadian equivalent of the American core values are peace, order and good government, which give an entirely different spin on things. There is free speech in Canada, but that free speech is tempered with the concept that peace, order and good government are as important (and more so in certain situations) than absolute free speech. The problem with is that the people who decide what is acceptable or not can justify restricting free speech in order to protect or advance societal values or goals. Neither system is perfect, but they encapsulate the basic nature of each country. People tend to forget that although they share a superficial common culture and a language (minus Quebec and some parts of Boston), the United States and Canada are fundamentally different countries, with a completely different social, political, military history.

            "answer_text": "Yes in a broad sense (see Gareth Jones's answer to Does Canada have freedom of speech? ). However, what many wrestle with for freedom of speech is that one person's rights ends where another begins. For instance, harassment and threats do not fall under freedom of speech. There's also the issue of soft freedom of speech. In Canada we do, in fact, deal with consequences from what you say and try to protect against then because they can be as bad as the government punishing you for what you say. The consequence of this trade off is that you may not speak about whatever you wish. For instance, Nazis bristle at being silenced in Canada but they are simultaneously protected from being fired from a job if they don't spread hate speech. They would like you to believe that they can be free from consequence while spreading hatred but that would restrict the right of freedom of speech for people who want to disassociate themselves from Nazis. Hence the trade off. Overall, Canada also values an orderly society. Speech that can demonstrably bring undue harm to society can be banned. This typically affects extremely discriminatory speech or terrorist propaganda. I'm vague about what that means because ultimately the courts decide on a case by case basis. ",

The government mandates that you must call someone by their preferred pronoun, he, she, him her, zim, zer, apache helicopter, tank, whatever they tell you to refer to them by, you must under Canadian law do so. We also have hate speech laws. Spreading hateful propaganda aimed at specific groups is illegal in Canada whereas in the United States it is legal. In the United States if you don't like what you are hearing you can protest, leave or debate but they are allowed to speak no matter what their opinion is. In Canada is you speak hatefully towards a group you are breaking the law. The Supreme Court of Canada has rejected constitutional challenges to the hate propaganda offences in the Criminal Code, and has also rejected challenges to the hate publication provisions in human rights legislation. THE COURT HAS RULES THAT WHILE THE PROVISIONS RESTRICT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, THE RESTRICTIONS ARE JUSTIFIABLE UNDER SECTION 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Our own government acknowledges that fredom of speech is RESTRICTED IN CANADA. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. This link takes to the text of The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, part of the Canadian constitution: Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982. It begins: Rights and freedoms in Canada 1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. Fundamental Freedoms 2. Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: (a) freedom of conscience and religion;(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;(c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and(d) freedom of association.Now, notice that the freedom of expression (including speech) in clause 2b does have limits expressed in clause 1. Any limits must be prescribed by law, of course, but laws can be scrapped by the court if they are unconstitutional. The laws can create constitutional limits on free expression only if they are demonstrably justifiable. That is, the purpose of the law must be limited and clearly worthy. More than that, the justification of the law must be acceptable in and to a free and democratic society. The short form is that there is freedom of speech in Canada, but Canada is honest about the existence of limitations on it (as also exist in the States) and seeks to make sure the limitations are few, small, and strictly necessary.
