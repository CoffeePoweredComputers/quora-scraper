Hike and switches totally depends on the value you bring to the company and your negotiation skills. I have see talented guys gettings 10\u201330% hike only and also seen average guys pulling off over 100\u2013150% hikes. It all depends how you portray your skills and negotiate your deal, there is no set way of doing this. But if play are confident in your skills and can convience your worth to the company I guess you can ask for anything between 4.5lpa to 5.5 lpa ",

These service based companies like Infosys, Cognizant that you mentioned offer between Rs 3.5\u20134 lakh rupees to freshers. After one year experience, they earn around 3.8 to 4.2 lakh rupees annually.  So when you switch to these companies, ask for 4 lakh rupees minimum. Tell them that you are okay with the salary which they offer to employees with similar roles. Start with asking for Rs 4.5 lakh showing your experience and skill set. If you can negotiate well, they can settle between Rs 4\u20134.5 lakh or else you should get 4 lakh minimum from the experience that you hold. That would still be a 233% hike which is great.  Good luck on your job switch! ",
