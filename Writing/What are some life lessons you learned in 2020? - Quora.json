            "answer_text": "2020. The Year of Covid wrecked us. I watched, as did millions of other people, as this pandemic exploded all over the world. I started social distancing on my own back in January or February, as soon as I heard of covid, due to the fact that so many people were dying, and my parents, being elderly with some health conditions, most likely wouldn\u2019t survive the virus. I am their caregiver. I am now a hermit. This year has taught me a bunch of things. I\u2019m not the most patient person on this earth, and my patience has been tested a number of times. I haven\u2019t been able to conduct normal business, like getting my car inspected and registered, because certain places closed up shop. I haven\u2019t been able to go into a store and just browse, instead I now shop online and do the curbside pickup thing. I haven\u2019t been able to go to a funeral for a family friend. I have missed out on several outdoor gatherings with friends, because I seem to be one of the few people who minds the law, no matter how stupid that law may be. I more than likely won\u2019t be able to attend my first-born granddaughter\u2019s wedding this year. I am sick and tired of coved. Who isn\u2019t? When I let myself go there, I get a feeling of rage in my gut, because of all the lies and misinformation the American people have had thrown at them regarding how to live safely with covid. The fractured economy, the increase in violent crimes, suicide, domestic abuse, and more, the ridiculous notion of wearing masks\u2026.all of it just pisses me off. And how do you pick out the truth from the squirming mass of lies that have been told to us all? This year has tested my patience more than any other year, except maybe for 2014, when ISIS was in America, cutting the heads off of innocent Americans right in the damn streets. That was scary for me. Glad the current administration has wiped them out\u2026 well, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re not wiped out, just gearing up for more terror somewhere in Bumfukegypt. This year I have become aware of just how far left the democrats have become. This year I am more convinced than ever that we are living in the last days, and that surely Jesus will come again soon. This year has taught me to make sacrifices in the name of love. This year has taught me to not believe everything you read or hear\u2026 unless of course it\u2019s on facebook, because everyone knows what you see there is pure 100% truth. NOT. This year has taught me that eating out in a restaurant for a change from cooking every day is a real treat. (I haven\u2019t eaten away from home since February) This year taught me that some people are flakes to the nth degree. 2020 will always be a hell year for me. The year China released a manipulated virus that spread around the world. A virus that opportunists have used to their advantage. The year that saw a crazed rush for a vaccine against covid, one that I will almost certainly refuse, because of the very fact that it hasn\u2019t been tested enough and no one knows what the long term effects of the crap might be. I plan to have a few more good years on earth, and no possible iatrogenic reaction from a rushed vaccine is going to shorten that time I have. I have felt more doubt, fear, and disgust (over all things covid-related) this year than I have ever dealt with in the past. So far, 2020 has pretty much sucked. The only thing that could thrill me this year is if I win a million dollar lotto, or if Donald Trump is reelected. Cynical much? You bet. I no longer trust my government to have my best interest at heart. And besides covid, the political climate in this country is really getting to me also. But I am made from \u201cgood hardy German stock\u201d and I shall persevere. As will other Americans struggling this year. Because that\u2019s just what we do. Fall down, get back up. Do the best you can with what you have. Be happy over small pleasures. And always tell your people how much they mean to you. Trust in God and love your country and its flag. Speak up for what you believe to be good and right. And be safe. God Bless America. ",

            "answer_text": "This is what 2020 has tauggt me: That true that true friendships are those where they aren't scared to tell you the truth despite your faultsPeople value your worth based on what you can provide to them in skill and talent.That being nice is how you get taken advantage of and put in a position where you cannot defend yourself.No matter how good you are there is always somebody better smarter manipulative to get what they want.When you have a job or career that you love you trying to take it for granted because it only takes minutes for it to be gone and for someone to destroy what you have built upAlthough a reputation can help an individual in a person's life gain acceptance an approval from others it is easily taken down by that one person to cause destruction that is irreparableYour strengths is not only based on your physical the lands and the ability to physically defend yourself but also knowing your mental strength and the ability just see your way through a problem and solve itBeauty can open doors for many people but can easily be rejected for the same reasonLove is equated most of the time buy money not necessarily by true feelings and that your vulnerabilities can be exploited when you open up and speak your truthYou know a true person in your life is there because they will hear your story and believe it I never questioned itFriends are Charmed my money and not Charmed by character and by this an individual can be used to obtain their gain in life by stepping on the person that they once thought was their friendYour mind is a strong muscle and it can be manipulated in such a way I can teach you the right way to think and the wrong way to think and that the consequences are inescapable if you do not realize the solution is at your fingertips by thinking through a problem logically and understandably because if you can't you've created your own mental prison that you cannot get out ofI have learned that sometimes it's difficult to accept help from others monetarily especially when you're in need but in principle I've learned to keep my determination by working hard to maintain what I believe in which is never to depend on another individual no matter how much you truly need financial helpSometimes our biggest fears hold our biggest joys and if we prevent ourselves from opening the doors because of our fears we lose sight of the possibilities that can be provided to us to enrich our livesStanding up for what you believe in and for people you care about takes a lot of Courage and strength and determination when you are alone but I always hold true to those that need your help despite any circumstances that individual is in.Racism will always exist despite people believe because once you experience it you fight hard to try and prevent it and nothing ever happens.The rich get richer and the poor only have thier heart.you can give and give you can give and give to those in need but you always have to remember you should give and never expect anything back because true giving requires that of yourself just simply give.You can give your heart and you can give your heart and soul Blood Sweat and Tears to someone in a relationship and hope that taking care of them determines your love for them and care for them but if you don't tell your partner what you need and want you'll never get it.Men as well as women are always chasing money stability sex a true genuine individuals search for the same but in themselves not from another.Education does not equate to a permanent job education does not necessarily provide stability education does not make you better than anyone else you are as equal as the nextSelf-love is real love and true love Takes time to cultivatewhen you when you find something that you were good at take the time to cultivate it work hard at mastering it do not give up until you do for your skill will become your gift to be proud of and that has nothing to do with a certificateBeing married although has its benefits it does not determine the longevity of a relationship it does not maintain the longevity and stability of our relationship it can reasonably be built up and easily torn down.When it comes to children they should be not considered Commodities in a marriage or assets to a marriage but individuals you wash to cultivate and grow in two individuals you aspire to beLove your children as if it's the last time you'll ever see them because you never know what an expected challenges you have to face if they're taken away.Work on your faults because you never know when those Faults Are the reason you have consequences to face that you can escape fromYou need stability to be in a relationship financially if you don't work on things about yourself to support your own means you can never support a relationship that requires love and care but become dependant on individual for that which is not their jobIf you keep chasing if you keep chasing your dreams you never know what can come back to you and you should never give upAlways be yourself always be yourself and love others the way you wish to be treated for one day someone will understand who you are and reciprocated the way you feel you deservethese are just a few of the things that I have learned this year there's still a lot of things I have yet to explore so this list make it bigger I like keep writing. I still have a lot to learn about love, life, family, friendships, career, politics, the world, your community, culture Creed religion, myself ",
