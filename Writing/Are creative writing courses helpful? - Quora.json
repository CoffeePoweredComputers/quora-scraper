            "answer_text": "As somebody with a BA in Creative Writing and an MFA in Screenwriting, and who has taught writing at a college level, I can say with a great deal of confidence that yes, a creative writing degree is helpful. Obviously, if you want to become a writer, then creative writing courses are critical. But you may not realize, that even if your goal is to go into business, or even the sciences, creative writing courses can be helpful. In business, it has been said that the new MBA is an MFA. Why? Because businesses are realizing that the ability to think creatively, and to envision challenges and resolutions in new ways, can be incredibly valuable. Anyone trained in a creative art sees the world differently, and that fresh vision can bring unexpected rewards that can mean the difference between a company thriving or vanishing. The same goes with the sciences. It was Einstein who said that imagination is more important than knowledge. What you can learn in a high quality writing class fosters creative thinking and creative vision. Your training will help you see the problem with fresh eyes and sometimes all it takes is looking at something from a slightly different point of view to unlock new levels of knowledge. If you\u2019ve ever watched the movie, \u201cDead Poets Society,\u201d there\u2019s a scene where students are told to stand on their desks and look around. The world they see up there is very different from the one they saw from their seats. The same is true of a world that is looked at through a creative lens. (If you haven\u2019t seen the movie, watch it, or at least try looking at the world from atop your desk \u2014 you\u2019ll see what I mean). Finally, humans have been hardwired to create their worlds through stories since the days we lived in the cave. Back then stories were shared about the days hunts to share knowledge and increase the chances of survival. Today, training in story telling can open the storyteller, and those who listen to the stories, to new possibilities that open new worlds. So the answer is yes, creative writing courses are helpful.

            "answer_text": "Are you Searching for online writing courses just google search as \"Zoe Talent Solutions\"\ufeff. For many people who think of becoming writers, the very notion that there are creative writing courses may seem strange. The myth of the inspired and tortured artist has always been instilled, and that alone in his room he lives by revolutionizing literature and surpassing tradition. However, this conception is nothing more than a myth . Think of a symphony, which would be the musical equivalent of a novel, that is, a long and complex work that requires a lot of time, dedication and competence of the composer. Can a person completely on the subject sit down and compose a decent symphony without any kind of musical knowledge?  This is the question that I propose to you. \"Obviously not,\" I imagine it will be your answer, for many people have no idea what the musical structure of a symphony is, nor does it know the basic principles of composition for such a task. Even though we need to use musical notes (C, D, D, and so on), we would need many other tools, techniques and specialized knowledge. And this holds for almost any other form of artistic expression, whether in painting, sculpture, cinema, photography, dance, or theater. A ballet dancer is not someone who simply climbs on a stage and leaves pirouetting; to reach this level, have been years - sometimes a lifetime - devoted to learning and refining artistic techniques. And why in writing is this different? What leads people to think that a writer does not have to study and improve? Why is only literature the field of pure inspiration, with no need to know and master narrative techniques? In the fourth century BC, the philosopher Aristotle was the first thinker to codify poetry and to determine some of its essential aspects. Since then, his work Poetics is one of the most essential references for any writer and has become the text that inaugurated a new tradition to interpret, but above all to produce, literary texts. All literature from this point onwards owes much to Aristotle's observations and conclusions, and although he was only analyzing the poetic production of his time, such as tragedy, comedy, and epic, he also dictated the course of all future literature in West. In a way, Aristotle could be considered the father of creative writing, the first to isolate and expose literary narrative principles and techniques, and how we can use them to produce a coherent and compelling work that moves the reader and above everything that deserves to be read. It is logical that there were no writing courses in Ancient Greece, incidentally, this is a particularly recent phenomenon. In fact, universal education itself is something very modern, begun in the nineteenth century. Before that, a large part of the world's population was completely illiterate, receiving only the basic practical instruction for the trade they would perform, whether to be a bricklayer, a baker, or a shoemaker. Schooling was intended exclusively for the elite or for the priestly class; the plebs did not need to be educated, in fact, at least educated, the better, because it would be more easily manipulated by the ruling classes. This scenario has changed and today, with the growing specialization of knowledge, often even the faculty is enough. It is essential to continue to improve, by doing an MBA, a master's degree, a doctorate, qualification courses and whatever else there is on the way. And something similar has also occurred in the world of literature, with the advent of creative writing courses. ",

            "answer_text": "I think they are, but not in the sense of helping you boost your creativity. Writing courses tend to give you something that most authors desperately need to actually do the writing: a deadline. When you can finish the project whenever, it is very easy to procrastinate. Some people are great at setting deadlines for themselves. Others need someone to tell them \u201cwe\u2019re gonna need 4k words by Friday\u201d. They are also good for learning the specifics of a certain genre. For instance, you can take a creative writing course aimed at mystery writing. Having a topic or even a certain prompt can help with the very common writing problem of \u201cI want to write something\u2026 but I don\u2019t know what.\u201d Good luck and happy writing! ",
