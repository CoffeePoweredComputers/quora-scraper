If that's the case, you may want to pool together a bigger gift from all the bridesmaids for the bride. That's what we did for a recent bridal shower I held - all bridesmaids pitched in money - even those out of town - and we were able to get her something big from her registry. If it's too late or hard to plan for that, you can still send something on your own, but I don't think it's frowned upon if you don't.
