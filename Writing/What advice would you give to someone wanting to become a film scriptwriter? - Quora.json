            "answer_text": "Write because you love to do it. Never ever expect a single screenplay you write to be made into a movie. Write the movie you want to see and hear. Forget who your audience is except for yourself. If you can get yourself a good Agent you're 50% sold. If you live near Hollywood you're 50% sold if you're lucky you're 100% sold. Don't give two s**** what any Studio executive ever tells you about your screenplay they don't know what the f*** they're talkin about you could have written the greatest thing ever made and they could think it's garbage or you could have written pure garbage and they can think it's the greatest thing ever made. That's screenwriting and that's how it is. ",
