            "answer_text": "Yes, contrary to popular belief, local people express what they really think all the time. Many don\u2019t like the government and they\u2019ll even go on Facebook and write stuff about that. The problem is if you become famous, like a well known blogger, and you post anti government stuff. Then maybe something will happen to you. And on the local level you actually have a somewhat democratic system in that local officials are quite responsive and concerned about any problems going on. So for instance if a construction project is going to happen and they want to close a road you can be damn sure that if local residents don\u2019t like it they will complaint to the government and something probably would be done if enough people are opposed to it. In a lot of ways there is just as much freedom of speech anywhere else. The American concept of freedom of speech is being able to abuse other people, to incite racial hatred, or to say vulgar things. That is not really freedom of speech to me, that is bullshit that isn\u2019t tolerated even in many western European countries. Likewise, try saying you want to overthrow the US government or kill the US president, both such comments would land you with a visit by a federal agent, maybe even criminal charges. So there is always limits to free speech. I hate when Americans pretend only their form of freedom of speech is correct. It\u2019s actually bullshit and really only helps the rich and powerful. Six US companies own something like 80% of all media in the US, how is that freedom of speech? ",
