            "answer_text": "Well, that is quite an all-encompassing question. I am assuming that you already have an idea about the kind of magic you want, but are not sure how to develop it into a proper system. For this, I'll suggest you to look into Brandon Sanderson\u2019s Laws of Magic. There are three, and I'll introduce you to each of the law here briefly: An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic. This law basically deals with soft-magic (mysterious magic with no explanation on how it works) and hard-magic (well defined magic, like science). The more you make the reader understand your magic system, the more you can use it without confusing the reader as to how everything is happening. Also, if you want magic to be an integral part of your overall fantasy world, you absolutely have to make it hard-magic, so you can use it to its full extent.Limitations > Power. Do not create an all powerful magic user, a magic god. This takes out all the fun. There should be limitations as to how much and in what way magic can be used. Like if it is an energy based magic system, the magician should feel exhausted or need to recharge before he can do it again. Or something similar. Using magic should not be without any costs and consequences.Expand on what you have already, before you add something new. Do not create three magic systems in one world, instead make one but extrapolate it. Think on every possible way it can be used, make it diverse, and use it to its fullest potential. A brilliant magic system for a book is less often one with a thousand different powers and abilities -- and is more often a magic system with relatively few powers that the author has considered in depth.These are the three laws. I strongly suggest you to read the original article on it ( Sanderson's Laws of Magic) as it is very useful. Also, I'll suggest you to into Building Magic Systems Subreddit \u2022 r/magicbuilding, it is an amazing place for discussions on magic system. If you have not read books by Brandon Sanderson yet, please do. They have the best magic systems. Happy writing. ",

            "answer_text": "A good magic system should follow logical principles and have clearly defined powers and limitations. David Eddings system in The Belgariad is a good example. Sorcery is very powerful and flexible but is exhausting for the user and using it can be \u201cheard\u201d at a considerable distance by anyone else with the same or a similar power - so if a sorcerer starts trying to brute force his way through every obstacle, he\u2019ll exhaust himself and attract all kinds of unwelcome attention from opposing sorcerers. It\u2019s also limited by the mental abilities of the user - you can only do things that you can conceive of. Eddings put the limitations in place to stop \u201cSuperman Syndrome\u201d - where a sorcerer is just so powerful no-one in their right mind would ever oppose them and it\u2019s hard to write credible obstacles and enemies for them. Without conflict of some type, you don\u2019t really have a story to tell. ",
