            "answer_text": "As a person who learned English as my second language to speak, I can tell you from experience that I happened to speak with people who were able to speak English, however, very bad in term of grammar. Yes, I was able to communicate with them, but whether those were effective communications (in a sense that I would be able to establish the purpose of communication) is another question. So, yes, without grammer you still can have a communication. Now, let us ask; are we able to communicate effectively without grammar? My answer, based on my personal experience, is NO. Grammar is what facilitates the process of an effective communication. Without proper grammar (linguistic rules and regulations) you may still be able to communicate, but most probably with some amounts of misunderstanding (can be little or a lot depending on complexity of the topic of communication) which sometimes can completely render the parties from establishing their purpose of communication. Think of this scenario: You and your friend meet at 3pm. You haven't had lunch and when you see your friend you tell him that you are hungry. He replies: \u201cdon't you eat anything?\u201d (What he actually means is: haven't you eaten anything?) But what you understand is that he is asking you whether you want to eat something, so you reply \u201cYes\u201d. Here just happened a misunderstanding. The above is just a simple example. The problems which arise from misunderstandings in communication severe as you discuss more serious topics with someone who doesn't care/know about the grammar usage in his/her communication. So, grammar is quite important in communication. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but the accuracy of the communication transfer would suffer. We humans do not communicate well. Face-to-face, we hit about 80% accuracy, and that's our high. With all the body language and facial expressions and vocal tone (not to mention Power Point), we're still not good at sharing our view from inside our individual bubbles. Phone calls reduce accuracy to about 60% or less because we miss the nuances. By the time we get to the written word, we're pretty much apes waving palm fronds at each other from the distance. With luck we can manage 40%. Now remove the rules that help clarify our efforts. BOOM! Social unrest and even war can follow quickly. ",

And recently we have the swardspeak or gay lingo. But we manage to communicate effectively. One just has to choose the occasion and the company. In fact, in my present project, l have a hard time \u201cediting\u201d some of the letters that l have to send out because the grammar of the writer sometimes just wants to make me weep. So abiding with grammar rules really depends on the individual. And we also have sign languages when we want to communicate something. But that's another topic. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it can. During the Stone Age, people communicated through signs, until language was discovered. However, the reason why we have grammar rules is to avoid miscommunication. Language is not just a medium of communication anymore, it's an art, it defines sophistication and it impresses. So, if your goal is just to communicate, it's okay if the perfect grammar is not stressed upon, as far as the other understands you correctly. However, if it is more than simple communication, I think one should know the rules. ",

I have communicated to you my wish that you leave. No grammar rules necessary. But language cannot exist without grammar rules. That is one of the requirements linguists use to determine if a form of communication counts as language. ",

In case of formal program, meeting it's better to have good grammar skills to communicate which will be more productive. ",
