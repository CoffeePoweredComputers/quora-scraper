            "answer_text": "Yes, a five paragraph essay can be written in ten minutes. In fact, a five paragraph essay can be written in five minutes. The hard part isn't the act of writing. It's the selection of a topic, the research in support of that topic, and the refinement of your thesis. The mechanical act of writing isn't too hard, or at least, it doesn't have to be. Case in point, I am forcing myself to write this mini-essay in five minutes or less. Whenever the timer hits 5:00, I will stop myself. I will delete the entire exercise if I fail. If you are reading this essay, therefore, I have succeeded. Therefore, I've proven that writing isn't hard. :) Picking a topic, however, is tougher. Especially if you want to focus on a particular aspect of a broader area. In this case, you've asked whether a five paragraph essay can be written in 10 minutes. I spent the first two minutes of my allotted five thinking about how to focus and structure my argument. Then I spent the next 2 minutes thinking about my thesis. In this case, my thesis is that writing is easy, topic-picking is tougher, research is tougher still, and thesis-focusing is toughest. In this case, I kind of cheated, in that I didn't need to do any research. But I'd estimate that I spent another two of my allotted five minutes thinking about how to clearly and effectively state and support my thesis with what evidence I could provide by actually doing the act of writing the essay. I'm now reaching the 5:00 mark, and I'm onto the conclusion of my essay. I am pretty confident I'll finish by minute 5:00. All said and done, I spent four of my five minutes working on the topic, the thesis, and the structure of my essay. Then I spent a little under one minute writing this essay. Don't believe me? That's cool. But I have no particular incentive to lie. I set out to do this as a personal test, and I believe I succeeded. ",

            "answer_text": "Writing a five paragraph essay in under 10 minutes can seem daunting, but with the right planning and time management, it is certainly achievable.  The essay will likely be directed by a question or a prompt, like a quote, with a question. It\u2019s important that you read the question carefully and understand what it is asking of you. Once you are sure what the question is asking of you, the next thing you should do is brainstorm. Simply write down everything you can think of in brief notes and in no particular order just to get it out of your mind and on to paper. You can organize it later but initially you will have a record of relevant points and information to include. They might remind you of other things too. Now that you are aware of the demands of the question and have some ideas, you have to think about your answer. You need a main line of argument that will form the backbone of your essay. Once you have this, jot it down as it will form part of your introduction.  Writing a good essay requires the writer to know what to write. When you brainstorm there should be lots of things jotted on the page. When you write the essay itself, you need to have clear arguments, to be aware of the issues and be able to back up analytical points with appropriately selected information and evidence and some historians' views. A good essay style will help you make the most of what you know. If you know a bit about the essay topic, a good essay style can hide some of your inadequacies. If you really know your stuff, you should end up writing an excellent essay rather than just a good essay. ",

            "answer_text": "If you have the general ideas you want to discuss in the essay, great focus, and will be ok with a grade of C or lower - then yes. It can be done. Saying from experience, if you're that desperate to finish and need anything but an F, do it. Though a fair warning: it's extremely stressful. It's possible to finish an essay, but it definitely won't be your best! ",
