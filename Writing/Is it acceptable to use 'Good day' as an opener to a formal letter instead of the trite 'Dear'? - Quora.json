            "answer_text": "Is it acceptable to use \"Good day\" as an opener to a formal letter instead of the trite \"Dear\"? It depends on who you\u2019re writing to. If it\u2019s really formal, then \u201cdear\u201d is always a good fall-back. BUT - there are alternatives. I\u2019m a Beatle nut since the boys first hit the airwaves. So your question instantly threw \u201cPaperback Writer\u201d into my brain.  But OH NO! That salutation has gone out of acceptance since the politically-correct era came along, as described in this article. Free Download: 17 Proven Strategies for LEAD GEN Marketing On Fire! \u2014 Email Alchemy Elite 2.0 This one may be more helpful: Best Letter and Email Salutations and Greetings to Use The library I worked for sent out invitations, announcements, solicitations for money, and many other letters that required a formal greeting. It was a bitch, for me at least, to decide what greeting was suitable for each letter. We had a database that stored every possible consideration for communicating with our friends and casual users and new contributors. This included a tab for salutations, and here\u2019s where it got hairy. Say you have a widowed woman who goes by the \u201cold-fashioned\u201d name she\u2019s used since her marriage to the guy in the ground. She insists we never refer to her as \u201cLouise\u201d but as \u201cMrs. Raymond K. Smith III.\u201d We had to come up with a special coding for these women because if we had sent a missive to \u201cLouise Smith\u201d or to \u201cMrs. Smith\u201d or to \u201cMrs. Louise Smith\u201d - MAN, we could look forward to a reaming from Louise the moment she opened the envelope. Then we have the wife who needs to keep her identity intact. She\u2019s either \u201cBetty Amelia Zygmunt\u201d or \u201cBetty Amelia Zygmunt-Bono.\u201d Could that be more confusing? and how do you format that in a letter? She\u2019s called to complain no matter what we call her. We\u2019re scared shitless to send another formal letter with any sort of salutation - and then there\u2019s the problem, as with other cases of salutation ambiguity, where the husband (bless his soul) needs a salutation of his own, separate and distinct from Betty Amelia\u2019s. That requires two lines of names, just another brick on a marketing person\u2019s head. Gratitude to all husbands who don\u2019t give a damn how they\u2019re addressed. Well, except when it comes to titles, family add-ons, or some weird shit no one uses anymore - Sir, Esq, to name a couple. Lesser headaches involve mostly women who simply refuse to be a \u201cMiss.\u201d No problem; we deleted all \u201cMiss\u201d from the database and replaced it with \u201cMs.\u201d Job well done. Who can argue with \u201cMs.?\u201d Yep, someone can. Someone who has issues with any sort of salutation because they separate the sexes. OMG! We were running out of options in the database, resorting to a Word file with all these oddball requests/demands, then having to check all mailing lists against that file. Am I paid enough for this? What began as a simple and basic question raked up these memories, and would be more if I\u2019d stop for another think-through. I hope my answer has given a peek into the complexity of a problem most people don\u2019t have to fuss over. Good luck with pleasing all of the people all of the time. ",
