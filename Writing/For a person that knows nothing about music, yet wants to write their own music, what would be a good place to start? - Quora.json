            "answer_text": "This depends highly on what music you want to make. I\u2019d say, for starters, pick an instrument to start with. If you don\u2019t plan to perform the music yourself live, you don\u2019t need to become incredibly skilled with it. However, learning to write music without an instrument can be very challenging for many. Picking an instrument If you want to write music for a lot of different instruments, I\u2019d recommend picking up the piano. You can learn on a keyboard (preferably weighed) if a piano is too expensive. There\u2019s lots of alternatives. Some are cheaper, some are very expensive. Why the piano? It\u2019s intuitive, all the notes are right there in front of you, it has percussive and rhythmic elements, you can play melody and harmony at the same time. Essentially, playing the piano you get rhythm, harmony and melody all at once. Not a whole lot of common instruments offer that. If you want to write songs for guitar, then picking up the guitar may be a good idea. Music theory Getting a hang of basic music theory is also a good idea. There\u2019s plenty of websites for that, such as Open Music Theory, which is an open-source text book, although it focuses heavily on contrapuntal writing. Otherwise, I\u2019d recommend picking up books on music theory. If you want to write for the orchestra, also pick up books on orchestration. Giving any specific recommendations on books here would be difficult without knowing what sort of music you\u2019d like to make, but feel free to ask if you need more specific directions. Finding a teacher Finding an instructor or teacher may also be a good idea, but it\u2019s not the only path and it\u2019s not always a viable option. If you can, however, I would strongly recommend it. What will take years without a teacher might take days with one, and no, that\u2019s not an exaggeration. I once taught someone something they\u2019d been confused about for years, and it took me a few hours. This isn\u2019t because you can\u2019t learn without a teacher, but rather because music composition is such a broad subject, finding the right information and finding it explained in a way that works for you can be surprisingly difficult. Conclusion Pick up an instrument. I\u2019d recommend the piano as a starting point. You can pick up something else later if you wish. However, if you have already have an instrument in mind, go for it.Study the basics of music theory, either online or via books. This won\u2019t teach you how to make music, but it\u2019ll make understanding music significantly easier, which will help you on your path to becoming a skilled musician.If viable, get a teacher, instructor or some kind of mentor figure.I wish you luck on your journey! :) You have a long path ahead of you.

            "answer_text": "Assuming you don\u2019t know how to play any instruments, your only alternative is to collaborate with someone that knows how to play an instrument. If you plan only writing lyrics, then your best bet is to arm yourself with tons of poetry. Read them constantly. If you decide to take it seriously, learn how to write poetry by seeking info on the internet on how to do so. Writing music, however, takes you through many levels of approach. If you can memorize melodies of songs already, you are on your way to be able to imagine or emulate melodies in your mind. This assumes you have an ear for differentiating notes and the rhythm of the notes. When I started writing music, I was learning to play the guitar. Once I learned several chords on the guitar, I will string them together to make my own chord progression. Out of the chords a melody would pop in my mind. Just by doodling on the instrument, you can arrive at a decent set of songs. But you\u2019ll have to write tons and tons of songs that way to arrive at something meaningful. On the other hand, you can obtain an inexpensive electric piano or synthesizer of some sort, and pluck out melodies that sounds pleasant to you then record it. This is the easiest approach. With a partner who knows an instrument, you can hum or \u201csing\u201d out the melody in mind and he/she will be able to replicate it on their instrument. In this case you are using your musical mind to come up with songs, which is the most preferable way to compose new music. You can start by remember melodies you like and then change a few notes in it. Keep changing notes of the melody in your mind until it develops into its own new melody. Then either pick out the notes on the piano or have your partner do it. In essence, what you are after is a new melody that is copyrightable. The chords that go along with it are just an embellishment . . . an arranger can do that for you if you are seeking a professional piece of music. In the end, if it is just a hobby, you need not go any further levels. But if the music bug hits you and you want to take it to a professional level, then you have to learn an instrument and learn about music theory. There is no escaping that. Arm yourself with music of artist you like and emulate those songs \u2014- enough to make them way different than its source. Eventually, original music will pop in your head without using other songs as your source. It will be like a surreal awakening. When that happened to me, I felt very powerful. I learned to use my mind to create original songs. ",

            "answer_text": "I suggest learning how to play an instrument and get at least a basic understanding of music theory. Although, it depends what type of music you are interested in. For example if you are interested in producing electronic music, you might not necessarily need to learn an instrument, but an understanding of music theory would come in handy. There are many youtube tutorials you can refer to if you are interested in electronic music. ",

You wouldn\u2019t try to write a book if you couldn\u2019t read a book. Right? Sure, you can download software that will write the song for you, but then that\u2019s not really \u201cwriting your own music\u201d. Is it? Take the time to learn to read. It will more than pay off in the long run. ",
