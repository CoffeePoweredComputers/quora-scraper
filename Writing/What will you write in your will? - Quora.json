I suppose, all my clothes and those old action figures and stuff I have go to my 1st cousin, (take care of it,) I have another first cousin, but it\u2019s a girl so probably wouldn\u2019t be interested. All my books? Probably to anyone who wants them. Nobody in my family reads much. I have one of those crystal rock things that I would split with my family to remember me by.  My money.. you mean that 100$ and my savings bonds? To my parents, won\u2019t help them much but oh well. I would leave my bible to my nana, because she would like it, being the big ol Christian she is. All my Clemson stuff goes to my Grandparents on my dad\u2019s side. I do save my goosebumps books for my mom, because she loved goosebumps as a kid. Those old cars and monster trucks that I hoard until they find another use? I give them to my moms best friends son, he loves them. I leave my Ds\u2019s and 3ds\u2019s to them as well, but give the Pok\u00e9mon games to my cousin. Anything Else, just let my parents do whatever with it. But also write a note to my friends telling them that i died, and I love them all, Thanks for reading, Your country boy, Forrest \ud83c\udf33 ",
