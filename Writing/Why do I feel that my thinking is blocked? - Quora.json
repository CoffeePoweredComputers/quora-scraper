            "answer_text": "At times our thinking does get blocked. It could be by our emotions, our subconscious not wanting us to think about that Situation etc. Other time our thinking becomes blocked because we are just too tired. We need to take a break, walk around, grab a cup of coffee, do something to clear our head and unblock our minds. Other times it\u2019s like with God and sinning. God will tell you don\u2019t do it, it\u2019s wrong, but as We keep doing it, we push back from God, desensitize ourselves from him talking to us and eventually he lets us have what we want, a sinful life without him. The same thing when there are things we do not want to deal with, hear or think about, we push them aside and push them aside, are mind makes up excuses, soon we believe the excuses and our thinking gets blocked. Often unconsciously. One pray to God for help. Then take a break, don\u2019t think about it for awhile, get involved in a different activity and then later come back to it with a fresh start. ",

            "answer_text": "There can be many reasons to this such as inappropriate sleep, overthinking, fear of future, work stress, lack of concentration power due to available disturbances and counting. Lack of sleep is one of the biggest reason to block thinking since the cognitive part of the brain is not able to process the incoming data perfectly. Now you must be thinking about \u201coverthinking\u201d. On one side, the person is not able to think and I\u2019m talking about overthinking. Overthinking happens when you try to imagine about things you don\u2019t get and to feel the pleasure of those things, we overthink. But one fact that we forget is that it shifts us away from the reality and we end up building our own parallel universe where things act according to us and hence don\u2019t let us think properly about the main idea. Once Shakespeare in his book Macbeth wrote \u201cfuture fears are more terrifying than present ones\u201d and is absolutely true. You can\u2019t predict what will happen in future and worrying about it is no less than wasting of time and energy. Your worries doesn\u2019t allow your brain to ponder on regular stuffs which diverts you. ",
