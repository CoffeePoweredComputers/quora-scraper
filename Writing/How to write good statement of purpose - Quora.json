            "answer_text": "Applying to graduate school is a complex and time-consuming process that requires lots of responsibility, effort and a whole set of different documents to let you get accepted to the desired institution. Letters of recommendation, resumes/CVs, test scores, cover letters, essays, etc. are essential for a good application but writing a Successful Statement of Purpose is of the greatest importance, indeed.  This paper can sufficiently increase your admission chances, especially if it\u2019s properly written. By presenting a powerful SoP, you\u2019ll be able to convince your readers (in this case, the admission committee of the university you\u2019re applying to) that you have a solid background (valuable experience in the chosen program, prominent achievements, useful skills and personal qualities necessary to succeed in the sphere you\u2019re aiming at) which will help you to stand out from the crowd of other candidates and show that you have a potential to become a great specialist. When you start writing your statement of purpose, don\u2019t forget to divide it into four parts and include the following points: Start by introducing yourself. Tell about your interests and things that motivated you to choose a particular program and institution, let the admission committee understand what sparked your desire to apply for graduate school.Sum up your previous academic career (meaning your undergraduate study): mention any research you\u2019ve conducted, important thesis papers or projects and your work experience (if it\u2019s related to the program you\u2019re applying to).Tell about your past or recent activities: tell what you\u2019ve learned and how it helped you to concentrate on getting into graduate school (but make sure that these activities are relevant to the speciality you\u2019ve picked).Describe your academic interests as well. In this part of your SoP you have to indicate what you\u2019d like to study at the university you\u2019re about to get in order to assure the admission committee that you\u2019re aware of the research scope in the desired discipline. When you\u2019re done with formulating all of the points mentioned in the list above, remember a few more things: since the admission committee read between the lines, make sure you let them understand how competent and self-motivated you are as a future graduate student; describe everything positively; always provide concrete examples, do not simply tell; be concise and manage your time right. Hope these tips will help you to reach your goal and get admitted into the university of your dream, good luck! ",
