            "answer_text": "Well the main factor is content creation. The audio created for a podcast can actually be repurposed in a number of ways: Uploaded with a splash screen as a YouTube video (also on other video sites)Transcribed into a blog postSharing RSS feed with multiple podcast directoriesThe benefits are crazy amazing. I\u2019m a new podcaster, and so far it\u2019s been easier and more fun than I could imagine. It also generates content. As I stated above, the content can be repurposed. So, while I\u2019m creating my shows, I\u2019m also spawning blog posts, videos, and new ideas for more shows. The spread of each piece of content is nearly endless. The sites include, but are not limited to: My websiteFacebookTwitterPinterestiTunesBlubrryPodbeanStitcherTumbrLinkedInSoundcloudCastboxAcastDSoundSteemitSo the benefits are massive. If you\u2019re a blogger, you\u2019re limited to posting your blog only to your website as not to be penalized for duplicate content. If you\u2019re a YouTuber, you\u2019re limited to video sites for the most part. Podcasting is a super versatile medium that allows you to spread your eggs into the most baskets. You can also monetize a podcast in multiple ways through sponsors, affiliate marketing, and advertising just to name a few. Then if you put it on your blog, you can further monetize using regular methods for blogger. Through YouTube, you can monetize your videos with AdSense. Other benefits include just the enjoyment of podcasting. The equipment and software are relatively inexpensive. There\u2019s no need to spend hundreds on a mic when you can get a decent one for under $100. You can start with your phone. Needless to say, I\u2019m a huge fan. ",
