            "answer_text": "A2A: If there was one really disastrous semester, and if there was a really good reason for it (had a baby, terrible illness during finals week, etc.) then maybe add one sentence to your SOP explaining that. Otherwise, I agree with the other answers here: don\u2019t highlight shortcomings that might not even be noticed, and that are clearly outliers from your overall performance. In our review process (in CMU\u2019s School of Computer Science), I often see comments from other evaluators like, \u201cThis guy got a C- in \u2018Algorithms and Data Structures\u2019 (a very central course for a CS person), but all his other CS grades are solid, and his research project shows that he has a solid working knowledge of this stuff. So that must just have been a bad week.\u201d So if the problem is not too egregious, we are prepared to notice and forgive a bad result or two. In your case, a 3.5/4 GPA would be a little bit low for a top program like ours, but not so low that an excellent research record and good letters could not overcome it. And one 3.0 semester is not too disgraceful as part of the overall package. I imagine that the standards in top OR programs are similar. All that said, if in the course of your bad semester you failed (or even got a C) in a course that is central to the gad program you are applying to, you really should make sure that you know this stuff, and do something on your record to show that you do \u2014 take and ace a follow-on course, use the material in some project, or whatever. That makes it much easier for the committee to give you the benefit of the doubt. Added later: Yes, as Loretta B DeLoggio suggests, if there is good reason to include an explanation, it sounds a lot better (less defensive) coming from from one of your letter writers than coming from you in the SOP.

If you attempted six difficult courses and got lower grades, the reader is likely to chuckle and say, \u201cWell, he learned his lesson,\u201d and continue reading the file. You should only explain if the person\u2019s going to be upset or confused: \u201cThree courses and D\u2019s in all of them?\u201d might require an explanation. Even so, it shouldn\u2019t be in the SOP. You can include a brief addendum, or one of your recommenders who knows you well could mention: \u201cRichard has generally been an excellent student; he really should have taken a leave of absence the semester he broke his leg, but he insisted on trying to continue with his classes. It may not have been the best judgment, but is evidence of the kind of dedication he shows.\u201d ",

Note that this can address one or two semesters but not a pattern of poor performance. Indeed, if it\u2019s just one semester, usually a committee will overlook it unless it was a key semester (e.g., the one semester when you took all the core courses in your subject). In general, one semester won\u2019t make or break an admission: there are lots of inputs and even the GPA is but one of them. In short: if you have a compelling argument, feel free to say it, but please keep it short. Note that, per my policy, I don\u2019t get into specifics of cases, so I\u2019m ignoring the details of the actual GPAs, etc. ",

For example, please, take a look if this web site has such features: Management Personal StatementJournalism and Mass Communication Personal StatementMedia and Communication Personal StatementBecause, if it does not have them, please, do not use its services, because you will be disappointed in the result which you will get at the end!
