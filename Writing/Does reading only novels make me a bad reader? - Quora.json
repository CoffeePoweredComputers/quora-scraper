            "answer_text": "I\u2019m pretty sure anyone who told you reading novels make you a bad reader, isn\u2019t pretty much a reader himself/herself. Reading various elements of literature is good, but so is reading and always reading novels. Personally I read everything, but having crawled through hundreds of novels through years, I can tell you it only makes you wiser and a better person every growing day. You get to imagine and live (little bit of) millions of characters, situations, geographic locations and climates. Over years feeding and living through these hundreds of characters, you kindle a much wiser and broad minded part of yourself. As others suggested, it\u2019s damn good for your brain as well. A thriller equips you with knowledge and caution, erotica gives you some mind blowing ideas for your own personal life, adventure wakes up a little bit of \u2018sleeping\u2019 you, etc etc. It\u2019s always a different kind of magic in the stale rusty smell of those novel\u2019s pages I can see at you coffee table. Grab them, they are good! ",

            "answer_text": "If you're reading for enjoyment, not aiming for some specific learning outcome, what you read doesn't really matter, as long as you're enjoying it! If you really want to broaden your range, maybe try reading blogs on subjects you're interested in. For example by people in the same \"walk of life\" as you, or a different group that you're curious about.I love novels, but I often read blogs for something quick and informative. I used to frequent, for example, http://psychologytoday.com as they have a huge range of articles on a multitude of psychology based topics, many of which I find interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "To wean yourself off novels you will need to give up your willing suspension of disbelief.  All you need to do to spoil the fun of a best-seller is to put yourself in the mind of the author, not that of the main character.  Anticipate what the author will have the character do next.  With time you'll become very good at this, but your enjoyment of reading most novels will have dwindled.    Instead of delivering yourself to the author of the novel expecting to be lulled into passivity, look for new, interesting things.  Keep score.  Grade authors by their Ideas Quotient.  Some non-fiction writers score very high on this form of IQ as well.  Short story writers get the ideas across without the padding. Later in life I have discovered a new form of reading in the consumption of  television programs available over the Internet. If it's a choice between True Detective and the most recent best-selling detective novel, I'll take the T.V. series because it's covering ground which is new to me.  Couples, Grey's Anatomy and Downton Abbey are unexpectedly fine reads. ",

But if you wanna try to read some books other than novelsyou\u2019d better know what kind of thing that can attract you, makes you curious and wants to know more about it, or what kind of topic which you think it's interesting?for example if you're a master in medicine stuff, you kinda enjoy and have a talent on it, so then you can try to start reading some articles or any book that talks about people's health.
