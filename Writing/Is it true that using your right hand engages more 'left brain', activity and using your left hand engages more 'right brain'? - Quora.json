            "answer_text": "Yes, but this does not mean as much as you may think it does. Using the right hand will activate *motor areas* in the left hemisphere, and using the left hand will activate *motor areas* in the right hemisphere. However, this will not affect other functions that are specialized in those hemispheres. And there are far fewer such functions than myths suggest. In particular, it is *not* true that the left hemisphere is \u2018logical\u2019 and the right hemisphere is \u2018creative\u2019. All complex intellectual activities, that could be called \u2018logical\u2019 or \u2018creative\u2019 or both, involve extensive interaction between multiple areas of both hemispheres. The main real differences in function between the two hemispheres are that in most people, the left hemisphere is mainly responsible for language and the right hemisphere for visual-spatial skills. But you will not increase or activate verbal skills by using the right hand, or visual-spatial skills by using the left hand. ",
