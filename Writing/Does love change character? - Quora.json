            "answer_text": "I don't think it changes your character. I believe that when our love is flowing it brings about change and creativity. When we incarnated into this earthly life.. We came with open minds and open hearts. Just look at a baby and you will see this. It's the experiences we undertake while in this open state that changes aspects of our lives. We don't even know we are doing this. After All we are but children. These aspects start to play out in our adulthood. You chose your character before you incarnated. Hope this helps. Much love.. ",

            "answer_text": "With time? Yes. Like all good things and bad, change plays it's part and I must admit it only plays too well. It could mean differently to different people. More often than not love starts to demand where as it should preserve, be vast instead of being confined and only then, it has a chance to blossom. Besides, in the long run your love changes direction and is shown in the little things, flows in each other's comfort and stillness, not in the grandeur and the passion with which it all began. With time, (truer) love changes in character but only to get richer and serene. ",

To act in love is to act in a positive manner, and to act in a positive manner is to open yourself to a whole new world of freedom and positive energy coming back to you from the universe. Always act in love. ",
