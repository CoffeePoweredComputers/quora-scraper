            "answer_text": "Some tips for writing horror are to research neurology to ascertain a thorough understanding of the physiology of emotional attachment, because novelty is the key to successful horror writing. As astonishing as it may seem, even now in the twenty-first century there are many subjects that have yet to be touched upon, many angles of approach which thus far remain unexplored in the bewitching medium of horror writing. When you have become adept with the physiology of emotional attachment, research separation anxiety. You can evolve characters with whom your audience becomes emotionally attached, then subliminally alter your plot to deprive readers of those whom you have caused them to love, thus creating a deeply rooted psychological horror which readers don\u2019t readily perceive consciously, yet of which they are blatantly aware at the subconscious level. Indirect horror which isn\u2019t entirely understood is the most horrifying horror of all, yet you will win a greater following of adoring loyal readers by fleshing out your horror with meticulous detail, as long as each explanation you provide leads to another mystery. You have the macabre option to apply your understanding of emotional attachment and separation anxiety to a sinister brooding character, male or female, who has become drunk on the power and international recognition of being awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his or her profound advancements in the growing field of neurosurgery. We\u2019ll call this psychotic genius, Borgnine. This devious neurological prodigy has a private gated compound in a remote wilderness region where, in a personal modern fully-equipped medical laboratory, Borgnine performs brain surgery on those unsuspecting victims lured to the compound under insidiously false pretenses of nature therapy. Before performing the neurological alterations on the physical encephalon of the unwitting pledges, Borgnine gives them an injection of insulin to induce temporary diabetic coma. Waking from the artificially triggered coma, the horrified test subjects find themselves locked in a sensory deprivation chamber, a gruesome psychoemotional tactic aimed at achieving a state of utterly diabolical separation anxiety. These steps - Borgnine has formulated in a vicious mind control plot - are necessary prior to the evil brain surgery in order to effect the desired result of intense emotional attachment (and therefore complete submission) to their depraved megalomaniac captor, the violently feared cult leader, Doctor Borgnine. Make sure you are well-briefed on Subproject 69, the mind control experiment covertly funded by the CIA and headed by Professor D. Ewen Cameron during MKULTRA. Verse yourself definitively in poisons such as Dead Man\u2019s Bells, and lethal narcotic injections which can escape notice in post-mortem examination toxicology screens, id est, potassium chloride. Here are some additional tips for writing terrifying horror. Be proficient in knowledge of real life horror, exempli gratia, in 1956 Minamata city Kumamoto prefecture, Japan, a worried mother brought her five-year-old little girl into Chisso Corporation\u2019s chemical factory hospital. Physician\u2019s were at a loss to explain the helpless child\u2019s symptoms - difficulty standing, inhibited speech, seizures. In the shadowy wake of the girl\u2019s mysterious illness, crows dropped dead from the sky while bloated fish carcasses floated belly-up on the surface of the bay. Shortly thereafter, the medical facility was swamped with victims of what was labeled Strange Disease, or cat dancing sickness, due to the bizarre behavior of felines that staggered off the docks to drown in the dark water of the murky bay. Months of research into the cause of the inexplicable epidemic finally revealed that waste-water runoff from the Chisso chemical factory had contaminated the bay with high levels of heavy metals such as manganese, selenium, thallium, and mercury. The causative agent was determined to be a highly toxic organic mercury compound, methylmercury, that had bioaccumulated in seafood eaten by Minamata city inhabitants, resulting in poisoning of the local populace. The mortality rate was shockingly high - 36.7%. By some estimates, over two thousand victims died gruesome agonizing deaths due to irreparable damage to their central nervous system before the flow of pollutants from the industrial chemical factory was stemmed. Early in the spring of 1993, Milwaukee area emergency rooms were inundated with patients suffering from extreme watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, dehydration, fever, and vomiting. A disease of unknown origin was spreading like wildfire throughout the panic-stricken population. Before the tragically fatal outbreak was over, 400,000 people would be infected, 69 of whom died. The culprit was a deadly microorganism, cryptosporidium, a nasty parasite found in raw sewage. The insidious public health hazard managed to pass through a water treatment facility to reach homes throughout the horrified city, resulting in the largest outbreak of waterborne disease in recorded US history. Certain conspiracy theorists allege that these grievous catastrophes were no accident, having been planned and executed (as experiments for engineering weapons of mass destruction) upon unsuspecting control groups clandestinely selected by an unnamed power-mongering faction of the Corporate Controlled Military Industrial Complex. With these advantageous tips you\u2019ll be on your way to writing horror that will chill the spines and terrorize the minds of your growing following of devout readers. ",

            "answer_text": "There are all sorts of things people are going to suggest, and a lot of them are pretty good. As Mr. Collier said: Horror and Gore are two very different things. How much actual gore was in the first Alien movie? One major splash of blood and bits? The other candidate is Ash, but that was a robot full of milk. And yet it\u2019s still the most terrifying movie of the series. IF you have a \u2018monster\u2019 of some kind\u2026 DON\u2019T SHOW OFF. Pull a One Ring deal with it: \u201cKeep it hidden. Keep it safe.\u201d Save the appearance for when it will have the most solid, hard-core impact. Maybe the reader shouldn\u2019t even KNOW if there\u2019s a monster or not. Does the reader ever get to see the real monster at all? Are we sure it\u2019s really gone? On a related note: Sometimes it\u2019s okay for the monster to be gone. Having some \u201ctell\u201d at the end that gives away to the reader \u201coh, it escaped/survived/wasn\u2019t there/was in the other person/etc.\u201d actually ends up being a REALLY cheap way of leaving an opening for a sequel. If you\u2019re bringing the monster back in another story, leave the opening for it to have survived, and know how, but DON\u2019T TELL THE READER. At all. The smart ones will have it hit them that the creature might have escaped if you write it well, but mostly, people won\u2019t catch on until a big, dramatic reveal in the sequel. (I\u2019m not going to dump hard rules, as I rarely subscribe to many, but\u2026 don\u2019t try this on your first story unless you have concrete evidence that you can get it RIGHT) Jump Scares Don\u2019t Work That Well In Books. . Unique isn\u2019t actually a strictly doable thing anymore. About every combination of ideas has popped up somewhere in some form at some point. Don\u2019t struggle clear off the deep end looking for something \u201cnew\u201d, but try to re-purpose old ideas in new ways to make something truly good (half the time, my writing is done because I see something and think \u201cI could write that better\u201d). If you do write something better, make sure it\u2019s different enough from the original. Do things different. Make YOUR characters, because humans are FAR more variable than story plots, and will drive things in very different directions (also, we\u2019re ALL sick of the big, tough, white, male, American Marine with stubble and surly sarcasm). The Hero doesn\u2019t have to die\u2026 but it can help. It might be more interesting to have them go bonkers or something, or just straight-up survive (psychological trauma does leave mental damage though, so they aren\u2019t going to go marching happily into the next situation without changes). Don\u2019t kill characters without need. Make their deaths worth it. Make them mean something to the story. Pointless deaths have their own place, and can still have worth To The Story if you do it right, but a pointless death for no other reason than to show off that the monster has a karate action arm is just Showing Off (see above).
