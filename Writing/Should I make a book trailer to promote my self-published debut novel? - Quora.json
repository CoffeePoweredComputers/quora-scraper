            "answer_text": "As someone who produced book trailers for my clients early on (starting in 2002), it might surprise you that my answer is \u201cNo.\u201d But it\u2019s precisely because of my experience that I say this. The disconnect is that novels are a medium of words while videos are a medium of images. Think of it conversely: Which would more likely excite you to see Black Panther or another new film\u2026 a video trailer or a written description of the movie? Additional detriments: Book trailers just don\u2019t translate into sales most of the time. There\u2019s no evidence to the contrary from my experience or elsewhere. If you have the means to make one for fun, not for sales, then go for it. But unless it\u2019s really good, you actually have a greater chance of hurting your sales than even having zero influence.They\u2019re very rarely done well. Either the production value or the artistry tends to fall way short, and often both. Keep in mind that the public has become extremely used to seeing high-level Hollywood trailers, music videos, and extras like the \u201cmaking of\u201d documentaries on DVDs. It is really hard to compete with the visual expectation these have created.For a novel trailer, you start to visually create the world the reader is normally left to imagine. This may not seem like a big deal, but part of the magic and connection between a reader and a novel is that the reader visually creates the fictional world they\u2019re experiencing through your words. Unless your trailer is extremely abstract, it tends to ruin this magic. This is exemplified to some extent by the public\u2019s reaction to a major novel when it\u2019s released as a film \u2014 inevitably, some (sometimes many) readers are very disappointed with how certain characters are portrayed or who portrays them. This is because the readers had already created the image of those characters in their minds. (This can certainly be true of settings and other elements as well.) Even if the author feels it to be 100% accurate, it doesn\u2019t matter because the readers are already invested in what their imaginations brought to the story.All that said, I\u2019m mostly referring to trailers for novels. These can work well for non-fiction books, but then I don\u2019t really consider them \u201ctrailers.\u201d Usually, the good ones are not really done in a trailer-type way, so to me they\u2019re just promotional videos.

            "answer_text": "I confess I don\u2019t get the point of book trailers. They NEVER look professional, they NEVER convey much of import about the book, and unless you pay far more money than you\u2019re going to get in return almost no one will see them outside your book promotion group full of other self-promoting authors who will never buy your book because they\u2019re busy selling theirs. I have seen exactly ONE good commercial for a book. It was by James Patterson, who obviously has a budget for these things, and it was one of his simplest ones. He\u2019s sitting on a stool in front of a plain background, holds up his latest book, and says \u201cBuy my new book, or I\u2019ll kill [series protagonist] Alex Cross.\u201d Taking your main character hostage? Now that\u2019s funny and attention-grabbing. (I still didn\u2019t buy the book. That brings the total of books I\u2019ve purchased because of trailers/commercials to\u2026still zero. And I buy lots of books. I own over 2000 at this point.) ",

            "answer_text": "I see that others don\u2019t prefer them, however I do. The biggest issue I find is that most authors expect their book trailers to translate into sales and they don\u2019t. Once that expectation is out of the way, the trailer changes from being a sales tool to an awareness tool. A big part of an author book marketing is in getting themselves and their noticed. People can\u2019t buy books they don\u2019t know exist! By using your book trailer as a part of your branding and author identification, you can build awareness of yourself and your books. There are many places on the internet where you can place your trailers but you need your tribe of followers that you should have already built to push your book sales. Your book trailer will give someone interested an idea of what your book is about especially before you\u2019ve acquired a bunch of reviews. They can help you get your name/book title listed in the Google search engines. If you have the knowledge and skill to create them yourself fine, otherwise have them done professionally. Just as a bad book cover will hurt your book, a bad trailer won\u2019t do you any good either. The issue isn\u2019t so much the trailers as how you use them and what you expect from them. They are not a magic bullet that is going to make your book fly off book shelves. Remember that book marketing is marketing not selling. Nobody wants to be sold. Promote your book to bring awareness and interest to it and if you have filled the needs and wants of your readers, they will buy your book. ",

You have to spend a lot of effort to drive traffic to the video - and then you have to drive that traffic to the sales page. It\u2019s a tall order in today\u2019s attention deprived environment.OTOH, you can create short videos of snippets and tips from your book and post them to your blog, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube. You can shoot these with your desktop computer or iPhone. I think that would have more impact, and be more useful to your potential readers.Good luck! ",

Your resources would be better spent learning and practicing the art of micro-marketing. and no, I don\u2019t know how to do it. But there are authors out there who do. Selling books the indie way is a very intensive process. There is a lot involved. Learn about that instead. Chances are, your book trailer is going to disappear into oblivion and no one with watch it or buy your book. just sayin\u2019 but good luck! ",
