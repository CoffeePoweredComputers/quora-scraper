            "answer_text": "An essay is a formal writing sample of a given topic composed of multiple paragraphs.  The largest difference between the two types of writing is that the essay usually involves more preparation work.  Traditional essays involve five paragraphs, in which the first serves as an introduction and includes a thesis statement- a critical idea that defines the purpose of the paper. By contrast, a paragraph is shorter and by virtue of this does not have as many requirements.  There is a topic sentence to open the paragraph that defines its purpose and the remaining sentences in the paragraph serve to support and enhance that topic sentence.  If you want to think of it in a comparative way, the topic sentence is the thesis statement of a paragraph.   ",
