            "answer_text": "I am not an established journalist, but I have had experiences that could very well have lead me towards journalism had I not chosen to switch careers. To answer your questions, I did undertake internships in print and broadcast journalism. These are indispensable if you want to pursue a career in journalism. The more you undertake (within reason, you can\u2019t live on unpaid internships all your life), the better it is for you. But it is not just about quantity. As you go on your internships, make sure you have the chance to really exercise whatever skills you have acquired during your course. I was lucky enough to attend a university with a very strong journalism programme that emphasised practical skills in media production (print, broadcast, and online) and news research. Many of our tutors (we called them tutors, not professors) were professional journalists themselves. And yes, luck does make a big difference. It is especially the case if you are ambitious enough to seek a position at a major news organisation or want to take on international journalism or war reporting. Luck will determine if you can meet important persons in the field of journalism that you would like to pursue. Networking events where important persons in your chosen field of journalism will be present do not happen every day. I was lucky to meet figures such as Janine di Giovanni at the World Press Freedom Day conference hosted by UNESCO. Those kind of experiences allow you to connect with important figures in journalism and are learning experiences outside a classroom. As far as education goes, you might be able to get away with not going to university to study journalism. But that depends on your ambitions. Do you want to be a reporter on your local newspaper, radio station, or TV channel? You can start out as a cub reporter and work your way up to whatever position you choose. If you want to work for a more prestigious news organisation or go beyond local and regional journalism, then I highly doubt you will be able to get a foot in without a degree in journalism/communication/media.

            "answer_text": "I started as a print journalism major at university but graduated with an emphasis in photojournalism (the closest thing we had to a photojournalism degree). I got as much experience as I could during my student years, including working as a writer for an entertainment monthly magazine, the university magazine and as a staff photographer and photo editor at the daily student newspaper. I got a semester-long photography internship at a local daily newspaper. I should have gotten at least one more internship and wish I had. Then I was out. Out of university, out in the real world. I had the choice to keep working as a freelance stringer at the newspaper I had interned at or to take a full-time job at a weekly newspaper in a small town where my duties would include both writing and photography. Knowing that hard way eventually gets easier and is usually the better choice, I opted for the latter. I did that for a year, paying my dues and working 80 hours a week. Why would I take a job at a weekly instead of regular contract work at a daily newspaper? Because my goal was to push myself and shoot everything I possibly could rather than just the random assignment that came my way that the staff photographers couldn\u2019t do. I only worked there for a year, but it was exactly the push I needed. I ended up freelancing for a couple of years then\u2014interrupted by a three-year stretch of living and working as a teacher and freelance photographer in Korea, Japan and Russia\u2014and then had a huge amount of experience that landed me my first staff photojournalist position at a small daily newspaper in Utah. That turned into a photo editor/chief photographer position. After that, I had the resume and the portfolio to get jobs at progressively larger newspapers in Arizona, Washington and Maine. I look back and a few things helped me become an established journalist: the willingness to embrace opportunities that exposed me to different environments and skills (writing, living in small towns and foreign countries). I was willing to do things that other up-and-coming photographers weren\u2019t willing to do, and it helped me. Number two: I didn\u2019t give up easy and I stayed positive. Basically, I was relentless when it came to going after a photo, or a story, or a job and although things didn\u2019t always work out like I wanted, they almost always worked out well ultimately as long as I kept moving forward and stayed positively focused on my goals. Especially these days, there is no \u2018established\u2019 path to becoming an established journalist. You will need a university degree, and perhaps an advance degree too. But that\u2019s just the entrance price. To really earn your career and have longevity you\u2019ll need to constantly work to improve yourself and be open to opportunities. Do that, and you\u2019ll go far. ",
