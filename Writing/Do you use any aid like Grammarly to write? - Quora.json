            "answer_text": "No, I don\u2019t. So I can\u2019t comment on whether Grammarly is any good. I haven\u2019t used Microsoft\u2019s grammar check for years because it objected to sentences in the passive voice and sentences with multiple sub-clauses, both of which are necessary in academic and scientific writing. It may have improved since I last tried it. I was taught grammar at school and grew up writing by hand and then with a typewriter; I only started using a computer for writing when doing my university undergraduate degree dissertation. I do use a spellchecker and have set it up so that it will automatically correct words I habitually get wrong. ",
