            "answer_text": "It\u2019s your own choice. For things like romance novels, it\u2019s usually best to focus mainly upon emotions, expressions, what they think, etcetera. When writing action novels, suspense, horror, superhero, etcetera, it just depends. Sometimes, too much description can be a bad thing. It takes away the audience\u2019s imagination and their stuck reading the story in a two dimensional figure, where as if you describe some things, but leave some gaps here and there, that enables viewers to use their imagination. You see, that allows them to while yes, follow that story, they can imagine things easier because you didn\u2019t describe everything and leave them to be bored and just gaze through it. When I write my stories, I leave some details out for the audience to create themselves, so they have much more fun with it. For example, instead of, \u201cHis moves were lightning fast, punching through needles of rain through the bellowing storm above, his fist soon colliding with his adversary. He felt his adrenaline pulsate, his eyes twitching with mere hatred, his lips quivering. He threatened to level him like gravel upon the concrete roof that shook so violently below them, and with herculean strength, the two leaped through the haze of rain and smashed like stones, continuing to fight until the other gave up in defeat.\u201d While yes, I made that up on the spot, I focused too much on like, six seconds of the fight, whereas if I write it like the better example below, I cover much more of the story while still making it interesting, but I don\u2019t drown out the audience and leave myself getting more bored when I type three paragraphs for say, twenty seconds of a fight. Better example, \u201cDuring the onslaught of rain that ensued between the two combatants, they battled, not without countering their attacks and striking each other, swiftly with moves that had been passed down by their masters. They would kick, punch, jab, and grunt, whether being hit or delivering the strike. They continued, the storm groaning in distress. One swing was countered, and than the next, followed by a series of fighting maneuvers that were executed in a blur.\u201d Now I know it didn\u2019t seem like it, but I actually covered way more in example 2 than example 1, yet I still sprinkled some big words in their and descriptive moments, though it was lengthened significantly. Overall, you really can just do what you want only if you\u2019re reading it or a friend is too, but if you plan on publishing it, try not to fill it with nothing but words most people won\u2019t even understand. Hope this helped! Cheers! :) ",

            "answer_text": "I like just enough description to provide context for the characters' moods, actions and motivations, and the story. For instance, if a character lives in New York City, they'll likely interact with the world differently than somebody who lives in Greenland. And since many readers will not live in New York City or Greenland, a short description of the sights, sounds, and smells of the environment helps us to understand how a character relates to the world and how they might act in certain situations or what kind of situations they might logically find themselves in. Similarly, characters at a funeral taking place on a hot, sunny, humid day will likely feel and behave somewhat differently than if the day is raining and cold.Of course, in some stories the environment is actually a character in the story (e.g. some of Jack London's work) and you need a description to understand its character. I think some authors write a lot of description because they think they have to or because they love the setting and want to communicate it to their readers. In the latter case, they might be better writing a travelogue.My rule of thumb about reading description is that if I notice it -- that is, if it sort of sticks out and distracts me -- I just skip it. In the last 10 years or so, I've noticed that I've become a lot more ruthless about skipping stuff. ",
