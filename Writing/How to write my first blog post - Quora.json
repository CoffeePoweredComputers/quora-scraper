            "answer_text": "I will answer this question based on my own experience. When I decided to blog, I chose my niche, which is relationship. I got a very nice theme, very unique. Put up everything needed, from about page to contact, privacy and all that. Boom! It was time to make my first appearance. The problem here wasn't that, I don't know what to write but I didn't know which one to start with, haha. Every research I touched, talked about introduction but I wasn't comfortable publishing just introduction because I was shy talking about myself. I wasn't too sure if people will love to open my blog just to read about me. So, I went straight to a particular topic within my niche, but I chose a neutral topic, I didn't go too deep into my niche. Here's the link: 21 TYPES OF PEOPLE YOU DON'T NEED IN YOUR LIFE - Relationship Star Blog I treated the topic very deeply. So, at the end, I decided to insert an introductory of myself and the blog, and it worked for me. People liked it and I was comfortable as well not talking about myself alone. I used one bullet to kill two birds. Meaning, I introduced myself at the same time, dived into my niche. But, there's a trick. After about two months of blogging, I decided to pull out my introduction from that initial post. Now, I'm more comfortable and relaxed. I can now comfortably talk about myself. I've gotten an audience who are ready to read whatsoever I post. I extracted the intro and made it an independent post. And people loved it too, even though some of them read it before. Although, I edited it and made it come out finer. Here's the link: Welcome to My First Blog Post - Relationship Star Blog Now, I've fulfilled all rules. So, you can decide to do it my way or your own way, haha. The most important thing is for you to engage your readers. I'm still learning and very open for professional advice from the experts. ",

Starting with the first post can be tricky, if you want an analogy I would say it\u2019s just like the first impression of someone you meet, naturally it should be good enough for a second date, so in context of the blog it should tell the reader a little about your personality, about what motivates you to start the blog and about your uniqueness in context of your content and also it should give a glimpse of your creativity. I would propose to make it an introductory one as to what you will be sharing in the future posts and how it can add value to others reading it.
