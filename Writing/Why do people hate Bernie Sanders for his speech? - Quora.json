            "answer_text": "If anyone hates anyone for what their political views are they personally have a real problem. There is too much emotion and feelings in politics today. It\u2019s why people are treating each other so badly and giving them justification for hate. Politics should be discussed and debated and if no consensus can be reached agree to disagree and move on. Bernie Sanders has a left of the left progressive purview. He wants to change this country in so many different directions that it won\u2019t be recognizable from what we have today. People don\u2019t like it and as they have free speech they make no bones about it. I actually like Bernie\u2019s style and his passion but I don\u2019t like most of his ideas. He doesn\u2019t either or he wouldn\u2019t be a millionaire with three houses and he wouldn\u2019t be traveling in first class or private jet. He would give most of his money to the poor, sell two of his houses and give his money to the poor and only travel by train or with the rest of us schleps in coach to save the planet. ",
