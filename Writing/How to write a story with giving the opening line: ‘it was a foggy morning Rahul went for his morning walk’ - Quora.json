            "answer_text": "\u2018it was a foggy morning Rahul went for his morning walk\u2019? Well, you can\u2019t use it like that. It\u2019s not grammatically correct. It\u2019s actually two sentences, but it should be condensed into one correct one, imho: Rahul walked through the foggy morning. You see? Remove the repetition of \u2018morning,\u2019 and get rid of the unnecessary pronoun \u2018it\u2019 and weak linking verb \u2018was.\u2019 In order to go on from there to create a story, there has to be a Problem in that fog. Rahul should walk into his Inciting Incident as soon as possible. Don\u2019t make the walk in the fog unimportant to the plot\u2014if we\u2019re going to watch him walk in the fog, the problem should occur in the fog or the opening line and even opening scene is unnecessary. Rahul must have a believable motivation to engage that problem and try to find a solution (rather than running away or ignoring it.) As Rahul moves through the sensory world you\u2019re describing, let us get to know him\u2014let us see the problem, and in seeing it and how Rahul acts toward it, get to know his motivation and his world view. Make sure there\u2019s a reason why we\u2019re reading about Rahul and that problem in the fog. Make sure that Rahul\u2019s fight with that problem in the fog is resolved in some way. There\u2019s nothing worse than a story that just peters out without resolution, imho. ",

            "answer_text": "Define your genre, decide who is Rahul, what is his role in the story, and create at least a general idea for the ending. The genre defines what you will write. In a romance Rahul can be a happy or a broken-hearted lover this foggy morning. It is important to have a strong start. It is more important to have a strong finish. I believe knowing where you want to end gives you a direction for the story. It can pull you back when something sends you in a new direction. The ending should always satisfy the readers questions about the characters. Hence, no dangling plot lines. After you finish your story, edit out the unnecessary scenes. Good editing is how you end up with a good story. ",
