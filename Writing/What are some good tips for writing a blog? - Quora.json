            "answer_text": "Writing a blog can be a simple, enjoyable, and profitable adventure. Here are some of the best blog writing tips I\u2019ve discovered while building the #1 blog in my niche over the past five years\u2026 If possible, write about something you know and understand well. When it comes to blogs, there\u2019s a lot of noise out there. Meaning there are a zillion blogs, all competing for the same people\u2019s attention. But the good news for you is that most of them are just noise. Meaning, they give weak, generic information. Most are just copying other people\u2019s blog posts, just changing the words around here and there (and some don\u2019t even put that amount of effort in). This is where it pays to write about something you know and understand well\u2026 If you decide to write about something you don\u2019t know much about, you basically have no choice but to copy what others are doing. When you write about something you know well, you can discuss original thoughts that others aren\u2019t discussing. This helps you stand out.If you aren\u2019t an expert at anything, do this instead... This is an exception to tip #3: If you don\u2019t feel like you know anything well enough to have your own individual perspective on it, that\u2019s okay \u2014 you can make up for that by learning about the thing you want to write about. And you don\u2019t necessarily need to wait years to become an expert \u2014 it may sound weird but you can be a beginner and an expert at the same time. For example, I\u2019ve spent the past couple of months learning how to play the guitar. While I\u2019m obviously not an expert on the subject, I am an expert on being at the stage I\u2019m at right now! I can probably teach someone the basics of guitar as well as any expert, and maybe better when you consider that it\u2019s been many years since an expert had to learn guitar, whereas I\u2019m doing it right now. So feel free to dive into something and then write about it. We all have to start somewhere.Read your competitors\u2019 blogs (but not for the reason you might think). Remember when I said most bloggers are all just copying each other, and repackaging the same old content in slightly different words? Well, let them do that, because you\u2019re going to do something different. Instead of reading related blogs to find content to steal, you\u2019re going to do the opposite: You\u2019ll read your competitors\u2019 blogs to find out what they aren\u2019t doing. What information are they failing to cover? Did they write an article that\u2019s boring but dry, on a topic you could make much more interesting (perhaps by including a personal story)? Do you have a unique perspective on a topic that no one else has covered? For example, when I read other freelancers\u2019 blogs, I noticed that many of them (for some weird reason) advised against using freelancing sites (e.g. Upwork, Guru, Fiverr, etc) to get clients. So I wrote a post about how I\u2019d earned over $100,000 on Upwork in just 12 months. This was totally different from anything else out there, helping me stand out and get lots of attention and readers.Teach people something useful. Some people treat their blog like a public diary \u2014 again that can be interesting but it doesn\u2019t set you up for success. To understand why, think about a \u201cdiary\u201d blog vs. a blog that teaches people something useful\u2026 When you teach people something useful they will place a very high value on you, and the information you\u2019re sharing on your blog. When they value you highly they\u2019ll keep coming back, sharing your content with their friends, and helping you grow your blog\u2019s popularity.Simplify something complicated. One of the best ways to teach people something useful is to take something complicated, and make it simple. See the thing is, there are a lot of good blogs out there that are written by experts, but experts tend to make things complicated, whereas most blog readers are looking for simplified answers to their questions/issues/challenges. For example, one of my most popular blog posts is called How to Become a Copywriter Quickly with No Experience, No Portfolio, and No Degree. I wrote that post because I saw that other bloggers were offering difficult, complicated, ambiguous, and time consuming paths to becoming a copywriter \u2014 whereas I came up with a much simpler solution. The hundreds of comments at the bottom of the post echo that my theory was 100% correct.Stick to one topic per post. This is related to the idea of keeping things simple. Remember, it can be tempting to try to cram everything you know into each post, especially if you have a lot of knowledge on a subject and are eager to teach people something about it. But there is such a thing as packing a post with too much information. For example, I once wrote a post called 5 surprising truths about how to charge \u2014 and get \u2014 what you\u2019re worth. There\u2019s a ton I could have written around this subject, but I stuck to the title and kept it tight. People loved it. On the other hand, adding too much information to the post could have made it long and rambling, and no one likes reading someone else\u2019s rambling.Include screenshots/images when possible. Adding images to your blog is an easy and free way to add flair and depth to your posts. They also break up the text, making it easier to read the longer posts. My blog posts generally contain plenty of screenshots and images, and I don\u2019t even have to pay for the images because I get them for free from flickr Creative Commons.Do simple keyword research. One of the best ways to get people to read your blog is to write articles that match what people are already googling (words people type into google are known as keywords, or keyword search phrases). For example, if you google \u201cbest copywriting books\u201d, the first search result you\u2019ll see is a blog post I wrote that perfectly matches that topic. Now, how did I know people were using that keyword search phrase? I figured it out using this simple keyword research tool. Tools like this are easy to use, and can give you hundreds of ideas for topics that directly match what people are searching for, boosting your blog\u2019s visibility.Tell stories. Sharing your knowledge through blog posts is great, but it\u2019s even better if you can mix in stories. People love stories. They\u2019re entertaining, and they make your blog content more impactful, more memorable, and more engaging \u2014 stories just have a way of drawing people in in a way that dry facts alone can\u2019t do. You can tell short stories, like I did here. Or you can tell longer stories, like this post where I discuss 5 times I quit my job. You can even use mini-stories as introductions to teaching posts, as I did in this post.Include helpful links. Did you notice that I\u2019ve included links to tools, resources, and examples that add usefulness and depth to this post? Chances are you did notice, and I\u2019m guessing you found them helpful as well. This is an easy way to make your posts 10x better, without doing any extra work.Don\u2019t sweat the small stuff. Many people obsess over small details, like how long their posts should be, how often they should write, how to promote their posts on social media, how to write the perfect headline, and so on. I don\u2019t think too much about any of those things. I\u2019ve written long posts, short posts, and medium posts; I\u2019ve written consistently at times, sporadically at other times; and I don\u2019t do any fancy promotion. I simply focus on writing great content people love, and let the chips fall where they may. Because my content is solid, the chips always fall in all the right places!Just write. If you\u2019ve followed some of the tips above, and still aren\u2019t sure what to write, just start writing. Don\u2019t worry about whether or not you have something interesting to say, exactly what topic you should be writing about, or any of those things \u2014 just write something! Why? Because the act of writing itself will help you clarify your thoughts. I threw away my first dozen or so posts (maybe more), because I didn\u2019t think they were interesting, and half of them were so unfocused that I barely knew what I was trying to say at all. But, by going down that path, I was able to clarify what I wanted to say, come up with more interesting ideas, and so on. Just give yourself permission to write, without judging it.",

            "answer_text": "How do you start a blogging business? I like your question because you phrased the question the right way. You said \u201cblogging business\u201d. You're definitely on the right path. A lot of people ask the question \u201cHow do I start blogging?\u201d or \u201cHow do I blog for money?\u201d or \u201cHow much money can I earn with blogging?\u201d While those are important questions, they highlight the mindset of the people who ask them. They're looking at just something extra that they do on the side to make extra money. Let me tell you, if you really want to make real money, and I'm talking about replacing your day job's income and then some, treat blogging as a business. Your question is definitely on the right track. With that said, here's how you start a blogging business. Step #1: Treat it like a business If you treat something like a business, this means that you're gonna schedule a few hours every single day, all day, every day, for that activity. This is important. In fact, it is foundational. If you want to succeed in the dog eat dog world of blogging, you have to treat it like a business. This also means willingness to invest. Now I understand that a lot of people who start a blog don't have any money. Believe me, I started that way. But here's the thing. Once you start getting money, you have to reinvest a decent chunk of that back into your blogging business so you can grow. In other words, make your money work for you. That's how investments work. If you look at your blog as essentially just a source of extra income which you just spend immediately, your blog is not gonna grow. You have to reinvest your income into your blog. That's a critical part of treating your blog as a business. Step #2: Be business minded when picking the right audience When putting a blog together, you have to think about audiences. In other words, is the audience that you're trying to reach already existing? Do they already hang out at certain parts of the internet? Do they talk about certain things? Well, go there and find these topics so you can lock in on an existing community. It's so much better to come up with a blog that appeals to an existing community than to build a community around a new topic. Step #3: Make sure your topic is commercial enough and can manage its competition A lot of blogs basically start out dead in the water. They blog about things that everybody else is blogging about and the bloggers behind these enterprises wonder why they failed. This is not rocket science. If you notice that there's already a lot of competition for the topic that you want to talk about, move on. Find something else. Also, make sure that you talk about something that people will pay money for. If you're interested in dwarf gym socks and there's no market for that, don't be surprised if your bank account shows a grand balance of zero. Again, this is not rocket science. Whatever it is you're blogging on has to have decent demand, manageable levels of competition and a high enough commercial value. Otherwise, you're just wasting your time. Step #4: Make sure your blog builds on winning materials How do you know a piece of content is going to be successful? How do you know that people are gonna search for it, like it, share it and otherwise fall in love with it? Actually, it's very simple. Look for content that people already like and improve on them. It's that simple. That content must obviously be within your niche. But if you're able to just reverse engineer what already works and share it in those channels, you get nice traffic. Step #5: Get ready to outsource Blogging is no joke. If you want to be successful, you have to treat it like a business. The good news is once you start making money off your blog, you don't have to do everything yourself. Start outsourcing theme design, technical stuff, bits and pieces of your content and then eventually, your content and updates. When you do this, you get more time and energy to focus on what really counts. What really counts when it comes to the blogging business? Strategy. That's how you get ahead. That's how you beat the competition. Start treating your blog as a business and it will treat you really well. ",
