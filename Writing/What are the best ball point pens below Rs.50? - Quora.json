            "answer_text": "Top pens which I have tested and reviewed are given below and are outstanding in performance are :- 1)Montex Mega top This one of the best low cost ball pens I have come across . Has one of the best and consistent writing capacity . Ink lasts long,hoses a clear cap and body and cap has a metal clip . The grip is really solid and is good and is non-slippery . The only problem is if the pen is used rough the clip comes off and also be careful to cap the pen because the tip is a bit sensitive than other but I recommend it the most .(cost is 10 rs ) 2)Linc Glycer One the most durable low cost pen out there . Writes really smooth and quick and also there is a rubber grip and the body and cap is made of clear plastic . Also the clip of the cap might break is extreme cases but , I recommmd this pen also due to its solid performance .only problem is that the name of pen is written more like slycer than glycer but is easy to find in any store .(cost is 10rs) 3)Rorito I-skate It is much smoother than silkina and is a very fine preforming pen . You will pat yourself after buying it . It hoses a plastic cap and body .(price is 10 rs) 4)Flair Silkina Though it lacks a rubber grip , it has a metal clip on its cap and it makes a statement of fine writing till the very last word and is extremely worthy .Perfect for those who prefer a smooth but not soooooooo smooth pens such as gliding pens which write fat .(price is 10 rs and can be found anywhere) 5)Cello techno tip This pen also hoses a plastic body but has a rubber grip and also writes really well and is very durable . (Costs 10 rs) 6)Cello Pinpoint It is a cheap pen but the cap is not durable and the rim of the cap\u2019s clip comes off . But it writes really smooth but not as much as silkina .(price is 10 rs) I have tested these pens really well for their durability and ink flow consistency and have come up with this top ranking of low cost solid performance pens in India .I recommend Montex mega top and Linc glycer the most . Hope this helps!!! ",

Back when I used ballpoints, I tended to use a Zebra because I could get a medium-sized ball-point cartridge.  So, if I am wrong on the exchange calculation, let me know and I will revise the answer.
