            "answer_text": "Yes. YES, I write poetry. To me poetry is an art,a rhythm and a flow. Now to these you can have the add-on Art of playing with words: Like songs and music have those meanings and vibrations and clinging. Word chain is also like a music, a complex one. The words which come ahead and which follow,what they mean in the context or what they intended to do there. All these together just wound in a piece of writing Rhythm of the feel: Its a ride unless you fell like one you have not been like the purposeful listener/reader. One who just enters the car needs to feel the air, the vibe and needs to be a part of it. Flow of emotions: The poem reveals,relates and sings a song. A song which portrays the joy,the pain and those feelings which never have a name. Poems for me is like leaving a message in space where you tell anything and everything.Now its the reader/listener who has a vision/understanding/feel form it. Some get it beautifully and some have a even more serene experience. That\u2019s the beauty of poetry. Some minds live that part of the poetry which event he writer did not want to create. The poetry is the key which fits in different into different locks and opens different doors. Its a momentary thing, mood and the presence of the moment creates the poetry,the feel and the want. At times when you read your piece after some time you have a all new aura of the world you created. Just to express: Core The wetness of water...The heat of fire...The sound of silence...The stability of winds... All wished to be known...All wished to be felt...All wished to be conquered...All wished to be dealt... Beyond our imagination ...Beyond our stealth...Lie certain secrets...We can never forget... Gift of love Some words of beauty...Some gasp of despair...Some pain of parting...Some act of care...Together they bring gift of love...Wrapped in all sweetness...Wrapped in all prayer...A world so serene...A world so rare...Full of passion...Full of glare...Creating the magic of love in the air...

            "answer_text": "Yes I actually do write poetry and I would love it if someone could tell me if its any good! Here\u2019s one I wrote shortly after George Floyd was killed :( The Lion\u2019s Perspective By: Marco Anne At the zoo, you see lions, cranes, bears, tigers They\u2019re all behind bars, In a cage, every day of their lives, And people, they stare or wave. Seeing the animals brings them such joy! But did you ever think to put yourself in the lion\u2019s place? What does he see? How can he live the way he does? The lion, in that small, barred cell, Really does not see himself as being in a cage! The human beings are the animals, He observes them everyday as entertainment. But the humans\u2019 enclosure, Something is peculiar about it. Yes. They are contrasting colours and Covered in complex clothing. But where are the fences? Nothing divides them, no physical bars, no walls, Just one open area. Free. We need to live like that lion sees. Our size, shape or colour doesn\u2019t divide us. Neither do our abilities, disabilities or religion. We may seem different, but in the end, We\u2019re all human. Nothing between us. Nothing blocking us from one another. Without boundaries. The way that lion sees us. That was for a free verse assignment but I re-worked it after the original submission because I realized that I didn\u2019t really like it. (I got an A- lol) This next one was written when I was in grade 5. I don\u2019t really like it but tell me what you think :) The Night Storm By: Marco Anne When the downpour started, it was not strong. It kissed my window and nothing seemed wrong. Then a rumble sent shivers down my spine. The sky\u2019s stomach was hungry, and a pit formed in mine. It lashed and it crashed for hours on end, I prayed for a stop to this, that God would send. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking \u2018bout the horrible pain, The fear, the shivers From this terrible rain. And then, was it quiet? Had my prayers worked? I looked out my window and up my hopes jerked! The sky! It was blue with no booming flashes. I smiled and sighed All those fears had become ashes. Fearing those storms was a thing of the past. They were simply a blip, In our great world, so vast. (We had to write that one for our bible class, I got a B because the rhyme scheme had a problem apparently) Wings! Marco Anne If only I had wings! I could escape from this cage where now, stiff, I stand; Drop these heavy weights, Rejoin life beforehand. Kiss the mountain peaks, Taste the snow as cold as ice. Splash in the cool river water, Oh! Wouldn\u2019t that be nice! And while the icy evergreens whisper, I\u2019d take a dip in the river of purity. Erase from my mind, the guilt and the anger, And no longer, I\u2019d be an obscurity. Perch on the tallest treetops, And drink in the breathtaking landscapes. Dive to the deepest depths, and swing by the trees with the apes. I would fly with the birds To the farthest of places - even Nebraska! To the Bermuda Triangle, To Belgium and to Alaska. All day and all night, I would do what I please. Flap in the limitless night air, Or ride on the colourful breeze. Ah, if only I had wings! (sorry the spacing is off, I had originally written this in a word document in a special template our teacher made but it kinda screwed it up when i put it into quora.) This poem was written on a day when I was just kinda feeling hopeless and worthless. This next one was written for a historical figure essay but I converted it to a poem when I was finished because I got bored Amelia Earhart By: Marco Anne Girls can do a man\u2019s work, can\u2019t they? Young Amelia always questioned this. No, they said. Girls do housework, men get jobs. But aprons, pots, pans and mops were not for her. Watching the male pilots, Watching the male baseball players, Watching and longing. She would accomplish what some men could never do: They said she couldn\u2019t do it, but she did. Pilot school was only the beginning\u2026 She loved the adventure. She was hooked! That greasy, tangy, grimy smell of peril drew her in. She didn\u2019t stop! Her pilot\u2019s license lead to so many honours, But so much prejudice, They told her to give up, They told her she would never be equal to men, She didn\u2019t stop. She accomplished what some men could never do: They had said she couldn\u2019t do it, but she did. She had encouraged women, Break the barriers, she said. Stand up, speak out, she said. Women WILL be recognized. After crossing the Atlantic herself in 1932, Some people became truly convinced. Maybe women could do it as well as men. Maybe women were equal, And she kept encouraging this recognition. She accomplished what men would never do: They said she couldn\u2019t do it but she did. But then, in 1937, she disappeared. Gone was that advocate. Gone while circumnavigating the globe, Standing up for the women and breaking down barriers. If she hadn\u2019t had stood up, only men would be pilots. Only men could do work. Though Amelia was lost at sea, was she really gone? No! Of course not. Her legacy lives. She revolutionized how women are seen. And they said she couldn\u2019t do it, but she did. \u201cThere\u2019s more to life than being a passenger.\" If I get some feedback and maybe a few up votes I\u2019ll add a set of inspirational haiku me and my best friend made together Just your sassy next door neighbor Marco",

            "answer_text": "I enjoy reading poetry. However, sometimes I do write words in a strange rhyming pattern and shamelessly call them poems. Here\u2019s a one that I wrote recently: It\u2019s titled \u2018An Ode to a Deluded Generation\u2019 adn it\u2019s dedicated to my generation or as we call it, the Generation Z. It goes like this: They're out there in the dark alleys, of shady bars and posh restaurants Dancing and drinking away on a Friday night losing themselves to the loud music. They're out there in their trendy sneakers, striving. The shoes for which they sold a chunk of their soul, just to show the world that they're arriving, gradually moving towards their estranged goal. *** He still remembers those days, how they used to tell him those tales \"Strive and struggle son, for just this one time. Later on, life is as blissful as that delicious glass of sweet lime!\" He still remembers those days, when he burnt the midnight oil to write his own story, for he believed them all, he believed those tales. He believed that slow and steady wins the race, Like a mouse turning the wheels of time, running away to be in a better place, to stay alive in the rat race. *** They're out there sitting in fancy cafes, sipping that cup of mocha latte Their gaze is locked but the moments fly away, as they tap those fingers in that ashtray. They walk out through the door, One more night with a known stranger, lost in the wilderness, making love on the floor. One more night of nothing but empty promises, Like the desolate words, flowing out through a miserable poet's verses. *** How they all smile, like broken mirrors on the wall. How they all laugh, even when they fall. Because they've learned to feel, but not to cry. They've been taught to walk, but not to fly. *** He goes home to his mother, and lays his head on her lap \"Why am I not yet happy, mother? Why do I still suffer?\", he asks Gently the mother caresses his forehead, \"Go to sleep my son, it'll be alright. Don't you worry my son, just take a nap\" *** The sun is setting now, the roads are wet with tears They've lived far too long in delusion They were promised a palace but thrown away to rot into a prison. Soon they'll breakout and gather in crowds They will flock together to flood the town, The light in their eyes will shine again that lost spark in their hearts will be found. and the whole world will watch in awe, as these deluded souls burn everything to the ground. *** Steinbeck had said, in the eyes of these people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage. One day he'll stand up and the world will be a stage, He'll look at those rejuvenated faces in the crowd, as his words written on a page will give rise to a revolution. lead by a romantic and passionately deluded generation...  Well, that\u2019s the most recent one I have written. You can check out my Medium profile for more Neeraj Chavan \u2013 Medium Or maybe my personal blog Skeptical Thoughts Cheers! ",

It is moments like these that I cannot simply state how I feel - even to myself. There is too much anger and passion and elation and excitement at times to simply casually describe what\u2019s going on. In those moments I feel like screaming an impassioned rant, to let my emotions explode out my mouth. I am not naturally a writer. I\u2019ve worked on my writing, but I am principally an orator. Speaking comes naturally to me. I was practically born to rant. So my poetry rarely sounds like writing and sounds more like transcribed rants. With a bit of editing these sometimes become more similar to standard written language and not oration, but I rarely care to do this. I do not write poetry for anyone to read it - even myself, really. I write to make sense of my thoughts. It is as I transcribe the rants that are locked in my head, as I let them trickle through my fingers onto my notebook or into my laptop, they take on their own form and become more clear than they were when they were in my head. This is cathartic and useful. Even for those of us educated in psychology it is hard to understand what goes on in our minds. Our souls are stormy and unpredictable. Having a medium of expression through which one can let his insides out is often very important for emotional health. I know that for me it is. Thanks for asking ",

Fate What a beautiful relation is marriage,For which we pay lot of carriage!It is pleasurable for parents to spend the money,Cuz they love their daughter, who\u2019s cute bunny!But sometimes Life plays serious games,Which destroys everything- name and fame!The Govt. pours their rules, like Bathroom shower,Only because they are in the Power?It broke his Pa, pushed the man in depression,His family collapsed, plus their relations.His sister and her fiance are in shock,His parents are silent, like a rock.He never cursed anyone for \u2018that\u2019 modification,He cursed his destiny, Misfortune and his Situations\u2026! Peaceful Night The night was dark, beautiful too.I was there, but didn\u2019t know what to do!The wind blew gently, but my hairs were mess,I didn\u2019t care, I wasn\u2019t at the Press!The sky was black, no\u2026no it was grey,The bat flew high, without her prey.The branches waved gently, with no more tears,I smirked gently, with no ghosts or fear!The moon scattered light, over the earth,All of a sudden, I thanked my mom, for giving me birth!\u2018You may sleep now\u2019- Who whispered in my ear?\u2018Was it my Mom, I gazed\u2026no..no..It was my fear\u2019!\u2018You should sleep my boy\u2019- said the shallow forest,I yawned, agreed, \u2018Yeah\u2026my soul needs Rest!\u2019 My Soul I see my face, forming over a cloud.It was a jocund stage, away from the crowd.It soon faded away, but didn\u2019t turned me sad.It\u2019s my soul, not sole, don\u2019t stab it hard. I thought of them as joyous, rustic.Even, a nightmare was never that linguistic.The scars and scribbles kept tarnishing my card.It\u2019s my soul, not sole, don\u2019t rip it hard. I was amazed, bewildered at the fact.That they weren\u2019t those, they always enact.Maybe, I was the one who found \u2018M-O-M\u2019 hard.It\u2019s my soul, not sole, don\u2019t cut it hard. Just hoped of playing with a Toy Truck.Still was happy, with these pain stuck.I saw, who quilled the shrubs in the backyard.It\u2019s my soul, not sole, don\u2019t gnaw it hard. My grave drizzled, but never bleeped.That\u2019s how peacefully, a 13 year old could sleep.I was finally dig, deep in the dreary backyard.It was my soul, not sole, which was torn apart. I Folded My Hands Each time I was obstinate, I stepped back and folded my hands. Red, Blue, Green were never the option to choose,I hunched back as my wallet yelled, \u2018You have to refuse\u2019.Odor is selfish, it only sticked to my hands,Incense sticks- stubborn, refused to be my errands.\u2018Loathing\u2019, \u2018Defiant\u2019, \u2018Foul\u2019- were my names in vernacular,Biggest irony- My state is secular.That was when, my home floated on sands,Each time I was obstinate, I stepped back and folded my hands. The final bite burned her delicate tongue,\u2018He is an Anti-Social, he must be hung\u2019.Anger and Zest killed my pillars, my passion,Sword and Wailing eyes are deadly combination.None were breathing in the barren lands,Each time I was obstinate, I stepped back and folded my hands. Slivers never actually damaged the palm,Adorned bangles wailed over the farm.I still was adamant, will not come to your \u2018Home\u2019,\u2018What else do you have?\u2019 he smirked from his home.I could see the \u2018stupor\u2019 and realized my fad,I admit, I was obstinate,I stepped back and folded my hands.

Here is a Google Docs link with all of the poetry that I have written: Poetry Journal (I am 16 by the way) Here is one of my poems (it\u2019s based off the ending of Kimi No Na Wa/Your Name) My eyes hit the floor-- The sunshine from the other corner-- The one, is all that\u2019s on my mind; Years on end, I ransacked my brain for a sign-- but I have no clue-- just that, I was in love. With whom, I don\u2019t know. Another train-- crosses the path of the sun; I catch a glimpse-- and, of the one-- for certain. Our eyes lock together, and time is forgiving to let me remember her face. With little thought-- as soon as I stopped, I begin to sprint. Sprint, Sprint, in chase of her. I approach the steps, and I stroll, as I had done before. She, is in front of me. My thoughts escape me. Who is she? Why am I here? I proceed as normal, as does she. I come to a realization, when I am where she was-- and she does where I was-- I mutter out-- whether I had seen her before-- A single tear streams down her cheek-- and she gives the answer I hope for. Our eyes meet again-- with obvious signs of relief, and with beaming smiles on our faces. After another moment-- when time stops-- leaving only our emotions-- I ask for, her name. ",

Here's a poem I've written recently Broken Wings Those who were trapped Stopped her from leaving. Even so, her wings grew As her heart started beating. Their made up reasons, She believed them not. She longed for where the skies are pure And where rain stops. [And thus she fled] Her wings brought her far, But their curses caught up. As she soared through the clouds, Her wings were shot down. Feather by feather, they tore up her wings. For each hope she had, she felt the pain sting. \u201cIt was a curse\u201d, they said For those who broke free. \u201cIt was God's wish\u201d, they spouted. She was left there to bleed. The fallen angel, with her wings stolen, She can no longer fly and her heart was broken. \u201cWas it a sin?\u201d, she wondered \u201cFor us to break free\u201d Was there ever a purpose For us to resist?

Or not] Sunset nears And the pebbled gut of clouds Foreshadows storms tonight Or perhaps tomorrow. But here The sun erupts volcanic And the molten light spills forth Through the shredded edge of cloud. A mezzo note is hummed And beyond sound or touch A melody is intertwined With some essential fabric Low winds stir And the softness of the air Carries with it the twilight smell Of sweet nostalgia. And here The breezes sing an elegy Unheard, unfelt, Unknown [Also untitled\u2014I really hate writing titles] I find you in the winter twilight When the indigo darkness of the sky Steals softly through the naked branches And comes quiet upon the sunset, Colored all the pale colors of loneliness, And sings a soundless lullaby. I find you there in the aching wind And in the low-swept, frost-cut leaves\u2013 Not in these things themselves But among them and apart: The only living, beating heart Against the cold reflection I find you in the winter mirror. With the wistful clouds and elegiac sun, I see the beauty of the image. I look beside me then And you find me there And take my hand and smile. And though I lose you in these words I find you in the winter twilight. [Hey! I have at least a working title for this one] The Madhouse Echoes yammer\u2013 Proclamations made beneath the arches, Shattered strands of song. The sober drunkards drink together From the troughs And gutters. The contaminated sunlight Filters through the window And they squabble for a drop. The guard rattles the bars, \u201cHey! Quiet down in there.\u201d They drool and leer. He turns back to me, Returns to what he had been saying, The dripping words Punctuated by teeth and thumbs. I am not listening; I cannot tear my eyes from them. Check out my \u201ccollection,\u201d now available on Amazon for Kindle only (for $0.99 though!)

            "answer_text": "Yes, I indulge in writing poetry. Below is a poem I wrote titled Quietude  To Quietude. For sound travels more leisurely than light, Keenly gathering moss along the lush slope of time. And so, prolonged thunder follows the flash of lightning; And so, applause rings long after the stage is emptied. To Quietude. For sound travels more leisurely than light, Keenly gathering moss along the lush slope of time. And so, heat multiplies for eons before a volcano erupts; And so, sweat and tears are spent, unnoticed, for aeons before the conch of victory is finally heard. To Quietude. For sound travels more leisurely than light, Keenly gathering moss along the lush slope of time. And so, a bird flies artfully for long before it can sing it's song; And so, the mind stumbles foolishly through the miles of life, before its laurels are announced. To Quietude. For sound travels more leisurely than light, Keenly gathering moss along the lush slope of time. And so, there is a simple gratitude owed to solitude; And so, the unheard moments of character slip by whilst stringing the strains of victory in Quietude. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but I don\u2019t ever sit down and go \u201cI\u2019m going to write a poem now\u201d. Instead, for me, poetry is a conduit for expression. The words flow when the mood strikes. If the wave has not washed over me, letting the language present itself as if through supernatural intervention, then I won\u2019t force it. I write poetry only when it flows naturally. Most importantly, I write it only for myself. Thus, I write poetry erratically. I have written multiple poems within a week at certain stages in my life but gone months without writing any in others. A lot of my poetry is negative (as those emotions often were more consuming) but some of it speaks of my moments of pure hope. Some is wistful as I reflected on my cusp into adulthood, some is absurd as I deconstructed the crazy world around me. Overall, whenever I feel like reflecting upon my personal journey, I reread my works and the story they tell. In that way, I suppose that my poetry is a record of the journey of my soul. I shan\u2019t claim that my poetry is good. As mentioned above, I have not written it for others to assess nor judge, but rather as a insight into a snapshot of myself - a flawed capture of a time when emotion overwhelmed me. However, I shall share a sole example here. A poem that is one of my personal favourites. It no longer applies to me; that doesn\u2019t mean I should merely forget the time when it did. But seriously, don\u2019t we all write poetry in some form or another? Dark Skies In a perpetual darkened sky, What do a few clouds matter? The shade they cover, meaningless. The ground already shadowed. What does rain mean to a man In a world that's cold and wet? What is the sound of thunder, When cries of the heart left you deaf? Snow is no longer cold, To one whose heart is stone. Wind's bite cannot touch the man, Who has already been worn to bone. To me the world is nothing. It holds no power over me. Cause I already lost myself in the dark, Already lost my will to see. The light that always beckons, Out of reach, it taunts. Tis high time I abandoned hope. It only leads to naught. The weather cannot touch me. The storms live in my heart. No matter what the world does to me. No more can I be hurt... -Daydreamer 25/06/2015 ",

Until recently the closest I came was fiddling with the random words on the refrigerator \u201cmagnetic poetry\u201d until I found a fun app for iPad and iPhone. The app is called Creative Writer and it's similar to magnetic poetry. It's also similar to the predictive text on your device. There are several in-app purchase word sets but even the basic one is fun. Your keyboard is replaced with a long list of random words. Tap one that appeals to you. Then you have an all new set of words to choose your second word. And so on. But it's not random. The brain stimulator here is that you don't have to just ponder the right word; there are so many choices that you'll end up choosing a word that you wouldn't have thought of on your own but because you see it in the massive list your eyes are drawn to it. Despite my general disdain for poetry I find it relaxing and stimulating and when I return to my novel I feel the words flow more freely. I even think I may have created a couple decent poems using this app. There are also wordsets that are designed for prose. A couple examples: Yes, monsieur, the peculiarity marked his character which made up indeed something which I, a long distance between us, mayn't have taken to epitomize the matter. It was evident from the beginning he should have behaved better. As soon as those letters were dispatched to Paris, he beheld his countenance and saw everything in dark colours of death. when he saw that there wasn't any more money and all the good times which would give back naught else but love and friendship unestranged, he stood alone upon his journey, and let it begin afresh. where there were possibilities, and the great sun burns hotly in the sky above, past all dishonor, there isn't much regret for every breath upon the face and every step upon the ground that makes each man a king ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I do like writing poetry, usually I write short one. Here's a new poem of mine- Choice Lost in this mirage of work and life,  She wondered when was she happy the last time  how beautiful was this world from time immemorial  Was this the life she had dreamed of all this while   Had siblings for the cuddly hugs and endless fight And a heavenly lap of mumma waiting for a hug tight There was nothing but loneliness now Was this the life she had dreamed of all this while   working nine to five on something she doesn't like Is she losing her trueself and becoming a tyke She wanted to run away and beat the hell out of life Was this the life she had dreamed of all this while   When was she given a choice? Never did they let her raise her voice All her life she was asked never to question But now when everything seems above her control  It was better to raise her voice than to become a paranoid because this was not the life she had dreamed of all this while.  With the help of her loved ones she gained her confidence back and now she knew she was on the right track A job of nine to five was not her choice  So she resigned and raised her voice because this was her life and it was her choice  Amidst all the chaos she is on her way to find her dreams For she knew none but she could walk through this streams Working on something she had always dreamed  Now she is happy with the way she is  because this is the life she had dreamed of all this while. :) ",

            "answer_text": "I write all of the time. I have 12 different books I am writing in various levels of completion. Most of them are books of historical research and/or historical fiction. Four of them are books of short stories. One of them is about philosophy and reconciling the ideas of the early modern philosophers, enlightenment thinkers and mystics with modern views on things - purpose and the unexplained supernatural make up a large part of the book. I have been writing that one for almost 30 years. Three of the books are nearing completion. One is in the final editing stages. I write poetry often as well and find I now have enough poems to make up an entire anthology - an entire book of just my poetry. I only write poetry some of the time and only when a certain mood hits me. Its usually in moments of quiet contemplation alone and just after something has triggered me emotionally - a death - a world event - injustice, etc. Most of my poetry is dark - but much of it has a silver lining of hope at the end. Most of my poems are fairly short. I have only written a couple of lengthy ones. I will share a few examples. This first one was only written a night ago. HARBINGER: By Aaron R. Shields A patch of shadow in the road Dim recess in a ditch Shade cutout from within the trees In burlap missing stitch It moves from place to place in stealth Clear knowing where it goes. Pursuing mainly men of wealth From wence illgotten flows Rememb'ring souls that they have took Lives countless they have spoiled Smart cattle penned in by the spook Forgotten hours toiled A whispered sound they think they hear May be their bane at last Oer shoulder peering in desperate fear Forgetting crooked past It moves in mirrors and placid sea Assuaging fray'ed nerves Until it finds them dull with glee Prostrate in twisted curves Dark hollow form moves from below To seize its worthless prey Found turned to gold from Midas' toe Dead eyes with naught to say This next one I wrote after my nephew had committed suicide (an Afghanistan veteran) and I was just kind of numb with shock contemplating all kinds of crazy things. BACKHOE: By Aaron R. Shields A backhoe in corner with bucket wet Rarely washed but with purpose yet Oft not considered or so it seems Long taking work from ditch digging teams With power to move both stump and mass Cuts scars in the earth now covered with grass Daily it moves in its usual gear Dredging up soil ordered furrow near Six feet below is the depth it goes The seeds of our dearest departed it sows Filling up graves now marked with stones With treasure below of cherished bones There was so much death in my life when I wrote this. Friends, family and my faithful dogs - so many had gone. I felt empty and felt little comfort with a hate towards death. Not afraid of it whatsoever, but angry it takes my loved ones. A FINAL RETIREMENT By Aaron R. Shields A lonely dark angel moves down to his place Long given up in assaulting our race His brothers now wonder at whence he has gone In former times his presence so strong He sighs as he opens a long dusty case and gazes upon implements decaying in waste An old broken hourglass askew on its side Its contents blown windward as sands of the tide Beside lays worn handle with attachment still there a harvesting blade of ancient despair Its grim cur'ved surface now dull with neglect dried edge thick rusted, bloody function long checked The sythe a reminder of sin that once was Mortality and pain now replaced by the Dove Up to the window of time he doth look No longer collecting the souls he once took Brutality - inequity both great and small replaced with perfection, pure contentment for all The spirit and body now one and the same great debt paid in full by the One who was slain defeating the angel by rising again and raising us with Him - redeeming all men Making the slayer's old task obsolete With death now retired and heaven complete This last one I wrote in pondering that elusive feeling most of us feel that we think will give us happiness. We chase it our whole lives - often in the wrong places. THE LAST REFRAIN By Aaron R. Shields It was light - under cover It was bobbing overhead It was shining just a sliver - out of view It was happy - so we thought So we searched for it for naught 'cause its something unobtainable - who knew A glimmer when we'are young The stuff of longing - in a song, It! - drives some folks to madness in pursuit We look for it in people We look for it in books We look for it in nature - sky and sea Inspiration in a cloud Lost cherished lover - crying loud Gushing heartbroke from a lyric - skyward flew In the face of faithful hound Air and wind-chimes holds the sound Euphoric phrase in symphony - doth rapture heart In a sound mind or insane It is really all the same 'Cause much of us are searching - most in vane We grow older and more jaded Still we look with feelings faded We settle here and there - for happiness But we hope and pray and fast That our longing ends at last That the thing we're looking for - will nigh appear Some few - will give up hope Others still - just take up dope The solution so confusing - must maintain In the end - when we all rise To a place beyond the skies When hidden things revealed - are all made clear Our hearts and minds made whole The song revealed to our soul We'll find it's God who finally sings - the last refrain Thanks for reading. Hope some of you like them. I have many many more. I have rarely shared them with anyone. Aaron ",

            "answer_text": "I started the #5MinutePoetry movement, which encourages re-phrasing your Facebook statuses as poems that you spend 5\u201310 minutes crafting, the goal of which is to make Facebook a more interesting place for everyone. My poems tend to be introspective, as finding a way to encapsulate my thinking in a few lines is very therapeutic. Here\u2019s one of my favourites:  I dreamt I was a knight in armour \u00a0Riding over fields of crimson wheat,\u00a0And with each step, recalled the farmer\u00a0Lying, vanquished, in the furrows at my feet.\u00a0Who was this man who\u2019d sacrificed his life?\u00a0What agency stepped in to lift my hand? \u00a0Did he have livestock? Children? Wife? \u00a0For whom he\u2019d vivified once-barren land?\u00a0\u00a0I dreamt I was a man of courage,\u00a0Striving to accomplish noble deeds.\u00a0The road ahead all but discouraged\u00a0Cultivating any sort of seed.\u00a0But looking down, I saw a man \u00a0Who\u2019d put aside all pretenses of fame,\u00a0And working quietly with plow and hand \u00a0Ensured that not a soul would know his name. \u00a0What good had all his effort brought to pass?\u00a0How full had been the life that he had led?\u00a0Was he content? Resigned? Steadfast?\u00a0I\u2019ll never know; I left him lying dead. \u00a0\u00a0I dreamt my fate would carry me afar,\u00a0But, waking, I am left with bitter dread.\u00a0Was I truly meant to chase a shooting star?\u00a0Or has my future\u2019s joy already fled? \u00a0\u00a0If so, oh well.\u00a0I guess it\u2019s back to bed. \u00a0Edit: Naman Agrawal has requested more! So, I\u2019m including a couple short ones, and a longer piece. Hope you enjoy. We said once we'd stay friends forever; \u00a0Friends, whichever way our roads may lead. \u00a0Indeed, we said we'd find each other \u00a0If the other ever was in need. \u00a0\u00a0But promises can't read the future's mind\u00a0And kindness cannot walk the streets alone. \u00a0We've sown the seeds of discord with each step, \u00a0Which kept us both from reaching for the phone. \u00a0\u00a0I do not question why our ties unwound. \u00a0I've found that second-guessing is a waste. \u00a0We faced our own distinct and sep'rate ways, \u00a0Each gazing toward a fate we can't outpace. \u00a0\u00a0So here it is, my dear, my last adieu:\u00a0A few sad lines I know you'll never read. \u00a0I concede to you all visions of a \"someday\"\u00a0So that, one day, I'll from memory be freed. \u00a0Another emo poem: Tonight, there's something in the rain:\u00a0Not really sorrow, not quite pain, \u00a0Just a whisper to convince my soggy brain\u00a0there's no tomorrow; \u00a0That the trains I've wrecked \u00a0Left stains I've kept \u00a0Concealed through the years, \u00a0Now revealed through these tears wept by the sky. \u00a0Looking up, I find the raindrops start to fill my hooded eyes. \u00a0For I can't forget regret, \u00a0And I'll forever wonder \"why?\" \u00a0And now, getting political (February 6th, 2016)\u2026 Maybe he IS \u00a0Just a feel-good, yes-we-candidate,\u00a0Pledging to withstand the state-run mandate\u00a0That immigrants, blacks, and all working-class mothers\u00a0Must forage for scraps \u00a0And/or wrestle each other\u00a0Before they're allowed to live life like the rest of us, \u00a0Standing abreast of us, \u00a0Owning the rights that our forefathers left for us. \u00a0Is that ENOUGH for us?\u00a0HuffPo seems to think so. \u00a0\u00a0But when the going gets tough, \u00a0Seems the \"tough\" like to throw rowers overboard, \u00a0Hoping that \"lightening the oars\" \u00a0Might afford them a little more time with their families. \u00a0Why's is so hard to see why that's INSANITY?!\u00a0Fuck off with your vanity, \u00a0Shut off Sean Hannity, \u00a0And once in a while recall your HUMANITY!\u00a0Please! Can we\u00a0All just\u00a0Stop and \u00a0THINK?\u00a0 \u00a0I feel that we're nearing the brink of disaster, \u00a0And our options are \"sink\" \u00a0Or to row that must FASTER,\u00a0So when some bastard tells you that \"shrinking the ship\"\u00a0Is the ONE WAY to make sure our kids are equipped\u00a0To avoid dereliction and \"skip this shit, quick\",\u00a0Spend a thought to consider the kids who he'll KICK.\u00a0And then ask how he's planning to keep us afloat\u00a0When our boat consists only of thrones for the Kochs\u00a0Bobbing lonely amidst democratic hypocri-sea.\u00a0\u00a0Faced with that prospect, WHY CAN'T WE AGREE\u00a0That The Land of the Free's not defined by its borders!\u00a0That \"Iraq\" and \"Iran\" aren't new slang for \"Mordor\";\u00a0That in order for personal freedoms to thrive\u00a0It's important each person can be KEPT ALIVE. \u00a0Doesn't mean much if \"freedom\" means \"freedom to die.\"\u00a0\u00a0So sure. Go ahead and despise the word \"socialist.\"\u00a0I couldn't care less, just so long as you'll toast to this:\u00a0We've got this one shot to stop treading water. \u00a0Let's not fuck it up for our sons and daughters!\u00a0",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I am 13, an aspiring author, and preparing my first novel, so, I read some brilliant poets such as Pablo Neruda, Kipling etc. and also the new age poets, for example Arch Hades. And on reading them, I realised, that poetry is about expression, making it more relatable to the readers, so I too, tried my hand at a verse or two, now note that I wrote my first poem sitting in my classroom, while studying Maths. I liked them, and so, I decided to open an Instagram account by the name \u2018theblisspoetry\u2019 you can search it too on IG, and the response I got was amazing, most of the appreciation was from my classmates and parents, so I continued. I have written numerous fragments and also long ones. I would like to share a few here\u2026 Magic After so many years, too, I find solace in you. I see dreams in your eyes, On seeing you my heart cries You seem to be made up of stars, On seeing you I forget all my wars. I see your face in the moon, and I\u2019ve decided that I want you to be the cause of my doom. I know that in the end, it will all be ok, but even if it does not, too, I\u2019ll still love you like the first time I saw you. I don\u2019t know if a heaven exists, But you are quite close to it And when you look at me, I still feel magic, a magic that no one felt, Which makes my heart melt. I added love to my bucket list, For on seeing you, I realised, That magic does really exist. -Aadit India of my Dreams In the depths of the night, a beggar struggles in his fight, his boy lies wounded and his daughter naked. Living like scum, in the corner of a slum, a pile of dirt on the left, and the dark silhouette of a building on the right. In the bedroom, a rich man sleeps sound, while in the slum lays a dead hound. He lives like a king, on his finger, he wears a gold ring. A helpless sweeper lives in dread, while, in front of a hundred people, a man shoots a girl in the head, And still, no one killed Jessica. The tricolour waves strong as a wall, full of deep red blood, if anything at all. They say India has a strong social base, While in Munirka, a 23 year old Jyoti Singh was raped by 6 men in the Nirbhaya case. They say peace comes in the right season, But then why were Sikhs were killed in 1984, without any reason. Bones were found behind tanks, of helpless children, who were eaten raw in Nithari, Noida, And they say the ruler of the world will be India. The tricolour waves strong as a wall, full of deep red blood, if anything at all. They say that sleeping on the pavements is all right, while a Raman Raghav comes and kills them in the night. A murder which made India weep, When Aarushi Talwar was murdered in her sleep. They say nothing in India is sinister, How do we believe that, when Vikas Yadav burnt alive the lover of his sister? They say there isn\u2019t a lag, When Neeraj Kapoor was cut into 300 pieces and stuffed into poly bags? The tricolour waves strong as a wall, full of deep red blood, if anything at all. -Aadit PS: Kindly share your comments and check out my Instagram account:) ",

            "answer_text": "The irony of creativity is that it at times thrives best with confinement. Restrictions pushes many creatives to produce some of their best works. Poetry is that tinge of pressure, to have the right sense of rhyme, the flow of it, the length & selecting the correct word . You have to get your message & sentiments across but without excessive flourishes. I delved into poetry to give it a shot & challenge my writing. I loved its simplicity but at the same time how a string of words could bring about strong emotions. It\u2019s one of the simplest but most heart-tugging forms of art there is. One type of poetry that exemplifies how limits can catalyze creativity is the traditional form of Japanese Poetry, Haiku. It\u2019s beautiful. Here\u2019s one of my favourite poems I wrote a while back if you\u2019d like to read :) DAUGHTERS This is a poem for my future daughters Who will all be named after flowers Reminding them Every time their name escapes someone\u2019s lips That a flower needs not compare itself to another A rose blooms when its time comes So do the lilies, the azaleas The orchids and the hydrangeas Flowers do not bother to compete To see whose beauty they can beat Flowers do not care To see who blooms faster than the rest Flowers do not compare To see whose colour is brighter Or whose petals are bigger I will name my daughter after flowers So they remember The lessons a flower teaches It does not matter That dahlias are bigger than daffodils That sakuras aren\u2019t as pink as tulips Flowers are appreciated as they are My daughters will be beautiful as they are Her name will remind her That flowers too have their seasons That wherever her roots grow or die Wherever her petals bloom or wither Just as flowers have their seasons People will wait and love and appreciate As time and the shift of seasons Reminds them of the grace and beauty in patience I will name my daughters after flowers So they remember To love fiercely Opening their hearts Their petals of kindness For the world to see To not be like jewellery Constantly on display In television and shop arrays Ever admired but its care exclusive Whose love is so expensive Their attention so selective To my future little flowers Your beauty is part of nature\u2019s diversity The death of love is when it is compared It is a terrible habit to have Comparison robs us of bliss Too busy counting the things that are amiss To my future little flowers Bloom when your time comes Worry not of others Worry not if you are faster or slower Bloom when your time comes Of others, you pay no bother Learn from the mistakes of your mother ",

I published some 2,000 new, vibrant poets before the wolves broke down the walls\u2026.. Poetry rocks, until you are sat across from a Bank Manager\u2026my passion cost me more than one hundred thousand pounds\u2026 Look up online for \u2018dogma publication's and my name, you'll see\u2026. However, you wanted to know if I WRITE poetry, well here we go. it's a sonnet, in Shakespearean format, entitled \u2018Waiting'.It first appeared in my own journal, \u2018\u2019The Alchester Review', in 2002. Copies of which, by the way, are even rarer than the first Harry Potter novel\u2026.. Waiting She stood and smoked a cigarette, or two, And waited for the bus to take her home. Her fingers, like her mood, were turning blue, And in the Autumn chill her mind did roam: It wandered back to try to find a joy, Of Sun kissed beaches, or a Summer's love, But all she found was a small baby's toy, Beside a headstone, carved therein a dove.. She knelt beside the grave, and closed her eyes, And through the pain, she thought what may have been: She thought of all the torments, and the lies, Whilst he lay dying, small get quite serene: Upon the bus she sat down and she wept, And sobbed in to the small blue sock, she kept.

I thought you were a God's innocent hatching. But you turned out to be one of those witches ; Who is pulling out my old and deep stitches . Now as the wounds are open to air; I have that same old pain which I am prepared to bare. You started the game baby; It's me who is gonna finish it may be . You have held my weakest strings; But i don't fear for you breaking it in a sling . Now it's your season I'll give you right's to shower ; And I'll dance raising my hands higher . ",

Don\u2019t you wish?I have created my own little world inside me,Where you and I are free, Where we sit under the red skies, wrapped in each other\u2019s arms and you reciting poetries to me, Where we kiss at 3, And hold each other\u2019s hands till eternity.

With the flower petals dropped down from the road Stay with me The flowers are red As they ran out of the hope Similar to the pain you\u2019ve dispersed Despite the fact it\u2019s a short term solution For long time grief Oh friend I\u2019m thankful you\u2019ve stayed on the ground And didn\u2019t fly like a dove Above the ground ",

            "answer_text": "I write poetry. It is my outlet to express freely and without bias. Poetry is a form of art that engages the mind and heart to work in unison. I have different ways of writing poetry and I have learned on my own how to play with words and capture what I truly wish to convey. This is the thing about creativity that can be expressed uniquely and in different ways. Some express through paintings, some through poetry, singing, playing musical instruments, creative writing, et. Art should live on the essence of its expression. Never let it die. Sometimes, I wish to share my poems with the world so I also submit my poetry online to websites that are more lenient and have a review policy to at least check my work and then after correcting any lackings, if any. My poem is them published online in my name. It\u2019s truly an amazing feeling when you see your poem published on a website. It stays there forever and also enhances your credibility. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I do. I write English poetry as Urdu poetry is not my cup of tea though Urdu is my native language. I write poetry when I feel a lot. When I am full of thoughts, feelings, notions and emotions. I write when I feel that it is enough, I can't bear more burden. Why I write poetry? I myself don't know when my writings starts changing into poetry. When I am writing what's going on in my mind, all of a sudden I start writing poetry. People generally think that when you write a romantic piece of poetry you are or were in love with someone. See: Poetry is not about a certain person. It is for a person that is within you or for whom you feel. It can be anyone. Your lover, or your crush or for any random girl or a guy. It is not necessarily for a certain person. I write poetry. I am not great at it. I just assemble my thoughts and feelings and I don't know how they get the shape of a piece of poetry. I write to discard my emotions. It is a relief! Try it once you will forget drugs. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I do but recently I have not been writing poetry. Actually it's not the kind of thing to be written after thinking that you are willing to write poem.(Actually that's the case for me) I have met a lot of poets with whom have I asked, \u201cHow do you start when you write poems?\u201d Most of them say that poetry is the manifestation of your feelings, and whenever I get a feeling about something I write and that is how poems are written by me. Well, most of them were frank but I guess not all of them. As you see it's not always possible to start writing poems wherever you get the feeling. So if that's my case then whenever I get touched by something, (however absurd it might be) I see to it if I am in a position and situation to be able to write or not. If yes then I start writing immediately, if not then I try to remember the thing that made me feel such and I write it down on my mind. And when I get a good position a nd situation I recall it. Every detail, every textures and touch they come to my mind one after another (maybe in a transformed form) then I write. I hope I understood your question. And I say to myself: Think not much o dear mind, For there be more dearer than you to me. For dearer be the nature and the feelings that it brings, Feelings that my heart can merrily grasp Better than your logic your wit so far. ",

Like I said it's a quest, there are no clue, no right key, no right door.  Like I said it's a chaos, the more you resist, the more it comes. Like I said it's a toss, But with no head or tail.  Like I said it's complicated, the more you dis-tangle, the more you get entangled. Like I said it's hidden, the more you find, the more you loose.  Like I said it's not very difficult, but yet sometimes takes ages to understand.  And like I said, it's the path you make, it's what you want to see, it's how you want to feel, it's choosing your right from no options. In the end you don't win or loose, it's what you are.

            "answer_text": "I am writing Hindi poems from last 17 years. I almost written 100+ Hindi & 6\u201310 English poems. This has started with my first crush. I had written 50+ romantic+love poetry. Sometimes I had written depressing or negative poetry. I was very emotional. You can say a emotional fool. Except I was a good poet, I was very shy about it. I never ever showed these to anyone till I was 27. I always felt embarrassing whenever someone catch me writing. I felt like a thief. I was very much conscious in my home to not let others read these emotions. This is very clear that I was not mature enough to think it as normal as it is. After 28\u201330 I started to understand that there is nothing such to hide these from others. These are not as personal as I thought. I was not doing anything wrong except expressing my feelings on paper. After 27 I have started writing social poems also and social articles. I have written a short story as well and 2 ideas are on the way to described on the paper. My poems got published online on AmarUjala.com, Matribhasha.com and AajSirhaane.com. My company magazine has published a lot of my written material either poems or articles and I have been rewarded many times as well. I used to show my literature to my friends, relative and even my family now a days. I am trying to make it professional now. I rather lough in myself about my immaturity now. One of my poem written when I was just 18 is present here. \u0905\u0928\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0930 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u092a\u0928 \u0939\u0948, \u092f\u0925\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u0939\u0948, \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0907\u0928 \u0935\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u093e \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u0939\u0948, \u092f\u093e \u092e\u0947\u0930\u093e \u0939\u0940 \u0915\u0941\u091b \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u0939\u0948, \u0909\u0938 \u0905\u091c\u0928\u092c\u0940, \u0905\u0928\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0930\u0964 \u091c\u094b \u092e\u0942\u0932\u094d\u092f \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0905\u092d\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947, \u092c\u0938 \u091c\u093e\u090f \u0909\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0940 \u0938\u0939\u091c, \u092f\u093e \u092d\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u0942\u0932\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u092e\u0947\u0902, \u0930\u0939 \u091c\u093e\u090f \u0906\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0923 \u092e\u0939\u091c, \u0915\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u0939 \u092e\u0939\u0915\u0947 \u0918\u0930-\u0906\u0901\u0917\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902, \u092f\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0901\u0926 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u0939 \u0915\u0932\u094d\u092a\u093f\u0924 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092e\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902, \u0915\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0930\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u092f\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0901\u0926 \u0939\u0948, \u092f\u093e \u092e\u0947\u0930\u093e \u0939\u0940 \u0909\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0926 \u0939\u0948, \u0928 \u092c\u0941\u091d\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938 \u0939\u0948, \u0909\u0938 \u0905\u091c\u0928\u092c\u0940, \u0905\u0928\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0930\u0964 \u0926\u093f\u0916\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u092d\u0940 \u0927\u0941\u0902\u0927\u0932\u0940-\u0927\u0941\u0902\u0927\u0932\u0940, \u092e\u093f\u0932\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u092d\u0940 \u091a\u0932\u0924\u0940-\u091a\u0932\u0924\u0940, \u0916\u094b \u091c\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u092f\u093e\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u092e\u0947\u0902, \u090f\u0939\u0938\u093e\u0938\u094b\u0902 \u092e\u0947\u0902, \u091c\u095b\u094d\u092c\u093e\u0924\u094b\u0902 \u092e\u0947\u0902, \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0922\u0942\u0902\u0922 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0924\u0928\u094d\u0939\u093e-\u0924\u0928\u094d\u0939\u093e, \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u0932\u091f \u0930\u0939\u093e \u092a\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e-\u092a\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e, \u092e\u093f\u0932 \u091c\u093e\u090f \u0915\u0939\u0940\u0902, \u0926\u093f\u0916 \u091c\u093e\u090f \u0915\u0939\u0940\u0902, \u0909\u0938 \u0905\u091c\u0928\u092c\u0940, \u0905\u0928\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0930\u0964 \u092e\u093f\u0932 \u0938\u0915\u0924\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0935\u0939 \u0938\u092c \u0915\u0941\u091b \u0939\u0940, \u091c\u094b \u091a\u093e\u0939\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0907\u0902\u0938\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u092d\u0940, \u092e\u093f\u0932 \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0917\u0930 \u091c\u094b \u0915\u0941\u091b \u092d\u0940, \u092c\u0938 \u0909\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092e\u093f\u0932 \u091c\u093e\u090f \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940, \u092e\u0943\u0917 \u0924\u0930\u0938\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u094b, \u0915\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0930\u0940 \u092a\u0932-\u092a\u0932 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0948, \u0910\u0938\u0947 \u0939\u0940 \u0932\u0917\u0924\u093e \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0948, \u0909\u0938 \u0905\u091c\u0928\u092c\u0940 \u0905\u0928\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0915\u093e \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935 '\u0915\u093f\u0936\u094b\u0930' \u0935\u093f\u092e\u0932 ",

You held my hand and helped me walk, You never got tired of my endless talk. You told me stories when I was four, I still remember our fights for the Ludo score\u2026! You enthralled me by showing the star, Now, I try looking for you in them, far. You tugged me in and patted my head, Now, crying for You turns my eye red..!Every toy I wanted, You bought, Every Holy Mantra, You taught. All the love I wanted You gave, When I was scared, You made me brave.I wish I could turn back the clock, And enjoy the evening Temple walk, You inspired me to achieve great, You really were my best mate.Time passed by and I grew up, But, I will always remain your little Pup. You gave me courage, to fight all odds, You made us capable, from tiny Todd\u2019s.Today You turn Seventy One, Yet, In my heart, You shine as bright as the Sun. I write this today in your memory, I know you would be smiling from up there, heartily!!I know You haven\u2019t left me, I know You haven\u2019t!!

            "answer_text": "http://poemhunter.com The poemhunter dot com website gets updated every day with new poems. Poets register there and then use the submit a poem service. They can also add a picture beneath the poem itself. They can edit the poem later. Keywords help us find the topics. When I visited there, I started adding poems. I've got about 2,400 poems now. http://denismartindale.co.uk When I've updated a few poems, I can then update the PDF e-book file for myself to download and for others, too. Many poets welcome feedback and poetry suggestions so poets can edit their work.Most of my poems begin as challenges to myself to create something positive. So these are under my control. I have other poems based on thinking up a new title or responding to a phrase that I just thought. Maybe it will help create a common metre hymn style structure of syllables in the verse line form of 8-6-8-6.At other times, there's no way I can edit the phrases to suit that style. So I'm really studying the text and the punctuation and I can use the grammarly dot com text checker for such as these poems. In fact, I registered there and log in and create a new document for the text to be checked. When edited, I exit and a copy is left online for reference.Like others, I have submitted poems to poetry anthology publishers, local papers and magazines, yet also to TV channels and Radio stations. It's a way to share the Christian faith as well as world issues, nature and love.Another way to create new poems is using a well-known song and to write new lyrics to it. With websites like poemhunter dot com we can also add extras like videos. Elsewhere, we can create a blog or a website. However, these could involve extra learning time for website HTML commands and special display effects. A whole bunch of worries could be avoided if we just use poetry websites instead.If we create a domain name, then there's an extra expense, yet there are times when we simplify visits to our poetry that way, hence this domain name, http://denismartindale.co.uk Then use keywords to search for relevant poems eg God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, angels, Church, Christianity or for my Stephen Gayford wildlife painting poems search for Stephen Gayford, lions, tigers, bears and so on.The poemhunter dot com website has a top 500 poems option or the members with their poetry in the top 500. Then there are the brand new poems being added. We can search for a poet or a poem or an exact poem title. Even so, I found QUORA to be a treasure trove of ideas, so I like getting their email updates. I like the pictures I see on QUORA and I use unsplash dot com and pixabay dot com to find useful images on these free-to-use image websites. http://unsplash.comhttp://pixabay.com Or try Google then click the images tab for even more as clip art also helps poets present their poetry. http://www.google.com ",

I have just completed two chapbooks and almost done with a third. I also have two others in progress. Here is a poem that was published by Crimson Feet Print Magazine (the poem was written before I had any education in poetry) You can hear me read the poem in my youtube link at the end of this post. I now teach poetry. This poem is in my current chapbook being submitted this week to several publishers. Published by Wordfest Print Anthology 2016 Selected for the Waco Cultural Arts Festival Where the Woods Open There's a path I always take, down to the river where the woods are dressed down, open The light of the sky doesn't shine, in your eyes but leads the way to redemption I like to stand there for a moment, on the shortcut created by troubled feet woven with wilderness bliss, and cigarettes butts It's a path that never sleeps I see the same semi-blind vision, of the river every time. I hear baby boat horns blaring in the distance, and floating out of view I walk to the rhythm of the trees, the faint sound of\"Wild Thing\" playing in the car. I carry a bent black rod with a tangled neon line ,a mud covered box of rusty hooks and flaming red bobbers I wear my T-Shirt that says \"Iron City Beer\" that's cut off at the belly or sometimes my other one that says \"Just Do It\" with shredded denim shorts that ride my buttocks After a few seconds of inhaling and exhaling an indecision, I do what most fisher men do, with only my thoughts to keep me company I find a clean rock and cast with desperation The woods close. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Poem #2 Published by Blue Hole Print Magazine 2016 selected for the Georgetown Festival The Outsider The less I speak when I am pushed to fall skinless into the brooding sun beam My bright voice falls spiritless on its tongue the skirt of it tears and tears and seems unsure of its reflection It seems to rise up into the suns mouth and turn there to a muffled sigh Slowly it begins to purposely let itself go you see, nothing of the air can seem to stroke it without breaking it, upward and away and right when it's just about ready to lose its sensitivity to the salty wind it sees your face as salvation the heart of it burst open, it sees the ground as a giant god like fresh dirt, it meets the ground gladly and gladly, and gladly. Hear me read my published poem: \u201cWhere the Woods Open\u201d  ",

The people judged me and labeled me \u201ca threat\u201d, I was silent and continued preaching, Helping people to find what I was looking for, My eyes and my soul were searching, For a beauty that I regard now.

My every part is in love with you, Oh the master of existence. I am in the garden of mercy, And my heart is a place of beauty, I will continue preaching, no matter what. ",

You said to me, \u2018I cheat you', But it was heard by me, \u2018I love you'. I came behind and behind you, And now I understand you. I thought of you as my family member, But you crossed as a wrong number. Now I try you as a member, From out of my heart's chamber. The day we met, Your relationship I set, Your lullaby on my bed, Brought my eyes the wet. Forget the days of our promises, And days of compromise. I'll make our memories lost, The days will move very fast, I'll not turn to you at any cost, Do understand my word get lost. Thanks for scrolling, By making your time spending. -ASHIKA FATHIMA ",

Talking about our future-past, Of all the things we have gained or lost. How a certain thought would escape my mind, Then it would reach yours just in time. How you complete me, my words, my thoughts, I imagine my heart without you will completely be lost. Now as I stand here, In the scorching heat of the burning sun. This clearly states that you are gone, But also means my life as a individual has just begun. I now realize what I really miss, Not your warm hugs or comforting kiss. In all these years what I have really lost, Is the real me and my actual thoughts. Now that no one is by my side, I feel I am the one to guide. Now the decisions are to be made by me, They may be wrong, so let them be. As no mistake does really Last, I figure out only I can shape my Future-Past. This is about finding yourself after you loose the person who once defined you.This is kind of long too but I wrote whatever I felt like at that moment. ",

It hurts doesn\u2019t it\u2026All of the pain all of the heartache\u2026 But as much as it hurts I don\u2019t give up\u2026because I have someone that I fight for I wont ever stop caring about that one person in my life because she\u2019s just like me\u2026She\u2019s tragically beautiful, To be tragically beautiful means To have been hurt in a way that has made you shut off from the world\u2026 I'm tragically beautiful and always will be\u2026 Someone save me\u2026from my own tragedy\u2026. Last poem guys probably my favorite one I've created The Beauty of Three Words. There is magic in words They can destroy\u2026they can also make our entire day but words are truly magical\u2026 Words can protect\u2026they can shield us from this cruel world\u2026they can make us laugh They can make us shed tears\u2026They can make us feel something we haven't felt before A beautiful form of self expression A way to externalize the way we feel I never thought that my life could be affected so greatly by just three words I never thought words could be so powerful So let me share the three words that were said to me to you\u2026 I Love You.

All that I have ever wanted is to lay down with somebody, someone to clasp tightly, on the turf whilst counting the stars and watching the crimson light from Mars. All that I have ever wanted is to wake up next to a person who is the reason that I am still breathing, that I am smiling. All that I have ever wanted is to dine with someone by an ocean view as the setting Sun bids its adieu. All that I have ever wanted is someone to console me in times of adversity, someone to ensure that we will always have each other. All that I have ever wanted is someone to turn to when nothing goes well and someone to tell that \u201cI need you\u201d. You are all that I have always wanted. Though, you look happy already without me. ",

One of my favorite poems is one that is very sad, as it is one I wrote for my grandfather, Pal, before he passed away. He requested I write him a poem before he died. He was terminally ill with cancer. This is the poem I wrote him. Whisper Wind Whisper wind, willow, willow, Hang from the limb of a tree Chirp chirp goes the birdie sitting next to me. Whisper wind, whisper, whisper, do not lie to me. Holly tree, holly tree, right behind me. Whisper wind, whisper, whisper to the trees, let their leaves blow unto me, for I am the one you cannot see. Whisper wind, whisper, look at the bee, Let him soar, soar, buzz around me. Whisper wind whisper, it is half past three. If I am not ready wind, don't whisper to me. Whisper wind, whisper wind, look at me, Just tell me, just tell me, what do you see. Whisper wind, whisper wind, do you see us? It is we, we, up in the tree, Please wind, please, whisper to me. Weep not wind, for this ride is free, Whisper wind, whisper wind, come with me.

Example: The Monster-Called Rape: Between five and ten minutes the thrusts are over, but the pain remains forever with the victim; minutes ago, both friends were cheerful and happy, but for his temporary enjoyment, jaunty mood has turned a mortification for her. Because of his sexual urge, a tunic of ignominy, she is forced to wear; because of uncontrolled libido, shamefully, her nakedness the sex junkie has exposed. Because of heartless desire, a non-healing emotional pain, she may carry forever, for monster in him, her innocence she lost and for the lust and greed in him, her pride and dignity, he snatched away from her. Oh! Her life earned moral excellence, which carries life certificate of virtue- rapist ruined within minutes, decency, gravitas, and self-esteem, qualities nurtured for years-amoral and insanely- good-for-nothing-son-of-Adam- made her lose in a jiffy. Down her heart, pain and anguish hibernate, on the floor of her heart, dark moment of yesterday estivated; on the four walls of her heart, are permanent inscriptions- reminder that draws tears- from yesterday\u2019s savagery. In her mind is the recurring image of torment that has refused to obliterate, motion and still pictures of her capture in hands of a sluggard. Continually, her ears play those horrible cry of yesterday- with no one in sight to deliver her soul- every time she looks in a mirror she sees a violated and a subdued soul by a slugabed. Daily, image of Bondage, Discipline, and Sadomasochism BDSM, which has transformed to a tormenting shadow never depart from her; aberrant sexual behavior, which insanely human society elevates to a pre-eminent position of dominance and submission. Have you been abused by someone-you know or not? Have you been violated or disgraced by someone you love and trust? Oh! I feel your pain. Yes, I feel your pain- regardless of where abuse occurred: in public square, classroom, restroom, on marriage bed, moving bus, car seat, office table, jail house, hospital examination bed, on the wall, in darkness; rape victims suffer same fate- shame, hurt dignity, and misandry. From oriental to occidental monogamy to polygamy, endogamy to exogamy culture, without cultural, religious, and political bias declare war on rape. Men and women of goodwill, proclaim from your opened-windows, doors to rooftops, proclaim from north to south, east to west- our: daughters, sisters, aunts, wives, nieces, mothers, are not and should be sex objects, rather partners in a honorable sexual relationship. Let the World say no to rape Let the world of humankind: Remove Accursed Prosecute or (Punish) the Evil (R.A.P.E.) in our society; let us make society safer for Womenfolk. ",

But does he love her... Surely NOT on the same frequency that she vibed on  You see whenever she heard his name or saw his face  A tune came to mind that lit up her eyes and danced through her body, making the coldest day warm.. He had no idea the love that was waiting on him..  His voice played like a melody..slow and free in her soul.. Oooh... the songs she could sing about him She couldn't lie.. She was addicted and he had become her addiction and she wasn't quite sure she could let it go The rthymn of love that constantly ran through her veins like tingles of anticipation just ready..waiting, hopelessly for that Etta James \"Sunday kind of love\" The thoughts alone set her on a high that was unreachable by any drug  She was ready for him, but his heart.. His heart beat to a different drum.. She ached because he still had hers, but now she danced to the beat of a broken heart. She loved him..she really did. He loved her not. ",

I started and the poems came every day, one in the woods on a walk, I wrote 18 verses as I walked, they cam sometimes in the middle of the night, I wrote with biro but when I wrote two pages, in semi darkness, and there was nothing there I swopped for pencil, now I write on my iPhone. I can write three a day, they just come. I do not follow any pattern or law of poetry, I have read and loved my mother reading poetry to me and my sister as children. So my poetry is coloured by my experience of the 19thC poets and the language is not always so modern. But who cares!!! I do not write in order to be \u201ca poet\u201d just because they come and I enjoy the creating of them. I do not know the jargon about poetry like the length of a sonnet, I like to be free, so I suppose it\u2019s called freestyle. Here is an example, although it is only one kind, I write about so many things, usually nature being my muse. Following the Wind Following the waving trees the same direction as the breeze as if a thermal element was wafted with my gait as blown along beside the river downstream with its flow I felt a kind of impetus impulsive like a joy that grabs the psyche swings the spirit in high gear a thrill of moving onward through the day and year as if time were anonymous and I a mere convolvulus that happened to be flowering today Margaret Ann Waddicor August 2013 \u00a9 ",

But there was something highly appealing about expressing my thoughts and feelings in verse form. I ended up taking a long hiatus until my 30s, where I began writing poetry again. Shortly thereafter, I started posting my poems on Tumblr and Instagram. The latter is where I gained a lot of popularity in the early days of poetry emerging on the photo sharing platform. I was going to originally publish a book in 2015, but it was delayed two more years. I was going through a lot of emotional issues, with 2016 being my worst year in my life. I had a spark of inspiration again, in late 2016, and set out to publish my first poetry collection as a paperback. According to my research, I\u2019m the first poet to publish four books in 90 days. All published in 2017, under my Sosii Press imprint. As of writing this answer, I\u2019m planning two new poetry collections, that I want to publish in 2019. ",

I started it as a Challenge. Its a good story. Go Ahead . You\u2019ll Enjoy! It was around time when I was in 11th grade. One day as di(my sister), mom and I were and having our normal creative conversation. Which we loved to do. Di wrote something and showed it too us. We both like what she wrote. And my first words were, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can ever write poetry\u201d She said,\u201d I am challenging you, I\u2019m gonna say a topic and you and I we\u2019re both gonna write on it. You take your time as long as you can and write in whatever a way you want to mold this\u201d I\u2019ve always loved challenges and therefore accepted this one too. She gave me the title:- \u201cThought of falling in love\u201d. Keeping in mind about my first crush\u2026.I started. And wrote my first ever poetry. \u201cThe Thought of falling in Love is almost Killing,As it sometimes hurt my sweet feeling.Falling in love for me is so tough,With a person who is more then rough.But falling in Love sometimes makes me smile,It makes my feet fly high in sky.The person whom I'm gonna fall in love,Is going to be someone with a heart like dove.Though, thought of falling in love is not so good,Yet it could fill my belly without any food.When I will fall in Love the world will watch,For I am so tough.But if I ever get deceived in love,I will give up my thought of falling in LOVE.\u201d And I wrote it in 15 minutes. I read it out loud and the expressions that my mom and my sister gave well that was one of the best expressions I\u2019ve ever got in my life. After this there was no stopping and till date I\u2019ve written 50 poems and over 100 quotes. Some by experience some completely out of imagination. and there\u2019s no looking back!

When you write poetry, you don\u2019t have to explain everything. When you write, you can leave your heart on the pages. When I write, the crazy words pour out from my mind to cover the page, as if it has a will of its own. When I write, I do it for myself, for my own enjoyment, for peace and for joy. Poetry is something that I like to play around with and it\u2019s something that I do enjoy quite a bit. Here\u2019s some poetry that I wrote a while back, it\u2019s not perfect and I like it the way it is: Battle Wounds Scars cover me- from head to toe. Some you cannot see, not all received from foe. Friend a tricky word- I was betrayed by one, Maybe even my third. When will it be done? They lie and cheat- smile and break you, looking at you like fresh meat. Oh, what will I do? Chained and beat by their verbal blows. Even in the dying heat, I still grow. I have lasted long Nothing can scare me What they did was wrong, but at last I am free. Apart Silver in my eyes. Gold in my heart. Rivers run down as I cry, it is time to be apart. Steel in my gut. Fire in my veins. There would be no \u201cbut\u201d, even if all it gave me was pain. Words on my tongue. Promises in my mind. You acted as if stung, as if it was my find. Determination in my spirit. Sadness in my soul. Broken was your spirit, but it was fine time you go. Thank you\u2026 You taught me to learn. You taught me to love. May every leaf be turned, May I fly free like a dove. You taught me to be, To pray to God. To truly believe In myself, in me. I swam through the dark. You came in with the light, and along came the angel\u2019s hark. You lead me back to what was right. Thank you, Mom. Thank you, Dad. Always there during my \u201cbombs\u201d. Always there, even when I\u2019m bad. I love you guys. Thank you for all. Love never dies. Just know, I will never fall. ",

When I look through the window, I see tears of a neglected widow, Crying for a truth that we know, As they stage a regrettable show, To milk and sell her family cow, So that their joys can flow, This makes her life to be very low, Thanks to our greedy Heartless law, That puts her on a death row, When I gracefully walk out of the door, I meet the child, who begs from store to store, Thinking of neither school nor score, This is the angel we should adore, Our future that should beget us more, To be better than before, But we only see a social sore, As I jog along the wonderful boulevard, The images I bypass are very sad, Wearing a deadly scaring red, They perpetually shout hard, Hoping that they can be heard, They call all to be given a hand, So that they can softly land, In the usual public graveyard, To be another one numbered, If I sit down to feed, Needy cases attack with speed, Their eyes virtually eat all my food, When I sleep with my ever open head, I dream of the original creed, The call to be a fruitful seed, Never to be the bad weed, Ever to be the fountain of good, Then I conceive that I am mad, Because mankind is no more kind, Mankind is now madkind, Man\u2019s kind is dead, Mankind died, Mike N Nyaga 0726 813493 mikenen@yahoo.com ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I write huge volumes of poetry. Have also published about a thousand of them in books, online sites, magazines, newspapers, and journals. I love it. As a young kid I enjoyed playing with words and expressions. Over time the techniques developed even as the reading continued unabated. By the time I turned twenty, I was known as a pretty good poet. In those days before the Internet onslaught it was enormously satisfying to see your name in print and watch others reading your work. Their facial expressions encouraged me to continue. To me, poetry is the crystallised essence of language. Like music and art, poems say the nicest thing in the the subtlest of ways. The core idea is just a microscopic glimpse into creativity. Each time a poem is revised and reborn another new poem is created. Of the thousands published I cannot recite one single one. I have no explanation for this lapse. Each poem comes from a blazing furnace inside my mind and the sculptor's hands, the piano players nimble fingers, the flautists delicate notes and the artists gentle brush combines to create exquisite lines of poetry. How that happens I still dont know. I enjoy writing. It keeps me awake. It is the best thing I do. Everything else springs from this eternal fountain. Thank you. ",

The reason for that is I have aspergers, which is a developmental disorder affecting ability to effectively socialize and communicate. So that is one reason I write poetry. The second reason I write poetry is for it helps me find de-stress at the same time. I wrote a poem not to long ago for my grandpa passed away and that helped me out a lot too. Here is my poem. We all have it. It does not matter what your skin color is, your background, or even where you are from. It is determined to win, no matter what the cost is. No one can stop it no matter how are people try. It does not care what you have done. It is the most powerful weapon you can have. Nothing or no one can break it. You can try to reject it, but it will always be there in your life. We all say it at least once a day. We always mean it. Sometimes we do not say it enough. What I'm talking about is LOVE!!!! So yeah that is why I write poetry. ",

I am not a professional Poet however it is my hobby to write poems in my native language Telugu and sometimes in English. I find it is comfortable for me to express my feelings in my native language as I am much familiar to it. If I require to address the second part of your question here are my reasons for which I always tend to write poems and why I can strongly advocate the benefits of writing the poems or content. Poetry has given me a great insight of life and has taught me the expressive skills that which gives me emotional honesty.I always feel that writing poetry or a content is same as advancement in your personality.After I start writing Poems, I could feel listened to.It gave me immense confidence and strength to believe in my self.It has helped me to have my own identity.I can be judgmental about myself.Though lot of my poems talks about traumatic incidents of my life, It gives me a emotional relief after penning down it.It has become my skill to overcome from the sorrows.It helped me in getting rid of the stress situations in my life as I can divert my mind.If someone is inspired by your writings it is almost an achievement which is equivalent to winning the world.It has helped me to explore myself. It\u2019s always been surprising for me to learn new things about me.I hope I could answer your question. ",

How could I admire picasso with my blind eyes? How could I cry poems being dumb? I left numb, totally numb.

Not sure if his pools are of water or tear, Solitary confinement is what is queer. I know, I know you are pretty sure, Your wealth and riches are not the cure. (for the lack of peace that he suffers) Oh, I see, man on the side of tranquility, Alas, he wishes for more prosperity. Instead of loving an atmosphere serene, He thinks and whishes, \" what else could have been?\" Spending his days of happiness in disgrace, He throws his peace on the painful surface. Wishing for what the\"Materialistic man\" has, The \"peaceful one\" dreams while looking at the grass. (Because he knew for not having luxury and abundance.) Hope you like it ",

So, if you are looking into writing poetry for some reason. Think about why you like poetry and who or what you are writing for. Some people do it to remember someone or something after it's gone, sort of like a memoir. Others do it to express themselves. Many people write poetry when they have nothing better to do. Lots of people do it for school and some write poetry when they get a creative streak, or an inspiration hit. ",

Hans Zimmer woods speak of his broken bones and never respected glory. I walked over his face buried in snowy mountains. And absent mindedness. What a wonderful world, I sing. Bamboo sticks falling out the Jeep. This roaming foam of mirth , was a bit medical. I never used you for myself. I could never preach peach fruit lies to be muddy truths. You are Copernicus conundrums. My uncertain , unsaturated polyester pollen grain. Shifts , sifts between the pages. My name, father's holy fame. And what a brutal cut I make in the very fabric of my being. When I say love won't unite us. But something called belief could. Grief would. Raw angelic enthusiasm. My words are worth nothing. My life does. I can't relate to the mainstream mundane aesthete universe. Still I won't want to glorify that upheld placard of self obsession. So I close my eyes. Sing from your ceramic sights. Like I am forgetting one or more humans living between the spaces of my ribs. This woman need no assurances that things will get better. So I converted my mind into practical guide of queen of the hills. Dusted and burning. Silent still not echoing with silence. ~ Anavil  ",

A beautiful portrait that oxygenates me atlast! A beautiful portrait that hangs forever in the walls of my heart! ",

I have just published \u201cFOR A TROUBLED WORLD\u201d, a collection of beautiful and stunning poetry that is a poignant reflection on some of the burning issues of our times. It brings into focus our very humanity, our sense of right and wrong, our ability to discriminate between truth and falsehood, and our innate capacity to bring into the world the nobility and goodness within us. It is a telling reminder that we have to look within for peace and lasting happiness, but that we also have to awaken our social conscience, and be our brothers\u2019 keepers in tangible expressions of service and love. And there is the clarion call for us to fiercely resist all forms of discrimination, racism, and the deeply - rooted fanatic spirit. There is light, wisdom, and beauty, and the outpouring of humanity in this book. This book is now available at amazon and barnes & noble and other online retail sites. It will bring joy to both the young and the old. ",

Staring various people, striving to survive,His own will to live now began to fade,All He wanted was to rest in the shade, He sat in the darkness of his own heart,Trying to forget the agony , he thought, About the smile on his face various people brought. Then he Realized how important it was,To live and to bring a smile,To illuminate the darkness people hide. With restored will he rose, To win the Battle of life, But he lost, he fell, never to rise,But He now rests in the shade, after his demise. -vb My First Poetry. It might seem dark but that is the atmosphere there and this was my start as a poet. ",

Words alone can ne\u2019er express it the thoughts that deep inside me dwell. not poet nor author has e\u2019er writ this love which I\u2019m about to tell. A love which caught me in it\u2019s trap the day my eyes caught sight of you. although seemed merely chance or hap from the start God already knew. He planned it just the way He did in such a kind and loving way. to show us where all good is hid that we would at His bosom lay. On the day I saw your smile \u2018twas beauty to my inward heart. I wondered, would it take awhile? Could Cupid strike you with his dart? From week to week my love did grow. I longed to see you more and more. I longed to hear the day you\u2019d know The place that in my heart you bore The special day on which it came was not like any other day. I saw you, then I called your name Somehow I knew what you would say. Although our love was but a spark the flame was not too far away. The light would shine against the dark and make the night to turn to day. \u2018twould not be long before I knew you were that special one for me. The one that to I\u2019d say \u201cI do\u201d and hear her speak those words to me. ~Daniel Benitez ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I still write, but much less than before. There are not too many real poetry readers. Likewise, not too many real poets. The environment is not encouraging. Maybe only young and lonely college students search for poetry on their own, to read it, to feel comforted. I believe that it was a quite strange eruption of poetry sites on the internet, which in reality are social media sites, where people gather in order to connect and to share life experiences of their own, naming that chitter-chatter POETRY. I wonder if there are sociology studies about this phenomenon and statistics showing the extent of this habit compared to other social media, such as dating sites. I tried to share something beautiful in my poems because I was lonely. I failed to create something attractive or accepted. You can check my Goodreads blog, but I suppose you won\u2019t.

Find a plate and a free seat for him, Find a kind face without all the sin. A father he once had, a mother as well, He\u2019s no longer a part of this gathering swell. Brothers and sisters\u2019, he also had near, Now they don\u2019t even stop, to buy him a beer. On towards the kitchen this star of his night, Onwards for here he\u2019ll find a free bite. On he shuffles in his worn out old shoes, Only registering he\u2019s here, without any clues. Morning will come, all too soon enough, When he\u2019ll wander along, living it rough. Moved on again not wanted so close, On again filled with relentless remorse. One night of warmth to settle his bones, One night of food, so doesn\u2019t curl up his toes. One night in company of same likened men, One night that may not come, ever again. ",

Foxgloves in hedges, Surround the farms, My place is warm, And so are your arms. Daisies are pretty, Daffies have style, The nose is cute, And so is your smile. Roses are beautiful, Just like you. and another ive written in the past  Missing by wolfy How happy is the clear gap! Are you upset by how readable it is? Does it tear you apart to see the gap so crystal clear? I cannot help but stop and look at the grief deceased. Does the deceased make you shiver? does it? When I think of the sparse, I see a disdainful face. Pause to leaf, like the sparse does. I cannot help but stop and look at the little absent. \"Yowl\", said the absent, And \"yowl\" then \"yowl\" again. I cannot help but stop and look at the lonesome unavailability.

But if good prose is a skill, which can be learnt or taught, then poetry is the distilled essence of inspiration and, sadly, very few of us have the gift. Occasionally I get the urge but most end up in the waste paper bin. I did write a poem once about mutual oral sex merely to see if could write some smut but the convoluted metaphor of snakes having sex was so laughable that I posted it on my blog just so that people could laugh at it. I have written a few, mostly about love or unrequited love, but probably the one that I enjoy the most is about punctuation in a travesty of a homage to Roger McGough. Punctuation - for Sarah Why? Does it? Take her! So long! To get ready to go out? ",

The road which leads to my old home, Is perhaps asking the whereabouts of my youthfullnesss. Nothing much has changed, Except for the gained inches my feet suddenly seem to walk on! ",

Stop shouting with the silence vibes; You know it hurts a lot insides... Leaving behind every ties one day our life denies... Searching for me ur eyes dries; Disapperaingin skies she wont found anymore coz u left her cried ... Sweet and sour thats how its all; Leave and live innerone's cries... Dried seashore inside the soul; Its nothing what its looks like , Learnt that this is called life...\" --- ",

I teach myself as I age blindThat fools do love with poisoned mindsBut grow enchanted with a smileWhose visage does my soul beguileAnd twinkling eyes by force ensnareA mind still mutely unawareThat seeds which grow within my heartWith blossomed blooms do upwards dartRound aching ribs in writhing wreathsEntwined with pretty petalled leavesAnd spit down in my hollow chestA little bit of poison.

The monsters dance around the fire and cause havoc and bloodshed, but the people are in a hypnotized daze, and cannot make judgements for themselves. They have lost all ability to think for themselves, and do not see the destruction that is caused as the old virtues that had once kept society together are falling apart. To them, everything is relative, and the site of the monsters does not alarm them, causing them to become oblivious to their impending fate. All is well Anger, pride, lust, falsehood They dance around a bonfire Shreiking and howling like dire wolves As the old world withers within the flames - Beauty, truth, honor, courage They are nowhere to be seen They molder in the sweltering heat As ancient towers are ground to dust - The people sit around in a daze They no longer have control Souls have been sold, and hearts emptied They carry eyes of coal - Anger, pride, lust, falsehood They revel in their trance As into flesh their fangs pierce And blood is smeared on their wicked lips. - Yet the people refuse to see or hear They blankly stare ahead Without any spirit they repeat \"All is well, all is well\" ",

Anyways, enjoy. // Melancholy Like Lemon Honey // Melancholy like lemon honey A gushing, flowing breeze With sour pensive thoughts at mind A golden happy tease // As I lay in this field of daisies And flowers far past the view I think about my lemon honey house And the people in there too // My lemon honey cloak that Follows me through the night A curtain of reminder that The golden happy bites // And so I sit with my lemon honey Trickling in my sights For what am I without you? Ah melancholy, my dearest plights Analysis: This poem is about being sad for no reason and lemon honey is just like honey- sticky, enveloping everything and teasing gold. // I Watch // My thoughts feel like glue My mind, a chamber of hazy blue Giddy 4 foot girl in the middle Singing a tune I\u2019ve heard somewhere but That somewhere is too far away, seems a Riddle And so I watch // Theres no clock but I hear ticking No people but voices are licking my ears Taking bites of the sound, my eyes dreary And so I watch // This glue seep from what once was thin layers Now a cavern for surveyors She watches it close in I\u2019ll be in her prayers And so I watch No more. Analysis: this poem is about looking back at your past self, watching them oblivious to the thoughts that would grow as they grew up ",

Life We are lost in a busy life, Caught with struggles and strives. But what defines our life as busy, To come up with an answer is not so easy. Life is a book with so many pages,Each page describing different stages. Participating in an unknown race, Making our life busy with no free space. Life is a cycle of happiness and sorrow, With the uncertainty of the events in the morrow. Live each moment with a smile, Coz death is inevitable and it's not a lie. ",

Why do you demand my new creations?) I composed these lines when a loved one asked me to write again, all over. I stopped writing long ago because of the fear of expressing too much, weird as it may sound. I guess poets don\u2019t have a reason why they write poetries. It\u2019s like asking water why it flows or the wind why does it blow. It\u2019s something which happens to you, just like love, not something you do by applying efforts. I wrote poetries because it was like an intoxication for me. It was like being truthful at least to a paper; it was like words are writhing inside you dying to come out, and you are the only saviour for them. It was like a remedy dredged up by my soul to empty the mind, when it weighed too heavily. Poetry was freedom for me. I am a hostage ever since I stopped them from being born. ",

Someome leaves for, Someone better to walk in, Neither its your bad nor, A great loss happenin' Certainly not the epilogue, But a new chapter, Of your travelogue, Making your life even better. What you think is end, It is a new dawn, Will be a pleasant memory, When this era will be long on. Thanks for reading!!! ",

There\u2019s lots of different kind of poetry but they all express feelings and emotions, associating them with meaning and thought. Though it is very vulnerable, it is a very beautiful form of art for that reason. ",

It's basically about the sadness around me and how I'm unable to pull out myself out from it due to various reasons. \u2026here it goes again\u2026 Here it goes again, Broken promises,regret,same pain. I'm trying too hard to change the route of my mind, But it knows only one route,one of it's kind. It's the same filthy route,I've been walking on since a decade, Sadly, I'm unable to take a Left or right even though I see the truth naked. I ate all the negativity and I drank all the sadness, I'm wondering since a decade,what is the cure for this madness ? Every time I stand-up to do something new and get on with the hustle, I get lost within my mind cause it causes too much of unnecessary tussle. I feel defeated to this viscous circle and endless loop of lust, Please someone give me a helping hand to break this upper sadness of crust. I know I hold a greater potential than existing,I know I can do better, But sadly my life is a complete mess, exactly like the stuff inside the gutter. Neither I'm angry on god nor I'm disappointed on him, All I want is to get out of this unending useless whim. I know it's a naive poem. ",

Too often we get caught up in cliche ideas of what poetry needs to be (roses are red, violets are blue, etc) and we don\u2019t just put our heart into our work. Instead try this: write a brief story of something important to you, like an event or a feeling. Now try to make most of the lines you wrote very descriptive and unique (instead of saying, \u201cI went to the store afterward\u201d, say, \u201cLines of retail bricks and mortar sucked me in, moth to a flame.\u201d). You\u2019ll end up with a poem you actually like, rather than something you contorted yourself and your writing to create by trying to make it rhyme, etc. ",
