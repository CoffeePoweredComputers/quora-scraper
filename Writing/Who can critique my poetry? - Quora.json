I think over history a lot of writers work in a depressed, intoxicated stupor--it seems to go with the trade if you think of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faulkner (who had to be poured out of a bathtub filled with ice-cubes to deliver his Nobel speech), Lowell and Berryman, etc.  My guess is they all revised sober. You can post poems here or send them by message. I can't promise that I will praise them, but if they are praiseworthy, I would. ",

            "answer_text": "Art under the influence is almost never any good. But the alcohol or drugs or whatever will dull your critical faculties, which may help you put words on paper. While you're writing, you'll think it's great, too. Psychologists have actually done studies that compare the work and the artist's attitude toward his work both drunk and sober; these studies, unsurprisingly, are consistent with my first paragraph. An exception is the late Christopher Hitchens, who often (always?) wrote drunk and never seemed to need an editor. ",
