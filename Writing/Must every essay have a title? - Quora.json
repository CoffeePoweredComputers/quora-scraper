            "answer_text": "Yes, technically every essay should be titled, even if you wish to title it \u201cUntitled.\u201d However, the title of an essay is meant to allude to the subject and grab the reader\u2019s attention; an untitled (or \u201cUntitled\u201d) essay does not serve this purpose. Get creative and grab ahold of someone who normally would not pick up and read a random essay. Writing an essay about Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet? Don\u2019t title it \u201cHamlet.\u201d Instead, pick some interesting things that you touch upon in the essay. \u201cUnrequited: A Look at Love in Hamlet\u201d or \u201cTo Kill or Not to Kill: Hamlet\u2019s Inaction\u201d (a play upon recognizable words from the work will usually score). The title doesn\u2019t need to be elaborate (in fact, a title too long or indecipherable will always force a reader away). But, it must be interesting. Finally, if an academic essay, the subject should almost always be in the title. An essay on algae as biofuel? \u201cGreen Gasoline\u201d won\u2019t fulfill a professor\u2019s expectations. Instead, something like \u201cEco-friendly: Algal Biofuels and Scum Farming\u201d will steer the audience toward the topic nicely. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not mandatory for an essay to have a title, but it might be required by a specific teacher. Not only that, but titles are great and an easy way to make teachers happier, thereby increasing your mark. Titles not only tell the reader what your essay is about, but they show your teacher that you have reflected on your writing. I personally recommend titles on all things students write because it is more likely to appeal to your reader, and will likely improve your marks as well as your own understanding of what you wrote.
