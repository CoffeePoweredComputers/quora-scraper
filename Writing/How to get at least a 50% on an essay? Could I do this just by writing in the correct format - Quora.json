            "answer_text": "A so-called \u201ccorrect format\u201d is just broad architecture. What you really need is content. If you have a well-thought out thesis, and good arguments laid out in an organized, cohesive way, you don\u2019t need to abide the \u201ccorrect format,\u201d whatever your definition of that is. The best way to achieve 50% on an essay is to aim for 100%, and if you fall short, you\u2019ll probably be in the range of 50\u201380%. Read essays and articles in magazines like TIME or Newsweek. Get familiar with clear, well-written sentences/paragraphs. Add new vocabulary to your repertoire. Become well-informed so you have content (current events, history, opinions, facts, trends, scientific studies, etc.) to draw upon when you actually write that 50% essay. ",
