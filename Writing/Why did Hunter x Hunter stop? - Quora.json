            "answer_text": "Many still quote the back pain problem of Yoshihiro Togashi(Mangaka) being the reason. Togashi did say his back pain is from bad posture when he was gaming.(And from his own drawings, he didn\u2019t seem to be correcting it even after it became such a hinder to his work.) While he had assistants before(One actually published a manga about his assistancehood during the Yu Yu Hakusho period), he is also very against the idea of using assistants, so that didn\u2019t really help in his excuses.(Some of the newer chapters he seemed to have his wife as his assistant) Also, he is not really blaming his hiatus on his back pain(at least not any more). In 2018 he claimed that he has issues with the heavy tax rates: \u8d85\u8840\u6c57\uff01\u6240\u5f97\u88ab\u62bd\u8d7070%\u3000\u96e3\u602a\u51a8\u6a2b\u8981\u7576\u4f11\u520a\u738b and is very frustrated that if he worked 20 hours a day, 14 hours of it is taken away. (The page is in Chinese, but the second image is a photo of the comment in Japanese, copied from the 50th anniversary special of Jump) People have speculated that the 70% tax he claimed cannot be correct(the highest rate is 45%. But since he is saying 70% of his work output is not received by him after tax, he may also be saying a lot of it is taken by the publishing company.(but he obviously don\u2019t want to offend the company so he blame it on tax instead) He really couldn\u2019t care less about money since other than his own earnings(even if he stop working, the sales of previous works), his wife\u2019s earnings(His wife is the author of Sailor Moon in case you don\u2019t know) are still creating a large inflow of income for their family of 4. Also, Naoko Takeuchi(his wife, now technically Naoko Togashi but she didn\u2019t change her name in many registers and people are still referring to her with her maiden name) is from a VERY rich family running a jewellery business to begin with. Some say that he is a perfectionist and keep scrapping ideas and redoing them, thus given the chance and freedom(The publisher is no longer chasing him down for new chapters) he tends to keep improving his work. So is it laziness that got him into the hiatus? Maybe. But it is obvious that there are many layers to this story, laziness is only a combination of frustration of high taxes and loyalty fees paid to the company, family life, perfectionist ideals, no immediate need of bread making for income and maybe slightly because of back pain. Everything points to \u201cno outcome\u201d even if he did worked on the story. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to be technical. It didnt end The creator of Hunter x Hunter Yoshihiro Togashi is on hiatus. For two years. After multiple years. Now here look at this image of his \u201cHiatus chart\u201d if you will  He says he has back pain which is why he is on Hiatus so much and he also says the manga company is putting to much stress on him. If you wanted my opinion I call cap. You see my mom has had back problems so do you know what she did? She had surgery and we\u2019re by no means rich but Togashi is RICH he could fix his back anytime he wants I doubt it\u2019s just his back. He also says it\u2019s stress which it could be everyone handles stress differently but he\u2019s not handling it good he could just end the manga right here and i\u2019ll be more happy instead of having everyone wait here THE MANGA CAME OUT IN 1998 AND HE\u2019S ONLY IN CHAPTER 390 HE\u2019S TAKEN ALMOST TWO YEARS OFF. You know what shows came out and ended by that time? Tokyo ghoul 143 chapters, Attack on titan 132 IT COMES OUT MONTHLY and each chapter is like 2 chapters for god sake(Yes I know it didnt end yet but its close to), NARUTO CAME OUT AFTER HUNTER X HUNTER IT HAS 700 CHAPTERS WEEKLY FOR GOD SAKE BLEACH ENDED(The anime) AND THE MANGA IS AT CHAPTER 686 BOTH OF THESE SHOWS MAIN CHARACTERS HAVE KIDS NOW?!?!. These are (Mostly) Weekly mangas that started after hunter x hunter and are either still going or finished and have more chapters than hunter x hunter. Personally I just think Togashi isnt interested into writing the manga. I mean just think about it the dude\u2019s net worth is estimated to me 25 MILLION ?! He has no obligation to keep working he\u2019s set for life and I doubt he\u2019ll ever finish Hunter x Hunter. So now you\u2019re probably asking? Why doesnt he just give the manga to someone else like Akira Toriyama or do it once a month a page a day isnt very much. To answer you I have NO CLUE. He has said that he\u2019ll \u201cFinish the manga or die\u201d which it looks like he\u2019ll die before it finishes (Not trying to be rude) Because he still has A LOT to cover. He\u2019s still in the dark continent expedition arc WE\u2019RE NOT EVEN THERE YET we\u2019ve been in this ark SINCE 2012 MY GUY THIS SHOW IS OLDER THAN ME AND I\u2019M ALREADY OLDER THAN THE MAIN CHARACTER WHY. I know i\u2019m sounding really rude right now as he has no obligation to actually continue this series but he has many options instead of leading on thousands of fans like fixing your issues. If he has back problems there are many solutions. For his stress I doubt he\u2019s having stress he\u2019s had 2 years off and multiple months after months off. He could again just give the manga to someone else at this point I\u2019d rather him just give the story to an experienced story teller than just leave us hanging. Oh yea and just for reference this is Eiichiro Odas Hiatus chart  It only goes up past 2018 but he\u2019s been pretty consist with manga only taking 1 break per month for only a week because he does it EVERY WEEK and every manga chapter still has as much detail as manga chapter 1 AND I CANT EVEN FIND AKIRA TORIYAMA BECAUSE THE MAN WAS A LEGEND ",
