            "answer_text": "The other movies do express human emotions and contexts - the toys/bugs/cars/robots/etc. are just a pretense. These characters are all anthropomorphized to the extent that they might as well be human. The rest is dressing and metaphor.  One indicator of this is that all of these characters bear human faces and/or body language (and far more often the former than the latter).  Even characters that don't have a human-like body plan (head, legs, arms) move almost as though they did (e.g. the fins on fish in Finding Nemo are used to gesture the same way people gesture with hands). The human capacity to recognize and interpret facial expressions is very deeply ingrained, so it's relatively simple to make something \"read\" like human to us - put a loosely human face on it, and have it behave loosely like a human's would (and steer clear of the Uncanny Valley).  As another illustration on the body-language side of things, consider the hopping lamp that was Pixar's Mascot: It moves like a person, and we could pinpoint where a person's body parts would be on it, even though it has no limbs or face. Add even some limbs and the basic parts of a face (notably, the eyes), and you've pretty much got Wall-E or one of the toys from Toy Story, etc. ",
