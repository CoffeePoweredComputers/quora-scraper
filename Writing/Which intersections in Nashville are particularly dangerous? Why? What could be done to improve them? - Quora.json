            "answer_text": "It seems that while we've put in a number of roundabouts, people don't know how to use them down here yet. So I've seen a number of accidents or cars stopped in the middle of roundabouts just because people don't know how to use them yet. Perhaps education on how to use these would improve the safety.  Also, Jefferson street between Rosa Parks and the Cumberland River has a lot of pedestrian cross traffic, but no crosswalks and few lights. Many people have close calls from cars that speed down the road. More lights, stop signs, and crosswalks will eventually alert drivers that the area has high pedestrian traffic.  ",
