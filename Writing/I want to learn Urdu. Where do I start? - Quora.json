            "answer_text": "I think the first step would be to learn the Perso-Arabic script. I'm going to assume that you already know how to speak Urdu, so reading/writing is just the next step.   \u200bSo above is a picture of the Urdu alphabet. Once you get accustomed to what letter makes what sound, it becomes pretty easy to write words. I'd suggest that you go onto YouTube and look up videos on learning the Urdu language, as those can be a great asset when trying to understand how the language is written.  I was in a similar position to you about 2 years ago. I could speak Urdu (I wasn't that fluent, but I could converse coversationally), but I didn't know how to write the language nor read it too well because I was born and still live in the US, so it can be difficult for parents to teach their children Urdu because English is what children are taught in school. Anyways, I already knew how to read the Arabic script because being a Muslim, I have to be able to read the Quran which is written in Arabic. So I think we had some books at my house for elementary school children on learning Urdu. So I would sit down with my mom and read aloud the alphabet and then try and read passages from Urdu children's books. You see, the difficult think about learning to read/write Urdu is that when word are written,  diacritics are very rarely included so it can be difficult to read words especially if you don't know that word in Urdu.  At that time, I also went onto YouTube and found a video series which I'll link below that covers a lot about the Urdu script and how to read it.  After I became a little more comfortable in reading the script, I would go online an search up Urdu shayari, look on Google images, and try to make out the words that were being used so that I could get more practice with reading Nastaliq script. Also one thing you can do is to try and read BBC Urdu articles for more practice.  Now reading/writing Urdu is not too hard for me. The only tricky part about writing Urdu is that some words that are borrowed from Arabic contain letters that have sounds that are found in other letters of the alphabet. Examples: in Urdu, \u06be\u060c\u062d\u060c \u06c1 can all have a similar 'h'  sound, but \u062d is found mostly in words borrowed from Arabic. \u062a\u060c\u0637 have the same 'th' sound, but \u0637 is found mostly in Arabic words\u0633\u060c\u0635 have the same 's' sound, \u0635 is found in  Arabic words\u0636\u060c\u0638\u060c \u0632\u060c \u0630 all hace the same 'z' sound, but \u0637 and \u0636 are found in Arabic loan words The only thing that can be done to become accustomed to these words is just to memorize which letter is used in the word.   Lastly, once your able to read and write more, it's helpful to have an Urdu-English  dictionary to reference if you don't know how to spell a certain Urdu word, but you know it's English equivalent. On Android, I suggest the app below.   \u200bBut you'll have do to a little bit of scavenging on the apps store of your phone to find the dictionary that works best for you.  It's difficult at first, but I think it's definitely pays off. And Nastaliq is such a beautiful script to look at, so that's also a plus point of learning to write Urdu.

            "answer_text": "Hey there, Firstly let me tell you that learning Urdu(verbal) isn't that difficult, but learning how to read and write is quite difficult. Well quite very much difficult. (No intentions to scare you, but telling you the truth) The Urdu script is completely different from the Devnaagri script.  1. Each word has a different form depending on its location - the beginning, the middle or the end.  2. Urdu when written is usually without vowels. For ex : Wht shld I strt lrnng as a frgn lngge? (Note : The single consonants have been written so to make sense) So now in the above sentence you can pretty much make out what is written, because you've studied english for years now. And you also understand the context. So Urdu (as seen in magazines, newspapers) is written without the vowels just as shown in the example. 3. There are different alphabets for the same sound! The sound \"aa\" can be expressed by Alef or Aayeen. The sound \"Ka\" is expressed by 2 different alphabets. But which one is the right one can be learnt only by practise. How to nail it? See, when you're learning a new language (Urdu is close to Hindi but still there are differences in the vocabulary) and that too with a new alphabet, it takes time, hell lots of time. And if you're motivated to learn it, no-one can stop you from nailing it! The first step : Learn and memorise the alphabet. It can take anytime between 2 days to 2 weeks to master it. (I learnt the Arabic alphabet in 2 days, but it took me around 2 weeks to memorise and master it) The second step : See how are they used in the words. As I stated above, words can take different forms depending on their position, learn the structures. Third step : Learn the words. Learning \"Elephant\" is easier as compared to learning \"Elphnt\" as the latter doesn't have an vowels. So learn how are the different words written. Step four : Vocabulary and grammar. Vocabulary can be helped over by anyone aged in your family. IMPORTANT POINTS TO NOTE: Make sure you do watch Urdu shows. DD Urdu can be of great help. The Zindagi Channel shall help you a lot in getting familiarized with the culture and different words (And trust me Pakistani shows are way better than Indian shows. If you rate Pakistani shows as 10/10, Indian shows don't even deserve a -10!) Read Read Read! Join a Delhi Public Library (if you're in Delhi) or some public library or subscribe to some Urdu newspapers and spend atleast an hour reading them. It'll help you build your vocab, improve your grammar and shall familiarize you with the different rules. Best of luck! Salaam :) ",
