The interesting thing is how many really great books are on Amazon which Trad publishers blew the author off over, forcing them to be Indie published, after which they laughed in the face of Trad publishers trying to pick them after after being a huge success. The interesting thing is how many truly terrible books became best sellers, and were picked up for movies. The wonder is not about bad books on Amazon. When anyone can upload a book, and millions do, having a high percent of bad books is a given. The wonder is, of the millions of books uploaded, with something like 1000 new ones every day, how many of them are NOT bad books! As far as bad books go, if all you see is bad books, all I can say is :- You\u2019re looking in the wrong place for your reading. ",

            "answer_text": "There are so many badly written self-published books on Amazon simply because it\u2019s possible to self-publish any book, even a bad one, on Amazon. If you\u2019re looking for something to blame, you may as well blame the internet as a whole, because if it weren\u2019t for Amazon and Smashwords, the bad writing would still be out there, and the people who write it would still be expecting money for their \u201cimmortal prose.\u201d If a book is badly written, self-publishing isn\u2019t the cause of it being bad. It\u2019s just that a self-published author doesn\u2019t have to bother with all the \u201ctrivia\u201d (please note the sarcasm quotes!) of editing and proofreading and just making sure the book is readable\u2026 so some don\u2019t bother with any of that.
