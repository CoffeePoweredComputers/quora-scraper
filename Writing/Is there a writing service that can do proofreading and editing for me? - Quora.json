            "answer_text": "Although many companies distinguish between editing and proofreading, I prefer to do both at the same time. As I read an essay or press release or ANY written work, grammatical errors can affect concepts and ,therefore; distort clarity and intent. There is no extra charge for my clients for this dual service. \u201cWin With Perfect Writing\u201d is the name of my company. Check it out at winwithperfectwriting.com. I do not charge by the page or word but prefer to give a free evaluation in the form of sample writings first, to see whether we are a good match. My rates will adjust according to the client\u2019s budget. While both proofreading and editing are time consuming, this service should not be priced excessively for the author of a book, a business owner and especially for a student. ",
