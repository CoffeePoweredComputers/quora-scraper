            "answer_text": "Both.  Though it's likely that underneath that wittyness is more specific talents--probably ones related to relating to or influencing people, or strategic thinking.  Gallup, leaders in the field of talent identification, divide talents up into four main domains:  Relating (to people and other living things) Thinking (working smarter) Striving (ability and stamina for doing stuff) Influencing (having an impact on people and the world around them) Talk show host Conan O'Brien would have talents related to at least two of those domains--such as Relating to people, and especially Influencing people, as that's where he gets his satisfaction from: seeing people laugh.  So you could say witt is both a trait and a skill, with underlying talents. ",

            "answer_text": "As Bruce Achterberg already noted, it's a bit of both. However, just as with musical ability, eventually practiced skill comes into play a bit more often than mere talent. Genuine comedic timing remains one of the most difficult-to-master abilities there is (just compare Tim Conway or Bob Newhart with Johnny Carson). Without it (no matter how brilliant), kiss much of your wittiness goodbye. As the American Bard, Mark Twain (i.e., Samuel Clemens) was reputed to say, \"The only problem with snappy comebacks is they take two weeks to think up.\" More accurately, Twain said, \"It usually takes more than three weeks to prepare a good impromptu speech.\" Few wiser words have been said. I hope that this helps. ",
