            "answer_text": "How do people get started with a PhD dissertation? Possibly the hardest thing to do is start the introduction, after all it is the way you ease the reader into what you have spent your last few years living with. Having written two, the way I have approached them both is a really basic lead into the subject. I will give you the two I have written, They are what I have done but in now way am I suggesting that they are correct. 1996 Ph.D chemistry 1.0 Introduction Hydraulic cements are powders that react with water to generate hard, solid matrices, that continue to increase in compressive strength even when the matrix is placed in excess water1. Within this category are ordinary Portland cement (OPC), high alumina cements (HAC's) and calcium sulpho-aluminate cements (CSA's), the properties of which are described later in this introduction. The cement chemist's notation is outlined in Table 1.1. This notation uses letters to represent oxides, allowing the chemical stoichiometries of constituent phases to be written in a \u201cshorthand\u201d For example, Ca2SiO4 is represented as C2S, which is the algebraic summation of 2 x CaO + SiO2 = Ca2SiO4. 2020 Ph.D Chemical Engineering 1.1 Thesis The topic under consideration in this doctoral thesis is entitled \u201cProperties of bentonite mixtures for plugging coal seam gas wells\u201d. This thesis discusses the creation, testing, failure modes and all mechanisms needed to produce an engineered plugging system which is sufficiently flexible to be custom designed on the well site by simply running a prediction program. The thesis is divided into an introduction (Chapter 1) and three divisions. Chapters 2 & 3 review the literature expansion theories and methods currently in use. Chapters 4 & 5 detail the methods used and empirical results obtained during testing. Chapters 6-10, each chapter represents a focused discussion on one aspect of the thesis, and contain the discussions and reasoning behind the various models and theory needed to complete this thesis. Chapter 6 contains\u2026 Now there is apparently no continuity between either of them, however, in reality, the second thesis introduction runs the opposite way to my first thesis. In my first I had to explain to a bunch of chemists that the normal chemists notation does not apply. Where as in my second, I did the thesis structure first to explain why they were going to read a load of blerb which apparently does not have any association to what the thesis was about but was in fact setting the stage much like the first for everyone to understand where they reader was going to be lead. The only way I can explain the process is that I was using the very first paragraph to launch the reader in the correct direction before taking them off in a strange direction. In the first I was pointing out that their fundamental assumptions about the symbology being applied was abnormal. in my second, I was explaining that there are two chapters of literature review, the first is chemistry, the second is geology/ industrial practice. The introduction is a leader into the maze, You know the answer before you begin, they dont! You have to walk them through the total logic in your thesis. ",

            "answer_text": "My tip is this. Once you have got into the subject (and don\u2019t spend too long just finding more references because it is comfortable, start thinking) write the abstract. That\u2019s right the abstract of the work you are about to do and the results you will get. You don\u2019t know what these are but you should have some hopes. If you have already done some work, the sooner you write the abstract the better. This is the abstract of a successful PhD. No excuses. The word \u2018unfortunately\u2019 will not appear. It is not a list of \u201cvarious experiments were carried out and results will be shown\u201d. It is \u201cby testing the\u2026 it has been demonstrated that\u2026 and as a consequence\u2026\u201d This will firstly put you into the right frame of mind (success) but also make you think about what you have to do in order to achieve it. It stops you wasting time messing about with minor issues and omitting something major that the External Examiner will jump upon. (Obvious comparisons; control experiments; alternative explanations etc.) Then you should sketch out a contents list. Continue to work on this, with sub-sections, just so you keep a track of what needs to be done. Believe me, you are likely to forget something if you don\u2019t write it down. If you have left the dissertation till you have \u201cfinished\u201d the work, then doing the abstract and contents should tell you if there is any work you should have done. It might be as simple as checking some references or might be a significant effort to gather data or proof. Expect to change both the abstract and contents as you progress. It is fine if conclusions are the opposite to what you expected, just so long as they are conclusions. The conclusions are some of the most important features. They should not be a summary of work done, but what is now known. This can include things like the data or historical documents not being able to distinguish between two possibilities. ",
