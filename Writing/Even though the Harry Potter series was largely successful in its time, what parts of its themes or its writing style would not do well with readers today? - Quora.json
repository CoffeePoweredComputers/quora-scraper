            "answer_text": "This is both an answer to the above question, as well as a comment on 'progressiveness' in general. It might be worth a read even for non Harry Potter fans. In my opinion, it'd be more of the 'progressive' stuff that today's media is making a diehard push for. This has its share of good, sure, but it\u2019s also mostly bad in how they're doing it. For example, when writing a story, you can't just throw in some supposedly Asian character and call her 'Cho Chang' these days without getting some sort of hurt feedback. Not many readers might've cared back in the 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s, but since almost everyone is a social-justice warrior of some sort these days, you're likely to find blogs, tweets, and all sorts of rants against Miss Chang.  In addition, you're likely to get some infamy in the LGBTQ community for not including any homosexual, bisexual, or whatever have you kinds of characters and relationships in the books, even though Harry Potter is set in the 90\u2019s. People want their pride represented in some way across the media these days, and I can especially see this type of humour generating some anger: Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter, then adopted a high-pitched whimpering voice. \u2018\u201cDon\u2019t kill Cedric! Don\u2019t kill Cedric!\u201d Who\u2019s Cedric \u2013 your boyfriend?\u2019   Typical 90\u2019s kid (or older) response: Lol, that is kind of funny. (Because we used to make these kinds of jokes without fear of getting harassed by activist movements, back in the day). Most likely reaction from today's generation: How dare JK Trolling make fun of homosexuality! How dare she mock those kinds of people for their choices in life \u2026 Many lines of rants and social-justice speeches later: #RowlingMustFall! Moral of the story: you can't even fully release your story the way you might want these days, for fear of activist nitpicking and reprisal. In further addition, 'Parvati Patil' and 'Padma Patil' might draw criticism from readers or critics who might accuse Rowling of only putting them in for representation, and nothing more.  Right, so you're likely to get hate for NOT putting in people of colour (or whatever have you) as well as when you DO actually put them in. A lose-lose situation, eh? The only way around this would be to give the Patils a bigger role in the plot, and thus not feed the readers who might be looking for some social-justice thing to complain about. Ah, and then there's the infamous 'Black Hermione' thing that went around, and might still be going on. OK, let's suppose that Harry Potter hits the shelves these days, and it's written exactly as is. Well, things like this: \u2018NO YOU DON\u2019T!\u2019 roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned \u2013 \u2018Get out of the way!\u2019 he shouted at Ron and Hermione. They didn\u2019t need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron\u2019s wands. Ron crawled to the four-poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg. And this: Hermione\u2019s white face was sticking out from behind a tree. are likely to draw two kinds of notoriety today: \u2018Representation\u2019 discussion (more like arguments and online threats).Animal-cruelty discussion.I'm not going to go into detail with regards to the second; but for the first, we'll probably get all sorts of differing opinions on how people imagine the characters might look. That's fine, except for when some feel the need to make it MANDATORY that at least one of the trio be of colour. Why does that have to be important? Like, it's not an issue unless it's unnecessarily brought to worldwide attention. Sure there's no outright description of the main trio's skin colour, I think, but we can make heavy inferences at various points from Rowling's writing. As far as I, and many other readers I know, pictured Hermione before even seeing her on-screen, this comes pretty close:  The biggest problem today is that the manner in which people 'fight' for representation ends up having the reverse, ironic effect on its target group. For example, I know many women who don't really feel 'disempowered' or 'objectified', but the moment things like: \u2018OMG, LOOK AT THE FEMALE JEDI, REY, KICK ASS (but is cringe, a Mary Sue, and a bland character in general) IN STAR WARS!\u2019  (Please excuse the typos. I didn't make this image.) or \u2018LOOK AT THIS SUPER COOL (but cringy) ALL-FEMALE-HEROES SCENE IN AVENGERS: ENDGAME!\u2019  or \u2018LOOK AT THE GENDERBENT, LADIES-CAN-KICK-BUTT, TOO (but so obviously while trying to show women of different colour and body types) GHOSTBUSTERS CAST!\u2019  stuff happens, then those ladies I know shake their heads, cringe, and go 'noooo' in disbelief. Another example? All hail the 'first' big-screen black hero!  Never before has a person of colour been shown in Hollywood like this! Oh, wow! This is groundbreaking! Er \u2026 Um \u2026  Wesley Snipes did it in his Blade films without the media going around marketing the whole damn thing over his skin colour \u2014 or at least not to the point of Black Panther, where the whole thing was pretentiously focused on the fact that the film 'celebrated' people of colour. How people likely perceived it: Black Panther: Wow, look at our glorious Wakanda! Look at the fact that we're speaking our language on the big screen! Look at our token black-character (*cough* marketing, *cough*) Look at [insert 'progressive' message here]. Blade: Yes, I am a black man. OK, sure, cool. Now here's my awesome film(s) to watch. Do enjoy. Some supposedly \u2018disempowered/body-shamed/person of colour, etc.\u2019 people whom I knew felt that by going to the cinema and by trying to enjoy such films (except for Blade, which never tried to shove itself down our throats), they made it super obvious that they were mainly attracted by the fact that their race, body type, etc. was being shown on-screen. In other words, the 'disempowered' group felt even more uncomfortable just being seen watching this social-justice fest. When I was younger: Black kid (or any age) to their non-black friend: \u201cHey, did you see that awesome Daywalker? Blade is so cool, isn't he?\u201d Non-black kid (or any age): \u201cYeah, totally! Did you see \u2026\u201d And they proceeded to talk about the film without feeling a hint of discomfort, except for things which happened in the film itself (blood and gore, etc.) which is perfectly fine. Today, most likely: Black person of any age: \u201cDid you see Black Panther?\u201d Non-black person of any age: Feels nervous. HAS to give a positive response (even if they hated the film for any normal reason) for fear of being labelled a racist. \u201cEr, yeah, haha. It was a good movie, wasn't it?\u201d And they proceeded to have a shallow conversation about the film. Yes, I know that Snipes's films are super old, and that we needed some newer stuff, but that doesn't excuse the new stuff to go and market every damn thing over their in-your-face social-justice messages. Shoving in social messages like that actually exaggerates the feeling of disempowerment at times. Another example? Mass Effect: Andromeda (released 2017) and how it so obviously, so cringily, and so blatantly made only the males in its game handsome, while the women were deliberately designed to be ugly in order to combat the so-called 'objectification' of women.  Like, just leave that stuff out of our books, films, and video-games, people. Honestly! And if you are going to do it, then do it with style, nuance, and not in a ridiculously IN-YOUR-FACE kind of way. For example, Mass Effect 2 (released 2010) gave us the character Miranda Lawson, who's the living embodiment of an objectified, genetically engineered, 'perfect' woman.  (Yep, she's voiced by and facial-scanned from Yvonne Strahovski. Notice the amount of effort that this Bioware team put into getting her right, in 2010, as compared to the sabotage done by that other, social-justice team years later to Andromeda's main female-character?) However, the series also gave many flaws and a good bit of depth to Miranda's character, and ultimately showed that there's more to a woman than just her looks. In that same game, we had the complete opposite but surprisingly similar woman called 'Jack'. She looked like a bald, trashy, scantily clad thug.  But the series ultimately showed that she's just as vulnerable as the 'perfect' Miranda, and that she's got a lot of depth to her character, too. They were both memorable, quality characters in a quality storyline in the end. And coming back to Blade vs Black Panther, the former did it by NOT making the target group feel segregated/special/whatever from the rest. It gave us just another superhero much like the rest. The same can be said of the old Mass Effect games (the \u2018OG trilogy\u2019, so to speak), in that the women whom they wanted to use as a means of delivering a positive comment towards women in general were just there, as per normal, the whole time. No dumbing down and 'uglification\u2019 of their facial scans (as in Andromeda), no obvious social-messages, etc. Now that's how you do it. But Black Panther already did the damage (yes, I'll use that word), because now there's a good chance that every subsequent black-protagonist or black-setting, etc. film that gets released will be overshadowed by social-justice stuff. It creates tension and division in society instead of doing the opposite and bringing people together in favour of building a more inclusive world. So coming back to the question, if Harry Potter was to be released today in its exact form we know, there'll more than likely be a high degree of social-justice nitpicking taking centre stage, and Rowling would then be called up to answer endless questions about \u201cWhy isn't x type of sexuality or person represented?\u201d or \u201cWhy is it mainly the wizards that are powerful, as opposed to the witches?\u201d or \u201cWhy isn't at least one of the trio a person of colour?\u201d, etc. Back in the 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s? JK Rowling likely just wrote her books, made sure that there's nothing illegal in them (the big stuff, like underage sex and all that), and went and released it. The average reader of that time likely just picked up the book, appreciated the plot and its characters, and, you know, took an interest in the story \u2014 as opposed to looking for some 'representation'. No harm done, and not much (if any) need to make some social grandstanding in the media. Awareness is fine. But shoving it centre stage at the cost of quality, plot, franchises, characters, etc. is not. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea of not having technology would be a huge issue for the kids who live, learn and love on their smart phones, laptops, computers and games. What boy and some girls wouldn\u2019t want to spend a Saturday playing video games instead of watching Quidditch in the rain? And writing on parchment with real ink would not go over to well in this age of laptops, where the kids just open them up and start typing a paper. The muggle born would show this stuff to the purebloods and they would want in on the technology too.  I can hear Hermione now. \u201cThe ceiling of the Great Hall is enchanted.\u201d I read that on my phone on the trip up here. Wha?!  They\u2019d have to be terribly cautious on their social media, because kids flying on broomsticks wouldn\u2019t be kept a secret. Someone takes a shot of the strange creatures inhabiting the Forbidden Forest or McGonagall is on a video of her transforming from a cat into her, well it\u2019s going to uncover lots of the wizarding world, unless\u2026 the wizards can discover charms for social media and computers. The themes of Harry, Hermione and Ron going it alone still works. More time should be spent on Ginny\u2019s development, because teens love. Ardently. Passionately. Impulsively. Harry can\u2019t have a chest monster in him. He has to be seen wooing Ginny, with Ginny feeling happiness around Harry. A good happiness. The same with Hermione and Ron. Their relationship as lovers needs to progress over time with endearments, fooling around, and fights. All of it. More love. More Ginny too.  Kids see through the improbable, so Voldemort has to become a lot scarier than any film out there. Does he eat Inferi? Good, that\u2019s disgusting. Make him worse than he is now. He has to crush Bellatrix or Lucius to within a second of their lives, when they ruined his Horcruxes and Voldemort found out about it. Crush them the way the Emperor does it, soundlessly, against a wall, not being able to breathe. Terror. More abject terror. McGonagall has to be afraid of him. Very.  I\u2019m more terrified of dementors. Seriously.  The writing style, being driven by dialogue works. The theme of a boy wizard who lived with muggle relatives and he learns how to be a fully functioning wizard whilst readying himself for a duel with Voldemort, that terrifying man. More deaths during the school year might make the stakes higher. Dumbledore cannot have all the answers. No one has them all. So make some students die throughout the books. Does the basilisk kill Colin Creevy? Maybe. It\u2019s more on par with the violence and darkness in the world today.  And diversity. We expect more of it now. Gay characters. Not every other person, but enough to notice. Every one is capable of having magical blood, no matter their background. I can see that in students and staff. That\u2019s all I can think at the moment. I\u2019m sure their are loads more coming\u2026 ",

Harry being forced to return to an abusive household year after year, teachers cruelly bullying students, horribly serious pranks played by students (ex Fred and George shoving Montague in a Vanishing Cabinet, Sirius nearly sending Snape to his death). All under the \u201c\u201cwatchful\u201d eye of Dumbledore, who clearly knew about all of this yet willfully allowed it for decades. Not to mention the racist thinking that had to go into the creation of this universe. I mean, a disgusting and ugly creature that wants to be enslaved, and their only advocate is scorned not only by their peers but also by the creatures themselves? The only East Asian character having an inaccurate and laughably stereotypical name? The banks controlled by miserly, sneaky, and double-crossing beings? Who are highly intelligent but not quite trustworthy enough to be granted wands? Hmmm\u2026 There are definitely quite a few aspects of this universe that don\u2019t hold up and are rather off-color. Especially post-Hallows as Rowling has exposed herself as a transphobic racist. ",

But so far as the themes and style go, the themes of friendship, courage and good vs. evil are timeless, and the style is perfectly understandable now as it was a couple of decades ago. ",
