            "answer_text": "In Japanese kana, we pronounce the word \u306b\u307b\u3093, or in romaji, Nihon. In kanji, \u65e5\u672c (p. 474) is two syllables (when together). The character is a combination of the sun, to the left, and the tree (to the right). The kanji can be examined predicated on its taxonomy and associated with the composition of the two radicals, 72 \u65e5 (p. 473), pronounced hi or nichi (day) and 2, | pronounced bo (p. 55). \u65e5, pronounced here, hi, means sun, time, day, date (p. 473). Radical 2, bo | (p. 55), has its roots as a single vertical line | and is referred to as a rod, a stick, or a line. Four additional strokes or lines are added to the initial single line | to create the kanji \u672c (p. 64) , identified in Nelson\u2019s Dictionary\u2019s subsection 96, as within the category of radical 2, \u672c (hon), and can mean book, real, the same, present, the current, true, and normal. Hon, \u672c (p. 64), is also the counter for long things. The Modern Reader's Japanese-English Character Dictionary. Second revised edition by Andrew Nathaniel Nelson (there are any number of copyright dates). Published by Charles E. Tuttle, Co. Inc. Tokyo. A newer dictionary is The New Nelson Japanese-English Character Dictionary. ",
