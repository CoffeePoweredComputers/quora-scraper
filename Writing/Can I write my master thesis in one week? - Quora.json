            "answer_text": "This is not sounding good - but you know that already. Much depends on how long your thesis is expected to be, and how much preparation you have actually done. If you have got loads of notes but just haven\u2019t started sticking it all together, then I think it is possible. And at least it is only a draft that you have to give in by the end of the week. Cancel all previous plans for a lively social life and get going. Confession time: half-way through the last year of my first degree course, I was supposed to hand in a 10,000 word essay. I had done quite a bit of spade work, but hadn\u2019t even started putting it together, just couldn\u2019t get going, and it was definitely overdue. And then, on a Friday morning, on a field trip 80 miles from our university, I was ambushed by one of our lecturers. Marion (sweetly): Ah, Gill, how\u2019s your Special Topic coming along? Me (fingers crossed behind my back): Er, almost finished, Marion. Marion (sweet smile again - she knows!!): Oh, good. So I can have it first thing on Monday, can I? Me (shiit!!): Er, yes, Marion. (Now what have I done????) Well, I had another place to go the following morning, and couldn\u2019t get back to university until the Saturday evening. But as soon as I did, I started writing. I wrote all through Saturday night, all day Sunday, most of Sunday night apart from a couple of hours\u2019 sleep in the early hours, and finally finished at about 7:30 on Monday morning. So I cooked breakfast for myself, went and had a shower, and walked up to the campus to hand the work in to Marion. And couldn\u2019t find her. Eventually I found one of the Porters. \u201cMarion?\u201d he said. \u201cNot in today. Won\u2019t be in till Tuesday.\u201d !!! Well, I got the thing in, and I passed. It wasn\u2019t good, but I passed. And so can you. Don\u2019t waste any more time - just get going! And good luck\u2026 :) ",

I can tell you I wrote an acceptable draft of an Honours thesis (Canadian university, undergraduate) in 11 days. But I\u2019d done all the necessary reading and prepared my quotes and bibliography beforehand (all my sources existed in two piles on either side of a chair). I went through at least three drafts with my advisor (well, he ended up being my advisor as my original advisor flaked on me, but that\u2019s another story) during that time as well. Not even half the length of a Master\u2019s thesis paper, of course. Either you can do it and have left only this much time because you know your capabilities (that was the case with me, though I was literally writing and revising up to an hour before the paper was due; had to save some time for printing), or you can\u2019t and you\u2019re going to need to come up with a reasonable excuse for an extension (good luck with that) or come clean and throw yourself on the mercy of others. Good luck. ",

My one hail mary pass writing spree was a 130 page state of the field review in 4 days. I actually received a perfect score. I also took so much adderall in those 4 days I was feeling bugs crawling all over my skin every time I closed my eyes for about two days. Throw yourself down a flight of steps or get a friend of a friend to hit you with their car and stick around for the police report (tell officer you darted out into traffic rushing to get to the library so guy doesn\u2019t get ticket). You go to hospital and take an incomplete for the class. It\u2019s better if you have an injury that shows up on an x-ray, but complain about blurry vision and tell them you don\u2019t want pain killers. They\u2019ll take you serious enough to give you a useful write up. ",

In my experience, a rush job always shows! I can also say that after doing two masters theses and a PhD, each took at least 12 months to write up. Also, this is a consultative process with your supervisor(s).There is no point in possibly risking years of hard work. You need the best quality you can deliver and this is not a cursory, overnight exercise.\u201d I have never heard of a quality thesis being written up in a week, ever. Depending on many variables, in theory, it is possible but, I\u2019d be extremely nervous. As a supervisor, it would never happen on my watch and as a marker \u2026.. well, it will show! ",
