            "answer_text": "In the US, technically no you cannot patent something if you did not in fact invent/create it. You may in some instances not even get a patent if you did create and invent it on your own if someone else thought of your same invention just slightly before you did. Of course in these incidents, and in cases where someone applies for a patent that they did not actually invent, they may get a patent because that is the nature of patent examination. To answer the technical side of why you have to be the inventor, one of the requirements for getting a patent is satisfying a variety of statutes. The big 4 statutes that need to be satisfied are 35 U.S.C. 101, 102, 103, and 112. 35 U.S.C. 101 lays out among other things, the following requirements: \u201cFirst, whoever invents or discovers an eligible invention may obtain only ONE patent therefor. This requirement forms the basis for statutory double patenting rejections when two applications claim the same invention, i.e. claim identical subject matter. See MPEP \u00a7 804 for a full discussion of the prohibition against double patenting. Second, the inventor(s) must be the applicant in an application filed before September 16, 2012, (except as otherwise provided in pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.41(b)) and the inventor or each joint inventor must be identified in an application filed on or after September 16, 2012. See MPEP \u00a7 2137.01 for a detailed discussion of inventorship, MPEP \u00a7 602.01(c)et seq. for details regarding correction of inventorship, and MPEP \u00a7 706.03(a), subsection IV, for rejections under 35 U.S.C. 101 and 115 (and pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f) for applications subject to pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102) for failure to set forth the correct inventorship.\u201d The source is from Requirements of 35 U.S.C. 101. So while you may technically get a patent issued to you, if the actual inventor were to challenge the validity of your patent, they would invariably win and your patent would then be invalidated. ",

            "answer_text": "Can I patent something just because it hasn't been patented before - yes, patents are given only if it is not already known or patented, if it is already patented then you will not get patent in the first place. Just because someone has not patented should not be a reason for you to patent it,The first step in the journey of patent or intellectual property (IP) is to establish a goal on what you want to achieve. Once you have this, then you must evaluate if you can reach the goal with patents. This will lead you towards what should be a scope of claims, etc, Without a goal, it is like obtaining patents randomly which may or may not give you a return on investment (ROI). do I need to show that I created it? not required , as long as you have invented it and can describe it in such a way that ordinary skilled in the art can make a product out of it is enough.

            "answer_text": "You have to show that it wasn\u2019t an already publicly known thing/technology. So no, you can\u2019t just take e.g. an opensource library from GitHub or an old engine design and patent it as if it was your invention. Not if somebody can prove that it was already previously published (although not patented). You may patent new or modified usage of an invention based on another, already existing one, but you have to show that there\u2019s an \u201cinventive step\u201d in the final solution. What\u2019s that is not entirely clear, though. It\u2019ll be up to the authorities to assess that. ",

            "answer_text": "In the United States, you have to have invented it. The reason is quite amazing \u2014 it\u2019s because the Federal government has no power to issue a patent to anyone but the inventors of any particular discovery. Check your Constitution, and you will find this phrase, \u201cThe Congress shall have [the] power . . . [t]o promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\u201d Courts have held that it\u2019s the inventors/discoveries part that applies to patents. So a patent issued to anyone other than the inventors of the discovery would be void as beyond the power of the Federal government! I\u2019m totally serious. This really is the law. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer to both of your questions is no. To gain a Patent, the invention disclosed must be both new and involve an inventive step, having regard to everything available to the public at it\u2019s filing date, anywhere in the world. All forms of publication are relevant, including academic papers, journals, media, conferences etc and not merely the content of earlier patents. An \u201cinventive step\u201d is a non-obvious solution to a problem addressed by the \u201cinvention\u201d, and thus goes far beyond adding something that is new. In general, it is not necessary to establish inventorship, unless this is challenged by someone else. ",
