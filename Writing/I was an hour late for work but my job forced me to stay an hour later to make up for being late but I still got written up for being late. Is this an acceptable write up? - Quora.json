Is this an acceptable write up? The fact that you can be written up for being late makes it clear that being late is against the rules. The consequences of your having to stay the same amount of time later (a) is a totally separate matter, and (b) does not erase the fact that you were late in the first place. In fact, it could have caused more problems: perhaps a security guard had to stay later because you stayed later, or perhaps a computer systems backup had to be delayed because you were still working. Consider this similar situation: you take $50.00 out of the till for personal use because you don\u2019t have time to go to an ATM. The next morning, you stop by the ATM before work and replace the $50.00 the next day. Although the company didn\u2019t lose any money, should the fact that money was taken to begin with be ignored? Many jobs have flexibility in start and end times, but yours apparently does not. This is something worth keeping in mind. ",

            "answer_text": "You were late for work. You have not contested that fact. If you are being paid hourly, you need to work off that hour to earn the pay; hence, the requirement to work an hour later. This certainly makes things easier for the payroll person than to have to deduct an hour\u2019s pay from your cheque. Whether you work the extra hour or not does not excuse you from being late. If your company has a very strict policy about lateness (and most companies do), then, yes, it is fair for you to be written up for this infraction of the rules. ",
