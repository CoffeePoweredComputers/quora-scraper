            "answer_text": "In answer to the question: Is it worth sending your manuscript to a publisher anymore? There are a couple ways to tackle this question, depending on the question\u2019s intent. Are you asking if it\u2019s worth being traditionally published anymore? In some cases \u2014 it depends on your goals as a writer. If you are a non-fiction writer writing in a space other than memoir \u2014 it was never worth it to send your manuscript. The Houses that publish non-fiction want proposals, they don\u2019t want your completed work. If you intend to make money by selling the book, then you are better off being with a traditional publisher than self-publishing. You will be paid an advance upfront to write the book. If you\u2019re writing the book primarily to reinforce your own expertise, and to market your self and your other services (say as a speaker, or mentoring, or a premium course or master group) then you are much better off just skipping the entire process and self-publishing. You\u2019ll get to market faster, still have the ability to reach the majority of readers, and start moving people into your funnel faster. If you are writing fiction, very few Houses accept unsolicited submissions directly from authors. You need to first get an agent to represent your book, and then your agent will submit the manuscript on your behalf. There are exceptions, of course, especially in smaller publishing Houses. But you need to do your research and know who those exceptions are, then you need submit your work in the proper format to the proper editor. If you meet an editor at a literary convention, and you\u2019ve pitched your book to them, and they ask you to send a synopsis and sample chapters\u2026then yes, it\u2019s very much worth it to do as they request. However, a caveat: if you are writing genre fiction (Mystery, SF/F, Romance, Thriller), let me lay out the most common scenario you will encounter in 2020 as a first time author with a traditional publisher. Your book will have been undergoing the submission process since 2018, maybe longer if you struggled to find an agent. You now have a contract in hand! It\u2019s for the Trade Paperback and eBook editions! You are being given a $2000 advance. You have signed away all subsidiary rights to the novel. You also have a non-compete clause in the contract. This is a standard boiler plate for a new author. Your agent assures you this is just the way it is, you aren\u2019t being screwed. Your contract is the same as the last 4 new authors he\u2019s negotiated. You get half of that $2000 on signing the contract. You will get the other half upon acceptance of a completed manuscript. You start working with your editor. 6 weeks later he gets you the first round of edit notes, and you get to work. 6 months later, the substantive developmental edits are done! Hallelujah! Then you go through a line-edit. That takes about a month. Then a copy edit. Another month. It\u2019s been 9 months since you last got money on this book, and you\u2019ve spent half your time working on this book since then. (You have, of course, continued to write more novels since 2018, including several that live in the same world with the same characters as your first one!) Finally, after 9 months, the book is ready to be published, and you get your second $1000 check. The book is set to be published in Q3 2021 \u2014 a full year from now. So you write another book in the series, you\u2019ve got some other novels not in the series that your agent wants to pitch, but your contract has a non-compete, so you can\u2019t publish anything else within 6 months of Book A, and your current publisher also has a right of first refusal, and they just want your agent to wait so they can see how this book performs. So your agent doesn\u2019t bother pitching anything else yet.. Better to wait and see how Book A plays out. Q3 2021 comes along, and your book is FINALLY released. You do some press, a few interviews locally, some national trade magazines. That\u2019s about the extend of your marketing. Your house was not able to secure you space in the front of Barns n Noble, or a Walmart deal. Your launch kind of fizzles. By February of 2022 its obvious that your book, like about 90% of trade fiction, is underperforming \u2014 you aren\u2019t going to \u201cearn out\u201d your advance that first year. Which means they aren\u2019t interested in picking up your other books. No second contract is forthcoming. No royalties will ever be paid out on this book. Your agent immediately starts pitching the other books you\u2019ve written \u2014 except for the three that you foolishly wrote in the same fictional universe with the same characters over the past 5 years you\u2019ve been waiting for publication and the possibility of a second contract. The rights you signed away in the contract were for the book and the characters and locations within it. The publisher needed to have those rights in order to have any hope of securing a movie deal, something that is now never going to materialize. You can\u2019t pitch those books (B-D) to anyone other than the Publisher of Book A. And that Publisher has already said they aren\u2019t interested. You can\u2019t do anything with them. You can\u2019t self-publish them unless you can get the rights back to Book A. So you dig in to your contract to find out how you can get Book A back. After all, some people read it, and you think if it just got pushed in the right way, you could make some more money off of it and those other books you wrote. Here it is, your reversion clause! If after five years, the book is no longer in print or available to purchase at major retailers nationwide, you can pay the company a fee to get your rights back, at least any right they haven\u2019t already signed over to other people. Except\u2026 your book is available as an english language eBook edition. That\u2019s never going to go \u201cout of print\u201d. It\u2019s never going to be pulled and be unavailable \u2014 your reversion clause effective gives you no way to get your rights back. It\u2019s a joke. So, you have now written four books for which you will only ever make $2000. All of that time and effort, and you made $2000. And only one of them will ever be read by anyone! This is not a doomsday scenario. This is the most likely result of a first time novelist\u2019s trade publishing career in 2020. Most first time genre fiction books don\u2019t earn out. Most first time authors who don\u2019t earn out don\u2019t get second contracts. Boilerplate contracts (which is all first time authors get because they don\u2019t have any negotiating power) include language that gives publishing companies the rights, in perpetuity, to your fictional universe. And if you can even get a reversion clause, it will look like the one above, unless you can get your agent to negotiate for it to be changed \u2014 a possibility with a small press, but not with a larger press owned by a corporate conglomerate. So, you beat the odds and got an agent. Then you beat the odds and got a publishing contract. You are in the 99.9 percent of authors who complete a manuscript and actually get it published. You are 1 in 1000, and that\u2019s being generous. More than half of those lucky few will never get a second deal. And they will be unable to monetize that book, or anything related to it, ever again. Now, ask yourself, if you wrote four novels and self-published them, would you be able to sell 550 digital copies of each book at $3.99 over your entire life? Because that\u2019s all you would have to do to earn MORE than the $2000 you earned on that series with a traditional publisher. Don\u2019t believe me? Here\u2019s the math. Covers: $225 * 4 - $1000Editing: $2000 for all 4 90k books.Total expenses: $3000 Expenses + potential advance = $5000 Royalties per book at $3.99 = $2.34 Sales needed to exceed traditional deal: $5000 / $2.34 = 2137 / 4 books = 534 sales per book So, with this context in mind, I think the question bears asking once more, this time of you. Is it worth sending your manuscript to a publisher anymore? ",

            "answer_text": "For some publishers, no. Many major publishers don\u2019t take manuscripts from authors. They only work through agents. That said, there\u2019s still significant value in working through traditional publish channels. Not everybody is suited to self-publishing. A self-published author has to engage editors and layout people and cover artists and do marketing and so on. It\u2019s business and project management with some writing involved. Some authors are terrible at that; that\u2019s why they write. Others might be OK at it but just don\u2019t want to. And many authors, while they might be competent at the business of publishing, are simply better writers than they are business owners. Self-publishing is a legitimate option, particularly these days when social media provides more powerful tools for individuals to reach scattered audiences. But it\u2019s not the only option. Traditional publishers still have much greater reach than any novice author is likely to have and have an infinitely easier time putting books in stores. And, of course, they take care of most of the tasks an author is unlikely to be good at. Traditional publishing is still, for many authors and particularly new authors who don\u2019t know how publishing works, worth it. ",
