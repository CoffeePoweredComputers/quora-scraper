            "answer_text": "Sanskirt does not have a script of its own. It is written in local scripts in India or in the scripts of other writing system, suitably modified like you have written as k, kh, gh In India Sanskrit can be written and have been written in all the major scripts the languages there. For example k, kh, g, and gh used in Sanskritcan be rendered in the following scripts as follows Punjabi: \u0a15 = ka, \u0a16 = kha, \u0a17 =ga, \u0a18 = ghaTamil: \u0b95\t = ka , \u0b95\u00b2\t = kha, \u0b95\u00b3\t= ga, \u0b95\u2074 = ghaGujarati: \u0a95\t= ka,\t\u0a96 = kha,\t \u0a97 = ga, \u0a98 =\tghaDevanagari: \u0915\t= ka, \t\u0916 = kha, \t\u0917\t= ga, \t\u0918 = ghaMalayalam: \u0d15 = ka, \t\u0d16 = kha, \u0d17 = ga, \t\u0d18 = ghaTelugu: \u0c15 = ka, \u0c16 = kha, \u0c17 = ga, \u0c18 = gha (One can show for all the 20\u201325+ languages; one can see them in Wikipedia) In South India a special script called Grantha was developed which was also used for writing Sanskrit. In fact, it was the most popular until very recently for writing Sanskrit in South India. The letters for k, kh, g, gh in Grantha are shown below (from Wikipedia):  There are also a few South East Asian languages in which Sanskrit can be written because they also follow the same Brahmi Script system (Brahmi script - Wikipedia). Let me just give Khmer language script, corresponding to k, kh, g and gh, which is as follows, but the g, and gh are not pronounced as in Sanskrit. \u1780\t[k\u0251\u02d0]\tk\u00e2 \u1781\t[k\u02b0\u0251\u02d0]\tkh\u00e2 \u1782\t[k\u0254\u02d0]\tk\u00f4 \u1783\t[k\u02b0\u0254\u02d0]\tkh\u00f4 So, Sanskrit can be written in about 25\u201330 scripts. Other scripts also can use systematic diacritics to transliterate Sanskrit written in Indian Scripts. It is sometimes said creatively that Sanskrit is a script-agnostic language. ",
