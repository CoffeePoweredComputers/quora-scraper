            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re ready to get serious about freelancing and multiplying your self-employed income, here are top ten tips for earning more during your first year. 1. Choose a Niche If you\u2019re new to freelancing, you might feel ready to take any paid work you can get your hands on. But as you get deeper into your freelancing career, you\u2019ll need to start being more strategic about the types of work you do and the clients you take on. If you choose the right niche, deciding to specialize and putting some effort into branding yourself as an expert within your niche can really pay off for years to come. 2. Get Clear on Your Service Offerings One major decision you need to make early on in your freelance career is what you do and what you don\u2019t do. The more specific you can be about what services you offer, the better. Not only will it help you brand yourself, it\u2019ll allow you to control how potential clients perceive you and give you the opportunity to continue building your portfolio in the direction you want to move in. 3. Define What Your Ideal Client Looks Like Before you can go out and start looking for clients, you\u2019ll need to develop a clear picture of who you\u2019re going to work best with. Do you want to build websites for small business owners, pitch in on new feature development for high growth technology startups, or take on longer-term contracts with enterprise-sized companies? Making these clear distinctions between who and what type of business you\u2019re targeting will be essential to effectively pitching your services .To define exactly who your ideal freelance clients should be (and how to start finding them), ask yourself these questions: What type of business has the problems I\u2019m solving with my services?Can the business I want to work with afford to hire me?What demographic trends can I identify about the decision makers in the types of businesses I\u2019m targeting? Think: age, gender, geographic location, websites they frequent, and their personal interests.4. Create a High Quality Portfolio Site It goes without saying that one of the best ways to demonstrate your technical skills is by having an amazing portfolio site of your own . If you want to be taken seriously as a new freelancer, you\u2019re going to need a website that: Showcases your expertise.Highlights relevant past experiences.Shows who you are.Includes your contact information so that potential clients can easily find you.The purpose of your portfolio is to educate, spark interest, and convince potential clients that they\u2019ll want to choose you for their technical needs. That\u2019s why it\u2019s worth investing time into deciding what to feature on your portfolio and how it\u2019s being displayed\u2014before you start looking for new projects. Once your portfolio site is up, start including a link to the site within your email signature and on your social profiles. 5. Level Up Your Skills The best way to justify higher rates? Make sure you have impressive skills that are high in demand . Practice using your new skills by building the types of projects that you want to eventually be paid to work on. Whether that\u2019s WordPress websites, mobile apps, or something else entirely, the more you can differentiate yourself among a sea of competition with cool side projects and examples that\u2019ll attract potential customers, the better. 7. Build Your Credibility There are many ways to build your Credibility within your industry. Aside from creating high quality blog content and collaborating with notable influencers in your industry, you can write an ebook, create an online course, and line up speaking engagements to start increasing your visibility within your niche. These credibility-boosters can help you add your list of accomplishments that you can highlight on your portfolio and simultaneously demonstrate your knowledge for more potential clients to see. The wider you can broadcast your message, the more influence you\u2019ll build within your niche. 8. Determine Your Pricing While deciding how much to charge for your freelance services is a major step toward determining your perceived value, you need to make sure you\u2019re charging enough to make a sustainable, comfortable living. Most clients won\u2019t hesitate to pay higher rates for a freelancer that gives them an incredible first impression and sells them on the ability to deliver high quality results.Before setting your prices at the bare minimum you need to charge in order to hit your financial needs, consider the actual value you\u2019d be creating for your potential clients and make sure you\u2019re not leaving money on the table. You can always increase your rates in the future and hope your client stays on board, but if you start at a price point you\u2019re already excited about, you\u2019ll be that much more likely to over-deliver and continue increasing your value moving forward. 9. Perfect Your Pitching There\u2019s an art and science to pitching your freelance services to new clients. Because it\u2019s such an important part of running a profitable freelance business, I created an entire online course on the topic of writing freelance proposals that convert, and I even give away my freelance proposal template for free. Landing new clients isn\u2019t just a matter of crafting an awesome freelance proposal. Your success depends on how you\u2019re selecting new jobs, how you position your value propositions, and how much research you do ahead of time. 10. Blog Frequently The goal of having a website showcasing your skills is to attract and convert new clients. What better way to increase the number of potential new clients coming across your website than by creating high quality blog content that positions you as a stand out expert within your field? At the beginning, aim for creating one or two in-depth blog posts per month, geared toward providing truly helpful solutions that your potential clients may be searching for. Note: That means you\u2019ll be writing for an audience of your clients, not other people in your field.Once they discover your content and get some free value from you, you\u2019ll naturally be top-of-mind if they\u2019re ready to hire out for more in-depth help. Once you have a website that highlights your abilities and clearly communicates that you offer freelance services, one of the most effective ways to increase your online visibility is by getting content published on the blogs and publications where your potential customers spend the most time.

            "answer_text": "Depends what you mean by \u201crelative beginner\u201d. If you mean an RB at your field, I would suggest, don\u2019t. Be a regular employee for a while (at least a few years), until you\u2019ve built up solid credibility in being good at it. If you mean an RB at freelancing, then yes, go with the web sites others have mentioned. BUT: Be aware that after a while you should probably move off of those. They are a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d, with a lot of people shopping primarily on price. That\u2019s fine when you\u2019re new enough not to be able to command higher fees elsewhere. But once you\u2019ve built up a good portfolio of happy (preferably ecstatic!) past clients, you should be relying more on your own website (and other marketing channels such as an opt-in email list, referral kits, etc., and above all, relationships). Then you can set your fees without some website taking a chunk and dictating how you work. You will have to do (or evaluate people to outsource) a lot more work in marketing, project management, accounts receivable, customer service, and so on\u2026 but that\u2019s what you\u2019re in for if you\u2019re serious about going into business for yourself.

With that said, I am pleased to tell you that for some websites you aren\u2019t required to have any experience to start as a freelancer (although some experience is always a plus), but you are encouraged list a category of skills that you do possess so that you do get flagged for when there is a project available in your field. Sites like Freework and Guru are good places to try to take a shot at freelancing, and as you land your first client or a job, and you continue developing and expanding your freelancer portfolio, the easier it\u2019ll be for you going forward. Wish you luck in your future endeavours as a freelancer!  Disclaimer: I am part of Freework team and my answers might be a bit biased. ",

            "answer_text": "Experience is a tricky word. What actually is experience? Working a job for 20 years, but being terrible at what you do\u2026 is technically experience, but is it valuable? Maybe I haven\u2019t got my first client, yet\u2026 but I\u2019ve built hundreds of websites on my own. Is that experience? I\u2019d say so. So, it\u2019s tricky\u2026 but, bottom line, how can you get a freelance job with no experience? You create experience. Don\u2019t wait around for it to be handed to you. Create it. How Do You Create Experience? Let\u2019s say you want to freelance as a developer. There are tons of open-source projects desperate for developers to contribute. My favorite example is Shopify. Shopify has an open-source theme framework that all their themes are built on. And, there are 3,822 \u201cshopify\u201d jobs on Upwork right now:  In fact, \u201cShopify Templates\u201d is listed as one of the top 20 fastest growing skills in Upwork\u2019s latest quarterly skills index report So, contribute to their theme framework and put that in your bio. Do you think a potential Shopify client would consider that experience? Hell yeah. And, it\u2019s not random either. It\u2019s direct experience in the thing they want done. Or, if you\u2019re a graphic designer. Take a look at the website for Nissan:  It\u2019s okay. But, my guess is you could probably come up with something better. So, do. Build out your \u201cre-interpretation\u201d of Nissan\u2019s site and put that in your portfolio. A portfolio is to show potential clients what you\u2019re capable of. Nothing says it has to be client projects. Final example\u2026 let\u2019s say your writer. Search for blogs in the industry you want to write in (tech, fashion, business, etc). Find ones with multiple authors. Read through the articles on the site and get a feel for what kind of articles they publish. Write one of your own. Then, send it to the publication and tell them they can have it for free, but that you\u2019re interested in writing for them. If your article is good and they need more writers, there\u2019s a good change you\u2019ll, at least, get an interview or trial-run. And even if not, put the article in your portfolio. Point is, you don\u2019t have to wait around on someone else to \u201cgive\u201d you experience. You can go out and get it starting right now. You just need a little creativity and a little persistence. And remember, experience is really just a shortcut for performance. Clients ultimately don\u2019t care how long you\u2019ve been doing something. They care if you can deliver for them. Find ways to demonstrate that\u2026 and you\u2019ll be just fine. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone has got to start somewhere! To gain success as a freelancer, you need to make connections; to maintain success, you need to build relationships. When you can establish a lasting professional relationship with an employer, you will continue to get repeat business, and staying busy is how you make money. You should start by going to one of the many freelance websites like goLance. Through these sites, you can connect with employers from all over the world who are looking to hire people for all types of work. Create a profile with contact info and a resume so that employers can find you, or browse a list of posted jobs and apply for free. Making connections is that easy, thanks to Internet. Making connections is just the beginning. Now you need to get hired over the other potential freelancers vying for jobs. You need to stand out. You need to market yourself. This is as much a part of being a freelancer as the work you get paid for. Most employers are also looking to make connections with solid, consistent workers that they can build relationships with as well. Think about it: it\u2019s easier for them to hire the same person over and over, so long as that person does good work and is dependable. That said, appealing to employers on a personal level can help you stand out and get hired. Add a current photo to your profile, add links to your social media accounts, and write something about yourself and your experiences that employers can read. Let them see the person behind the screen. Once you are getting hired, remember that you are building a reputation that will follow you online. Be organized, respect your clients, observe agreed-upon deadlines, and always do good work. Joining the digital workforce is attractive to people because of the freedom it can potentially afford you, but you have to do the work. Getting started as a freelancer is as easy as making connections on a site like goLance, but that\u2019s when the real work begins. Good luck! I hope this helps. Let me know if you sign up at goLance, because I like to keep up with people and see the different paths to success. ",

Hubstaff Talent is free to use, there are no fees for joining and they don\u2019t pocket part of your earnings (I know other websites can take anywhere from 10-20% off your hourly wage). I appreciate that I can connect directly with the agency and all my hard earned money goes to me instead of having to split it with a third party. I also like that Hubstaff Talent sends out weekly reports showing me all the important stats such as how many people viewed my profile, the top countries visiting my profile and the top websites driving the most traffic. It\u2019s nice to get detailed insight and understand how my profile is performing each week. Hubstaff Talent allows businesses to search for freelancers based on skill set, location or category which is why thousands of companies choose this platform to find talented freelancers. I highly recommend creating a profile on Hubstaff Talent. Whether or not you are a relative beginner doesn\u2019t matter as much as how you market yourself. If you create a well thought out profile, you most likely won\u2019t be a beginner for long. Good luck!  Disclaimer: Hubstaff is one of my clients and I use their software in my business. ",

For example, if you are a writer, you can write articles on a site like ezinearticles, and use that as a sample. Better yet, write an article on an authority site and use it as a sample. And in your cover letter/proposal, make sure that you address the client\u2019s needs. Try and show them why you are the best guy for the job. With a great cover letter and portfolio, a client is just a few declines away :) 5 Things I Wish I Knew Before Becoming a Freelancer ",

If you want to get a job assignment or project or whatever, the purchaser of your services needs to know that you are qualified and able to successfully do that job. You need some evidence of your relevant skills. So first determine what services you wish to provide. Focus. Don\u2019t just try to do anything and everything. Then develop some evidence that you have the relevant skills. Think about creating some work samples for a portfolio, maybe doing some work for free in order to gain both work samples and some references. Or just create samples on your own that you can show to a potential client. Then seek paid assignments. Offer your services in various ways. Think about setting up a website where you can display some of your work and your references. Don\u2019t focus only on some of the online sources of work. Set up a site on LinkedIn and see of you can make some relevant contacts. Look and act like a professional. When you do get an assignment, interact in a professional manner, provide a quality service and or product and ask if the purchaser would be willing to refer you to anyone else that might benefit from your services. It takes time and commitment, but acting like a professional is what over time results in people seeing you as one. ",
