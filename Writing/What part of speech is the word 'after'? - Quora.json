            "answer_text": "The word \u2018after\u2019 can be a preposition, an adverb, or a conjunction. Because as words are divided into different classes according to the work they do in sentences, it is clear that we cannot say to which part of speech a word belongs unless we see it used in a sentence. For examples: They came soon after. (Adverb) They came after us. (Preposition) They came after we had left. (Conjunction) From the above examples we see that the same word can be used as different parts of speech. ",
