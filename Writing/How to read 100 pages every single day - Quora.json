Perhaps that is all you can read, but it seems like you don't have the motivation, perhaps not; but for me when I am motivated to read and am in the middle of an amazing book I read for a half an hour and finish 1/3 to 1/2 of a 400 page book. I am a extremely fast reader though. (I finished Les Miserables in one week.) it could be that your mind cant read the pages of the website as fast as others, as your brain doesn't actually read the whole word but the design of them in general\u2026so that could be it. For example, can you read this?\u2026 7H15 M3554G3 53RV35 7O PR0V3 H0W 0UR M1ND5 C4N D0 4M4Z1NG 7H1NG5! 1MPR3551V3 7H1NG5! 1N 7H3 B3G1NN1NG 17 WA5 H4RD BU7 N0W, 0N 7H15 LIN3 Y0UR M1ND 1S R34D1NG 17 4U70M471C4LLY W17H 0U7 3V3N 7H1NK1NG 4B0U7 17, B3 PROUD! 0NLY C3R741N P30PL3 C4N R3AD 7H15. and then this one: I cdnuolt blveiee taht I cluod aulaclty uesdnatnrd waht I was rdanieg. The phaonmneal pweor of the hmuan mnid. Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae. The rset can be a taotl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit a porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. Amzanig huh? Yaeh and I awlyas toghuht slpeling was ipmorantt! tahts so cool! if you can read these than its probably not because you cant read as fast. I suggest trying to read other things, to work on speed, perhaps its because your reading online? If you need some more help or anything else, just ask Avabeno ",

            "answer_text": "What you're looking for is called Speed Reading. A first step is to learn how to overcome your likes and dislikes and be able to read in any media, be they books, screens or whatever. As my older brother once said to me: \u201cWe never know where the truth might be\u201d. For celerity in your reading skill, you need to stop subvocalization, if that's a habit you have. It's better to gain a photographic ability to register the text in your mind. Understanding eye movements is also a way to improve the way you read, coming to use less movement, directing energy to understanding. It is also good to comprehend that it's not exactly the quantity, but mainly the quality of what you read that matters. This will help you to recognize how to skip parts of the text where you can just overlook. Many times, long texts are just a way the author utilizes to hide his confusion and ignorance. Especially with business, which is a pragmatic area of life, it's better to put into practice what you learn, because theory is never ideally applicable. Reality is much more than reading. Talk to enterpreneurs so you can lear by their mistakes too. Always have a project for your life, so you can prioritize what to know and do next. Don't ever believe what you read or hear, no matter who's saying. Critical thinking is an ability that will help you to recognize the quality of what your facing. In terms of reading, this helps you to immediately go away from poorer texts and spend more time in richer ones. ",
