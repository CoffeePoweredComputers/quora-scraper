It will save you a lot of awkwardness.  Apologise to her while subtly hinting at the incidentDon't do this when all of you are in a group or at the lunch table. Avoid an audience. She definitely wont appreciate more people being party to this conversation.  Tell her it wasn't okay for you to make that comment and you regret it. Hey, i am really sorry about that comment i passed the other day. It wasn't appropriate and i shouldn't have. Hope we can continue being friends.   ^ something on these lines.  Pointers for future :- avoid the following Nobody cares if you think she looks better without glasses or if she should switch to lenses.I hate it when people say it to me. I like my spectacles. Thank you very much. 2.  Don't pester people about what they eat/how much they eat at office  There are days when you just want to eat fruit salad for lunch and days when you could gobble down a bakery. Don't debate on how either option is not okay. I can decide for my self. Look at your own lunchbox.  3. Again - Don't bother commenting on clothes and weight and makeup. *Hope things get sunnier at  office.  ",
