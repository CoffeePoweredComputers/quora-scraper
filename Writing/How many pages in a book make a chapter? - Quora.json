            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. There is no set limit for pages in a chapter, high or low. There is no set limit for words in a chapter, high or low. I have read chapters that I thought would never end, and I have to be honest, it made me want to not read the rest of the book. I have seen chapters that were one blank page, with only the chapter name at the top. That can be used to a pretty cool dramatic effect, if done properly. Or it can come off as absolute crap. So I would be very careful with trying it. I once had a writer friend,Guy Anthony De Marco - Wikipedia, point out to me that each chapter should be like a short story, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Sometimes that end really is an end, sometimes it is a hook for the next chapter, but it is an end. With that in mind, I realized that a chapter, like a story, needs to be as long as it needs to be, and no longer. So now I write some chapters that are long, and some that are short, depending upon what the point of that chapter was and when I reach my goal of telling it. Do what works for you, but be mindful of how people react to it. Remember, if you are the only one who \u201cgets it\u201d, the failing is in your ability to communicate the idea, not in everyone else\u2019s ability to comprehend words on a page. I hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Pages? Nobody care for pages. You can change the number of pages by changing the font size and the font itself. Even the author\u2019s style plays a role in the number of pages. What you want to know is how many words make a chapter. The answer, however, is depends on the author. Some authors make chapters with just a few words. But most of the time, authors have chapters ranging from two to ten thousand words. ",
