            "answer_text": "Yes, but I don't recommend it. If the dub being lower quality doesn't bother you, watch it like that, but if I had to recommend one it would be the original Japanese voice acting subbed. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a subbed purist or anything, but even I have standards. Hunter x Hunter has the objectively worst dub of any anime series I've seen. Just to verify this, I've compiled a list of every anime series where I have watched at least half an episode of dub in and all of them beat Hunter. Naruto/ShipuudenWan PisuAttack On TitanMonster MusumeYu Yu HakushoFurumeta Alchemiste: Br\u00f6therh\u016bdoAnd Sailor MoonThe only one even debatably worse dub-wise (compared to Hunter) would be Sailor Moon, solely due to the infamous \u201cgirlfriends to cousins\u201d debogle. The only ones of these where I'd say the dub rivals the sub in quality are Naruto, YuYu and Attack on Titan. Naruto is highly debatable and Fullmetal had a pretty good dub, but it didn't really compare the way that these 3 did. Either way you should watch it because it's a great series that I recommend to everyone. Just don't know if I'll ever get over dubbed Killua's voice.  Signing off and wishing you a good one, James. P.S. If you're watching on non-anime sites, Hulu has the dub through most of the Yorknew City arc and the sub to the beginning of the Chimera Ant Arc and Netflix has the sub and dub end in the Greed Island Arc. Happy watching and thanks for the read! ",
