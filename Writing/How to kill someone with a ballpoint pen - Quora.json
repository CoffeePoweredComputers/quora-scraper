            "answer_text": "There are a number of ways you can kill someone with a ballpoint pen, the most obvious of which is just to stab a person with it over and over until he or she is dead. Done. But of course I usually answer questions because it gives me the opportunity to vaporize planets and that sort of thing. You know, the usual. So I thought I\u2019d take a stab (see what I did there) at maximizing the devastation caused by just one ballpoint pen. A few rules first: the destruction must actually be caused by the pen, not the pen activating some other destructive device. You can\u2019t press the nuclear launch button with the pen, and then claim the end of the world was caused by a pen. I\u2019m willing to allow energy to be added to the pen, but that energy can\u2019t be the source of the destruction either. Strapping the pen to the front of a train doesn\u2019t cut it, but making the pen go fast is OK. But only the damage caused by the pen itself counts - no accelerating the pen to 0.999999c and then counting the fusion you create in front of the pen. So how much damage could be done with a pen? Well you could make the pen go really fast. If you did that, it could fly through several people if they were properly aligned. So right off the bat, you could kill more than one person with a pen. But this is probably limited to perhaps a dozen people or so - any more and the pen would just be obliterated. You could construct numerous blades from the pen, and with those probably increase your path of destruction to the hundreds of lives. These people would have to be willing to hold still while you ended their time here on Earth, but it would work. Can we go farther? Yes, though it\u2019ll take some work. Ink chemistry Ink contains mostly chemicals that contain hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. These chemicals are chosen for their color, obviously, but also for their non-toxicity. But we can rearrange the atoms in those molecules to make something far more toxic. The most toxic compound composed only of C, H, and O that I can find is: Digoxin - Wikipedia Digoxin has an LD50 of around 20mg/kg. It would take around 1.6 grams of Digoxin to kill an adult human. A Bic pen weighs around 5.8 grams, so you could make enough Digoxin (theoretically) to make around 3 fatal doses. But heavier pens could probably be used to poison dozens. And then there\u2019s fusion. Most of a pen is C, H, and O. H would constitute roughly 10% of the mass, meaning a Bic pen would contain perhaps half a gram of hydrogen. When hydrogen is fused into helium, about 0.68% is converted directly into energy. 0.68% of half a gram of mass releases 306,000,000,000 J of energy. This is approximately equal to one of these: GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast - Wikipedia which is capable of killing thousands of people. If we fuse the carbon and hydrogen, we could increase the devastation even more. So is that it? Have we reached the limits of a pen\u2019s destructive power? Sadly, no. Though these pens weren\u2019t all ballpoint pens, I think you\u2019ll appreciate the similarities: A pen was used to write the words that have been used to kill millions. A pen was used to codify slavery into the US Constitution. A pen was used to write Mein Kampf. A pen signed the order to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A pen authorized the use of Agent Orange. A pen was used to sign the flight school applications for the 9/11 bombers. Even when it\u2019s me answering the question, the pen is mightier than the sword. Converting a Bic directly to energy kills thousands. But using a pen to turn violent thoughts and hateful ideologies into written words can kill millions. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay. So I once made the mistake of writing in the Fanfiction (https://my.w.tt/C7eUyytA06) that my character knows 97 ways to kill or torture someone with a ballpoint pen. Now my readers are asking for those methods, and right now, I xan tell you 20+ ways. I didn't plan to write all this so that's why number 1 is so dumb. Enjoy! \ud83d\ude08 1. Stab them. 2. Use the pointed side to slit their throats/wrists. 3. Use a nerf gun and shoot it at their head/chest. 4. Make them drink the ink. 5. Write something offensive on their shirt and wait for people to kill them for the offensive comment. 6. Get a whole bunch of pens and literally drown that person with pens until the cant breathe 7. Put the ink in their blood and wait for them to get blood poisoning/infected. 8. Use the pens as ecrisma sticks and break all their bones and leave them to bleed out. 9. Push a pen up their nose so far it damages the brain. 10. Exploding pens through their ear and make it explode in their head. 11. Use a pen to gut their insides. 12. Make them swallow the pen and let it block the air way and they die for to lack of oxygen. 13. Use a pen to lock them in place and don't let them escape from that area where you kinda staple them, and let them starve or dehydrate to death. 14. Keep pushing pens up their asshole (lowkey/very highkey rape) and as more pens goes in, it destroys their insides. (Kinds like the bamboo torture thing). 15. Use the non sharp side and bash two pens on their temples to shatter the skull. 16. Make the person go into this cupboard like thing where every surface is covered in sharp pens so which ever side they lean, they would get stabbed by pens. 17. Stab them in the eye with a pen and leave them on a cliff/desert/whatever. 18. Make a box out of pens, trap the person inside, and push it off a boat so they sink to the bottom and drown. 19. Crush the pen into tiny pieces and mix it with their food so when they eat it, the sharp pieces with cut their insides. 20. Sharpen the edges and throw them at the person. 21. Pour the ink on the floor and wait for them to slip and break their head. 22. Fill their house with pens until they get so sick of seeing the same design of pens and ultimately commit suicide/develop a mental illness. 23. Make acidic ink and if they're left handed, it will smudge when they write do it will burn through the skin. 24. Make them swallow a pen that is infused with very magnetic substance. When near magnetic object, the body will be pulled towards the object, causing a great impact. Or, they will get sandwiched between two magnetic objects. 25. put a pen on their neck and choke them 26. pour (flammable) ink on someone and burn them up 27. continuously write on their skin until it scratches the skin. it would be irritable and painful 28. Get some mind controlling nanobots that attaches when it comes in touch with someone. place the nanobots on a pen and let it do the rest. now we have control of the body. we do what we want. done. 29. Sharpen the pens and through them like throwing knives 30. Get someone who loves to hug, strap them with tons of sharp pens, and send them to hug thou enemy 31. Make them read theze comments and let them get paranoid 32. You make a sword balloon for their kid, put a pen in it, and watch them (playfully) stab them And just a reminder, I was half asleep when I made this list so it would be\u2026a bit messed up and stupid.
