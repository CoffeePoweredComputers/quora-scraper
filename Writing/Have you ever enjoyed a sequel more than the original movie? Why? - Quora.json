            "answer_text": "I grew up in the 70s and 80s and back then, it was possible for sequels to have much better graphics and cinematography than the originals, especially if there was a gap in years and if the sequel had a much bigger budget. Here are some movies that I liked as much or more than the original: Star Trek: This is an obvious one. The original was pretty boring and the Wrath of Khan is generally considered to be one of the best Star Trek movies ever.Star Wars: I really did like the original and it was the start of one of the biggest movie franchises ever. However, there were parts of it that were really slow, like R2D2 rolling across the Tatoine landscape. Also, some of the the effects were a little shaky, even though they were amazing for the time. The Empire Strikes Back had a good storyline and is generally considered to be one of the best Star Wars movies. I really liked Return of the Jedi a lot too. It was actually the first one I saw in theaters.Terminator: The first Terminator film is a classic with classic lines, but the second one was a great story too and had much better effects, probably due to a bigger budget.Indiana Jones: I\u2019m not a huge fan of Raiders and The Temple of Doom, but I really liked the Last Crusade.2010. Again, 2001 is a classic. However, it can be very slow in parts and there isn\u2019t much dialog. I appreciate what it tried to do, but as a sci-fi fan, I thought 2010 was a much more engaging movie to watch.Back to the Future: This one is iffy for this list. I think Back to the Future may be one of the best movies ever made and I don\u2019t think any of the sequels are better, but I liked the third one quite a bit, maybe almost as much as the first one.James Bond: There are many James Bond movies that I like more than the original. Of course I\u2019m not sure you can consider this an original and sequels.Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants: I probably shouldn\u2019t even admit that I watched these as a guy, but I think I liked the second one better.I\u2019m sure there are many more that I can\u2019t think of now, but you can see a theme. There were a number of successful movies that were pretty good or even classics that had a sequel made later with bigger budgets and better effects. ",

            "answer_text": "Following the Frozen fanatic fever from previous years, Frozen II came as a wonderfully soothing breath of fresh air.  It was a fresh air that stemmed from an unpredictable movie from Disney, in which they decided they wanted to make a brave remake. By abandoning the castle landscape, ditching the royalty subplots and substituting it all for a ambiguous \u2018journey into the unknown\u2019 Frozen II was able to move more freely and elegant than its predecessor had. Everything from Elsa\u2019s distant voice, the spirits and the unknown history were all carried a mysteriously ethereal feel to them. I think that tapped into my love for such movies like Arrival and Annihilation. It felt very much like a playground of ideas all bursting with creativity, all merged into one film. I like to think they it more-or-less succeeded.  None of that however would be possible without the talent behind the screen. The 5 year gap between the original was evident in their animation developments, and the team assured the ethereal atmosphere this film carries. \u2018Show Yourself\u2019 still reigns supermen over all Frozen songs \u2014 that\u2019s a certified fact. But it owes that, not only to Idina Menzel\u2019s always-powerful vocals, but also to the sheer bravado of the animation during the song. It was truly spell-binding stuff. I believe while the sequel\u2019s songs aren\u2019t nearly as iconic or strong than the original, alone, they carry so much more weight when watched along with the animation ; It\u2019s attest to their magnificent visual storytelling skills. In fact, everything here demonstrates a mastery of animation - particular probs to the wave scene. Not only was it a technical feat but it beautifully enhanced Elsa\u2019s troubled state of mind. Oh, and Elsa looks like a complete badass riding the water horse. Can we all agree on that one?  And while the sub-par critical and audiences reception was mostly due to the \u2018confusing\u2019 narrative and the absence of a clear villain, I strongly believe that\u2019s what set it apart. This film managed to take the path away from Disney\u2019s increasingly clich\u00e8 fairytale storylines and was able to craft something entirely new while standing its own ground \u2014 it was something more equivalent to an abstract animation. And while I can recognise where the criticism comes from, I believe this looser style of storytelling enabled the film to tackle themes of identity, change and sisterhood in a refreshingly nuanced and artistic way.  There was something palate cleansing about Frozen II. And in the age where an abundance of trash is spewing out from Disney, it\u2019s all the more welcome. Certainly more welcome than Frozen that\u2019s for sure. To all the people still obsessed with that film \u2014 just let it go. ",

            "answer_text": "Indeed I have, though there is something inherently inferior in the very idea of the sequel. It is also known for sequels to be more popular or widely accepted despite the fact they\u2019re inferior to the original (the curious case of Terminator 2). My first one is at the same time the most controversial one for me, as I came to fully appreciate and even prefer the original over the years. But still, for most of my life/youth, I preferred Mad Max 2 aka The Road Warrior (1981) over both the original Mad Max (1979), and the last in the series - Beyond Thunderdome (1985) . In any case, it is a marvelously executed sequel and one of the prime examples of what sequel should be, if done at all. As it was unable to repeat the incredible shock and realism of the original, it opted for a more Sci-Fi approach, choosing to focus on what is to become the most widely recognisable trait of the franchise - a dreaded sense of permanent threat. And okay, the insane stunts/spectacular crashes.  Rocky IV (1985) is an iconic character receiving an injection of pure 80\u2019s manliness, turning it into a proverbially simplistic, but unrepentantly macho, testosterone overloaded tsunami of badassery propelled forward by a hype inducing, adrenaline heavy score by Vince DiCola. Rocky IV OST alone has more iconic themes and songs than the entire 21st century so far. While not the best, nor necessarily superior to its slower paced, character study of an original, Rocky IV was the sequel I return most to, if nothing, for the coolness factor and its straightforward, unapologetic 80s-ness it wears with pride.  The Lord of The Rings franchise has never been quite my thing. I respect the elaborate-ness of its world, the excellent villains etc. but the hype around it is just as puzzling to me now as it was back then. However, the juggernaut of a movie franchise it was, it was unavoidable. Like eating at McDonald\u2019s. But unlike McDonald\u2019s - it was always a good experience, even if a bit too long. Of all those, the most memorable for me was the sequel - The Two Towers (2002). It didn\u2019t seem to be as heavy on lore as the first one, it was darker and more action packed, or at least it was how I remember it. And the night battle sequence was pretty badass. The unstoppable suicide charge of a buffed up lunatic was pretty memorable.  I consider Tim Burton\u2019s Batman to be the best portrayal of this particular superhero in film (though Michael Keaton is terribly miscast). Overrated Nolan films, while okay as far as film goes, have no particular flavour of a Batman film, just a generic action film dressed up as Batman (loose the terribly out of place costume/character and nothing would change), as ignorant or careless about Batman\u2019s world or lore as Nolan himself. Having said that, the 1989 one, while amazing in many aspects never grew on me quite the same as the sequel. It might have been me preferring good casting choices in such films (and the original was too bad at that), but Batman Returns (1992) is what a Batman movie is supposed to be, and as close as one can/could get (apparently) to the beloved comic book character/animated series.  The last one is a bit different in tone and origin. The Japanese horror movie Ju On: The Grudge (2002) succeeded doing everything its (too) low budget predecessor(s) couldn\u2019t achieve. It took the idea, the incredibly unsettling, mournful, eerie atmosphere and provided a more polished, more impactful version of the story. The sequel is easily the best one in an incredibly (and regrettably) long franchise,  and arguably one of the best horror movies in general.  ",

            "answer_text": "There are five sequels in existence that I love beyond all others, that I would be willing to consider some of my all time favorite films. But, surprisingly, of those five films three of them I enjoy the first movie more. Two of those movies are Lord of the Rings films. My favorite of the trilogy is Fellowship, but I also love the other two and rewatch them every year. Few moments in cinema are more exciting than The Charge of the Rohirrim or more brilliant than when Gollum talks to himself.  The other one is my favorite sequel of all time, Before Midnight, which is more stressful than the entirety of the Safdie\u2019s filmography combined. That\u2019s not even mentioning the hilarious dialogue and huge amount of truth in the final scene, a scene that subtly shows the crazy fact of life that not everything needs to work to work out. Despite Midnight currently being my 7th favorite film of the decade, I like Before Sunrise more.  Also, before going into what my two choices for superior sequels are, it\u2019s probably worth mentioning that I haven\u2019t seen The Human Condition or Apu Trilogies and am not counting films that are part of narrativeless trilogies (Think Bergman\u2019s Faith or Man With No Name).  The first is Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s magnificent entry into the Harry Potter franchise: The Prisoner of Azkaban. Cuaron is, by a pretty wide margin, the finest artist to ever work with Harry Potter and his endless creativity is on full display in this one. Images are filled with meaning and beauty in a way few franchise films have ever matched.  Cuaron is a master of using simple motifs and images to create this meaning. Think of how the poster of Sirius Black is framed in this long take, constantly in the peripheral of the viewer as he is discussed. But he is also outside of Harry\u2019s vision, representing our protagonists na\u00efve view of the dangers that face him. But images aren\u2019t the extent of his talents. Cuaron is really able to make the melodrama work in this film by controlling his actors. Radcliffe gives a more reserved performance in this film than in any other entry of the series and that works wonders for showing his desperation.  Cuaron makes sure it isn\u2019t Harry Potter who is terribly in need of a father figure. That doesn\u2019t work as well, because Harry Potter is the chosen one \u2014 a fictional character. Instead he turns Potter into a rather helpless, totally out of his league boy who needs a father, allowing the audience to relate to him. Azkaban is the only Harry Potter film that really allows the viewer to feel Potter\u2019s vulnerability. With any of the other directors, something like Harry blowing up Aunt Marge would be treated like comic justice. In Azkaban, Cuaron shows how it brings Harry into a world of trouble that he just barely escapes from, albeit with consequences.  Cuaron allows the viewer to treat his \u2018chosen one\u2019 protagonist as undeniably fallible, which is why the film works so well. In films like A Little Princess, Y Tu Mama Tambien, and Solo Con Tu Parejas Cuaron had already shown he could make an all time great coming of age drama. The fact Prisoner of Azkaban was a sequel with wizards wasn\u2019t about to stop him from being customarily brilliant.  But the next incredible follow up is from a director who is virtually the complete opposite of Cuaron. While Cuaron is soft and moving, Sam Raimi is in your face and constantly comedic. I am of course talking about Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man 2.  Raimi\u2019s superpower is certainly keeping control of tone. The director weaves a web of horror, comedy, and action that all somehow keep a consistent aesthetic. It has some of the most perfectly compiled action ever, moments like the train fight stay constantly tense as while as regularly hilarious. The film is just so regularly funny. But, as all great directors should do, Raimi draws more comedy from his visuals than his script.  But it isn\u2019t just a monumentally fun action romp. This is a film that, just like Azkaban, has the courage to treat its superpowered protagonist as vulnerable. Peter Parker is drawn away from the hero life in the film, it starts to weigh on him too much. The best scene in the film, hell my favorite scene in any comic book film, is after Peter throws away the suit. Most directors would cut to him wrestling with his situation, but instead Raimi throws in a visual joke. In a montage that looks straight out of a bad 70s SitCom, we see Parker confidently walking to the song \u201cRaindrops Keep Falling on my Head\u201d with a goofy grin on his face.  It shows the sacrifice of being a hero instead of heroic sacrifice. It makes the case that Parker\u2019s life would be better if he didn\u2019t have superpowers, a more mature argument than this silly early-2000s action film had any business exploring. Parker\u2019s character arc, how he wrestles with his own ability, is what separates this film from its predecessor. It eschews the traditional comic book structure to tell a story of a person that is actually universal. We all have to wrestle with our talents and wonder if our ambition to accomplish dreams is worth it.  One thing makes this a very special superhero film; that separates it from every other comic book movie made. It is very much not about a guy in a suit who punches people. ",

            "answer_text": "Hell yes. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved Thor 1. Great movie in my opinion. But Thor Ragnarok was on a whole other fucking level. For starters, we got my favourite villain ever (cause Loki isn\u2019t a villain, you can fight me on that). Hela was perfect. Great backstory, brilliant acting and a great costume too.  The overall theme of the movie was amazing too. There was a big contrast between The Dark World and Thor 1. Look at the titles for an instance.   Those have that sort of fancy, mythical sort of vibe. Then we have this\u2026  Colourful, more scifi sort of style, which reflects the theme of the movie. Ragnarok was also a lot funnier, which always scores points for me. The others had some good points, the highlight probably being this scene:  But on the whole, Ragnarok was much funnier:    I always lose my shit at that scene. Always. It was also pretty amazing to see the character development for all of them, and finally see Loki treated as more of a protagonist than an antagonist. Plus, we got Valkyrie!  The only thing I didn\u2019t like was the end credits scene. And knowing what it leads into\u2026I bet you can guess why.   ",

            "answer_text": "Question addressed: \u201cHave you ever enjoyed a sequel more than the original movie? Why?\u201d Several answers have already mentioned the Harve Bennett Star Trek movies. But in this case, I will say that I particularly enjoyed The Rescuers Down Under from 1990. A sequel to The Rescuers from 1977. I found The Rescuers to be dull, almost pointless and with a storyline that actually put me to sleep as a ten year old. In 1990, I met two dear friends who took me to dinner and to see the latest Disney film, The Rescuers Down Under. My entire moviegoing experience exceeded my expectations in many ways. Firstly, I saw this movie in a theater that'd been built to comply with the ADA, which had been signed less than a year previously. I adored the lopsided theater configuration that allowed optimal seating and access to the rear of the theater for prime viewing spots for anyone who was wheelchair bound. Then, before the movie came the short film. This was Mickey Mouse in The Prince And The Pauper, the first Mickey Mouse appearance in almost 20 years. After the short film, there was an intermission of about 10 minutes that played instrumental versions of Disney songs. The intermission card on screen was a picture of a Mickey Mouse hand from a Mickey Mouse clock on an image of a clock face. There was a countdown timer on the screen along with the musical interlude. Then when the timer reached 10 seconds, the Mickey Mouse hand ticked down the last ten seconds. It actually received cheers from the audience. Then came the feature presentation. This was the first Disney animated movie that used extensive digital processing for their landscape and wide shot movements, and you could see the enormity of the work the animators created when they showed off the point-of-view of the eagle flying over the Outback and landing on the cliff facade alongside the waterfall. It seems that this setting was chosen expressly to show off the amazing digitalized effects in Disney\u2019s animation system. This movie had interesting characters, and many references and callbacks to the original 1977 movie. The story was interesting, the characters including the antagonist, Percival McLeach were well written and easy to identify with. The entire movie was a visual treat. The sequel to The Rescuers was, in short, much better and more engaging and enjoyable that the original The Rescuers. ",

            "answer_text": "There are plenty of movie sequels that were better than the original, and I will provide a few that MOST consider are better (but even then, there could be people who disagree with ALL my entrees, so I put multiple so hopefully everyone can at least agree with me on ONE). Remember, ALL OF THESE ARE MY OPINION SO PLEASE DON\u2019T HARASS ME IN THE COMMENTS BY PUTTING YOUR OPINION AS IF IT AS A FACT (thank you):  Arguably the best Star Wars movie ever, The Empire Strikes Back is considered to be better than A New Hope on every level of the overall quality of the movie (and some consider it to be among the greatest films of all time), and I personally agree. Plus, it brought us one of the most iconic scenes in cinematic history: \u201cNo, I am your father\u201d (I am not saying iconic scenes make a movie better, but they do help at times).  While The Dark Knight is said by many to be the best superhero film, there are many others who would argue that Spider-Man 2 is better. Either way, most consider this film to be better than Spider-Man due to its strong acting performances, incredible villain, and the developed romance between Peter and MJ. Additionally, it contained an iconic scene where Peter was stopping the train.  Paddington 2 has been considered by critics and audiences to be significantly better than the prequel, and I personally agree, since I liked the story, the introduction of the new characters, how Paddington was able to change a prison, and the ending was so satisfying that it almost made me tear up. Overall great film.  Widely considered to be the greatest superhero movie and one of the best movies of all time, The Dark Knight is a considerable upgrade from Batman Begins, an already-good film (in my opinion). From the phenomenal acting of Heath Ledger to the incredible story, this film was exceptional to me and many others.   Both of these films are considered by many to be upgrades from the original Toy Story, with Toy Story 2 featuring a new adventure and building up on previous characters while introducing new ones, and Toy Story 3 including a sad but satisfying ending to the trilogy (until Toy Story 4, but most consider it to not be in the same tier as the other three).  Another superhero movie revered as one of the greatest by many, Logan was incredible after witnessing its two meh (at best) films before it. The film contained a great story, good character development, and an incredibly sad death with a great ending to the trilogy making up for the two previous movies.  I\u2019m not sure if this can be included because Deathly Hallows Part 1 isn\u2019t really an \u201coriginal\u201d, but I will include it anyway. As I\u2019ve said numerous times with the other films, most critics and audience members applaud this film more than Part 1, which was considered to just be setting up for the big finale, which was Part 2. This movie delivered good action, heartfelt scenes, and what most would consider a good ending to the saga. If I haven\u2019t included other films, then it\u2019s because these are just the ones that I feel many people would easily consider better than the original (though I probably missed others, such as Godfather Part II, Return of the King, etc., but I just tried to answer the question).

            "answer_text": "Yes, it\u2019s Aliens. Ridley Scott brought \u201cAlien\u201d to life from an original script by Dan O\u2019Bannon. [Thanks for the correction Justin!] Imagine an alien creature that seizes a fellow crewmember and the rest of the exploration crew might be contaminated/infected. Protocol requires quarantine to prevent contamination to others. But the life and death moral dilemma comes early: do we abandon humans in mortal danger when we might be able to save them OR do we play it safe by leaving them to die thus preserving our own lives? These COVID days, quarantine becomes all too real. In the movie, Ripley the ranking leader decides to follow protocol while Ash the ship\u2019s scientist disobeys Ripley and lets them back in the ship. But Ash\u2019s decision was selfish, for the sake of scientific experimentation, instead of altruistic, that is to save lives.  What the crew didn\u2019t know was that alien species impregnates its prey before coming (birthed) out of the human cocoon. Here\u2019s the famous kitchen scene.  This factoid is from IMDB. \u201cFor the chestburster sequence, Sir John Hurt stuck his head, shoulders and arms through a hole in the mess table, linking up with a mechanical torso that was packed with compressed air (to create the forceful exit of the alien) and lots of animal guts (which, according to Sigourney Weaver, caused the set to smell horribly). The rest of the cast were not told that real blood and guts were being used, so as to provoke genuine reactions of shock and disgust. Apparently, this worked so well that Yaphet Kotto went home in complete shock afterwards, locking himself in a room and refusing to talk to his wife for several hours.\u201d Oh yeah, this species is virtually indestructible because it is huge, strong and bleeds acid. The rest of the movie is standard sci-fi stuff and the protagonist eventually defeats the alien. A plausible life and death moral dilemma accompanied by state of the art visual effects at the time, shocking original concept of chest-bursting birth, and dark foreboding throughout the movie. What can a sequel, lacking originality, have to offer? More chest-bursting? OK but we\u2019ve seen it and we\u2019re not as impressed anymore. Enter James Cameron\u2019s vision for a sequel. This time, bring back the heroine Ripley back to investigate what happened to a space colony. Hell no because I barely survived that experience and it\u2019s still haunting me in my dreams! Yeah but this time, you\u2019ll be safe (reminds me (just now I confess) of the witches threefold guarantee of McBeth\u2019s safety) because elite battle-tested Marines with cool gadgets will protect you!  Promises, promises. Here\u2019s the shootout scene.  Then there\u2019s another moral dilemma. Are decisions being made that value money over human safety? I think every day! The script is engaging, funny at times and tragic. The movie is epic and haunting.  Carrie Henn is perfectly cast as the sole survivor of this nightmare but Sigourney Weaver shines especially bright as the heroine Ripley.   Watch it if you haven\u2019t. James Cameron\u2019s \u201cAliens\u201d is good enough to stand on its own without the original. I think it is better than the original.  Heck, watch both. There\u2019s something awesome about each director\u2019s vision. P.S. You can skip all the Alien sequels after \u201cAliens.\u201d They are not worth your time. ",

            "answer_text": "Terminator 2 was clearly better than the first film. The first one was an achievement considering its modest budget and everything, but the sequel is perhaps one of the best action movies ever made. The Empire Strikes Back is also one of the best sequels of all time and a very strong candidate for the best Star Wars film of all time, however the original Star Wars had such an incredible impact on everything that it makes choosing between the two really difficult. When pressed I still choose ESB as my favourite before A New Hope. Aliens is also a frequently quoted excellent sequel, but the original was so different and so good at what it did, that I can\u2019t say that I agree fully about Aliens being better. The original film was a space thriller/horror film. The sequel went clearly into action movie territory, although it was tense and claustrophobic, like the previous film. Finally, perhaps the toughest call of them all: Godfather Part II. The original film starred Marlon Brando in one of the most iconic roles of his remarkable career alongside an excellent cast and a young Pacino. The sequel drew parallels between the rise of father and son, namely Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. There was hardly anyone who failed to deliver in their respective roles and even Nino Rota somehow managed to double-down on the amazing score. I honestly find it almost impossible to choose between these films. I can\u2019t blame anyone for choosing Part II, however the original has a slight edge for me over the sequel due to Brando alone.

            "answer_text": "One of the instances when a sequel stood out to me as being much better than the original was Batman Begins, and its sequel, The Dark Knight.  Batman Begins is a film I enjoy watching, and I think it\u2019s great, but for me, it is a film that does everything well, but doesn\u2019t really excel in any of the areas it tries to. Batman Begins has a very important story to tell, and it does so extremely well, but unlike the sequels that came after it, the best parts of it didn\u2019t come from its action sequences, or memorable villains, it came from watching Bruce Wayne\u2019s change in character from a young man desperate to avenge the murder of his parents, to a hero who doesn\u2019t kill, and has an incredibly strong moral compass. One of my biggest gripes with Batman Begins is how it handles action set-pieces, they simply never impressed me, and the finale with Batman trying to stop Ra\u2019s Al Ghul from destroying Gotham in his crusade to end crime, just left me underwhelmed. The train sequence almost bored me, and I never felt like the set-pieces matched the level of quality that the Character development had. The Dark Knight was different to Batman Begins in all of these ways, and it became probably the best superhero film, ever. Upon watching The Dark Knight, one thing immediately became apparent to me, and that was the film\u2019s handling of Gotham City. In Batman Begins, Gotham was portrayed as a dirty, grimy and mysterious city, with the whole place looking unstable. The Dark Knight completely changed this, and Gotham became a much cleaner, sleeker city with buildings and roads that resemble that of a city like Chicago, or maybe even New York. This was a welcome change to me, as I was never a fan of Gotham in Batman Begins.     Probably the one thing that people most admire about The Dark Knight, is the villain. Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker is to me, the best superhero villain ever committed to screen. It has yet to be beaten, or competed with. Heath brought a certain complexity to the role, not just being a laughing clown who\u2019s only intent is to cause chaos, the Joker actually has a goal, and he achieves it! There are few villains who are able to intimidate with such ease as the Joker, and in The Dark Knight, there are multiple scenes where you can feel the tension in the room when the Joker speaks. Because he\u2019s so unpredictable, you have no idea what he\u2019ll do. I could speak volumes about how great Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker is, but I\u2019m confident you all know this by now. The final thing that The Dark Knight did better than Batman Begins, is the action set-pieces, and the increase in quality here is incredible. One of my favourite sequences involves the Joker driving a truck, and Batman giving chase. The sequence is it beautifully shot, with the camera capturing every crucial moment, with not a single frame falling flat in its delivery. Something that\u2019s equally important is the score from Hans Zimmer, which has massively improved, elevating every scene it\u2019s in, but it\u2019s also recognised for its absence, with silence being used to great effect. The stakes in The Dark Knight are not higher than they were in Batman Begins. In-fact they are lower, but the better directing in this film means that even a finale with less lives at stake, holds more weight this time around, and pulls you in more. I also love The Dark Knight Rises, and I hold it to a similar degree to its predecessor, but the impact that The Dark Knight had on the genre as a whole, elevates it beyond anything that came before, or after.

            "answer_text": "Do you think a sequel can top an original? Who can show me an example? John Updike published \u201cRabbit, Run\u201d in 1960, the story of Harry \u201cRabbit\u201d Angstrom, who realises that life is a bit more prosaic and troublesome than his former highschool basketball star status had led him to believe. But Updike then went on to do something that I\u2019m not sure has been done elsewhere. He revisited the character approximately every 10 years, publishing \u201cRabbit Redux\u201d, \u201cRabbit Is Rich\u201d and \u201cRabbit At Rest\u201d in 1971, 1981 and 1990, respectively. Not only had the character aged 10 more years in each of those novels, but so too had Updike himself. His style had evolved, his attitudes to certain things had matured. It was a fascinating exercise.  Image credit poetry dispatch & other notes from the underground I liked \u201cRabbit, Run\u201d but I have to admit I struggled a little with \u201cRabbit Redux\u201d. I loved \u201cRabbit Is Rich\u201d and \u201cRabbit At Rest\u201d, in the closing chapter of which I shed real tears. The title left no room for surprise, as the novel moved towards its inevitable ending. The last two both won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and Updike is one of only three writers who have won that award twice.* The Pulitzers were well deserved, in my humble opinion. Maybe it helped that I read all four novels in one compendium edition, over the course of a month or so, sometime in the early nineties. I utterly immersed myself in Rabbit\u2019s life and to me, he is the most fully realised character in literature. Updike went on to include a novella \u201cRabbit Remembered\u201d, in a book of short stories in 2001. I almost wish he hadn\u2019t. Rabbit without Rabbit wasn\u2019t the same and the previous novels, in my mind, were complete and a thing unto themselves. To get back to the question, I don\u2019t think I would say the first sequel was better than the original, but the second and third sequels definitely were.  *Many people have won other Pulitzers (e.g. Drama, Journalism) more times.

            "answer_text": "Baahubali: The conclusion, cuz it slaps. Disclaimer: I'm not going to talk much about the first film. This answer is incredibly leaning towards the sequel.\ud83d\ude18 So to all the uncultured Indians out there(can't say I'll find many), Baahubali is a film about a young ruffian named Shivudu who falls in love with a beautiful lady and ends up uncovering his war-ridden past filled with deceit, betrayal, splendour and sadness. This is the poster of the first film.  It was a good film and it became a blockbuster hit and the reason? The ending left people confused. Imagine a person who loves a man like a father and is ready to support him through everything and he's even willing to give his life to him. The father figure admits to that person's son that he killed said man. Why? The answer's given in the sequel. Shivudu learns about his past and raises an army to overthrow his uncle, Palvaldevan. This is the poster of the second film.  A movie cannot be more perfect. It's god's gift to earth. It's one of India's highest earning movies and it was so highly anticipated that I could see paintings of the movie on the walls of Subways, McDonald's, Saravana bhavan, Sangeetha and Barbeque nation. Just look at the characters:        The power. Ah. The sets.    The coronation scenes of the king:      The war:          The outfits:   My eyes were glued to the screen throughout the movie and I watched it in the theatres 3 times, 21 times on TV. The splendour, the acting, the songs, the war and the dialogues; I can't. I literally can't speak enough about it. It's one of the world's most powerful historical films and you can fight me on this. I'm so proud of the reflection of our history. India was the second richest country in the world some 2000 years back. What you're seeing is not at all exaggerated. Some kingdoms in the Northern and Southern regions were even 100 times richer and more luxurious than this. So I hope you liked it. Please check this film out. Also, upvote, cuz I like seeing em big numbers. ",

            "answer_text": "The Empire Strikes Back is my alltime favorite movie, so yes. I should note here, though, that Empire was the first Star Wars film I ever saw, back in 1986. So it\u2019s not quite fair to say that I enjoyed the sequel more, since I didn\u2019t see A New Hope until about eight years after the first time I saw Empire. I think The Godfather Part II is superior to the original film. These movies I did watch in chronological order. So I can definitely say I prefer the sequel. I enjoy Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade more than Raiders. Similar to Star Wars, I saw Temple of Doom and Last Crusade many years before I saw Raiders, so my opinion may be affected by that. I prefer Octopussy to the other Bond films. Ant-Man and the Wasp is better than the first Ant-Man. Logan is better than any of the other solo Wolverine movies. X2: X-Men United is better than X-Men, and Days of Future Past is also better than the first X-men film. Toy Story 2 is better than Toy Story. Batman Returns is better than Batman. Winter Soldier is better than The First Avenger. Evil Dead 2 is better than Evil Dead. Harry Potter 8 is my favorite Potter film. Silence of the Lambs is better than Manhunter. The Avengers is the best MCU movie. Return of the King is definitely better than Two Towers, and only slightly better than Fellowship \u2014 though I go back and forth between liking Fellowship and Return more. Thor 3 is better than the first two. I\u2019m sure there are plenty more I haven\u2019t yet mentioned. ",

            "answer_text": "Without mentioning the usual, already written choices; a sequel I found to be more enjoyable than the original is: Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows  I really liked A Game of Shadows, maybe not a whole lot more than the first film (which is pretty good on its own right), but still a tad more. The second film improved on certain aspects that I thought the first film lacked. So why did I love the second one more? First off the villains! While I loved Mark Strong as Lord Blackwood, he wasn\u2019t anything beyond a 1 dimensional villain. He didn\u2019t feel as dangerous as Moriarty, which was portrayed excellently by Jared Harris. Moriarty in A Game of Shadows felt like the best version of the legendary villain. You know he\u2019s just as smart as Sherlock, which makes their encounters rather more interesting both knowing each to be an equal yet opposite of each other.  I also really liked the addition of Sebastian Moran, which Arthur Shelby (AKA Paul Anderson) portrayed quite well, I found it was an interesting contrast to Watson.  Another big thing that I found more enjoyable than the first one was the action scenes. That forrest battle scene is probably the pinnacle of Guy Ritchie\u2019s action style. The perfect combination between slow motion and fast pace action makes the scene really quite memorable and exciting.  Also, the A Game of Shadows added something that was very much missing from the first one and is also one of the most known aspects of Sherlock Holmes: Mycroft Holmes! While Stephen Fry may be a bit too comedic for it, he still did a memorable job and added a little bit of his own to the character.  The overall story (while I felt it a bit convoluted at times), I also felt was more intriguing and less predictable, which led to a very nail bitting climax in Switzerland. The story was always moving, even if at times it feels like it doesn\u2019t, it all makes sense by the end.  So for me A Game of Shadows manage to keep the best aspects of the first one, namely Sherlock and Watson, while also adding quite a bit more that will hopefully make for a satisfying conclusion in 2021 if/when the third film is released.

But, I am a very big fan of dancing and I love dancing movies. If you are a big fan of dancing movies, then you will definitely love what I am going to mention. This film is one of my favorites in all dancing movies that come out of Hollywood. It is a franchise series that started in 2006 and the movie is called: Step Up. And, it has five parts to this great series. My favorite sequel to this film is from the 2012 film: Step Up Revolution. I love hardcore and freestyle street dancing and this particular film has it all. And, what is so cool about this film is that almost the whole movie was based and filmed in Miami, Florida. This is the 4th installment (sequel) to the Step Up franchise series. The way this movie was told was beyond sick if you are a dance fanatic. I have been a huge fan of dancing for however long to understand for the love of different dance movies. And, for sure; Step Up Revolution is again one of my favorite dance films in Hollywood. Step Up Revolution is by far way better than the 2006 original Step Up film. ",

I felt like the first one had problems with the story like if the script was not finished when they started with shooting. The tone of the film changed for me a lot during last hour or so and I did not like that. I loved the second one (I still thing it is the best one from the series) because of great villain, lot of funny scenes, great action, it was not boring at all and I really cared for the characters. The ending was a great cliffhanger too. Third and fourth movies do not exist for me. The fifth was okay. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people seem to be using Follow-Ups as examples, not true sequels. If something is already part of a series, e.g., James Bond, Star Trek, Harry Potter, then the second movie made of that property is not a sequel. Sequels have many hurdles and being part of an existing series is a free pass over many of them. Aliens was a sequel to Alien. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s better, but I\u2019m satisfied when a true sequel is not decidedly worse. Terminator 2 (by the same director) was another very good sequel. So were Back to the Future parts II and III, imo. The Empire Strikes Back is regarded as a very good sequel. I\u2019d also nominate Toy Story 3, but I don\u2019t know if rules prohibit that if I don\u2019t think Toy Story 2 was a very good sequel. Most actual sequels are terrible. I don\u2019t know that any of the non-shameful ones I\u2019ve named actually TOP the original. (Certainly The Empire Strikes Back does not come close to topping Star Wars, and all the gazillion people who think so are certifiably insane.) ",

I think I like the originals best because I was awestruck at seeing those properties on the big screen for the first time. \u201cX-Men\u201d had a graceful touch and an ebb and flow of pace that the heavy-handed disaster-a-minute sequel \u201cX2\u201d lacked. *Angry fanboys will not be engaged in the comments.

            "answer_text": "Following the colossal critical and commercial success of 2016\u2019s Deadpool, a sequel was pretty much guaranteed. And it certainly didn't disappoint.  The film opens with Wade attempting to commit suicide by blowing himself up. Formerly an asset, his immortality has now become a burden\u2014an inescapable prison, trapping him against his will. He doesn\u2019t get the luxury of death that the rest of us do.  We then see the reason for his suicidal urges\u2014Vanessa\u2019s death. The scene is slow, quiet and uncomfortable, and the grief and anger Wade feels is almost tangible, suffocating us, captivating us.  The opening credits scene was beautifully well-crafted. Reminiscent of the Bond films of old, Celine Dion gave us a glorious, superbly sung sequence. And of course, what would an opening credits scene be without that snarky dash of humour sprinkled in?  I loved the original film, but to me the sequel was, and always will be, a superior viewing experience. Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz were wonderful additions to the already fun ensemble of actors. I particularly liked the references to Brolin\u2019s endeavours as Thanos, the Mad Titan. As with the first film, Wade Wilson couldn\u2019t miss out on some much-loved 4th wall breaking, a lovely addition to an almost perfect film.  But I think one of the main reasons I like this film so much is because it reminded me of another movie I hold dearly\u2014Logan. Both films show the protagonist struggling without their powers, and both films give the protagonist a character they care about and risk their life for\u2014Laura in Logan, and Russell in Deadpool 2. But seriously, I don\u2019t like the way Wade was throwing shade to Logan in the opening scene. I mean, come on! The guy\u2019s dead and you still can\u2019t give him a shred of respect? Not cool, Pooly.  ",

Of course, like everyone else said: Star Trek: The Motion Picture is empirically worse in every meaningful respect than Wrath of Khan.Star Wars: ESB is just plain better than ANH featuring a better story told better, with performances are legitimately decent.I would argue that in addition: James Bond: Daniel Craig era, Skyfall was to me the best of the series by a significant margin\u2014best pay off of many non-villain storylines and a wonderful send-off to a beloved character.James Bond: classic era, Goldfinger is easily the high-water mark of the Connery years, but Lazenby\u2019s On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service is probably my all-time favorite script, owing to its lowest level of deviation from the source material.",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Spider Man 2. I was not a huge fan of superhero movies as a kid. But I am a Roger Ebert fan. I saw a YouTube clip of his SM2 review. He himself cared for few superhero movies, but opens his TV review with: \u201cSpider Man 2\u2026may be the best superhero movie I have ever seen.\u201d Woah. Later, there was a \u201cBest of 2004\u201d episode. It was the 4th best movie. Why? Because Peter Parker is treated like a human, rather than a boring kid without the costume. It\u2019s deep, effective, and unlike any other superhero movie. I agree with all of this. I have seen this 5 times in the last 10 month and love it more each time. In the Bible, Paul says \u201cI consider all loss knowing Christ Jesus is my Lord.\u201d (Philippians 3:8) I have a similar approach: I consider all superhero movies to be loss knowing how great Spider Man 2 is. I saw Spider Man Homecoming recently. I liked it, but it isn\u2019t anywhere near SM2.  I suggest seeing this if you don\u2019t think it should at least be called great. ",

But actually they should not be compared; they are different flavors and each should be taken for what it is. T2 is a slick, fast-moving, well-crafted action movie with groundbreaking special effects (and even after a quarter of a century, they stand up incredibly well). T1 is in many ways an atmospheric horror movie (with tragic romance thrown in); the seemingly unstoppable \u201cmonster\u201d just happens to be a futuristic android instead of some supernatural thing. Some of the effects are dated; it is quite obvious when a rubber doll replaces Arnold, and stop motion always looks like stop motion. Some will however say that the dated effects are just charming.

I would also add Halloween II (1981), Halloween II (2009), Children of the Corn II, It: Chapter II, Nightmare on Elm Street 2 (though I still hated it and never watch any other sequels in the saga), Aliens vs Predator: Requiem, The Two Towers, American Pie 2, Bad Boys II, Rocky II, Back to the Future Part II, New Moon, Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again (it\u2019s as much a \u201csequel\u201d as Godfather II is) GI Joe: Retaliation, and Revenge of the Fallen. I also believe Jaws 2 is pretty much as good as the original (but the third and fourth films are terrible). And Caddyshack II gets undeservedly crapped on. ",

Part of the success of these movies is the wacky cult following that they gained because of Sam Raimi\u2019s total weirdness and Bruce Campbell becoming the perfect representation of a self-serving anti-hero. Pretty sure each subsequent film had a bigger budget as well. Side note: my kids used to play \u2018happy family\u2019 with an 18 inch Ash doll dressed as a baby in a stroller complete with chainsaw hand and sawed-off shotgun.

I enjoyed both movies, but the sequel hits on all cylinders and is a thoroughly enjoyable action/adventure movie. You just have to get past the timing of Rick and Eve\u2019s son (he shouldn\u2019t be that old already, given the dates proffered in the two movies), and some of the anachronisms, like keys in a car that should have had a push-button start, and the color of London Bridge at that time. Those sorts of things don\u2019t bother me for this sequel; it\u2019s just a delightful romp of a movie with characters you care about and villains you hate. ",

Toy Story 2 was much better than Toy Story. Back to the Future 3 was a little better than 1 and much better than 2. Tremors 2 is as good as Tremors on repeat viewings. Aliens had more interesting characters and didn\u2019t have as many stupidities. 2010 had more interesting characters and was not as boring on repeat viewings. Toy Story 2 was much more emotional and satisfying. Cowgirl went from being depressed to having a family again. Great stuff.

What I really loved about it was that they were pitted against something that was virtually unstoppable with the limited gear they had, yet one person managed to single-handedly defeat it after it had killed the rest of her crew. Truly a masterpiece. Aliens took the series to another level, bringing more action, story, and characters. It semi-sorta replicates the first movie, like I say, with more characters, more aliens, an alien queen, and numerous memorable quotes by the late Bill Paxton. Unlike the first, where the gang are trying to figure out how to kill the ALIEN, now the new gang are trying to figure out how to escape the ALIENS. Furthermore, I feel that the sequel has characters that you can admire more and practically root for e.g Hicks & Hudson, that is if you don\u2019t already love Ripley. ",

The Wrath of Khan, although based on a very slim premisse, delivered everything the fans were waiting since the cancelation of TOS. And was, in fact, much, much better than the first movie. It is, in fact, considered by a lot of fans to be the best movie of the franchise (I consider it a close call between it and ST IV - The Voyage Home). ",

Generally, if you have a good opening picture for a series, the producers try to recap too much on the glory of the first movie rather than take risks on a new plot element for the 2nd. In this case, the even movies generally suck. The odd ones force the producers to seek new and vibrant material and get a decent director. There is the opposite problem. What if you screwed up on the first movie but still want to keep the series going? Well, then (hopefully) the producers seek better writers, a better director and try to find something to make the 2nd movie better than the 1st. This is why even movies were generally pretty good for the Star Trek motion picture industry. http://www.cracked.com/article_15091_the-best-and-worst-star-trek-movies-all-time.html Why odd numbered Star Trek movies suck ",
