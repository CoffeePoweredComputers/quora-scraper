            "answer_text": "It is a fair question to ask. I always hated writing conclusions for essays and never felt like I knew what to say since I had just spent several pages arguing something. It always felt redundant to write a paragraph summarizing my argument. It wasn\u2019t until late in my college career as an undergrad that I realized I could use the conclusion to make sure I did actually make the points I was arguing in my paper. If you are an undergrad, I believe your instructors will be a bit more forgiving if you use \u201coverall\u201d or \u201cin conclusion.\u201d If you are in grad school, we expect a bit more from you. I would not, however, use both at the same time. For your concluding paragraph or paragraphs, you do not have to use anything of the sort. Instead, you can just start your paragraph off by wrapping up and revisiting your argument. It is clear that the women in Margaret Atwood\u2019s books are rallying against their place in patriarchal culture\u2026.Then revisit your examples. Or\u2026 The French New Wave was a short-lived film movement that had lasting effects that are still felt today. Quentin Tarantino is an example of\u2026. One last thing\u2014unless the essay is asking YOUR opinion, you should avoid using \u201cI think\u201d and \u201cI believe.\u201d Just start the sentence after those words. In terms of an academic essay, it lessens the impact of your argument. That is because unless you are an expert on the subject, your opinion is not a valid example. Facts are valid examples. Citing prose in a book or a scene in a film is an example. Your opinion is not a fact and lessens the validity of the argument. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, overall, in conclusion is okay to say but it is a clumsy way of speaking. Overall, provides a way of saying you will summarize in the concluding paragraph, its purpose. You can say what you think without the qualifier. Such as : After looking at the evidence I realized blonds had more fun. Or, I found concrete evidence blonds had more fun. Or just Evidently, blonds have more fun. In conclusion is also unneeded because the reader knows what you've looked at in your arguments. They're ready for the conclusion. One key to writing that communicates well is to simplify your sentences to eliminate anything unneeded. ",
