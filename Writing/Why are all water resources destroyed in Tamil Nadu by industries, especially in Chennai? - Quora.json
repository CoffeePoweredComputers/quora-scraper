            "answer_text": "It is a long story. If all of us are law abiding citizens this disaster could have been prevented. We are cheated by the most corrupt and low ranked politicians like Mr. Karunanidhi. His legacy has become an unending sorrow of Tamilnadu. He could destroy the truly nationalist leader who was honest to the core. He could depict him as anti Tamil and anti poor. He has amassed wealth by using his political power. He has created a very strong non Tamil vested interest to make Chennai a fortress for his selfish political game. He attracted the poor masses by offering shelters in Chennai to build his vote bank. Slum clearance board gave the impression that all who created slum will either make it their permanent residents or government will give them a better concrete shelter. The available open/ public lands were occupied by the poor and the vested interest. The dried up waterways, banks of the rivers, dried lakes, ponds and every available public places were encroached and blocked. The rain waters were diverted or pumped out from there. Thus 90% of 476 major water bodies linked to Chennai disappeared. This is the reason why we have floods but no water to drink later. With regard to industries polluting river water and other water bodies there is a pollution control board in the state and central governments. Buckingham and Carnatic Mills of East India company used canals for it\u2019s textile products , raw materials and chemicals. They dumped their soda ash and cinder wherever they found vacant land around their mills. Textile industrial towns like Tirupur and Coimbatore too let the chemical wastage in to canals linking water bodies. The industries in the neighboring states too playing havoc in polluting clean water rivers flowing to Tamilnadu. There is a plot or negligence of the states near Tamilnadu to allow the chemical industries to let flow the chemical wastes into the river waters that flow into Tamilnadu. We can blame it on pollution control boards, corruption and inaction against the vested interest and industries run by politicians or their relatives. Anyway, the central government projects like Hydro Carbon extraction in Kaveri delta will destroy everything including agriculture. Why the rest of India is quiet? There is no brotherhood or concern for others. Is this a war on a peaceful state? Is this not exploitation of Tamils by force? ",

            "answer_text": "Simple answer - byproduct of rapid industrialization Long answer: Generally, these industries are dirty industries like refinery, smelting, castings, dyeing, chemicals, recycling etc. During the first industrial revolution, Europe handled all these industries and they prospered. However after a certain period of time, they felt that it has too many side effects on their surroundings. So they shifted the high impact industries to second world countries like India, south east Asia and China. As we were struggling with proverty. We embraced these industries. Some of the famous ones are clothing industry of Tirupur, castings of Coimbatore, car,chemical and refinery industry in Chennai. Initially the benefits easily overshadowed the disadvantages. So the environmental regulations were not stringent. Everyone had a free run. However as years rolled by, we have moved more into cleaner industries like software which provides more value per impact it creates. So the industries which were so important at one point of time now appears as a burden for people. It's a common phenomenon across second world countries. So we are getting stricter economic norms and public opinion about industries. As a result, we are now transferring the same industries to third world countries like Nigeria etc. It's not that it's happening only in Chennai. It has happened in every city that experienced industrial revolution. Bangalore is comparingly better as it was software that took off majorly than other cities where industries were the first wave. Every city experienced a downfall and revived into a better phase. Now India is going towards the better phase of industrialization now. It's time for cleanup. ",
