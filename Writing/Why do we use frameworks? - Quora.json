            "answer_text": "We are always looking for new and innovative ways to reduce the time it takes to build a customer\u2019s website whilst boosting it\u2019s functionality. With this goal always in mind we\u2019ve built many websites in a variety of different ways and feel we have found the best way possible to build budget-friendly websites that perform well in search engines, have great functionality and won\u2019t break the bank. Our preferred framework for both Joomla and Wordpress websites is called Gantry and this framework makes it really easy for us as website developers to change and extend templates and designs incredibly easily. For example, if we wish to change the colour of hyperlinks in the content area, we can do that by filling in a colour field within the framework. If we wish to add module areas or additional sections to a website, we can easily do this within the framework. Without a framework, all these developments would need to be hand coded and that takes time \u2013 a lot of time. \u201cUsing a website framework like Gantry enables us to cut down web development project time considerably for our customers saving them time and money.\u201d Why even use a website framework? Why not just buy a template from a site like Templatemonster \u2013 they have more choice and are usually cheaper after all? The issue we have found with using a template website like Templatemonster is that whilst there\u2019s a variety of different designs to choose from, there\u2019s no consistency to how they\u2019ve been created and coded. This can cause issues down the track as every template will have it\u2019s own way of allocating colours, logos, pages, etc and a website design company would need to spend time finding their way around every template they use before they can even start building a website for a client. Combine this with compatibility issues with different modules and you can quickly get bogged down into lots of tiny, frustrating issues for every website that you build. The real advantage of using the same framework for each website design is you get a consistent development environment \u2013 reducing time spent on bug fixing, additional functionality and design changes, etc. Think of a website framework like a chef\u2019s kitchen. All the utensils, frying pans and cookers are the tools a chef uses to make the meal. That\u2019s what a website framework like Gantry is \u2013 tools that enable us to create beautiful website designs. Now imagine a chef that has to go into a different kitchen, with different pots and pans, utensils and cookers, etc every time he wants to cook a meal. That\u2019s going to cause inconsistent results with their output, take them longer to make and be a more frustrating process in the long run. Using the same kitchen, ingredients and tools every time means that chef can create something beautiful with consistent results in a timely fashion. \u201cUsing the same website framework means a consistent development environment and great results for our customers every time.\u201d Secure and safe widgets, plugins, modules, components and particles, etc By subscribing to a particular template provider we know that we\u2019re helping to support ongoing development of their templates, plugins, modules, components and particles. Not only that but we know that they\u2019re going to be built in a secure and well-structured way as they have a consistent team working on them. There\u2019s nothing wrong with free plugins, if they\u2019re built well and they\u2019re secure, but a quick Google search will show there\u2019s many vulnerable Wordpress plugins and vulnerable extenstions for Joomla \u2013 many of them being free. Using website templates and frameworks means you get a quality product with less problems Sure anyone can throw up a quick Wordpress or Joomla install, whack in a template, upload your logo and install a bunch of free plugins for you and only charge a very small fee, but I can 99% guarantee you that down the track you will be paying a proper website developer to fix all the bugs, issues, hacks or security problems your website is bound to have.

            "answer_text": "I used to have the same question why i am completing my education and transforming into a developer, these are the positives of using frameworks. Most of the frameworks are developed by people who are experienced in the field, so we slowly get used to the best practices when we start using them.As a beginners we might know or we might not about all the functionalities that the platform provides us, so by using frameworks we can start using them.Scaffolding a Application becomes much easier and saves a lot of time rather than manually adding all the components that we need.PS:- Usually when i start with a framework i go through all the libraries that are being used and learn their implementations too.
