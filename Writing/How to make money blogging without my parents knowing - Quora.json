For some, blogging is a way to blow off steam after a hard day at work. For others, it\u2019s a fun side hustle. One that allows them to make money on top of their normal day job. And still, for others, blogging has become a business. One so profitable they\u2019re able to quit their jobs, travel the world, and live life on their terms. All because they started. You see, blogging is a low cost, zero risk way to open new doors of opportunity that weren\u2019t previously there before. Doors that don\u2019t involve selling the latest fad toothpaste, LuLaRoe leggings, or Thirty-One bags to your friends and family on Facebook. No, we\u2019re done with all that. In this article I am going to walk you through, step-by-step, how to start a blog in 15 minutes or less, even if you\u2019re a total beginner. Before we dive in though, let\u2019s take a quick moment and look at the reasons why people start a blog.  Why Do People Blog? People often have very unique reasons for wanting to start a blog. Some are compassionate in nature \u2014 perhaps they want to educate others on a rare form of a disease they, or a family member, are struggling with. Others are informative \u2014 they want to chronicle a weight loss journey and inspire others to do the same. And others (reasons) are as straightforward as they get. They\u2019ve seen other people make money blogging about a certain topic and wonder if they can do the same. No matter your reason for wanting to start, with the right strategies, your blog can: Connect you with millions of people.Get your ideas out into the world.Make you more money than you could ever make at your 9 to 5.Think it can\u2019t happen to you? Think again: Just a few years ago I started blogging with absolutely no experience. We had no idea how to start a blog, nor did we really even know what we wanted to write about. Needless to say, things have changed in a short time. Learn from other top money making blogs We started at $0 just like everyone else, and now we\u2019re shooting to crack the $100,000/month barrier for the first time. And believe it or not, that\u2019s pennies compared to other successful bloggers. Take Michelle at Making Sense of Cents for example. In just 4 years Michelle went from making $672/mo to making over $100,000 per month from her blog. Take a look:  Or there\u2019s Melyssa, who made over $173,000 recently from her blog and online business:  It takes a lot of hard work to reach the elite ranks of Michelle and Melyssa, but that shouldn\u2019t stop you from trying. It\u2019s 100% feasible to start making a few hundred or even a few thousand dollars per month within just a few months of starting. We\u2019ve done it with this website, and you can too. How do bloggers make money? The cool thing about blogging is that there is a near limitless number of ways to make money. Using display adsAllowing companies to buy sponsored posts on your websiteAffiliate marketingSelling courses, ebooks or trainingsConsultingProviding a service, coaching or mentoringThe list goes on and on\u2026But before you start raking in cash from your blog, you first need to start your blog. And that can be a pretty intimidating hurdle for a lot of people, especially the non-tech peeps (like me). That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to walk you through, step-by-step, how to start a blog on WordPress using SiteGround(opens another tab). Why SiteGround? Well, in my experience, they are the best all around hosting company for new bloggers in terms of performance and cost. They\u2019ve also got a great infrastructure to accommodate your blog as it grows, which is really important. Are you ready to get started pursuing something awesome? Open Siteground in another tab and follow along with me.  How to Start a Blog on WordPress in 10 Simple Steps Step 1: Choose Your Hosting Plan By opening the link above you should land on a page that has three hosting options to choose from (StartUp, GrowBig, and GoGeek).  Assuming this is your first website, there\u2019s no need to go with anything other than the StartUp. It\u2019s the cheapest plan and has more than enough resources for a brand new website. This is a Managed WordPress hosting package; meaning it was built and optimized specifically with WordPress in mind. It makes your website faster, secure, and more reliable. It costs slightly more than a traditional web hosting package, but the extra cost will save you a headache down the road. More on that later. Step 2: Choose Your Domain Name Once you hit the \u201cBuy Now!\u201d button, you\u2019ll be directed to the order form. The first item on the list is the most important one: your domain name! This is the one and only name for your website, so give this some thought.  It can be tricky coming up with a name that isn\u2019t already claimed. Tips for choosing your domain name: Stick to just .com endings. Don\u2019t bother using .biz, .info, .org, or any other endings.Make your domain name simple and easy to remember.Leave out numbers, dashes and anything else other than letters.Step 3: Enter Your Hosting Plan Information This step determines your approximate initial cost to start your blog. It should be noted that Site Ground offers a 45-day money back guarantee. No matter how much you spend, if you end up deciding that blogging isn\u2019t for you within the first 45 days, you can get your money back, no questions asked. (Hence why blogging is an amazing opportunity to start your own business at a relatively low cost, with zero risk involved). In order to lock in the biggest discount, I recommend taking advantage of one of SiteGrounds\u2018 36-month hosting plans. It greatly reduces the overall cost of your blog, and you can typically get prices lower than $12.00/month (even lower when they\u2019re running special promotions). I mean what other business can you honestly start for less than that? None.  You\u2019ll also need to set up your HostGator Security PIN which you\u2019ll use to access the back end of your site. Write this down somewhere safe. Step 4: Enter Your Billing Information A pretty straightforward step. If you can\u2019t figure this part out, maybe this whole online business thing isn\u2019t for you. ?  Step 5: Choose Add-ons That You Want Fortunately, most of the add-ons that HostGator offers are already included in the price of the package. The only question is whether or not you need to tack on a SSL certificate (click here if you want to learn more about SSL certificates). That being said, the answer to that question is yes (you should add one).  Browsers are now displaying a small warning to users, when they first visit a site, if it is not secured with a SSL certificate. There\u2019s no better way to scare someone away from your site than a browser telling them they\u2019ve landed somewhere unsafe. If money\u2019s tight, you can forego this option till a later time, but I do recommend adding it now (there are also technical headaches that can be avoided down the road by getting one now). Step 6: Review Order Details and Submit Once you\u2019ve completed all the steps above, go through and make sure everything is the way you want it. I won\u2019t include a screenshot since everyone\u2019s checkout page will look slightly different based on their choices.Note: Depending on the length of the package you selected, your checkout price can vary greatly from what you may have expected. If you\u2019re on a budget and you can\u2019t afford the longest package (to get the full discount), that\u2019s totally okay. You\u2019ll inevitably pay more out of pocket for the lengthiest hosting plan, but you\u2019ll save 53% off the total cost of 3 years worth of blogging. There\u2019s no incentive for us to recommend one length of time over the other, you\u2019ll simply save the most by choosing the longer plans (plus you can always get a full refund, no questions asked). You\u2019ll also notice that there are a few other free perks: 24/7/365 Phone, LiveChat, Email Support and, again, the 45-day money back guarantee if you decide blogging isn\u2019t for you. Once you\u2019re all set, go ahead and hit \u201cCheckout Now!\u201d and let\u2019s get rolling. Step 7: Install WordPress Oh wait, you don\u2019t actually have to. That\u2019s one of the perks of purchasing a Managed WordPress plan. As far as blogging platforms go, WordPress is in rare company. In fact, WordPress sites now comprise more than 30% of the entire Internet. You could go with a smaller platform like Tumblr or Blogger\u2026or you can go with the content management system (CMS) chosen by: New York PostUSA TodayCNNFortuneTimeSpotifyTechCrunchCBSNBCIf those sites use WordPress, I think its safe to say you\u2019re choosing the right blogging platform.Note: It\u2019s important to know that it may take several minutes for your website to \u201cgo live\u201d. Typically this process takes less than 30 minutes but it could take several hours (your domain is \u201cpropagating\u201d so that visitors all over the world can see it). Basically, if your website does not appear right away, don\u2019t be alarmed, it just takes a few minutes for SiteGround to create something awesome. Although you won\u2019t need to check in here frequently, it does contain important information about when products may expire, allows you to setup email accounts, and is the go-to spot if you need to upgrade your hosting as your blog grows! It\u2019s also a good spot to get technical support if necessary. Step 8: Log Into Your WordPress Admin Dashboard Once your WordPress site goes live, you\u2019ll get an email confirmation message from HostGator giving you the info for where to access your WordPress login, your username, and a randomly generated password to sign in (you can change this later). Your WordPress Admin Dashboard can be found at http://yourwebsitename.com/wp-admin/ (Hint: You\u2019ll need to place your domain in the URL). And that\u2019s it! You\u2019re all set up and ready to go with your new site.  Step 9: Monetize Your Blog As you may have suspected, this is the hardest part. And to be perfectly honest with you, it\u2019s going to take time. If you just got done with the steps above, your initial focus should be on customizing your blog, creating content, and growing your audience, all before you start thinking about making money. To get you started I\u2019ve put together the exact blueprint for you to follow to make your first $1,000 blogging. Furthermore, here are a few parting tips I have on how to start a successful blog: Start learning about the different ways to monetize your blog. Choose the ones that sound interesting to you and start digging deeper into those topics.Make sure you\u2019re writing in a way that\u2019s easy to read. What do I mean by that? Be conversational, use short paragraphs, and use short sentences. Oddly enough, this is way harder than it sounds, especially for new bloggers. The way you learned to write in high school and college is not the way you want to write for your blog. I can\u2019t stress that enough.Your content needs to help people solve a problem. If it doesn\u2019t do that, then it better be entertaining. If you aren\u2019t doing either of these things, you\u2019re going to have a hard time getting readers to stick around.Use social media to promote your blog posts. I recommend starting with Pinterest. Check out my comprehensive Pinterest guide. Any more questions on how to start a blog? Let me know in the comments and I\u2019ll respond! Like this tutorial?

            "answer_text": "How do I make money blogging without my parents knowing? If you\u2019re still a child, you won\u2019t be able to set up a Paypal account without the help of another adult such as an adult brother/sister or other relative - they need to have a credit card. The money could be transferred to your bank account, but you would need to find someone you can trust. Blogging costs money - not just for the domain name but for a hosting company to put your site on the internet. If you use a free blog, there may be rules about whether you are allowed to sell goods or services - check the Terms and Conditions page very carefully. A free blog will also offer a free domain name, but they will still own it, so you could spend a long time building your blog and end up with nothing. One problem I see here is Income Tax. If you are a child, your parents are responsible for your income and may have to pay tax on it. So they need to know about it or they could be in trouble with the law. More importantly, why don\u2019t you want your parents to know? Do you want to say triumphantly, \u201cTa-da! Look! I earned $1000 blogging!\u201d - or are you afraid they\u2019ll grab your hard-earned cash? ",
