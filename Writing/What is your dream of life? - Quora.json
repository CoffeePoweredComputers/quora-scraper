            "answer_text": "I have a nice, large, clean house, with preferably at least 1 or 2 extra bedrooms than there are people living in the house (for the sake of having space for visitors). I live in a two-story house with a basement. The house is well-furnished; there are railings alongside the stairs and any balconies above the first floor with too little space between bars for any little children (whether mine or a visitor\u2019s) to squeeze through. The Master Bedroom is big, with a nice big king-size bed, and there are two walk-in closets and a nice big bathroom connected to it with a large shower room, with a sort of built-in bench of some kind to sit down while showering. There is also a nice, big bath tub, maybe with those hot tub/jet fixings, which is bubble-bath friendly (because I\u2019d love to spoil myself sometimes. Note: I would not try bubble bath and jets at the same time, as that is likely a recipe for disaster). There are enough rooms for a full family with any (if any?) children being able to have their own room. There are at least 3 bathrooms, so fighting over bathrooms is down to a minimum\u2026 The house could probably be cabin-ish, with a lot of wood and maybe a fancy-looking fireplace, but still with modern fixings and such, like a super nice kitchen and nice modern-looking colors splashed in appropriate rooms. But most importantly and least generically, there is a video game room! Which sounds very geeky, but bear with me. I\u2019ve seen many big fancy houses with a \u201ctheater room\u201d, with a big, flat screen (maybe even curved?!) TV, popcorn machine and some theater-style chairs even, with the walls lined with red velvety curtains or something. I\u2019ve got something similar in mind, but more with video games, and there\u2019s cabinets behind the curtains for space for games and consoles and such, and maybe even an additional TV that can be pulled out, in cases where the newer TVs won\u2019t display older systems in flattering graphics. Maybe instead of a bunch of theater-style seats, there\u2019d be some smaller comfy seats or couches nearer to the TV to make for easy gaming. Of course, it could ALSO be used for TV and movies, and some things could be switched out if necessary to make room for DVD players and such, but that\u2019s not nearly as fun! The house is probably in a nice, green, kind-of-rainy-but-not-excessively place, with some trees around and maybe a nice river/stream nearby. I work in game design/programming, and make lots of money, then at the end of the day come home to see my spouse and my (possible) kids, maybe one or all of them are adopted. We eat dinner together as a family, and I take somewhat frequent vacations and breaks to spend time with them and go out and have fun and make memories and form ever-closer relationships. I also rarely have to cook, because A) my spouse can cook very well and enjoys doing so, and/or B) I (or combined with my spouse\u2019s paycheck, if spouse works too) make enough money that we can eat out, or put minimal effort into meals since most of the meal is already made from store-bought materials. (But we eat a lot of pasta at home, frequently, and the fridge is consistently stocked with leftover noodles and Parmesan. Nice.) Our family has good, open communication, with little judgement and consistent efforts to be better people and kinder to each other. We are happy, and we love each other. Of course, this is the \u201cdream\u201d life, so much of it might come off as unrealistic. It\u2019s pretty foofy-frilly dreamy idealistic life. Nonetheless, I\u2019m more than happy to dream of, and more importantly, work towards, having a life like this. One day\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Look, guys. Everyone else is writing about making an impact, or finding a loved one, or do something actually important. I don\u2019t want that. I just wanna grow up and get an average-ish job. Maybe one as a consultant in a small company, or a coder at some tech company. Not a lawyer, not a doctor, not some stupid time-consuming office job I don\u2019t want. Maybe a 9\u20135 job, or maybe even a stay-at-home job. Breakfast? Nothing fancy. I don\u2019t care about eating as much as my family does. Maybe some bread or a Chinese pastry, some fruit or veggies, and a hard-boiled egg. I\u2019d bike to work, hopefully, or take a taxi. I don\u2019t want to own a car. Lunch hour might just be a Chipotle, or maybe MOD pizza if I feel like eating unhealthily that day. Most of the time, it\u2019d be a salad. I don\u2019t really care\u2026? At about six or seven, I\u2019d get home. I want to live alone, or at least with a friend. No point in further explaining that. I don\u2019t want to get married, or have kids. I want good friends, perhaps, but I want to live alone. Nothing too fancy, just a small apartment. I\u2019d put on some music, switch to pajama\u2019s. I want to live in a big city, though, a place where I can go out and party without driving. I would eat a stupid and cheap un-nutritional dinner (swiss cheese, an apple, bread, and some goddamn beer) and watch a TV show and unwind. Maybe hang out or get a simple dinner with some friends. If it\u2019s a Friday night, I might as well get wasted. Electronics? I don\u2019t want much. Fuck an \u201cAmazon Alexa\u201d or a large-screen TV, or whatever we\u2019re coming up with then. All I need is a laptop and a decent phone that works with Summoners War and Discord. My current Laptop costed 250$, and I love it. Household furniture? Fuck that, I don\u2019t care how pretty my chair looks. Get me a cheap-ass used sofa with a bit of bounciness and a used desk from eBay and a few chairs for about 500$ in all (I just searched some up and added it up, the stuff I\u2019d buy is literally 500$ in all). The things I\u2019d spend money on? I want a pet bird. A Pacific Parrotlet, specifically. Their care is kinda expensive, but it\u2019s honestly not that bad. Maybe one or two would be enough, and with the job hours I want, I\u2019d be fine with taking care of them mentally. I want a Spotify Premium account and a Netflix subscription. Maybe Amazon Prime\u2026? Not that sure on the last one. Point is, I don\u2019t want a glorious life. I don\u2019t need money, I don\u2019t need fancy things. I need friends\u2026 and happiness. That\u2019s all I want. And I have literally no idea whether the job I\u2019m describing would be enough to support the lifestyle I\u2019m looking at, and I don\u2019t know whether this is realistic at all. But that\u2019s all I want. Fin,Rose. ",

And until it is rid away of, I thereof, want to escape and be nonexistent within it.. I want to be unleashed by the laws as much possibly as I can, to be away of people who are void of compassion.. I don\u2019t want to get hurt by anyone else out of their own pain, ignorance and upbringing, and I don\u2019t want to hurt others. I don\u2019t want to be told what to do\u2026 Nor do I, to hear of all the tragedy of the world when I have my own turmoil, trauma and pain.. I do not care to attach to things that need not be attached to.. I wouldn\u2019t want to engage with anyone\u2026 For work, is just want to run a business from home and then use my writings as spruce of income, but in my society, I reconstructed how money is currently handled and do away with its current form, because it is one of the evil corrupters of mankind, that negatively manipulates the innate evil within every human.. Lust, greed, unauthenticity, jealousy, crime, illness, stress, competition, doing bad pit of need to survive, as you cannot survive without money.. Though some form of currency is necessary, for if we didn\u2019t have it, it\u2019d also create greed and competition and others wouldn\u2019t know what\u2019s theirs and who gets what..

I wrote many poems when I was younger a a few songs and once I regain enough energy, I\u2019d like to pursue more of this..Have one person that I\u2019m very attached to and have them forever live with me in my lake mountain mansion in a fantasy.. I need only one person. Though I\u2019d be horrified of losing this person\u2026 It doesn\u2019t even have to be romantic.. I would hope we would be so attached, that if were one of us to die, we\u2019d be able to communicate with one another astrally, and through signs.. Maybe even physically see their spirit, and since living a life uncorrupt of influence that distorts clairvoyance, it\u2019s possible it would happen..Find some way to forever preserve youth and childhood, and make earth a sanctuary that is heavenly itself \u2026 Growing up and losing innocence is one of the most corruptive and evil of things..",

I make it back to my apartment and it feels like it\u2019s fifty pounds of cast iron skillets. What\u2019s in here the bag is locked? Why can\u2019t I just rip the fabric? I guess I\u2019ll wait til a little later. I\u2019m going to Lowe\u2019s to buy a tool or something to open this lock. I think it\u2019s a bag of hammers or maybe some part to the plane that comes in squares. Ah who cares I\u2019ll just go to Mc Donald\u2019s and get some French fries. Maybe a diet Sunkist and cone of ice cream. Today is a fantastic day I feel great. Looks like the plane crash made the news. Wow two bankers robbed the federal reserve and tried to get away with 50 million dollars. Huh weird I\u2019m gonna drink this orange Sunkist and dip my fries in ketchup. Then a smile hits me slowly just like the one you see on people who are truly happy. There are no words I start crying and smiling and I feel like spinning around!! I start spinning around crying out loud. It\u2019s not true this is just a bag of airplane parts. I\u2019ve got a chance now. Buying a passport buying my sister her house she always wanted laying low not making any big changes. Omg but tomorrow I can afford the filet of fish!! I can afford to help everyone I have ever met. I can put envelopes of money in every homeless persons hands I can afford to bury the poor. I\u2019m going to start a farm because it\u2019s been my dream to always have a farm. Too bad I didn\u2019t give the money back but I noticed a couple days after the federal reserve was robbed a war was started so it will be quickly forgotten. I can\u2019t wait to see the look on my sisters face when she opens he envelope that says she owns her property. She can keep her retirement all to herself. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, for me, I have a lot of dreams and things I want to achieve in my life. But these are my main dreams that I want to achieve in my lifetime: Travel the world   I never thought of traveling to every country in the world. But I do hope I can travel to every country that I love, such as the US, Canada, England, Spain, Morocco, Egypt, Italy, France, Germany, China, South Korea, Japan, Russia, Vietnam, Philippines, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and many other countries out there. I want to try new things in life. I want to step out of my comfort zone and start adventuring to different places I\u2019ve never seen before. Yes, I know I\u2019ve seen pictures of those countries on the internet, but here\u2019s the question \u201cDoes that mean I have experienced everything just my looking at the picture?\u201d Well, of course not. And that\u2019s why I want to see and experience it myself, not only through my device, but in-person. Traveling is something almost everybody in this world loves, including me. I want to admit one thing though, I never traveled overseas yet in my life. I have travel envy whenever I see people traveling and doing fun things, but does that mean I envy them, like in a negative way? Of course not! They may have made me jealous, but they also made me want to be just like them once I grow up. Traveling can be a great memory for you and other people to remember. Not temporarily, but a lifetime! So I\u2019m going to give it my all so I can travel the world and make this dream of mine come true. Become successful in life I don\u2019t want to be a millionaire or a billionaire. That\u2019s not my main point. I never thought of become an entrepreneur and be successful like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, or any of them, no. I just want to become successful, as in having a stable job with good enough salary, have a loving family who can care and understand me well, and be productive at spending my day. Everybody has their own definition of success. And this is my definition of it. Although I might have said I don\u2019t want to be a millionaire or billionaire, that doesn\u2019t mean I never want to achieve that. I would be glad if I can, but that\u2019s not my main point when I say I want to become successful in life. Be the best version of myself I don\u2019t want to compare myself to others. I don\u2019t want to be insecure about myself. I just want to be myself, and be the best version of myself that I can be. That\u2019s what I truly want in myself. I know a lot of people who always compare themselves to others, and although this can be good at times (I\u2019ll admit, I also do that sometimes), there are those who does it negatively and they ended up feeling insecure about themselves that they hate themselves and never think they\u2019re worth it. That\u2019s negative, and should be avoided at all costs. Instead, compare yourself to others in a good and positive way that can benefit both you and the person you\u2019re comparing yourself with. Never fill your mind with negative things. Instead, do the opposite and just be yourself. Be the best version of yourself that you really want! ",

            "answer_text": "Always on a coastline with the water always to my left. Strange unknown structures and buildings that somehow feel familiar but then again don't to my right. Quite often a feeling of working on a ship or some other floatation device fixing up or rectifying or creating something I don't understand. All Is Strange but I don't feel lost I know I belong here. This is the general set out for a dream I have quite regularly. I really have no knowledge of where I am but I just know that it's where I'm supposed to be. I always advance up the coastline with the water always to my left I never turn in land or back just a relentless push forward. I don't know where it leads but I'm bound to follow. Sometimes these dreams have dangerous overtones and have involved fighting and other forms of combat. Which strangely for a Dream I actually feel pain. This sometimes wakes me other times it doesn't. I don't know if it's ordinary to feel pain in a dream but I'm not unique so it happens to me therefore others must cop it. I used to get lucid dreams quite often. I curse myself now for not taking advantage of them to learn more about the Dreamworld .instead I treated them like I treat everything, just another adventure to have fun with and then move on. Sometimes I wake up from the Coast Line dream feeling satisfied I'd learnt something. Others it was fearful because I had not achieved a particular task. On other occasions I have woken to have a complete recollection of a dream in total. I lay there in the dark going through the memory searching, searching for clues and sometimes finding a gem that sits in the jigsaw. But never ever have I had any clue as to where I am or what I am. I just am, no thoughts of evil, or goodness. Sometimes these dreams can run like a television episode in sequence. One nightmare I had and it was the greatest granddaddy of nightmares. Ran over the course of four nights it was a dreadful dream it just picked up from the night before. I was in a deserted farmhouse way Off The Beaten Track. I can't recall who my companions were but I think one was a girl and one a bloke that's my age. The protagonists the things of Nightmare arrived at this deserted farmhouse in 1960s models Mini Minors. 4 of them each carrying 4 people. At first all seems well they looked a bit dodgy, but trust me anyone in this part of the world looks dodgy because they generally have some warped ideas going on. Anyway as the dream progressed the people began to look less dodgy and more downright dangerous. Strange secretive unnerving. Different somehow. That was the note the first episode ended on unsettling, but not horrifying. Night 2 begin on a bad note one of these visitors had found a recently buried dog and was munching it with gusto. Much to the disgust of me and my two companions. Once in the course of his eating one of his fellow travelers yelled at him \u201cwhy are you eating that bloody dog .You never going to get anything from it. Piss off said our dog muncher and got on with his maniacal nibbling. Somehow one of them got me cornered in a laundry or an outhouse. Told me they could only survive by eating the flesh of the still living. We 3 were the coming banquet for tomorrow's late tea. Dream ended there on that somewhat dramatic note. When I awoke I was physically and mentally not in a very good state in fact I was saturated with sweat it was dripping off me. Night 3 . You've got to bear in mind that this dream even in it's episodic way was completely real to me ,as realistic as the red dust that makes up the outback. Dream resumes from where it left off. He was holding a large rusty carving knife while telling me this was what he was going to cut me up with. it had yellow paint stain on the handle and part way down the blade. Human Nature took over ,he was holding a blade at me, I pulled a flick knife on him a good size stiletto sharp enough to shave with. Acting upon a longtime Mantra of he who hesitates dies. I plunged the knife deeply into the left side of his chest as was possible. Nothing happened he made no sound no bleeding and no Falling To The Ground just stood there with his blade in his hand looking at me with deep dark eyes I hadn't noticed earlier. Then he raised his blade to have a go at me it was in that moment I realised that he was already dead and so were his 15 companions. Wakefulness brought me back to Sanity sweating like it was going out of fashion. Nightfall arrived it was nearly Dreamtime again. In spite of the previous 3 episodes rattling my chain somewhat .I had to know how the dream was going to end if indeed it was going to end tonight. My companions and I determined that mere knives or axes. Weren't going to cut it so to speak. But we had found a store of old gasoline. We split it into 4 five gallon containers. And did what the witch hunters did. Splashed them with enough fuel and then we lit them up. The screaming was intolerable it was more a screeching howling wind filled with terror than a scream. The creatures aimlessly scrambling around the farmyard. screaming in Fury that their misappropriated lives were being removed from them. Then we found a vehicle that worked and headed for the highway. who knows to find another hell. it was after all only a dream and our dreams don't hurt us do they ? This is a really cut down version of that dream it's reality and it's intensity still Jar me today quite a few years after having it. I hope that having now recounted it I don't have to re dream it.

            "answer_text": "Probably the question for me is what are your \u201cambitions\u201d. Let just start from beginning. When I was 5 years old my father went outside the city for an audit and he bought me a doctor set from there and while playing with it I decided that I want to be a doctor . At the age of 10 I went for a trip by air and boarded the plane for the first time. Then I decided I wanted to be a pilot. At the age of 14 I wrote an essay on where there is a will there's a way. It got a lot of appreciation from teachers that day I decided that I wanted to be a writer. At the age of 15 I represented my school in a zonal level dance competition and was qualified for the state level. Dancer was a good choice then. At the age of 16 I gave a speech in school assembly. And my ambition was changed to becoming an anchor or a speaker. At the age of 22 years I ended up being an inorganic chemist. These things still make me laugh. What I am today is very much different from what all I wanted to be. But still I am happy because I have worked Hard to earn it. The ambition which I have now(more sensible one) and would work hard for them I want to be known as an independent woman. The woman who is not dependant on anybody for her needs To make my parents proud. I want my parents to be known by my name To provide love and care to all those children who are deprived of it. If we are born in a good family we have previlages why can't we use them to help others. Those children definitely need them. To take care of my parents. BEing a daughter I want my parents to stay with me. I want to take care of them the way they did it for me. To cherish each and everything life has given me and to work harder for things I want. ",

I want to revolitionize the music industry, not so much the industry, but the music itself, I want to evolve it and bring the future to us in terms of sound and communication. I want to become a recognized global music icon and gain respect similar to the likes of Michael Jackson, 2pac and Elvis. That\u2019s only stage one. Stage one is there to provide me with the power and influence to do bigger things. With stage one finished I should have a good base to acomplish other things. One is to bring the future of fashion to us. Create my own design brand and create wild concepts of the future including fashion cybernetics and technology. I want to invest in technological research and advancement in the field of teleportation, and hopefully make groundbreaking achievement. I want to make movies or perhaps some other form of storytelling that will be far more dated. I want to research this field. I want to perhaps write a book about my experiences with life when I\u2019m older. These are some of the points I know I will get into after stage one. Stage one is my primary focus as of now. I have a deadline to finish it before 30, otherwise it will be harder for me to do all the other things. Let\u2019s get to work! ",

And some of them are movie-length, but without a satisfactory ending, poorly scripted and directed, LOL. And, of course, NO credits or subtitles. Or even music, I have to do something about that [mental note, music to accompany my dreams from now on]. I\u2019ve had dreams, after watching any movie, of being IN that movie, including horror/comedy/sci-fi movies. I had a dream, about \u201cgoing postal\u201d screaming at everyone I worked with, and complete with the generic staring from people, as in their own WTF expressions - that look, that \u201che\u2019s never done this before\u201d look. And maybe in the dream, they were worried I was going to be violent or something, but I didn\u2019t physically harm them just ranted like a mad man, like something had really [swearword] me off.  When I woke up, I honestly thought I was going to get fired for being like that, LOL. I thought it had happened, and someone was going to ring me and say something like \u201cwe have to talk about your being angry the other day, and why we decided to let you go, and I would like to suggest anger management therapy at the very least, before you consider a job anywhere. What you did, is just not acceptable, and some of us are wondering why it happened? Are you okay?\u201d I had another different dream of somehow getting the local train, with Clint Eastwood on board - as you do. Like that would happen where I live, maybe he was doing a movie in the area? Probably not, but hey it was a dream. I had a dream where EACH carriage of the train, was the size of a room in the Post Office, LOL. And for some strange reason, I was attempting to move from carriage to carriage, without being soaked by some brown glue and trying to get past several boxes of envelopes and letters etc. And I have never worked for any Post Office in that capacity, including mail room. Most of my best or weirdest dreams have NEVER reflected actual life or situations involving work, at all. Movies, sure, but never day to day stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "I want to live in an isolated lighthouse. And this is currently my main lighthouse of choice:  The place has a troubled history, however, as explained in this article written by Christy Heather from listverse.com: \u201cTevennec Lighthouse is a tiny structure that sits in isolation off the coast of Brittany, France. It has a long association with horror. Folklore tells that it was a repository for the corpses of the local dead and that it was inhabited by Ankou, the personification of Death itself. The lighthouse was constructed in 1875, and the first keeper succumbed to mental illness, hearing voices telling him to leave. As a result, running this isolated lighthouse became a two-man job and no one was to be there for more than a year. After the deaths of a two-man team, it was decided that men could take their wives. Still, some men on duty died unexpectedly and others killed themselves. No matter what was tried, even exorcisms, nothing seemed to help. After the partial destruction of the dwelling in a storm (while a keeper\u2019s wife was giving birth, to add to the drama), the lighthouse was fully automated in 1910. There have been plans to turn the island into an artist\u2019s retreat, but this has not been successful so far. Maybe Ankou doesn\u2019t want paint everywhere.\u201d Me again. I don\u2019t care about any of that. What a dream home! ",

Downstairs the floors would be reinforced black mirrored glass, with fitted bookcase of reinforced glass. Walls whiter than white, used in art galleries. With chrome deco picture lights over each painting, consisting of Picasso and Braque cubist period.

Although it\u2019s pre Art Deco, I\u2019d quite like one bedroom to be completed in the Mackintosh style. A 1988 Porsche 911 in the garage would finish it off nicely. How would I draw all this, for the exterior and ground plan I\u2019d use grid paper, the interior designs would be drawn free hand, perhaps using gouache or coloured inks. Probably not very professional, but I\u2019d feel comfortable doing that way. ",

The spaceship blasts off, puffing smoke onto the ground and the pressure pushes you back into your seat and your eyes tear. After minutes you unbuckle your seat belt and gently float around alone in your ship, peacefully admiring the lack of gravity. After an hour or so you reach the atmosphere of the moon. You get on your heavy spacesuit and get on the teather. As you step out the door, the gravity lifts you up as you gently push off floating Away like a free balloon. I helplessly continue forward as I look to the stars. I face the beautiful moon that I talked to down on earth. I admire her beauty. I\u2019m pulled back from the teather, get back in, and land. I float down as I hop of the ship. I \u201cfeel\u201d the moons solid state of material. I place some in a plastic bag to actually feel later. I can could still feel the presence of the moons power. My footprints stain the the moon.

            "answer_text": "This is first time I am sharing my dreams on Quora. Because it is way too far out of my reach. So you can say it daydream. But this is what I think of when I am sleeping, waking up or relaxing\u2026 Every day, every night. Please don't judge me without reading whole answer.  1st priority of my life is to serve. Society, Nation, humanity. I am doctor. Want to be a neurosurgeon. Why? Because Neurosurgery is associated with highest mortality (death) and morbidity (disease affecting life!) I want to do some research and want to have some positive impact.Neurosurgeon is the best person who can adress trauma and most likely to create difference in life of someone in emergency.In all fields of medicine, Neurosurgeon is one of the hardest working doctor and also doing one of the toughest jobs! As byproduct Neurosurgery will give me huge amount of money. Let me tell you, I don't have any special needs. I can live and travel without AC. Can sleep on floor, can eat any food which is Jain and healthy. I never buy anything for brands. When I will have very good amount of money, may be my expenses will rise but not in priority. 1st thing I want to do is to give my parents some better quality of life. Because they have just brought everything expensive for us (me & my sis) and themselves lived a simple life! So I know a few things they would like to use even if they refuse now. But they are very very simple so that I can do it in residenship too. But my real story of dreams start now.  I want to buy something like this. An ambulance, want to load it with some medicines, and go to remote villages. So I will spend some of my holidays in free medical camps and serve poor people who can't even come to hospitals in city.  This is my dream since last 3\u20134 years! Because even as a medical student, I was habitual of going to camps due to some great doctors around who used to donate for same!  I want to make a system in hospital where in emergency no money is taken in advance and atleast for children money should not be reason of refusal of surgeries. It's a huge thing, because in surgeries, share of income of doctor is just 10-15-20%. So in case if someone can't pay anything, it needs a huge huge donation apart from a surgeon's big heart who can operate for free.  Still in 2019, in India there are lakhs of children who can't go to school. I just hope, I can help a few number of children to go to school by providing some financial support! Even there are some retired teachers and volunteers who can teach those children but lacks environment, trust and security. There are many plans related to that. Because I have visited huge amount of those people and know their actual problems. I have lived for few days in small peripheral villages for medical camps. Or regular visit in urban slums of my city.  I want to start permanent helpline for suicide prevention. In India, most common cause of death in youngsters is Suicide. Hundreds of potential good lives lost in India just because of lack of some support, communication and preventable/avoidable reasons. Happy to say till now I have counseled around 300\u2013350 people for same and most if then are traceable and successful today. But this is very very small number for me. I want to reach when I can't even estimate number.  I want to work for adolescents in helping them taking right decisions. Because at most crucial stage of life, when decisions on career and relationship can change whole life from upside down, very very few luckiest guys get proper guidence on what is right vs wrong. In career, I can bet, more than 95% students in my country choose career without any interest and that's why living unhappy unsatisfied life!!!  I want to engage myself in research activities. I want to publish my articles in reputed journals. I want to go and present my work in big international conferences. I want to keep learning for whole of my life.  I am very much passionate about teaching. Even as an intern, I love to teach complex medical concepts in very simple words to my juniors. So I want to take some lectures just for fun and to provide some help to medico friends.  Few personal dreams which are not so high on priority. I hope I live with my family always. And as of now, I always have most happy family with beautiful relations and strongest bonds. And few good friends!I want to write a book. I hope I can write atleast one before I die.I want to travel world. Explore new places, cultures , meeting new people. (I said travel - not only tour). As an overview, I want to stay alive. I want to stay humble & kind. I want to stay curious, childish and foolish as I am now! Even if I can't do big things or change so many things, I want to die with satisfaction that I always gave more than I got. I want to live my life like I can smile at my last moment and say proudly, I lived my life in a way I wanted. ",

And the thing that doesn't let me sleep is the fascinating night sky! This vast expanse of observable universe that stretches infinitely holding billions of galaxies and black holes that are million times the size we could ever imagine. We human beings are even smaller than a pin point as compared to the magnificent cosmos and space. I have a dream of going out beyond the horizons into the space , into the universe and explore things. I want to know about each and every bit , right from the beginning of universe to formation and existence of black holes and other galaxies . Movies like Interstellar, The Martin have greatly ignited my desires . I feel like knowing the secrets of the cosmos. Stephan Hawking's documentaries have satisfied me to a great extent but yet , there lies a part of me that is eager to digest the other unsolved mysteries. I want to see myself in the space suit,just like Mark Watney( dude ,he looked damn s3xy) and experience what Neil Armstrong felt while he set his left foot on the moon. How will it be to be on Mars and how is it like being near a black hole ( i wouldn't survive then, perhaps to share what it felt like, lol) I think this dream is a bit quixotic to be accomplished, but yes,it has stolen my sleep since years . Wish I could flaunt someday- Hurray! My dream came true! ",

Age 5\u20136: I was very much fascinated by my class teacher that I wanted to be teacher only. The black Godrej almirahs is my testament of how badly I wanted to be a teacher that it has only chalk stains on it.Age 10\u201312: I got obsessed with the idea of being Miss India. Please don\u2019t judge and please don\u2019t laugh. It was a genuine dream. May be cause of too much TV or mesmerised by being all this glitter and glam.Age 13\u201314: Journalism may be?Age 18: Got into an engineering college (surprise surprise) with this aim that I will get a PhD degree and have a Dr. in-front of my name.Clearly all this never worked out cause right now I am working in a Central govt. autonomous sector and won\u2019t say that I hate it but I don\u2019t like it either. One thing I understood that life never works out they way we vision when we are young. May be we can direct or drive it to our goals but it doesn\u2019t exactly turn out to be way we want it. So to answer what is my dream of life? I would say two things: I want to be a good person. No I mean it. Being a good person is difficult, especially in these times. Often we do or say things to our friends, family and relatives which at first may sound funny but after we realise what we actually meant. Good person doesn\u2019t mean good marks or do well in life or always do good deeds. It also means to have a good, encouraging feeling towards life, be responsible and be cautious. How good of a person is not decided by how well you\u2019re doing in life but it depends on how you treat your present. How true you\u2019re to everyone and everything including YOU. So being a good person is something I dream to be.And I want to travel to these two places and that too solo. Auschwitz Camp  Fushimi Inari temple. I really want to go these two places and I would do anything to be there, to be present there and witness everything. For the Auschwitz camp, I am really intrigued, empathetic and very curious about the life of jews who were held in this particular concentration camp. And I have read books, seen documentaries which has invoked a grave interest for a very long time. About the temple, I don\u2019t know, something about the red pillar entrance that draws me towards it and I just want to sit there, relax and soak in everything around me. May be write a travel journal, detailing what I saw and felt. I am really saving it up for these two travels. I hope I can successfully stick to my dreams and get to live it. May be write my experiences about it On Quora some day. One at a time. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, I\u2019m from Tamil Nadu (southern area). Currently, I\u2019m working as an accountant in one private company. My salary is Rs. 6960 /- only per month. This salary is not enough for my live and daily expenses. I want to earn more above at least 15k. But my knowledge is not sufficient to touch that hike. My aim is nothing special to say. But I want to speak English very fluently. I would like to travel all over the world. If we want to travel, we must know English then only we can able to survive in other countries or states. So, I have tried many ways to speak. But it does not help me to speak fluently. When I try to speak, I\u2019m trembling in front of all. So, I decided to go to a spoken English class. I was very excited to go. I had built a huge dream after I pay my joining fee in that institute. \u201cHereafter I will speak English I can take my seminar in English\u201d. Lots of dreams I had in my mind before joining the class. On the first day of my class, I eagerly entering the class, but everyone was staring at me. (they all are children at the age of below 10) Their English teacher was absent for a while. So, they thought of me as a new teacher. I was humiliated. The children came and sat next to me and ask a question about English grammar. I cannot tell them that I didn\u2019t come to teach u all. But then they have known that I\u2019m not their teacher from the institute owner. After a two day, the teacher came, she looks beautiful. She speaks very politely to all students and said how much missed them all. Then she told me to introduce myself in English (she has already heard myself from the institute owner). I started to explain myself as she told. After heard all about me She said that you speak well. The birds were fled in my heart when I get compliments from her. The days were passing, she told me to follow one principle to speak English. That is, \u201cThink English when you see an object or anything\u201d. She has given homework to write down my own memories in English. I did all that she said. I have learned new English words and my pronunciation was changed little more. But my trembling never changed when I speak in English. When she started to chat with me in English, my mother tongue automatically comes by naturally. Then I left that spoken English class due to my poor economy. Still, I have trying to speak English. Even I left that English class, but I didn\u2019t give up my aim. I have watched many English movies and k-dramas with subs, I can understand what the concept of movies is and points, jokes, etc..., But I won\u2019t be able to speak English fluently till now. What I learned from trying to speak English, I need to learn and know newer English words, I should interact with well-known English speakers. When I was surfing on the internet, I came to know this website. From that day I addict this. So, I use Quora every day and started to follow many peoples and reading their stories to develop my English skills. Sorry for my poor English. I know it will be very hard for you to understand because of grammatical errors. ",

I have- Personal goals- To be more social and feel connected to people rather than being socially awkward.Stop being stubborn.To learn time management, which has lacked hitherto.To grow spiritually.Stop being materialistic.Try to be more emotional rather than being practical all the time.Short term goals- To read more and more books possible. I aim to finish at least 1 novel in a month, and I achieve this quite often.To write essays on any current topic. Yes, this is a practice I do in couple of weeks. I decide any social or current topic and write an essay on it. I think it\u2019s a good way to increase creativity and brush up writing skills too.To prevent myself from using more social networking like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc.To read newspaper everyday.Improve my handwriting. I write a little small. My friend thinks that I pen down 1 whole page in just a paragraph. Moreover, he jokes that one needs a magnifying lens to read it.Long term goals- Stay in touch with my former teachers and some friends who are special to me and have gave me unconditionally.To maintain my vocabulary notebook. It\u2019s because many a times I feel my vocabulary is altogether too limited to express my thoughts.To serve the nation.Be a responsible daughter and loving sister.To help at least 1 person to accomplish their dreams.To follow this- \u201cSimple living and high thinking!\u201dThanks for reading!

I wanted to become a child specialist, because children are future of our Nation. If they are healthy, then our country is also become healthy and wealthy. And all knows health is wealth. Firstly, to become a doctor, I chose medical stream in class +1 and studied well. In +2, I wanted to come in list of top 10 of our state, Himachal. But it remains a dream for me. I score only 91.6%,that day I realised what is Failure, because never before that I feel so hurt. That day is worse day for me. But my Dad says to me, \u201cIt's beginning of hardwork in your life\u201d. So, welcomed it. It is so inspirational to me. Then, I started preparation for Neet 2018. I have only one month for preparation. So,i joined a coaching classes in our city. When I went there, I think it will Easy to score at mock test. But, it's not. It makes me feel so bad. That's why I leave the coaching institute because never before, I face so much failure. Then,its the day of neet 6th May, 2018. And after one month, the result was out. And I score so bad in this. Actually, I know My result because my preparations are not good for the test. So, I was okay with the result. But they aren't enough to get a govt.medical college. So, I decided to drop a year. Then, it's a very important decisions to decide a coaching institute for neet preparation. My father choose a coaching institutions in SHIMLA, capital of Himachal. And I'll go there. Now, it's the month of January. Now, Only 4months left. I wanted to get a medical seet in SHRI LAL BAHADUR SHASHTRI medical college, Nerchowk, mandi. Its my dream to get a seat there.

I am working as a process analyst under operations, not a specific field. I am the only earning person in my family. I do not hold any good degree, only Bcom graduated with minimal marks from open school. I do not have a specific interest in any field or any passion. Yes, I am concerned about my future and do not want to waste 12 hours of every day in a job. Also, I have a strong responsibility now and it scares me to switch anywhere. It restricts me to try or explore other things. My dreams for the rest of my life would be: I want my future to be as stable as water. Yes, I can from a struggling family but I do not wish to be rich. I have realized how the lower middle class and poor people waste their precious life in this race of struggle.I want my future to be free of time. I want to live fully with my family and teach them how to cherish this beautiful gift of life.The profession I want should be a less time consuming but enough to pay me around 2\u20133 lakhs monthly. I think it would be a middle scale in the next 10\u201312 years. The rest time I want to spend with my another half and later with my kids.I expect a love marriage with a relationship of at least more than 5 years. I really get inspired by seeing couples who stick long and get happily married till the eternal.I wish to get married until I find myself stable enough to add a new family member. Maybe around 30? What say?I want my partner to work, definitely not a 9\u20135 job. I want her to work anything weather it creates wealth or not. I do not want just a housewife. Again she should be free of her work whenever she wants to do.I expect at least 2 babies not matter its a girl or boy. But I also want both, it will give me a feeling of parenting two different genders. Who doesn't want that?I do not want my kids to be educated in a premium school even if I am capable of. I believe that parents wish so that their kids go not gets into bad company. I feel its very commons and there\u2019s a age where things become different. It happens with every kid weather its a rich kid or poor. Studying in a govt school has different surround and a good school has different. You will find bad things everywhere. I want my kids to be wise that only parents can teach them not any school. It depends on their upbringing.I want my finances to be good enough to travel often around the country. Also, I could save enough to explore other countries with my family sometimes.These are my little dreams",

I am currently a senior in high school who is going into the study of architecture. throughout high school I have had the amazing opportunity to see many, many different learning styles. From Project Based Learning to Traditional, and weird blends of the two. The main point I have arrived at on my opinion of teaching is that the current system is broken, and we don\u2019t know how to fix it. Fun Fact: Our education system was implemented in the 1920\u2019s and was modeled after the blue-collar jobs at the time. Our education system hasn\u2019t changed since 1920. Jobs have changed since 1920, and employers are looking for workers with critical thinking and problem solving, not workers who can be told \u201cTurn this wheel when the material is beneath the press.\u201d Traditional schools were not designed to make the person employers are now looking for. I realized this, and been designing an educational model that fully readies students to tackle their future and be adaptable to any situation, and be able to think critically on situations and problem solve based on their conclusion. My hope and dream is to design my own school and than teach my model in it. I am fearful of things blocking my path -money, age, potential laws, support-, but I know that my model would be best for the students, so I am going to do everything possible to achieve it anyways.

It is my life long goal and dream to be able to work at home earning a decent living doing what I love to do with the talent and gifts God has blessed me with. I am having a difficult time trying to get there though and sometimes I feel overwhelmed with so many other things that I will have to know and do that go along with it. That\u2019s what is holding me up, because I have been having to do a lot of research and studying online to learn the things I don\u2019t know. I want to make sure I try to get everything right or as close enough to it as I can so I will have a better chance at succeeding. It is taking me a lot longer than I would like and I end up getting frustrated and upset with myself that I have to walk away from it for a little while. It is also hard for me because I am a single mom trying to juggle everything else along with working a full time job. It sure doesn\u2019t leave me much time left over to devote to dream. I also have a lot of problems trying to stay focused when I have adult ADHD/ADD. It is a challenge for sure but it is one dream and goal that I have never given up on. I am 53 right now and I feel like it is never too late to try to achieve your dreams. I may get there and I may not and I may be 80 years old before I do, but I sure know one thing and that is I will keep trying up until the day I die. ",

Though life will continue and there is NO retirement from life until death, but now the definition of 'dream' is different for me.................Actually \"DREAM\" is a volatile term. Yes, volatile. It changes its colour with time and with advancement of age. ...............The term \"Dream\" is never understood by the youth of current times. Now, current generation is such that the parents make all the decisions on behalf of the kid and the kid remains to be kid till he completed the education as designed/ thought by the parent / guardian. You can see that parents decide the future of the kid, even, what to wear, what to eat, where to stay, who are to be friends, which institution to choose to get education, which course to choose and even the placement in organisation and place to get employed all are being chosen by the parents. There is little scope for the kid (son/daughter) to think about own passion and own life till he is already an adult. this has made many youths frustrated after joining their jobs so selected/chosen....................................................................................................If you are born before 70's then you can find that the parents of those era had decision regarding the institutions and courses, if they had some consciousness on education system and if they had the financial resources to provide their kids, else, the kids themselves think and choose their path, looking into the support system from their parents. Naturally, all parents of those period, had the \"dream\" to see their kids in abetter position than themselves. But they had no knowledge, where to get such guidance. In those period, the 'village school master' was the path finder. For everything, he was the 'friend, philosopher and guide'. At that time, the unemployment problem was not so acute as of today. After completion of school courses, kids were getting opportunity to choose from the employers. Though, I completed B.Ed in 1979, I received messages from four to five high schools through persons, to be a headmaster of their schools. I had not applied. But to create formal record, I had to write one simple application to join the school, where I worked for about 18 months. In those days, I have just found the parents on admission days and to take the school leaving certificates for their kids admission in another schools. Else, the kids had to do all other needful jobs for himself, from paying monthly fees, attend school functions, sports, even appear the examinations themselves. But parents were getting periodical information through parent teacher meetings, which was never regular. It was sufficient to flash a notice to the students in the class was sufficient to get parents informed. The parents know the school and also teachers know the thinking of the parents in those times. The punishment in the school was NEVER thought in a guilt sense and the students also so obedient that punishments were rarely applied. The parents felt that physical punishment in schools were to amend the behaviour of their children only. The schools were not for business purpose at all.As the time passed, the population grew, the new parents became conscious of the education system and unemployment problems, which has now taken the shape of business in schools. OK. it is the affairs now................Regarding the DREAM, the kids are given a topic in classes to write on \"Aim in Life\" and the teacher guides them to write on a specified jobs like, a doctor, an engineer, Teacher and like. The students are never given an opportunity to think and write. The Parents have already designed the \"Aim\". Hence the boy or girl thinks about his or her dream when, he/she is already in the last rung of the ladder to select the job.And after that, there is little scope to design the so called dream.For me, .................................I was interested to be in education stream, first to be a research associate and then to be a professor in universities to guide the students for development of the society. But the passion developed late, as I was from a financially weaker family and I was not groomed to think for myself. It means, I was born and brought up in a strict social, financial environment by my parents. I had no opportunity to decide anything independently. I was always in the group of better students in the education life. Even if my decision were correct, those were proved to be wrong and naturally wrong decisions are always wrong. Only after graduation, I find myself in a fix, where I could not decide, how to proceed in life. .........................The strictness made me a rebel and I had to fled away from home for about two years and parents could not trace me. Then decided to undergo B.Ed training at Regional college of education, Bhubaneswar. During that training period, got information of banking job through \"Banking Service recruitment Board\". Applied. got selected in the first attempt for clerical job. Joined bank in 1980 December. But before joining bank, i had served as Headmaster for a Secondary school. ..................Only after joining bank, I dreamt to be a model banker. But once in a job, it is never easy to fulfill your so called dream easily..................But, I could achieve the following in my 36 years service in bank :...1. I was a clerk, Special Assistant, Officer, Manager in bank. (Clerk performs cashier job periodically)...2. I worked in a rural, semi-urban, Urban branch....3. I worked in all the sections/departments of a bank branch, like Deposits, Advances, Foreign Exchange, Bills, Clearing, MIS, and all the sections)...4. I worked in a branch, Administrative units like Regional office, Circle office, Head office....5. I worked in manual environment (physical Ledgers and Registers), ALPM, Networked through Novel, then through Linux environments, and lastly in CBS systems....6. I worked in general banking and then in Technology Department to migrate branches to CBS....7. I worked independently at an Institute to train unemployed youth for entrepreneurship under CSR activities of the bank (directly under Head Office) for 4 years as Director. I was in charge of selecting the trainees, trainers, food caterers, course content, and after training following up with trainees for their settlements in entrepreneurship activities...8. During the service period got a chance to be inaugurating manager of a branch and served for six months before transfer to other state, and also the Director involved for inauguration of the Institute in other state and remained for 4 years there....9. I was taking classes of my colleagues for their promotions also - as a hobby, as a freelancers. .......My dream was to be a model banker and could achieve many more than expectation, as you can find it here. ...Many more experiences gained, which can never be expressed in written manner. ...Now after retirement, hoped to be a guide to new entrepreneurs, and I am in that process. I had not developed a dream, in the childhood days, for which I can not reply any BIGGEST DREAM, which I had never seen. ",

Where they can change their lives and have those same opportunities which I was privileged to have. As far as following my dream is concerned I am trying my level best.I am working with an organization which goes to a village near my college to teach in a low income school. I am teaching there and trying to sort the things. I also plan to join the two year fellowship of TEACH FOR INDIA so that I can gain every experience needed to help those kids. Now,   Can you see that guy in back hoody? Ya, that's me in Manali.  I love to travel.  I dream to travel as much as I can. May be the whole world. I just want to experience the adventure and the feeling of \"living in the moment\". I want to meet new people. I want to make my each and everyday count. Always living on the edge.And who knows, I can have a famous travel blog of my own through which I can share my travel stories. Basically I wish never to settle, at least not till I am content with my journey around the world. I could be in Tibet for an year teaching English to the children or may be in Africa teaching there for two or three years and may be then I can go to Europe and stay there for some years having a small job and spending my time peacefully. I know it's not easy but I am gonna do it anyway. I dream to make my life count. I dream to die as a content man who had no regrets. I want to die as a man who followed his dreams. As a man who faced many failures but he never gave up and kept doing what he loved to do. ",

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: I mean a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. This has been my dream ever since I first read the books of J.R.R. Tolkien. And watching the movies, for all their flaws, really supported this determination. I believe that if you have a focus in your life, it will become real if you work hard enough and believe in achieving it. Every time I smoke my churchwarden pipe, enjoying the various aromatic blends of my tobaccos, I find my mind wandering on how I would start such a project, given I had the money.  The upper part of the picture canonically depicts the layout of Bag End as shown in \u201cThe Atlas of Middle-Earth\u201d by Karen Wynn Fonstad. I would imagine my own hole being much smaller, considering even with a potential family I wouldn't have a need of 18 rooms. I can perfectly imagine myself in 20 years, sitting in a rocking or armchair, a nice fire in the chimney keeping me warm during a cool winter night, my German shepherd lying on my feet and a large carpet, providing me with extra warmth, while I take a soothing puff of my favourite cherry tobacco and occasionally sip on a glass of Irish scotch (the best!) after a long day of work. Only I've never had a long day of work ;) ",

It would be great, no Kardashians and no reality TV that kill you're brain cells and lower's you're IQ. I would love to have a nice little beach house that is cozy and inviting with my three dogs. I would not have a TV because I never watch TV anyway. I love music so I wil replace a TV to those audio base boom box thingy's (yep, forgot what it's called lol) with music of my choice and a radio too of course. Hell, i would live on Heard Island if i could. Which, mind you has never had any human settlements. The island is separated into two, the major one is where Big Ben (the name of the massive active volcano in the centre) is. Obviously, i would live on the island opposite to it and then it would be beautiful to see big Ben's Eruptions from afar! Heard Island.     BUT I would much prefer to live on a beautiful islolated tropical island surrounded with crystal clear waters, waterfalls, mountains and jungles with a warm climate. I've never had any interest of mansions penthouses or \"living the high/rich life\". No way jos\u00e8, all I want is a simple, cozy little beach house on a beautiful island somewhere with no one else. I love it because there's a sense of adventure that goes along with it. Unfortunately that still remains a dream. Currently, I'm living in the Albanian countryside with my dogs\u2026which is good enough at the moment. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not consider dreams as A source or set of submissions for consideration in daily life not do I think that anyone else would benefit from fojng that. Now if you are alluding to the source material in A less than literal sense Then I will admit to A type of emptiness that by definition of the \u201c usual\u201d life would be said to be the case here but is not, that state is probably suggested, even implied in my writing ,but is not in fact the case |\u2022 explaining how this is\u2026 is difficult. I do not even know where to start. The difference between life as we know it as spiritual beings is not A thing that can be defined in terms of what we were born as, (I hate saying that as it implies that some are not qualified or \u201cworthy\u201d ,that there is some exclusivity in Love, which is total bull ) But No. Normal is gone, and good riddance Dreams, they that run things dream for us as we live these in real life, the nightmare aborted (your dream in guilt / fear would be attributed to what was drawn upon (as each draws from his store)which in man is generally just that, worry, fear and the dreams that come are conditional and our lives surely built that into the subconscious that will not express A classic happy ending without a price as those that do not give freely do not believe that they receive freely. But me? My dream is that every one of us sold all that they own and gave the proceeds to those in need, Having done this these then expect no limit to what might come their way. These would expect what was never dreamt of prior to that relatively MINOR investment; A life of good things, waking dreams born without the life crushing limitations suffered by so many, The dream I wake from to find the world twisted, and then I go back to sleep. To be with my friends that are indeed free. I wake to the result of the end of culturally required bias, politically correct invalidation, cities that are graveyards that someone forgot to bury, an ever growing mob morality that says God lives in us all -for A price and he is only available if your brand is backed by A man with A stage and A title and A hypnotic monologue , my dream is for others to have real lives. I thought stages were for theater, now I see that dreams are born there, We don't need any more dreams, we need consciousness, political erectness, cultural tolerance, and Men of power that are chosen out of A love of wisdom I am going to bed now.

As far as what I want to do career-wise, I\u2019m not so sure. I\u2019ve considered lots of different things and still haven\u2019t quite decided. My direction isn\u2019t so set and that\u2019s okay. Yet, that\u2019s just about me. To discover your aspiration(s), you have to explore. The only way to find your aspiration is by trying new things. By doing this, you\u2019ll figure out what you want to aspire to. So start trying different things. Things you never tried before. Join clubs at school. Take different classes. Write a story or write in a journal. If you haven\u2019t done it before, try it. Even if it scares you. Find a particular industry interesting? Try getting an inside look by interning at a business in that industry. By exploring, you\u2019ll find something that really excites you. And then, you may just have your aspiration(s). I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll discover your aspiration. Be sure not to worry about discovering it so quickly, there\u2019s plenty of time. Just remain open-minded, keep trying new things and eventually you\u2019ll discover it. And be sure to have fun in the process. ",

            "answer_text": "When i was little i always dreamt of becoming a football player.But reality struck me;there came the 10th board exams.So typical mentality,my parents didnt allow me to play football for 3 years because they wanted to me to become a doctor. We had intense arguments,i cried.I dont cry that often but leaving football forever was hard to stomach it;because I knew what they meant when they said \u201c abhi padhlo\u2026mbbs mein admission mil jaye tab khel lena\u201d To be honest,i dont blame my parents for that because they forced me to do it coz it was good for me;and on my dream profession list,becoming a surgeon is second.I was also interested and good in this field,so no worries there.. But this made me realise that there are so many people who dreams of becoming a footballer but are not supported by their parents just because there is no \u201cscope\u201d in india. SO MY BIGGEST DREAM IS TO MAKE FOOTBALL AS POPULAR AS CRICKET IN INDIA. I dont know how i am going to do it..all i know is; everything starts from inspiration for eg~ kapil dev,sunil gavaskar,sachin tendulkar have inspired generations of people to take up cricket by achieving something someone only could dream of. They made us believe that a human being is capable of doing great things with hard work.. So in order to make football famous,first of all i need to make people interested in football and indian football team need to win something big or someone who was born and raised in india must make his name on the global level.Only that can make it possible. I am the captain of college football team..when i came in this college there were just two good players..we worked hard to make a team..the team consisted of players who had neved seen football in life.Somehow we manage to win our first trophy which was college\u2019s first ever trophy in any sports. This brought more people in.The more the people who get in the team the more their friends come the watch the match Now im in last year of mbbs\u2026there are over 6 good college football team..we held our intercollege football every year which wasnt done before..there are nearly over 70 new football fans who follow their favourite club in every match.we even keep screening for champions league matches.and a lot of peope show up..so yeah!thats how inspiration\u2026now this 70 fans will grow up to be parents someday and might support their kids..every big thing starts small. Other thing i wish to do is build up football academies in the country..with foreign coaches. For all of these i need a lot of money..so im working hard to becoming a successful doctor\u2026 The popularity of isl and the under 17 fifa world cup has helped a lot;but we need more of these.. ",

To be know, heard, heard of, famous, infamous, and people to remember me for something I'd either Done or Could Do to attain it. Now it's changed slightly in that although to be well known could also mean lots of money & especially when money is needed most in my life. However, it wasn't till my loss of my marraige that knew I wanted even more yet less than nothing all the same. & so I'm doing just that in which could bring me money & fame yet I don't want a dime for it nor recognition as to it's title. All which I'm giving to her & my daughter. 2 accounts for all proceeds & royalties, all notoriety to my ex wife as it wil be dedicated unto & then to insure it's strength & lasting memory of me & she os to me I'm going to blow my fucking brains out after. No regret or fears. Ready to go home & wait for her w/ out pain. Hopefully God can forgive me also as I ask her too also. I only wanted her heart \u2026Nothing more yet she'd thought or had told everyone that I'd chosen a substance & lifestyle over her & our union. I have swallowed all my pride, bowed to one knee before Almighty God, broken down the walls that have kept me & the chains that bound my soul from hers & to think that it was me at all would done all this impossible & unforgivable wrong that she would mo longer stay;.. Much less ve honest herself about ANY of It all along.. ",

Well , I lived a stereotype life and passed matriculation and went through college.But a few things I've always longed for which I'll disclose today which is my dream life. I wish I could ever live a life full of festivities and cherish happiness. Like struggling for something great. As Olympic are held, there are a lot lof colors and dynamic life. People laughing singing and dancing. We guys have been put in vicious circle of emberresment and shame by our society and somewhat religious obligations and parents too. I wish I could learn performing arts. Play at ground in school. All my childhood I struggled with obesity till today. There was no trend of exercise at our home. We were told that reading books was only thing we could do. And sophistication was instilled in us(so called) that lead to immense shyness. I wish I could dance at my brother's weddings like a pro. I wish I could win some medal in some sports and live a free life. I'm grateful for everything I have but that would be so amazing. I want to say to everyone that, live a life of dreams. In that way you would be so happy. ",

But as nature made it, nothing is ever permanent. hence life gives us difficult times so that we don\u2019t go aimless living pointless lives and hence persevere to constantly try making ourselves and the ones around us happy again. i believe you should read the legend of ashoka the ruler who gaveup his entire kingdom when he realised the true nature of the human mind and life. Once Ashoka the emperor was on a walk along the beach.There he saw a sage who was sleeping at the shore. He was puzzled and ordered his men to get the sage to him. As instructed , ashoka\u2019s men woke the sage up and got him to Ashoka. He was not pleased by seeing the sage wailing away his time sleeping, so he asked him weather he had no ther work to do. To this, the sage smiled and said, my emperor, what is that you want in life. Ashoka said that he wanted to conquer and rule the world the sage asked, and then? ashoka said that he would be very powerful and could do anything and everything.the sage smiled and repeated his qs, and then,?Ashoka then said that and ill have all the money in the world.H would then lead a peaceful life and sleep without worries and stay happy. The sage smiled again and asked the Emperor, \u201cwhat else do you think am i doing here\u2026\u201d The point is that we don\u2019t always need to do something great to be happy.We often overlook the happiness that could be acquired in doing petty things .

I want to make them feel really proud of their daughter. And more than being proud,they will actually feel relieved to see me stand on my feet.

We need to organize things where one deranged individual does not wield absolute power. Free quality health care for all, including mental health care and also for mental problems not to be stigmatizing. Free food and drink: you can walk into a shop and take what you need\u2026you will not be permitted to take more than what you need. Not just food and drink but books and other items too. Some form of free accommodation for everyone. It doesn\u2019t have to be a house or apartment but can also include things like typees, tents etc. Free education for all. For extremists to be more moderate. For the Earth to be restored to a pristine state and for humans to live in hamony with nature. For everyone to advance spiritually to a higher level. ",

It helps me calm down when I'm angry or it's just my escape when things aren't going so well in life. I dream to be this famous painter, that's known all around the globe. Someone will say my name and people will have endless conversations about my art. People will look up to me also seeing a bit of their self in me. My paintings would be selling as constant as a shadow in the sun. My artworks would be photo realistic as well as hanging on every wall in my studio. My biggest dream is to change the world in some way with my art, making someone smile or remember something positive. Unfortunately, it's only a dream.

Dream Life: I would probably opt for being like the character I play in my stories, a shapeshifter who is a monsterologist and who is also friends with a group of monsters. Of course I would have the transforming into other people thing down. ",

            "answer_text": "I had two aspirations when I was young. I either wanted to be a teacher or a veterinarian. I started volunteering at a veterinarian hospital to see what it was like. A few months into it, they asked me to help while the vet neutered a cat. I was just supposed to hold the leg up and out of the way during the short procedure. I fainted dead away. One minute I was standing there holding the leg and the next thing I knew, I was on the floor and the vet was yelling at me to let go of the cat. I was still holding onto the leg. It was the only time I ever fainted in my life. After that, I figured that being a vet, or anything in the medical field for animals or humans, was probably not for me. I then started volunteering and eventually working in day cares and schools. I found that I was good at that and I have now been a teacher for over 15 years. The best way to find your aspiration is to get out there and try things. Volunteer at different things. Get some different jobs. When you are doing them, you will learn what you like and what you don\u2019t. ",

In this time, I\u2019ve been creating a universe. I\u2019ve got dozens of books planned out, I just need to start writing them, which is the hardest part. This is my dream, and it will not be easy.

Sure, there are things I don\u2019t like about the world that I would like to see changed, but I have exactly zero interest in being the one to change them. I am happy just to watch. In fact, I don\u2019t like doing at all. I\u2019ve been doing all my life and none of it has ever brought me the slightest bit of happiness or satisfaction. I\u2019m tired of doing.

And lastly, financial stability, some of you say \u201cbut money can\u2019t buy happiness\u201d Well, i agree and disagree. Money is like the cherry on top, being financially stable means one less burden, also it makes your life easier.

You mind is under no pressure hence you explore inside yourself ( real place to find your true ambition) listen to your heart, become unbiased and talk to yourself and decide to do what appeals to your heart the most, something that makes you genuinely happy from within and not superficially and not the society...Then comes a time when parents start talking to you, telling you ( imposing) their experiences and narrating stories that only they have heard or seen.. Then you meet you relatives who give you more download about this \"cruel\" & \" competitive\" world and what ambition you should have to survive in it...Then you make friends, who tell you what ambitions they have based on the influence their parents & relatives have on them... Then you grow up a little more and attend school... Where the teachers have more success stories, they teach you about all the successful icons and leader... They forget to mention the real reason behind the success of those icons is cause they followed their heart and did what appealed to them... And then we write big essays about them in exams and score big marks get a big job and follow instructions that others give us, then marry the person others tell us, put our children in schools that others tell us... Where the hell is Ambition other than in the dictionary and on papers.... It should be yours hence from your heart what you truly love and that appeals to your unbiased and uninfluenced mind... ",

My ambition when I was around 15 was to become a doctor, later it fluctuated to UPSC and now Law. More or less, any ambition that we set off needs acute amount of passion, determination and dedication to perform, we're needed to remain disciplined and dexterous throughout our journey. Sometimes, ambition becomes a thorough process where constant work and passion is required,a belief that we can do with our potential, a standard of not compromising our worth for anything or everything around us. The taste of being ambitious is the card of life. We may change our ambition with learning, experience and taste but at the end of the day all we want is a deep sense of satisfaction at our day's work, how much we actually utilise the 24 hours we had in our hand. Though my ambition kept on changing but my only goal in life is to realise a state of blissfulness where nothing except the self matters, where love becomes the only thread of communication to my heart, where I say I'm satisfied and satiated with myself, along myself, where nothing materialistic affect me, where I realize what actually truth means, all I want is to spiritualize myself to my self with the most vibrant and inert delights I've.

I want to put my hard work and imagination, to order those materials, add the necessary details, and reveal it to the world in a 'cooked' format, ready to be consumed by people. I want to achieve such dreams in my life. Please Upvote and Share if you like my answer. Thanks. ",

And I know I might not succeed. But I don't believe I won't. And if I die tomorrow, I've still had this goal, this aspiration.  It's important to have one. An aspiration to reach a goal.

My only motive is getting financial freedom in my life. It means getting a retirement early to enjoy my life to the full extent. Just imagine why our childhood was great because we didn't have to do any work to run our living. And see what if we acchive that stage where we didn't have to work any more but money keep on coming. It can only be happen with the help of assets and how beautiful it would be if we done it before 30 year of age.  This is my dream.

I am pretty sure I want a serious relationship and I am currently dating and visiting meetups of like minded people. I am also pretty sure I want to make a game that expresses something fun. I'm going to work part time and spend the time on screwing around with some prototypes I already have, however I am not sure if they are what I really want. I am also going to change some thinking habits such as becoming less defensive and more hopeful and I also think I might want to know more about Buddhism and just orientate myself by meeting a bunch. I'm definitely going to go on more adventures and I already planned some stuff like diving. ",

My mom has worked too hard all her life for all of us. We have till now lived in rented house and she and my dad would sleep on mat on the floor and would make sleep on cot. She has for a long time wanted to own a house of her own, to sit in a four wheeler and even to visit religious destinations in India. But she sacrificed her dream for ours so now I have made my dream to make her dreams come true and put a smile on her face which wouldn't go off ever again, regardless of the hardships. Because what good am I a son if I can't even do this little things for the women who loved me no matter what, prayed for me no matter what, cared for me no matter what and stood beside me no matter what. So this is my biggest dream. ",

And I would love to pursue my idea about getting essential life studies into high schools, subjects like How Men and Women Communicate, The Stages of Love, How to Raise Children, Emotions and Sex, Kindness, Compassion and Disability Awareness, Touching Another\u2019s Soul, and individual lectures. Again, thanks for asking!! ",

I'm never able to recall them once I woke up. I'm not that good in Mathematics or Science. But my dream say that I cured Cancer, converted useless substance into food by changing atom's configuration using Nano-Techno Robots. Weird, I even haven't used an actual robot in my weird life. And I also came to know in dream that after changing atom's configuration, it become highly radioactive. But this can also be solved by process in my dream that I don't remember. I'm having this kind of dream from my 8th Grade and these are frequent! About once a week! Now I'm in 12th Grade and I took Science stream even when I got lowest in Mathematics and Science in my 10th grade. I never shared this with anyone but now it's public :) Hope for the best. P.S. Nothing is Fiction above... ",

Dreams about property Someone who mostly dream about money, gold or big houses. Now I have a dream. I want to travel in time . That is a dream because I can\u2019t do anything, but dream.

Then place a rose on the side of the window and water it every morning. I have to cook and eat my favorite food myself in my kitchen. Every month should spend half of my salary money on the needy and orphan home. Spend time with them at least once a week. I should try my best to resolve their nostalgia.

I have an operation due November 30 and I have lots of work to do to make it happen. My dream is to walk normally and to run. My second important is to build the muscles in both legs prior to the operation. I walk and twice a week I walk in water. Covid closed my gym, but it is reopening this week and I can get a couple of gym workouts a week. My less important targets are: First to finish writing a booklet I started. It is not a high enough priority to allow me the time I would like, my target completion date is six months out. My second less important is to end my chess career. I currently coach players and play on a team, on a club in consultation games, and on a rating ladder. I am currently playing my final club game on line, and my two final team games on line. I have cut my ladder games in half. I still answer 3 Quora questions each day. Al ",

Luckly i gt admission in one of the prestigious insitutes that is Banasthali university , while i was going through the university website i get to know that university offeres a student pilot license for few students who crack an exam and an interview round and that too free of cost. It brought back all the memories back of my childhood toy and my dream to become one. I was admissioned to do Btech there , however my entire concentration was to crack that exam and get my dream fullfiled. In my first year of bteach, i appeared for scholarship exam and gt cleared in first attempt by second year i gt proffesional training and by third year i got my license and finally had 5hrs of flying as student pilot in one of Sesna which my university owns.

So Yeah, I was soo madly in love with the place, I played the whole damn day acted like crazy had the time of my life. But I was so happy to be there that in the evening I made hell lot of drama to come out of there, where in my dad had to literally drag me out. That night I decided, I want to sneak into that place and spend entire night there with my friends and have all the rides just for us. Yeah I know it's crazy, and trust me it's still on the top of my to-do list. Moreover what's the fun in dreaming if you're dreams aren't crazy. ",

And then heading to Chechnya and pretending like I am a hawk and dancing, albeit weirdly, in lezginka. But I'll look like a boss with the traditional Chechen dress and the papakha hat, and have an equally strange floatingly dancing woman with me, albeit dressed spectacularly. After that lose myself in the spiritual trance in dhikr somewhere in Chechnya too. And then head to a fact finding mission whether there is something really true about Cricassian (or Cherkessian) women being the most beautiful women in the world. A genuinely fact finding mission, that's all. Basically be a nomad with an endless supply of petrol. ",

During the day I\u2019d take long walks along the water on the grassy hills and look out as far as my eyes can see. I\u2019d sit and listen to crashing waves. In the afternoons, wrapped in a soft blanket, I\u2019d write and sip tea. I have a friend who has been to Newfoundland. My fantasy perplexes him. He knows I like warm weather and assures me Newfoundland is too windy and cold for warm-weather creatures like me. He points out that living in a lighthouse would always be drafty and adds that I don\u2019t really drink tea. I have so very many fantasies that can never be. Tell me. Are fantasies supposed to be practical? Are they supposed to be plausible? Do I need to expend effort to make them come true? Would that not limit something meant to be unhinged, delusional, extravagant, unrestrained? ",

Almost all my dreams as a child and a young man have been realized: I have the most fantasticest wife, a beautiful daughter, terrific grandchildren, I got through the Viet Nam War without being killed, or injured, or having to kill or injure anyone else. I became an architect (my dream from childhood), and had a successful career, including being the president of an architectural firm. I designed lots of interesting and useful and beautiful buildings. My wife and I managed to get our daughter through college, and to retire. Now, my biggest dream is not to humiliate myself or my family and friends too much. ",

I've always stood out and it places me in a negative light sometimes but also with the right opportunities It can be a very positive thing. I've also never been a confident person as I grew up very introverted and antisocial -like which seems to grow a little worse with age ( not all introverts lack confidence). That isn't to say I don't socialize mind you, my emotional needs as a child weren't adequately met so I've survived with a wounded ego and struggled to build myself up which is why I want to turn that around and live a life I can be proud of and free to express myself in the best ways possible. Hopefully I\u2019ll make that dream come true. ",

No I'm not interested in having any dream in my life, coz I woke up from the dream world waiting for my time in for a new world. Dreams will come and go it doesn't matter.

If we target dream of life in being aware which can happen in smaller steps may have the ability to expand our vison beyond our own limit of description as on the day. If someone is thinking for money / fame like things directly or indirectly the wider expanded dream would give much more than that, may be change the perspective of people tomorrow.

I hung on to the black and white photos, not sure what I would do with them. Only knew that I just had to have them. I came across an old wooden sash 6 pane window with white paint chipping off. Painted and repainted over the years so many times. I chose 6 photos t0 draw and paint in water soluble graphite. I have three of the six sketched out. My goal is to use the individual panned openings , instead of conventional frames. to uniquely frame out the completed paintings. ",

If you are defining dreams and fantasies similarly, as things I would like to accomplish or experience in my life then traveling to another planet, falling in love, having many children, and having my own massive nature preserve (perhaps on a private island). If you want to know about a fantasy or a dream (treated as separate things) then I suppose I could do one of both because I am host to a plethora of them. One dream of mine, as in a personal goal, is to not die disappointed with my existence. I want to be satisfied with life before I die. One dream, as in a literal dream I had while I was asleep, is very hard to choose as I have had so many peculiar, disburbing, and beautiful ones, but perhaps a randomly chosen one will do. In one dream, I foresaw the death of my friend approximately two weeks before he actually died while driving drunk. A fantasy of mine is being a private detective who is investigating the most tittilating case of all time. ",

The one dream that I have closely guarded and have been pursuing for a long long time is that of \u201cbeing independent.\u201d Trust me, there is no greater joy than the joy of being independent. The freedom to make choices, to reject, to feel, to dream, to experience and to live. Independence to do all of that matters a lot. If I dream to be independent, I dream it with a vision to live a life of satisfaction, to be accountable only to myself and do good for both the society and me. To set oneself free from the chains of expectations, delusions and attachments would be the ultimate expression of Independence where one's passion could take flight and drift into oblivion.
