            "answer_text": "I. Hii I am Sakshi, Sakshi Rajput, 20 years old. I like my last name for no particular reason, and this applies to every other thing.I hate lizards. Currently, I am obsessed with sunflowers, sky, words of The fault in our stars, Clara Mae and everything fierce & fragile. I like silence more than I dislike noise . I am Just Another Human. Just Another Girl. A Girl, I am supposed to act nice. I like Tees, and I like flats. II. When I lose faith, when I can't believe, When I seek validation . I repeat my name, S A K S H I which means Witness.I am my witness, I know what I do and why I do. I know when I am right I know when I am wrong. Opinions of anyone? Not necessary. III. I sleep while watching TV series but when I wish to read, I read until my eyes starve for sleep. I am not different, You are different. IV. I love eating and I love people, and I overdo both and then I get constipation in my 'brain'. Things are stuffed.They want to come out but can't, what comes out is watery saline. I won't write tears here because that will make me look weak.I still can never get enough of both. V. I like who I am and who I am becoming. No, I am not a Narcissist, but I wish to be. I think a number of times before taking any action -it's pros'- cons everything.Yes, I am doubtful. VI. I was born in March ,at the start of the end of winters.Not too cold, not too warm. May be that's why my reaction to almost everything is neutral.The doors of my heart are Narrow \"What once goes in stays in\" it doesn't come out neither I need to. VII. Even when I move forward I look back not to regret, not with melancholy, not for revenge but to see how long I have came. I don't L e a v e things behind. I can't even leave the chocolate wrappers, I treasure them. VIII. I fear 'Judgement' the most. I fear getting judged. So When I post something, when I write something or when I do any other thing, it takes a lot from me to do so. But these days I am developing a habit of doing everything and getting over the http://Fears.So I'll do it anyway. (Continued in comment section) IX. I love Sweets, and I hate lies .So when I receive sweet lies. I gulp them. Sweetness has always been my weakness. X. I love staying soft and sensitive because I can't be anything else, and I can't be because I don't WANT to be. Instead, I am C l u m s y XI. Egocentric -I no more judge people who act egocentric rather I admire them. People always drain my energy, so I like. I-zone more than I like You-zone. I wrote so much just for the sake of writing some facts about myself. I made it fancy. I hyped myself. This list can go on and it should go on. But... I love being N O T H I N G. -sakshi ",

            "answer_text": "I am Author Dia Stone, I have been writing for the past 4 years! I have written 8 books thus far and planning to write many more! I was born August 3rd.. A Leo. A Lion! I love people, I am very kind to everyone that I encounter, until they prove me wrong. .. I have always believed in live and let others live. I love to talk, I will meet a stranger in a store and if they talk to me, I will talk to them. My daughter refers to me as being quirky! I am quite sensitive. I wear my feelings on my sleeve. I have always disliked that about me, but, it is a part of who I am. I have been married twice, they just were not the type of companions I needed in my life. So since they were not compatible with me, I had to end the marriages. I have 2 children, young adults, a son and a daughter, they drive me crazy at times, I love them with all that is in me. I see things in people, some people make me want to weep because I feel some kind of emotion from them, deep in my soul, I could never understand this, I thought at one point that I was psychic! I am almost always able to look at a person and discern what type of person they are, by their vibes they are giving off, good or bad vibes. I do not like mean people because I am not mean. I love to wear pretty clothing, I am quite stylish! Dancing, I just love, to dance! I love going to the movies alone, I do not like any distractions while I am there, the same goes with writing, no distractions. My wish is for World Peace, I am an Empath, an ENFP which describes me perfect. My favorite flowers are Tullips! I do not really like Diamonds, I love Stones,( a 5kt Sapphire Ring, is what I wish for)) I guess I have almost the perfect name. I am a helpful and nice person, I work by day as a Counselor for the mentally challenged, I am so happy always to be of assistance to them. When I arrive home, I normally watch a lot of Life Time Movies. My motto: People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but, people will never forget the way that you made them feel.. I AM AUTHOR DIA STONE PEACE/OUT ",
