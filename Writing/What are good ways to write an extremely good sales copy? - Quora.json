            "answer_text": "If you are new to copy writing this is definitely for you . I will be sharing about a very specific elements that you need to know and master in , so that whatever you write people will read and buy your products or services. The 7 letters copy writing that make Anyone Read and Buy -RESULTS Copy Writing  Below is the transcript of the video for a better learning experience watch above video Check out my youtube channel Weng Honn Lets dive in . So , Do people want to buy a phone or is actually for photos and also for life convenience?Do people really want to buy a bed or the good night's sleep.Do people want to buy a affiliate marketing course or they want to earn money?The truth is that people don't care about products and services nor do they care about the features or any technical specifications of those products and services. They only care about what it can do for them and the results that they'll get from using it. So you need to sell the results not the product, we need to state what is the problem that we are solving. If you wrote only about features it would be like telling someone to buy this phone , because it has good camera,and a good camera is obviously a feature . I know that features are important but they're not the hook, it is not the action taking button that your client will press. Lets us do an exercise. Some here is a waterproof business bag and also a waterproof smart phone. Think of 1 benefit for each of this items.You can pause the video and write it down.I will just continue with it . So , for the back packs the benefit will be it able to keep everything in it dry ,even when it is raining. For the smart phone , it will not spoil if you accidentally drop the phone inside a pool. So , you got the benefits of the products , the next thing that you need to do is to ask the so what questions. Lets get started. So , for the business the benefit will be it able to keep everything in it dry ,even when it is raining. So what? So that if you have some really important document in it will not get wet and destroyed by the water. So what? If the document is a 100m singed contract , you will not loss it! Next lets look at the waterproof phone For the smart phone , it will not spoil if you accidentally drop the phone inside a pool. So what? It could save you another 2k to buy a new phone , where you can use the money on somewhere else. So what? So that all the important contacts ,documents , data and information that store inside your phone will not get dissappear. It is really troublesome , when transferring from an old phone to a new phone . So , by asking the so what questions you get to have the result answer. Lets look at more real life example for copy writing. \u201cWe help parents take better pics.\u201d Notice they don\u2019t talk about lenses, lighting, angles, or composition, the pixel how great is the lenses .They\u2019ve simply identified a specific audience\u2014parents\u2014and stated that they solve a problem they know that audience has. Everyone can fly by air asia. 10 years back , taking a plane is a luxury things that only rich people can afford .

Dyson Ltd is a British technology company established in the United Kingdom by Sir James Dyson in 1991. It designs and manufactures household appliances such as vacuum cleaners, air purifiers, hand dryers, bladeless fans, heaters, hair dryers, and lights .James Dyson hated the dust-filled bags and loss of suction of conventional vacuum cleaners.

And ideally you want these deeper benefits to connect to the dreams and goals of your target reader .You need to put yourself in your clients\u201ds shoes. For example , if you are selling weight loss products , what are the result you want? You want people to instantly go oh yeah that's really what is in my mind , that is the result that I want . That's really why I want to buy this product rather .so , always remember to start with benefits and end by writing down your copy with the result .

            "answer_text": "Let me help you with an example: An extremely good sales copy is not a result of first effort itself. My seniors used to make me write three to four times to have an extremely good copy. As copywriters we have a brain that works like wordsmith crafting sentences, tag lines in an appealing manner. But it has to match the needs of the sales company only then it can be termed as extremely good copy. Here are my few suggestions: Offer to rewrite three to four drafts till your client is satisfied: One of my clients wanted to host a pre marriage preparation seminar and wanted me to draft a letter to convince the sponsors and authorities. I drafted three different letters to give him options to chose from. I was sure none of them may be extremely good, because had one of them been extremely good there would have not been any need for the second and third one, but it was my service that pleased my client. he merged most appealing statements from all the three samples and got a perfect letter as he wanted. Be available even at midnight if your client requires a change at the last moment: A client of mine once Whatsapped me at midnight requesting me to give a couple of more titles for the sales letter. He said that he liked the sales letter but needs little brighter headlines. I did it happily for him and went to sleep. Next morning I woke up to find a thank you message of, \u201cAn excellent sales copy\u201d from him. I understood that the excellence was due to my help at midnight hour. So such gestures can make a good copy appear excellent. This is how you upgrade your own skills and relationships with your clients>. Hope this passifies you. ",
