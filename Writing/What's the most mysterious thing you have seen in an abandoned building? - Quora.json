            "answer_text": "I was asked to do some renovation work on a home that was in a state of collapse, literally portions of it leaning. Because the front yard was full of refuse, debris, old items that were of the occupants I suggested to the owner that first the yard be cleaned up so that the home would have reasonable access. It was arranged by a neighbor with the city that a 12 yard dump truck be backed up to the 12 foot retaining wall for easy loading and after carefully packing what was removed from the yard and the destroyed contents of the home as in furniture etc. due to a roof leak it was quite full. It was visitation day and relatives of the owner were on the property and as still many things were inside, all declared to be rubbish, I had pulled out a few odd items that looked ornate and old because I am a collector of medal as of such. One of the items I pulled out and had set on the concrete sidewalk in front along with others was a small rusty pizza cutting wheel without the handle. According to the \u201cgeometry\u201d that I remember, the visiting relatives did not pick up the pizza wheel from the sidewalk but picked it up from inside the house after I had removed it and seemed to be making small talk about it. I count this as some kind of spiritual phenomena and seeing the relatives holding the pizza wheel I asked \u201cOh, I wanted that, do you mind if I have it?\u201d It sat in my yard with other scrap metal and I probably still have it somewhere.

            "answer_text": "An artificial wooden leg wrapped in brown shipping paper. When I was a kid living in the tiny rural town of Clio, Alabama, there was an abandoned mansion on the edge of town. It had once been owned in the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s by a wealthy family with one son, who had a real talent for playing basketball. He took his high school team to the regionals then to the state playoffs. The story goes that the young man\u2019s father got extremely drunk while the state playoffs were being played. He insisted on driving his son back home from the game. Along the way, the father drove the car into a tree, ejecting the young man through the window. The young man lost his leg in the accident, along with any dreams of being a professional basketball player. The son lived with his hatred towards his father for several years, until one night he couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. His festering anger got the better of him, and in his own drunken haze, he murdered his father. The son went to prison for life. My cousin Johnny and I, ages 8 and 11 (he was older then me) decided that we would sneak into the abandoned mansion, which had all sorts of ghost stories around it by the 70\u2019s. It was in bad repair, with junk scattered everywhere. It was dark, dank and dusty. It was an antebellum home, with the high ceilings, tall windows, and vast rooms typical of that period. We went through the house during the late afternoon, when the light was dying. We walked through all of the downstairs rooms and then ventured upstairs. It was creepy. We entered one room, and amidst the junk in the middle of the room, found a wooden leg that had been wrapped in brown shipping paper. A leg for the son who had killed his father, and had died in prison. It was downright frightening to us. We ran out of the house like the hounds of hell were after us. It still gives me the chills to this day. ",
