            "answer_text": "If you can write 20 pages a day.. do the math. But will it be 20 good pages? Or 20 pages of crap, filled with grammar and spelling errors? Do you know how to edit your own work? How long it takes you to research something depends on you; your intellect, your ability to find the subject, and your desire to do this project. In order to write something that people want to read you will need to understand how to put a book together. There is a definite pattern and rhythm to it. And there are certain expectations from the editors and publishing houses as to how your work is laid out. Do you have a grasp of the publishing industry? Do they even want a 300\u2013500 page non fiction book in your field? Will it sell? Is there a need for it in the marketplace? Are you going to pitch your book to them? Do you know how to do that? You have a lot of research to do before you even begin to write your first word. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s not a book. It\u2019s an essay. Perhaps you meant 300\u2013500 pages? It depends entirely on how much research you intend to do, how quickly you write, and how persistent you are. If you are doing this professionally, you should probably be spending a minimum of eight hours a day researching, taking notes, drafting and outline and writing pages every single day, just as if it were a real job. Even if it\u2019s just a hobby, you should write every single day, and have a plan for how and when you will conduct research. ",
