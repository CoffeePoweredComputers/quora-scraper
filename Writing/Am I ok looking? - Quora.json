            "answer_text": "You're very pretty. I would suggest, though, that you NEVER post pics of yourself to an audience of strangers. This is an excellent way to gain stalkers or put yourself in danger. I won't even get into the self-esteem issues that would cause you to do such a thing, because I remember being a teenager, but please don't do this kind of thing again. You are opening yourself up to heartache (what if everyone here said you were horribly ugly? You're not, but you would have believed it) and it's NOT SAFE. I don't mean to lecture, but you need to hear it. Use your brain, sweet girl!! ",
