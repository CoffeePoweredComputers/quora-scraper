            "answer_text": "The verbal and writing sections are in a way interlinked, as one can help to improve the other. However, when trying to improve your scores there are some key things to keep in mind. Firstly, I would suggest looking very closely at the mistakes. I cannot stress this enough - It is important to understand exactly where you are going wrong and then use that to create a direction and game plan for improvement. Once this has been identified, there are a lot of resources out there that can help you systematically approach the problem and improve on them. Perhaps, you are only good at slow reading and need improvement in your speed, or maybe you need to build your vocabulary more. Your unique problems needs to be identified - FYI, I\u2019ve listed below some resources that helped me tackle some specific problems. Although there is NO substitute to continuous reading and building a strong foundation, there are some tips and tricks that past test takers can help you get some insight into the test. Take for example Reading Comprehension or Vocabulary Building Apps. There are some great resources on general tips as well such as : GRE General Tips ",

The main takeaways from the post are: If you have a significant amount of time on your hand, you should definitely get yourself a \u2018Word Power Made Easy\u2019 and start with it as soon as you can.
