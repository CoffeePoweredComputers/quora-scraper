[math]f(x)[/math] is a linear transformation. The transformation of a sum [math]f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)[/math]The transformation pulls out a constant [math]f(ax) = af(x)[/math]Examples In Calculus, the derivative is a linear operator. [math]\\frac{d}{dx}(x+y) = \\frac{dx}{dx} + \\frac{dy}{dx} = 1 + \\frac{dy}{dx}[/math] Cartesian lines are of course linear. [math]ax + by = c[/math] is a two-dimensional line [math]ax + by + cz = d[/math] is a three-dimensional line Non-Linear Example Polynomials other than lines are non-linear. A quadratic polynomial [math](y+z)^2[/math] creates a new term [math]2yz[/math]. [math]p(x) = x^2[/math] [math]p(y+z) = (y+z)^2 = y^2 + 2yz + z^2 \\ne (y^2 + z^2)[/math] ",

            "answer_text": "Linearity is a combination of two properties. A map [math]f[/math] is linear if [math]f(\\alpha x) = \\alpha f(x)[/math]Scaling the input is the same thing as scaling the output.[math]f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)[/math]We can add and then take the mapping, or we can add after we map each of the parts. This is known as a homomorphism.When we put these rules together we get [math]f(\\alpha x + \\beta y) = \\alpha f(x) + \\beta f(y)[/math] Or more generally [math]f(\\sum_j \\alpha_j x_j) = \\sum_j \\alpha_j f(x_j)[/math] A map is linear if it takes linear combinations of [math]x_j [/math]to linear combinations of [math]f(x_j)[/math] with the same coefficients. To prove that a map is linear you just have to show one of these equivalent conditions. ",
