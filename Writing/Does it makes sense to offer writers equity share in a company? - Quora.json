            "answer_text": "Offering equity is a way of paying people without money, by stealing from shareholders. It makes sense, I just don't think it is ethical. I should say, it is less ethical in my mind when you give it to people internal to the organization, but even with outsiders, it's a weird system of rewards, it's like printing your own money, it's kind of hard to evaluate the reward, and it creates unclear incentives. I don't know, I have a knee-jerk reaction against it from past experience. ",

Rev share - Find a way to make SOME profit of the website, and give contributors a worthy cut.2. Experience/Exposure - Find a way to empower the contributors that allows them to benefit professionally from quality content they write. Drop the equity angle - It's not sensible cost effective wise, neither to them nor you. ",
