These services know that the moment you put your name on their essay you have just committed plagiarism. Plagiarism can get you expelled. The consequences are so dire and these services know full well what the consequences are. But here is the best reason to never purchase anything from them. They figure if you are so foolish to buy an essay from them you are not worthy of their concern when you get caught. ",

Unlike the best services online, scam services do not advertise themselves as scam artists. In order to draw in bigger prey, these services advertise themselves as the best services online. The only time one realizes that they have been scammed is after they have paid for the essay only to end not receiving any essay. I\u2019m use only trusted and legit services from my list below: ",
