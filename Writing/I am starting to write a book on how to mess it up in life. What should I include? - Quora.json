            "answer_text": "Easy Answer- Take everything you have experienced in life, make it in some way horribly wrong, then spend the next 300 or so pages describing it. Simple really. For instance, take a 4-year-old, put them on a riding lawnmower stuck in 3rd gear. Recipe for disaster or life lesson? That depends upon the outcome and your storytelling abilities. Some would lean towards the macabre, telling of how the child struggles with the machine and ultimately loses it only to fall beneath its blades in a horribly disfiguring death scene. Others may tell of how the child seemed to instinctively know how to operate the machine, figures out the steering and pedals, and how to disengage the blades to come to a rolling stop when it finally runs out of gas, some miles away, as the key was broken off in the ON position. yet others will tell of the Super-heroic efforts of one who rescues the child in a herculean effort that allows them both to survive.As you can see, 3 separate possibilities from ONE scenario. WHAT do you write is not as important as WHAT you choose to write about it. Your perspective is what you are trying to convey. How To Mess It Up in Life, The Book would depend entirely upon what you consider to be out of place, wrong socially, or your moral values. Hard Answer- A question like this, opens the door for so many speculative answers. While some consider certain activities unacceptable socially, morally, or physically, others will not blink an eye when it\u2019s mentioned. The point in fact, IF you wrote of an entitled child, one who had many things others didn\u2019t but was suddenly deprived of such things, would that be messed up? Let\u2019s say you have a normal teenager. NOW he\u2019s been unable to get onto the internet for 3 days, can\u2019t text or use FaceBook, his phone has died trying and he can\u2019t find the charger cord, he lost all his contact information, the X-Box died on him in the middle of a game and he lost a Pokemon` Tournament. Add the fact his girlfriend has dumped him via a text message and he can\u2019t access Tik Tok to help him find another one. The worst part of it all is they EXPECT him to WORK for what he wants or needs, instead of it being just handed to him free of any responsibility. Can you imagine such a thing?By SOME standards that\u2019s absolutely the WORST possible life they can imagine. To a great deal of the population of the world, THAT is the most juvenile and selfish point of view ever. It\u2019s a matter of perspective. To the TEENAGER, their entire world has come to an end as they can\u2019t communicate, or ignore people, as they see fit. For a good majority of the world, who lives WITHOUT electricity to their homes, let alone such luxuries as indoor plumbing, water services, electric appliances to do everything for them. NO microwaves, NO stove, NO cell phone, NO fast food restaurant with drive through to quickly get food, NO Fresh-water, NO local grocery market with aisle after aisle of foods that can easily be fixed and eaten. NO house with their own room with a door that can be locked to keep people out, flooring, and walls to protect them from predators, or snakes, or insects. THIS is a reality for a good many people worldwide.Your question isn\u2019t really HOW to write the book, but WHAT do I consider to be messed up? That is something only YOU can answer. ",

            "answer_text": "How to write a book on how to mess it up in life = Wonderful. Your story sounds to be the \u2018unhappy ending\u2019 type. They exist and are popular. Whereas everybody else has scenes where the protagonist comes out on top, your novel will show how things get worse. Until eventually, all their dreams and hopes come to zero. If you want inspiration for this type of novel, have a look at Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d. Totally depressing but very powerful. ",
