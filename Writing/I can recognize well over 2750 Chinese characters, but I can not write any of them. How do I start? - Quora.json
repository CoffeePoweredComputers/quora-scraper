            "answer_text": "Things that will make this process easier, but aren\u2019t 100% necessary if your rote memorization is good. First, learn to write the radicals, as many of the 214 as you feel are necessary, but personally I only learned the most common 100 and am not touching the remaining until a bit later in my studies. Learn to write these by heart, to the point where you can think of a radical and instantly scrawl it down on the page with little effort (maybe that much isn\u2019t necessary, but it would help). You can do this either by rote memorization, spaced repetition software, or whatever other method you\u2019d like. (I used spaced repetition: Anki) Once you\u2019ve got that, you know the radicals well, know the pinyin. I didn\u2019t do this one, but I plan to in the future. If you\u2019re willing to put in the time, just like the radicals you could learn all the names of the basic strokes that make up even the radicals (\u70b9\uff0c \u6a2a\uff0c\u6a2a\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3f, etc) Some of these are used as just straight up character components sometimes (for example, \u5343 is \u4e3f + \u5341), so they will help (albeit to a lesser and lesser degree the more you learn the larger characters that they make up) in doing the method I\u2019ll describe below. How to actually learn to write the characters I used this wiki page Commons:Chinese characters decomposition to learn to write Chinese by components. I wrote a program that uses that page to recursively break down characters until they are just a bunch of radicals/other components, and then turned them into flashcards (pinyin and meaning on front, character and components on back). I took these flashcards and threw them into Anki, and then studied some every day by writing them down in Hanzi Grids. I studied about 75 a day 8 days before my HSK 4, and using this method I remembered most of them pretty well, but 75 is far far too many and I only did that because I had no time when I finished the program. You would be better off doing like 20 max (if that) if you\u2019re in no rush. So how exactly did I do it when I had these flashcards? I was like you, learning to write characters that I could already read and understand, so when I saw a character I would do two things: First I\u2019d recall the mnemonic I used to remember the character (If I had one for that particular character, usually these were based on the radicals anyway), second I\u2019d look at the components and (if applicable) think about them relative to the mnemonic, but the main, most important thing that I did was not thinking \u201chow do I write \u8d85\u8fc7?\u201d, but instead \u201cwhat are the components of \u8d85\u8fc7? What are their pinyin romanizations?\u201d I did this such that when I see \u201cchao1guo4 - to exceed, surpass, or outnumber\u201d on the front of my Anki flashcard, I don\u2019t immediately see \u8d85\u8fc7 in my head, I see \u201czou3, dao1, kou3 + cun4, chuo4\u201d, at which point I remember these very easy to write components \u8d70 \u5200 \u53e3\uff0c\u5bf8 \u8fb6 and I remember how they fit together to form the characters. Did I sometimes make mistakes like putting \u53e3 on top of \u5200 instead of the opposite? Yes, of course, but that was just because I was learning too many characters too fast, and I wasn\u2019t reviewing enough. Practice will eliminate that. So, you might be thinking one of two things, either \u201cok I\u2019ll use that wiki page\u201d or \u201cwow I wish I had that program you used\u201d and if it is the latter feel free to contact me, I\u2019ll give it to you no questions asked (athamirxoen@gmail.com this is a spam email so put like chinese program or something in the subject) I think if you consistently follow a spaced repetition system of learning to write Chinese characters through such flashcards in the manner I described above, that will do you a lot of good, however I do have one more suggestion. You can also just read many many Chinese articles and then copy them down (this will not only help you learn to write the characters, but also how authentic Chinese write, certain mannerisms and format, etc, and you\u2019d get used to writing certain characters after others) \u52a0\u6cb9\uff01 ",

            "answer_text": "It is amazing that you know so many Chinese characters. The number of most commonly used Hanzi (Chinese character) is around 2500. Writing Hanzi is not like drawing pictures. To write a Hanzi correctly, It is necessary to know its components ( \u6c49\u5b57\u504f\u65c1\u90e8\u9996), and the stroke sequence (\u7b14\u753b\u987a\u5e8f). There are available books, videos and even applications on how to write hanzi. It would be better to start with the simple characters, and to focus on practicing character components if necessary. Once you get familiar with most of the components and strokes, you will find it easy to write Hanzi. I believe it won\u2019t take you long to get there. I guess to learn Chinese is more or less the same as learning English: the four skills - reading, listening, speaking and writing should all be practiced. I suppose you have learnt Pinyin, the Chinese phonetic system, and can pronunce those characters. One good way to improve your pronunciation and listening ability is to listen to audio sources and imitate the speaker. As reading is the cornerstone to master a language, better read as much as you can. In the meanwhile, try to practice making phrases and sentences with the characters you know. Good luck! ",
