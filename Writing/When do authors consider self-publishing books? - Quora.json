            "answer_text": "It depends the author. That said, I recommend self publishing immediately. As a first time author go the self publishing route first and don\u2019t waste your time waiting for rejection letters from old time publishing houses that keep dying off. The world has changed in the last two decades. When you self publish, you learn the ropes of editing, design, PR, marketing as well as writing a good story. Recommend using Amazon. Amazon is the largest platform in the world. Recommend staying away from vanity publishers. Vanity publishers want money from you up front. Don\u2019t waste your time and money. Recommend you read the Wall Street Journal article published on Friday, December 9, 2011 written by Alexandra Alter. The article concerns author Darcie Chan and her novel, The Mill River Recluse. If you meet some success with your book, you can consider using an established publisher. Just remember, these people all have vested interests and look at you only from the prospect of what is in it for them. That is, can they make enough money off of you to waste their time with you. Also, through self publishing you can make dollars. Unless you are a famous person, the publishing houses will pay you pennies on the dollar. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "You might hear people say that authors consider self-publishing when they\u2019ve been rejected by traditional publishers, but that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story and is a limited way to view self-publishing. As a nonfiction book coach, I\u2019ve worked with over a hundred authors who chose to self-publish and only a few of them had chosen to do so after being rejected by a publisher. Most of them chose to self-publish without even considering traditional publishing. Why? Because trying to land a publisher can be a slow, time-consuming, and frustrating process of waiting around.Because traditional publishers only offer a small amount of royalties compared to self-publishing.Because self-publishing offers more control over their book.Because there\u2019s no barrier to entry like there is with traditional publishing.Self-publishing might be an author\u2019s first option these days.
