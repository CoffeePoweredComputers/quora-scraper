            "answer_text": "Well if you're using a led pencil to write with, and the eraser is too small, you can use it to put out the eraser. Then you're wrecking the paper clip which allows you to use it again next time. Needles can be used too, but if you don't have a needle, its your best choice if you don't want to wreck the eraser. I don't carry needles around for safety reasons, so I prefer to use a paper clip for such small things other than clipping papers together. Hope this is VERY useful to your wonderful question, and thanks for asking! ",
