            "answer_text": "Well, I listen to audiobooks because I really enjoy them. I was a total snob before I fell in love with audiobooks - I\u2019d always been a big reader and just \u201cknew\u201d that I didn\u2019t like audiobooks. Now, while I still like to read, I also always have at least one audiobook on the go besides listening to the audiobooks I\u2019m producing/publishing. Lots of people listen because they like them, some listen because audiobooks allow them to consume more books by allowing them to \u201cread\u201d while driving, exercising, cooking, gardening, etc. When I was first interested in audiobooks and searching out stats, I read somewhere that the people who consumed the largest number of audiobooks were also people who reported reading a large number of books, as well. So audiobooks are in addition to, not to the exclusion of, reading for many listeners. And there is a contingent that listens to audiobooks because they have some issue that makes reading difficult. As for a good title to start with, that\u2019s tricky. I listened to my first audiobook out of necessity. It was a terribly stressful and busy time in my life and everytime I tried to read for pleasure, I fell asleep in a sentence or two, I was sooo chronically exhausted. A friend convinced me to try audiobooks as a way to fit in \u201creading\u201d during my commute. I started with Bill Bryson\u2019s \u201cA Short History of Nearly Everything\u201d and found it quite delightful. I next listened to Melvyn Bragg\u2019s \u201cThe Adventure of English\u201d (I think that\u2019s what it was called) and absolutely loved it. I was hooked by that point. I tend to listen to a lot of nonfiction, but many prefer to listen to fiction. I would recommend you look for an audiobook in a genre you enjoy. Also, there are a lot of great narrators out there, but our reaction to narration tends to be very subjective. I might love so and so reading such and such, while you find the narrator intolerable or the subject matter stultifyingly boring. Don\u2019t give up if the first thing you choose isn\u2019t to your liking. Try a few audiobooks and give them a fair chance. Audiobooks aren\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but given the long importance of oral traditions and the pleasure we experience being read to as children, I\u2019m betting that most people can find something to their liking in audiobooks. They can be hard on the pocketbook, but the larger the audience becomes, the more they will come down in price - and that audience is growing as people discover that they can carry around a large library on their smartphones or other devices and listen anywhere. And there is always your local library. Besides CDs, many libraries offer digital audiobooks, too, so you can check out an audiobook and listen to it on your cell phone! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Books > Time There are SO MANY great and interesting books I want to read. To make even a dent in the pile I\u2019d love to have read, audiobooks come to the rescue. If I want to read a physical book, I can\u2019t do anything else. Well, maybe apart from commuting. But looking down in a car or bus makes me feel sick, so that only works on a train or plane.This is a serious hindrance to my desire to read more books. I\u2019m sure if I really tried, I could squeeze in more reading, but sometimes I want to get lost in Quora or yeah, Facebook too. Audiobooks however are fine on a bus, fine when shopping, walking, cooking, running, ironing, cleaning, working out, doing easy computer tasks like sorting photos, things that take up a surprising amount of time in a day or week.These days I don\u2019t mind that much to spend few hours batch cooking or ironing -it\u2019s time for a good book! And there\u2019s no shortage of those. If you are interested in my latest reads: 2018 ",
