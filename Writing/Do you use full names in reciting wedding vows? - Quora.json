            "answer_text": "Australian marriage law states that both parties to the marriage must have their full legal names stated at least once in the ceremony.(by me or them or other) Most couples I marry like to use the legal vows as the place to use their full legal names - they like the formality and it's only one sentence each. If a couple wish to include personal vows, additional to the compulsory legal vows, most are statements of the heart and they take whatever form you like. Sometimes pledges or promises, sometimes mix in religion traditional vows, and sometimes a declaration of some form about their relationship . Some couples don't want to have personal vows, but want a statement around a ring exchange or at some other point in the ceremony - neither ring exchange nor personal vows are a legal reqyuirement - it's choice and tradition - and so can do whatever is meaningful or nothing.

            "answer_text": "If you are writing your own vows, it's entirely up to you what you say. The 'formal' tradition in the UK is that you use all first names including middle names, but not surname. If you think about what's going on in a wedding, each vow is basically two contracts. Firstly, a commitment from the person speaking to the person marrying them.Secondly, a commitment between the people getting married and the community who have gathered to witness the marriage.You already know each others' names, and (presumably) all your guests know who you both are. So, there's really no reason to use names, first names, nicknames, full names, or just say 'I' and 'you' (or 'thee' at the appropriate points. ",

That\u2019s what I do: customize weddings according to what the couple wants, because it IS, after all, their day. If the couple wants their full names read in the ceremony, I will do that; if they prefer to be referred to by their nickname, or middle name, I use that prefered name. With the ceremony, I abide by the legal rules, and other than that, whatever the couple chooses, is icing on the cake, so to speak. ",
