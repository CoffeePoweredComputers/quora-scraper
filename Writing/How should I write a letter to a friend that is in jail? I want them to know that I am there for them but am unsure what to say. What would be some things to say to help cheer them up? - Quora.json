            "answer_text": "There are few things more exciting than receiving a fat envelope from a loved one, a casual friend, or even a near-stranger when one is incarcerated. (I\u2019m speaking from experience here. ;) ) In fact, inmates often keep a saltine cracker box to save all their correspondence for re-reading during times when they feel hopeless, bored and lonely, which is about 90 percent of the time, as you might expect, so the importance of the nearly lost art of letter-writing cannot be underestimated to an inmate. Although it\u2019s not necessary to make your letters long or frequent, it is appreciated! You\u2019d be surprised at how the most mundane things can bring hours of joy, even laughter, and other healthy emotions to a humble inmate. So, go ahead! It\u2019s okay to offer unsolicited advice and support. Do your best to stress how you will be there for them, in specific ways, when your loved one\u2019s time is over, as well as during this most difficult time, and stick to it! If you are financially able, follow the institution\u2019s rules to deposit money for paper and stamped envelopes, as well as money for desirable things such as snack foods and toiletries beyond the basics, which they can order through canteen/commissary. Something as humble to an outsider as a piece of chocolate or a pack of ramen can banish the deepest depression for a bit. If you have the means, find out what books or magazine subscriptions they crave, and have them sent in. (This is another policy that will vary by location.) Besides advice and news about their families, friends, and community, and (this is the best!) send along a page of your own corny jokes. (Rules vary about items such as magazine and newspaper clippings. All incoming mail will be gone over with the proverbial fine-tooth comb, and some things may be hand-censored or confiscated if inappropriate in the jailers\u2019 opinion.) That reminds me, a lot of inmates enjoy sex letters, if that\u2019s your relationship, but here again, keep in mind what your buddy\u2019s offense was to avoid anybody getting into trouble. Many of the incarcerated would love to see your drawings and poetry, even if you feel you have zero artistic talent, and will most likely reciprocate. Here, please again keep subject matter in mind: no gang symbols, overtly sexual stuff, signs of weapons or violence. It\u2019s common sense, really. Relay messages from any other mutual acquaintances, too! Send along, if permitted, their own childrens\u2019 drawings; these will be the most treasured items of all. If they can write back, keep them busy! Ask for a detailed hand-drawn map of his or her living spaces. Have them tell funny or poignant stories of fellow inmates(requesting names be left out for privacy,) what they see on TV and what their opinion is, what books or magazine articles they\u2019ve read, details of any special trips such as doctor visits or job searches they may be allowed, or other on-site events like \u201cchurch\u201d or the like. Food is a universal topic; find out what their favorite jail/prison meals are, when they are served, what\u2019s best (or worst!) And please, PLEASE tell the person that you love them, or care for them. If they\u2019re religious and you are, too, offer to pray that they have peace of mind, or tell their religious facility to keep the inmate in the congregation\u2019s prayers. And again, depending on a facility\u2019s rules, it\u2019s never too often to write. You have the power to help your friend do his or her time with a little more hope and smiles. Thanks for asking your question! (All opinions my own, based only on my short time in a U.S. county jail.) ",

I wouldn\u2019t try to cheer them up, per say, being in jail sucks. There\u2019s no way around it. But getting letters in itself will probably help them out. They want to know about the outside world, ask them if you can send them information about important local topics. Don\u2019t forget all mail to inmates is monitored. ",

Tell them about your job, your pets even the new dress you just bought. Write to a lifer, you won't have to worry that they migjt show up on your doorstep. Being incarcerated 10 years of a life sentence is long enough for the prisoner to not be the same person he was when they went in. I suggest you look up your inmats file. You want to know what their crime was but you don't want to ask them. ",

The TX shooter is in isolation too and on suicide watch. ",
