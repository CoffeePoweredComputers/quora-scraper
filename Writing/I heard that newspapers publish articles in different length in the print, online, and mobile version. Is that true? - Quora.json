It\u2019s different for digital and mobile. But articles online also tend to be shorter because the public\u2019s attention span is now much much smaller than it was 20 years ago. Readers tend not to read long articles online. Too much distraction, too small an attention span, and it\u2019s not a \u201ccomfortable\u201d read. ",
