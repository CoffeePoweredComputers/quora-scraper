            "answer_text": "Piano man is one of my favorite songs.   I always interpreted the people in the bar as people missing out on life--including Billy Joel as a meager piano man.   Paul earns good money as a real estate agent.  However, he has aspirations to be a novelist.  He never has time for a wife is irony as he finds himself a regular in a bar; time he could be using looking for a significant other. Davy is in the Navy because that is the only work he can find. Both can relate to one another in spite of the socio-economic differences because both are floating by life.  Ironically, the piano man can relate to all the patrons and hence write a song about them. ",

            "answer_text": "Someone who will not have time for a wife! I think Billy Joel was trying to describe someone who is an independent dreamer who can't follow through. A real estate person needs to hustle since they're only paid if they sell, a novelist needs to be dedicated and smart to finish the book. Neither occupation is constrained by limitations for salary, etc. If you work hard enough and you are smart enough you could make a very good living in either profession. Furthermore, you can adjust the parameters of the job in both cases and you are also solely responsible for your own luck in both cases. It is curious that Billy Joel's character \u201cnever had time for a wife\u201d suggesting he is obsessed with the dream but avoiding the great gifts in life like having a partner. His character in the song is also spending time with a group of sad sacks in a bar so he's probably not winning in the \u201creal estate novelist\u201d realm either. I'm picturing a dreamer who is diligently trying to \u201cwin big\u201d but his focus is missing so he's talking and chasing big dreams instead of just doing the work. That was a good song, very descriptive. ",
