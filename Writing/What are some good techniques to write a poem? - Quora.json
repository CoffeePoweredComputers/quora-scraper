            "answer_text": "The only sure thing were born to do is die. :D What a cheery way to start an answer. I\u2019m joking, it\u2019s just that sometimes when people discuss poetry it all gets oh-so-terminally serious. I think poetry doesn\u2019t have a lot of fans as it is and we are partly to blame. Ripping your heart out and bleeding it on the page, it\u2019s the most ineffective way to write poetry or create any kind of art for that matter. I\u2019m not saying that art shouldn\u2019t be painfully sincere and heartfelt at times, but the key phrase here is \u201cat times\u201d. Because it\u2019s exhausting and after a while you become numb and it translates on the page as fake and manipulative for the reader. And it\u2019s unhealthy. Life isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. As regards long poems versus short poems, Homer & co., classics versus moderns\u2026 Look, it\u2019s 2019, everything from how we slice our bread to quantum physics has progressed and evolved to be more effective. Why wouldn\u2019t art, why wouldn\u2019t poetry? Homer wrote epic poetry, today you have adventure novels and even better - superhero comics and movies! You\u2019re not forbidden to write epics, but in Homer\u2019s time there was also love poetry which was short and sweet and often unrequited, so yes, dramatic and sad as well. And they were into the whole incestuous mythologising, too. And they believed that poets were godly-inspired madmen/women. Which is not a very effective way to go about life. Besides prose had a bad rap back then, so even plays were written in verse. Today you have all sorts of genres. You have prose poetry. You even have something called fantasy/SF poetry. Case in point:  There\u2019s action, there\u2019s alien invasion in progress, and then there is winding down to the central moment and emotional pinnacle - waiting for that one guy to call you back. There you go, you can even be funny, sarcastic, vulgar, religious, iconoclastic, or whatever you bloody well please or hate in poetry. This also goes for art and life in general. You need a licence to be a surgeon, you need a license to drive a vehicle, you should be required to have a licence to be a parent if you ask me, but you absolutely don\u2019t need a licence to create art. You can write a poem about a pencil, a toothbrush, that muddy puddle of water you stepped in on your way to work or school. You can make it into a metaphor about an emotional condition or you can simply describe it as is. You are also allowed to lie in your poetry. You are allowed to take on the personality of a unicorn that was exiled to Venus and now has to find their way to a juicy pasture of magic mushrooms. You are allowed to not make any sense at all. You are allowed to philosophise about the meaning of life in blank verse or rhyme, or do both. You are allowed to be absolutely unoriginal. You are allowed to steal. Don\u2019t believe me? Read T. S. Eliot\u2019s \u201cTradition and the Individual Talent\u201d. You are allowed all of this and you are also allowed to then burn it all or delete it. Because all of this is practice. And these are a given in art or any creative endeavour: In the beginning you will be unoriginal, you will fall in love with an artist, you will want to be like them, you will intentionally imitate them and you will unintentionally use every cliche in the book, you will be cringe-inducing, you will be very, very bad.You will progressively become original, cause after the initial growing-up stage you will rebel against your \u201cparents\u201d, you will metaphorically kill your idols, you will come into your own having passed the initiation phase. You will have become an individual, more self-aware, honest with yourself and therefore honest in your writing. We are all a unique mixture of nature and nurture, opinions and emotions. Ultimately, you will not be able to help yourself but be original.However, you have to go through that initial stage. The best and most effective way to do that? Practice, practice, practice. This means: reading poetry & writing poetry. And in this case you need to do both. Set a goal of reading one poem a day and writing one line/phrase/word a day. If you don't know where to start with reading, pick up any poetry anthology. You don't have to read it from start to finish or even in the order the poems are presented. Read the ones with interesting titles, read the poets that sound sort of familiar, but you can't quite put your finger on them. When you find a poet you like or type of poetry or a rhyme pattern, read the info in the anthology and then seek more of it out. Find other poets or poetry that inspired what you liked and go deeper still. As regards writing, like I said, it doesn't even have to be a line. Write a phrase, something bouncing around in your mind, write two words that aren't supposed to go together but somehow do, write a word that has a melody you like or stirs something in you. The important thing is to know that most of it won't amount to anything or be especially good. All it is is essential practice, honing your craft, just like a musician would do, just like a painter would do, just like a carpenter, teacher, doctor, entrepreneur, mason, anyone wanting to get good at anything would do. Good luck and for poetry\u2019s sake have fun. :) ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a poet. I just write whenever something starts eating my brain. Last year, I read daily three newspapers a day. In each paper I had encountered lot of stuff about molesting girls/women. And, personally, I observed women who are awesome: I was unable to judge them. If I judge, I will be wrong. So, it came out:  I love movies, especially emotional movies. Almost every emotional movie is based upon heartbreaking: it could be because of adult love, friendship, parents, survival etc. Movies played a great role in my life. So, once, I wrote this:  In the same last year, I was obsessed with social networking. I\u2019m a kind of an introvert and found social networking is little comfortable to interact. And, one of my online friends asked me to write about digital friendship. I tried in my way and got this:  In a facebook group about books and writings, one of our peers requested us to write a poem on Bipolar Disorder. Because of her request, I started researching little about people suffering from Bipolar Disorder and put them in words like this:  I already mentioned, I\u2019m a kinda introvert. When I had no other choice than walking in the crowdy, nasty alleyways in the cities, I was suffered. I still feel very uncomfortable. So, I was lost and still  Because of my whole leisure year (2017), lot of things gone through my mind. One of them is how our souls are suffering:  The best thing I\u2019ve got in 2017 is books. Really a good feeling. I was unable to express this to others in any oral words. So, I put them in words as I was suggested by a special friend (digital):  I am a follower of Che Guevara and I lean more towards communism than capitalism. The class struggle that is clearly visible is really a great social atrocity. I always feel shame about it: DREAMS OF NOW ( A CLASS STRUGGLE)  Since the time of my own thinking, I\u2019ve started believing that something wrong is happening around us. When this belief took a rigid form, I got this: EDEN PARK In the name of your love,In the sense of your touch, In the feel of your breathI'm going\u2026I\u2019m going alone. Far away from the woods,Far away from the roadsTo the brink of this worldTo jump into my own world.I\u2019m going\u2026 I\u2019m going alone. Hate is must in this worldStarving to death is so commonMarketing is a hobby, andDeception is an artI can\u2019t hate, I can\u2019t cheatI won\u2019t market my laborI won\u2019t business my artI won\u2019t sell my heart, andI won\u2019t invest my mind, soI\u2019m going\u2026 I\u2019m going alone. Painful to stride on thorns,Awful to ride all nights Still I love to goTo the world where I wish to grow.I\u2019m going\u2026I\u2019m going alone. My world is full of loveI wish you to comeI know you can\u2019t live thereLike a delicate bird in cage.Every look harms you,Every touch hurts you,Every word breaks youEvery memory pricks you, stillI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re there?I stretch my hand To make a bond.I\u2019m waiting\u2026 I\u2019m waiting alone. Going to my own world is not at all easy since, I must leave everyone behind my fantasy. So, I started with, \u2018In the name of your love\u2019 Here are some more      Sorry for giving you trouble by mentioning my poems here. May be I am selfish or greedy. But, all I want you to realize is I had followed no structures, no rules and no patterns. I just put the words the way they were taking form in my brain, where the brain was fueled by my heart. If you feel my poems are good, you too flow like a river. Otherwise, I wish you find a better one. Thank you for requesting me. I do not see it as a request but, a chance for me to let my words flow. Thank you so much for the read. ",
