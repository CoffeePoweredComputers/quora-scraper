            "answer_text": "My motivation to write completely changed a few months ago, and I think comparing what it was before to now might be helpful here. About ten years ago, I decided that I should be a writer. Writing was the only thing that made sense to me . . . the thing that brought all my different parts (or personalities) together into a single focus, as well as my past successes and experience. At the time, I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what to write, but I knew that writing would be my thing from then on. Gradually, ideas for stories and other books came together, and I got to work, developing the lifestyle of a writer in the process\u2014learning how to give enough time to it everyday, etc. And those ideas for books became my motivation. It was like seeing sets of cumulative visions, which became clearer and clearer the closer I got to making them real. It felt like I just had to complete those visions . . . to turn them into the works I saw them becoming, so that each book could fulfill its potential. In a way, I liken my motivation during those years to Thanos in Infinity War living out his \u201cdestiny\u201d of collecting the stones until he could finally step foot on earth, respectfully defeat the last of his opposition, and cross the finish line. But, like Thanos, my vision was as shortsighted and limited as it was closed and uninformed by all but itself. I sacrificed everything for the sake of my books. I neglected my own health, my happiness, my loved ones, and everything else just to perfect every written detail. Honestly, I don\u2019t believe anything is worth losing yourself for. No \u201chigher purpose\u201d should require sacrificing your humanity. Thankfully, when I completely fell apart after fulfilling the calling of my motivation, those loved ones I\u2019d spent years pushing away were still there to help me gain new perspective (once I was finally broken down enough to be willing to see it). Long story short, my motivation now is totally different. It\u2019s the opposite. Instead of giving up fun and joy for the sake of writing, I write for fun. Instead of trying to bring together all the pieces of my experience and intuition into the most succinct narrative representations, I go into unplanned worlds through the perspectives of characters who become what they are as the story progresses. In other words, I get to know my worlds and people as they gradually come to life on the page. And I love it! My goal is no longer to complete the mission at all costs, but to have fun and enjoy life and writing, pursuing those things that make me happy. I\u2019m not necessarily saying that fun is better or more important than purpose . . . that personal happiness is a higher value than \u201cthe greater good.\u201d I can only share that, for me, I couldn\u2019t keep going the way I was. My motivation had to change. And for the last few months, my new motivation seems to work like rolling waves cresting ever higher and higher as they build upon themselves. I truly believe that sense of perpetual enjoyment will continue to grow, driving me on and on. And I\u2019d definitely wish that same great feeling on anyone who sets out to write a book. ",

            "answer_text": "Ah, this is a role for imagination! Sit down and imagine that you just published your first book. Imagine how you would feel and think. If you do not feel inflated, joyous, have a feeling of tremendous accomplishment \u2026 then you do not want to write a book. If all you can think of is how much money you can earn because you\u2019ve seen how much Stephen King makes for a bestseller, then you don\u2019t want to write a book, because your book will not be a best seller or make a lot of money (at least the odds are infinitesimally low). Basically if you are not already motivated to write a book, finding such a motivation is probably not going to happen. Writers write because they have to. When I advise authors to include in their imagined first response to their newly published book, that after sniffing it, fondling it, whatever, you will open the book to a random page and you will look down and see a typo. Don\u2019t panic, just get out a pad and write a reference to it down. There will be more and possibly they will be corrected in the second printing (if there is one). ",
