If the body doesn\u2019t fit the intro, you change the intro. And maybe you do more research to stick to the intro. So your intro and body change again and again. When you are satisfied, you basically rewrite your intro as your conclusion. At least if you asked questions in the intro, you answer them in the conclusion. ",
