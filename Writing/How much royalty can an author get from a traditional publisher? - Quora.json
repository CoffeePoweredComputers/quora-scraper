            "answer_text": "The current going rate is 5\u20137.5% for trade paperbacks with a big traditional publisher and 10\u201315% for hardcovers. So\u2026 Not much. While they may be able to help you sell more books, many hybrid publishers will pay you a 50% royalty. That means that with a traditional publisher you would need to sell 8\u201310 more books to make the same amount of money as selling one book with a hybrid publisher. And if you self-publish, you keep 100% of the profit, so you\u2019d have to sell 14\u201320 traditionally published copies for every 1 self-published copy. If your focus is on making money from books, you\u2019re going to have to market your book, no matter how it\u2019s published. But you\u2019ll make more money per sale if you don\u2019t go with a traditional publisher. ",
