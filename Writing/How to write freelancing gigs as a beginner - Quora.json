You should use a keyword that can search keyword buyer and it gets your link. Use the keyword at least 3 times in your gig. You fill your information correctly in your gig, for example: How many hours can you work? In how many days you can complete the work and give it ? What can you do in your service? Do not fill any information wrong. ",
