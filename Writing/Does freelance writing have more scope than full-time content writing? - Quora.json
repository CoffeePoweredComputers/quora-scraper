            "answer_text": "To be honest it depends, freelance writing is better than full time content writing without a doubt . But so is any job when compared to the freelance version of it because it relieves from a lot of stress and anxiety a full time content writing job can give you. But discussing about the scope, it totally depends on the individual and the quality of his writing which decides about his employment or even acceptance of his request to freelance any article. Quality does not only mean the language and vocabulary you might possess, but also the way you write and the way you interpret the topic and the way you approach it, all matters. This cannot be just acquired by writing over the years as , each topic has its own characteristics and needs to be interpreted in a different way each.

            "answer_text": "Yes. With content writing as a full time job, you\u2019re expected to work on anything that is thrown at you. You could be working on 1 article or 20 articles at any given time. However, no matter the quantity of articles you\u2019ve produced, you will still be paid the same salary as agreed upon when you got hired as a full time content writer. On the other hand, with the freelance writing, you pick up jobs as much as you want, for fees at your choice. You can still have full-time hours of work like 40 hrs or more every week, but if you\u2019re really working those hours on jobs, your income will be significantly higher. Downside is that a full-time job offers job security (up to a certain point!) and a steady income, while freelancing has an erratic income trend. Extra responsibilities fall on the freelancers to continuously market themselves, bid for jobs, etc. so that the income stays more or less steady. And that\u2019s quite a workload in itself. ",

            "answer_text": "Having worked both as an in-house content writer and a full time freelancer, I feel that I can help you solve this query. As per my understanding and belief, I feel that freelance writer has more scope for growth, both monetarily and professionally. As a freelance writer, you don't just work on similar projects all the time. Moreover, you need to stay updated and learn new skills all the time. You are your own marketer, sales guy and client servicing manager. So, naturally this helps a writer transform into a better professional. I don't even want to discuss how liberating it is to work as a freelancer where you have the power to control your own time. I know it is difficult to manage a stead flow of work in the beginning but if you are serious about growth and disciplined enough, there is nothing better than working on your own. I transitioned from a full-time employee to a freelancer and feel I have never been more happier, ever! In an industry that is ever growing, why limit yourself to just a specific job role? ",

            "answer_text": "I believe so because a full-time job will only pay a certain amount to you whereas freelancers get paid based on the number of articles they write and the number of words to be very specific. So if you're getting paid 3\u20134rupees per word and if you can write 3 articles in a day of 200 words approximately, then you can make at least 36,000 rupees in a month! But again, the amount of work also matters. If you get one article every day with 3\u20134 rupees per word you will end up making 18,000\u201324,000 only. Think wisely and one can always opt to freelancing after gaining a good amount of full-time experience to make more money based on the per-word pay concept. Some people even get 8 rupee per-word based on their experience and writing skills. I hope this helps :) Feel free to hit me up for any other queries. ",

            "answer_text": "Freelancing writing is somehow similar to content writing work. So if you are doing freelancing writing for someone than it can be of blog writing or content writing work. But your question should be which one is best freelance writing or personal blogging. My answer is personal blogging. If you have a passion for writing and if you can write for others then why not write for yourself. You can start on your own website.  You earn more than freelance writing if you have a personal blogging website. Earning can be from various sources like Google AdsAffiliate MarketingCPA MarketingGuest postingProduct sellingServices offering and lot more.These earning is far better than what you are getting some cheap bucks for writing to others.
