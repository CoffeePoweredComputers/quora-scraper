Network with other writers, take as many tests on Upwork as you can, and post your highest quality work on your portfolio. It will take a while, but I have a friend who makes that much writing. You have to commit to it as a full time job, just as if you were going to a physical job, and it will take a lot of hard work and effort on your part. But it can be done. Just don't expect it to happen overnight. ",

            "answer_text": "$100? You can earn more than that a day! Stop underestimating your skills and experience, because you're 99% better than many freelance writers who work for as low as $1 per hour. If you've got good work samples already, half of your work is already done. Now head over and read this detailed in-depth guide I published on how to get recurring monthly contracts without compromising on your rates.
