            "answer_text": "To save you from making poor financial decisions. A key purpose of accounting is to communicate to relevant stakeholders, up-to-date information about the financial performance and position of a business, so as to help them make informed decisions about the resources under their control.  But accounting uses it's own language to communicate this information and to someone who doesn't understand the language, the message is lost. If you don't understand concepts like assets, liabilities, expenses, revenue, equity, payables, receivables, creditors, debtors, gross profit, cost of goods sold, accruals, liquidity, cashflow, net assets, retained earnings, goodwill, amortisation, depreciation ... what chance have you or any stakeholder got of understanding the components that communicate the financial performance and position of a business. If stakeholders, like owners, managers, staff, suppliers, investors, funders and customers don't understand what many people in business call 'the language of business', then they would be 'flying blind' when making decisions and are more than likely to make poor ones.
