            "answer_text": "I find the specifics of hard vs soft magic systems somewhat indefinite. But I\u2019ve always thought of magic as described in Jack Vance\u2019s original The Dying Earth (to be specific, I am speaking here of the setting of his original short story collection of that title, not the Rhialto the Marvelous cycle). This sort of magic system has become almost pedestrian today, popularized as it has been by the original Dungeons and Dragons game system, but when Vance\u2019s story was published, it was a refreshingly new idea. Magic was a difficult intellectual exercise, the underlying nature of which was unclear. A magician who had worked diligently to train his mind might be able to memorize three or even four spells at a time, but that was all any human could manage. Once recited, a spell vanished from his memory, and had to be re-memorized. This made equipping oneself for an adventure as much a matter of careful selection of which spells to memorize as anything else. It also emerged, in the short story Turjan of Mir within the Dying Earth anthology, that magic is fundamentally a matter of mathmatics. To quote: \"Within this instrument,\" said Pandelume, \"resides the Universe. Passive in itself and not of sorcery, it elucidates every problem, each phase of existence, all the secrets of time and space. Your spells and runes are built upon its power and codified according to a great underlying mosaic of magic. The design of this mosaic we cannot surmise; our knowledge is didactic, empirical, arbitrary. Phandaal glimpsed the pattern and so was able to formulate many of the spells which bear his name. I have endeavored through the ages to break the clouded glass, but so far my research has failed. He who discovers the pattern will know all of sorcery and be a man powerful beyond comprehension.\" In later stories, such as the Rhialto the Marvelous tales, Vance departed from this idea, and sorcerers based their magic on enslaving supernatural beings called Sandestins. This always struck me as much less satisfying than his original idea of \u201cspells as one-shot items\u201d that had to be painstakingly reloaded after each use. ",

            "answer_text": "The Allomancy system from Brandon Sanderson\u2019s Mistborn series. Note, there are two other magic systems used in the Mistborn world, but I won\u2019t discuss those here as they\u2019re not used widely until the 2nd and 3rd books. Any other details on the magic has been left out due to spoilers. Allomancy has a strict set of rules of how it can be used. The system is based off the consumption of different metals and, by tapping into the metals power, the users gain certain abilities. Each metal can only be used for one specific thing and the outcome of using it can always be predicted. Any difference of power between users is explained as a difference in skill and practice, similar to the Avatar: the Last Airbender magic system. There is much lore behind Allomancy, which makes it fascinating. There are many intricacies to its history and every strange incident of its use is explained using this. One of the reasons this is my favourite system is being its so refreshingly unique. I\u2019ve never seen magic explored in this way before the Mistborn series. Since it, I\u2019ve encountered other unique systems, but I\u2019ve found that this is still my favourite. I wish I could explore Allomancy more in this answer, but it would simply spoil things too much. I highly recommend to any to read The Final Empire - the first book in the original Mistborn trilogy. It has this amazing magic system, a strong female lead, and an epic dystopian-fantasy world. ",
