            "answer_text": "Such people write like they think. In their heads is a never-ending rush of words and images that they can\u2019t stop, can\u2019t sort out into separate thoughts, and certainly can\u2019t act on. Their brains are breathless, gushy, and disorganized. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine what it must be like to live 24x7 inside a head like that, but it happens to me when I overdose on coffee. So I stopped drinking so much coffee. There might be genius there, but no one will take the time to dig for it. They need to do their own digging and smelting. I don\u2019t even read that stuff any more. I just ship it back and let them know that it\u2019s impossible to read and they should try again, by breaking their thoughts into topics, and then writing one short paragraph per topic. Is that mean? No, because most people won\u2019t even bother to try to read it and won\u2019t mention why, and then a friend will spend a lifetime wondering why no one responds to his posts and emails. ",
