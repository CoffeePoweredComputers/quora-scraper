            "answer_text": "The tried and true and trite advice: READ. Read what you love, what engrosses you, what you can\u2019t put down. You will pick up on things like style, voice, cadence, crafting. It will give you ideas and help you write as well as you read. It takes time, but it works. Also, read works (short stories included) by various authors. Just to throw a few out there: Ray Bradbury, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Kate Chopin, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, and Harper Lee. You will gain an understanding and feel for different writing styles and it will help you develop your own. WRITE. Write often, write everyday. Who cares if it\u2019s not brilliant at first, or if it\u2019s astounding one day and so-so the next. Writing is not just a skill or talent, it\u2019s a muscle that gets stronger and more defined as we use it. Most of all, have fun. Follow your joy and love in reading and writing. You will improve! You could also take a writing class and/or attend a few workshops. You could join a local writer\u2019s group, or discern a good one online - competent writers that know how to give constructive feedback. Remember to have fun while you work. It shouldn\u2019t be tedious. It should be work that you love so much it doesn\u2019t feel like work. Happy writing! ",
