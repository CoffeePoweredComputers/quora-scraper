It goes like this The day I met you I felt that I felt nothing but the days spent with you made the difference actually till then I never felt a presence of girl in my life to that instant but the days I spent with you really changed my way of life I dont say I love you but I can only say and feel there's some bond between you and me that I never had with anyone so far in my life that kind of feeling which I can't express in my words with you I always feel like expressing my feeling towards you but I never because i know i cant and couldn't But I can only say the days I spent with you would be remembered for my whole life time the way you treat me the way you talk to me the way I had an attachment with you will always be memorable I don't know how and why every feeling I had towards you are hidden in my self such that I my self can't exhibit them before me only Then how can I exhibit before you I want to say I like you but can't I want to say I care for you but can't I want to say you are more than me but can't May be if I had only wish in my life that would be to stay in presence with you my .........., I don't know what would fill the blank But one thing is true I ......., you I only know like my inner heart know what feeling I had towards you There were many sleepless nights thinking what I can do for you instead what I can do to myself As life is a journey as an philosopher has said, you are part of my journey and there is always a destination where I Need to leave you but I would be happy if I can be accompanied with you through out your journey also Nothing nothing I can do because I am afraid of loosing you I am afraid of listening negative from you Let me stay like this thinking somewhere around you might be having atleast any of the feelings which I had towards you dear You think I am a stupid who calls you daily for knowing whether you had dinner or not No It's like I call you everyday to just make myself feel comfortable that you are ok an assurance thats it and I feel good once I heard from you. You were although not my destiny but you became one of the milestone in my life may be which I cannot reach in my life time Miss you so much If there could be an other chance I would just born along with you to spend my most of time along with you I don't want to miss even a second in my life without missing you There were lots of feelings surround my heart when I think of you your smile your innocence would always make me remember me of my childhood If you could have met me in child hood itself it would have been something different ",
