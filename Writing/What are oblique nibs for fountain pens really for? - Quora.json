            "answer_text": "Calligraphy. Oblique holders allow the writer to achieve an otherwise difficult angle that is advantageous in various script styles of calligraphy. Most calligraphy nibs will go into an oblique nib holder, but if you want to use an extra fine nib, like the Brause 66 arrow nib (for Manga), then you'll want to get a nib holder designed to take it like a Ziller. Ziller makes different holders so if you search for one, make sure you look for the Brause 66 holder. I have a simple Speedball for most calligraphy nibs, but the wider ones hold better in a Kaweco nib holder. They are expensive, but you get what you pay for and a Kaweco holds nibs securely like the Hiro Leonardt P-8 and others in that line. I use a E+M nib holder for the Brause 361 blue steel pumpkin nib. There is another Brause that I cannot think of its number at the moment that looks like a forefinger pointing down, it is an interesting nib! As for ink I prefer a thicker ink than Speedball. I like J. Herbin\u2019s calligraphy ink for dip pens. I have it in four colors of black, green, blue & red. I like variety! I hope this helps you on your way in the world of calligraphy. Be patient. You need to practice, then it will become second nature to you. I have to stop myself when I am signing something from doing my name in Spencerian script! Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Oblique nibs accommodate the writer whose hand-position is not exactly \u201ctextbook\u201d or who faces certain other special circumstances \u2014 e. g., left-oblique nibs help the 50% (or so) of left-handers who do NOT bend their wrists while writing in English (or other left-to-right writing), and these likewise help those (non-bent-wrist) right-handers who are writing in a right-to-left script such as Hebrew or Arabic. Right-oblique nibs help the bent-wrist RIGHTY (yes, such do exist) if the bend in the wrist is moderate & the script is left-to-right. NOTE \u2014 although bent-wrist (a/k/a \"overwriter\") people are only a tiny percentage of the right-handed majority, there are so MANY right-handers that the actual _number_ of overwriter righties is about equal to the actual number of overwriter lefties: a few millions (I don't have the figure to hand).
