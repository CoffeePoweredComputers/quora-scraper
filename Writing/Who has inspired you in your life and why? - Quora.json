            "answer_text": "I have been inspired by Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s and Chris Pratt\u2019s freedom to be themselves, even on camera. I have been inspired by the Critical Role cast who openly enjoy a very nerdy hobby and are making the most of it. I have been inspired by the likes of Tony Robbins, Eric Thomas and Tom Bilyeu on the art of Motivation and serious joy for life. And I have been inspired by the people in my personal life. By my parents who, albeit very different, inspired me to be my best. My dad inspired me to think freely and to follow my own path, while my mother inspired me through her loving acts and positive outlook to keep thinking of the best. By my brothers who are weird and dorky and who push me to be a better older brother. My youngest brother who gives not a single care in the world about what anyone else thinks and is therefore freer than most, and my middle brother who travels the world and does what he wants to do on a grand scale on a whim, and therefore lives a very happy life. And by each and every one of my clients who all try their best to lead their own life. My clients who have gone through some terrible things and still took the courage to seek help. Those that seemingly have it all and still demand more of themselves. And those clients who come in every week with questions, concerns and an overwhelming desire to do better than before. There are many amazing answers to this question, as there are many truly inspiring people. And while I have been inspired by many people, I think it is mostly in the eye of the beholder who inspires you. I personally believe that each and every person is inspiring in their own ways. From the homeless person on the street who still has not given up on a dream of a better future, to the people sitting in their skyscraper offices that are trying to make the world a better place. From the person stressfully yelling at the cashier only because they demand so much of themselves, to the person that relaxes on the beach trying to live a carefree life. And even the person sitting here right now reading this, who after all they have been through continues to read answers about inspiration, most likely in an attempt to become inspired to lead a better life because they have not given up on themselves despite all their hardships. Every person can inspire you if you only look at them in the right light, because, at the end of the day, those that still get up in the morning are those that have not given up on themselves yet. Keep fighting for your dream. Keep battling your inner demons. And never give up on the idea of leading a great life. If you do that, even though it may not mean much, you will continue to inspire me at the very least. ",

            "answer_text": "Marshal Bruce Mathers III known as Eminem.  I have been continuously listening him and following him since i was a child. He has been my idol since I was in 6th standard of my school, I came to know about his personal life and how he has fought his way to success and become the best rapper in the world. His early life was very difficult as his father left him when he was a child and he used to live with his mother, due to financial issues he and his mother used to switch towns and they were living an unstable life. Since he was an introvert in his early life due the family crisis he was going through, he was often bullied in his school and was beaten down more often. He dropped out to school very soon and started doing what he loved to do i.e., rap. Competing around with the underground rap artists. He won several rap battles but that wasn't taking him anywhere in his career. After a lot of struggle his first break came when his recorded CD was heard by the all time legend Dr Dre. He gave him his first break with his album Slim Shady LP in 1997 which rose him to success. There has been quite a struggle in his life when his wife Kimberly Scott left him and he started with drugs. Once he over dozed himself with drugs and if it had been late for 10 mins before reaching hospital he would have died as the doctor says. Good news was that he survived after which he released him new album Recovery, which was an all time blockbuster. Now, he was known by everyone around the world as one the best rap artist in the world. He released several albums after that, most of them were a huge succet, breaking record sales worldwide. Now, we can say that he is the living legend among us and rappers call him rap god, which he truly deserves. . . . I am fan of his music, even more than that I am fan of how he fought with his failures in life to become the living legend that we all know now.
