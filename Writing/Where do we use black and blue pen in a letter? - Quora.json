            "answer_text": "If you are using a computer and printer to produce your letters, ink is generally used for the signature to show that the person who is sending the letter actually saw it, supposedly read its contents, concurred with what was stated, and would be willing to support it if there were ever any question about its origin or its intent. Today, letters are often not personally signed\u2026there is just a typed name and title below the signature line\u2026.and that is generally sufficient to indicate the originator. But, without the blue or black ink signature, the letters don\u2019t carry as much impact or veracity as those which are signed in ink. ",
