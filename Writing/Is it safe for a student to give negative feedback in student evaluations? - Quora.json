            "answer_text": "This is almost certainly referring to student evaluations of faculty/classes, so I\u2019ll start there. Any accredited college in the US requires that departments offering courses have mechanisms of evaluating the success of the courses, and an integral part of that is student evaluations. You should provide honest, impersonal feedback, including feedback about the teachers, lab assistants, tutors, &c. \u201cDr X was difficult to understand in class because his handwriting on the board was frequently illegible\u201d is a good example of negative feedback that is useful. The department head will probably discuss this one with the teacher. \u201cI didn\u2019t like Dr Y\u2019s lectures because he\u2019s an opinionated redneck jerk\u201d is an example of a personal, ad hominem attack. It may make you feel better to state it but whaddaya expect the department head to do about it? Don\u2019t waste your time or theirs. \u201cDr Y\u2019s lectures are not as effective as they could be because he spends too much class time talking about off-topic things interesting to him and his opinionated redneck jerk friends\u201d is a mix of the two above. It is a personal attack that may make you feel good, but it also contains information that the department head can act on. I suggest that it will be more effective without the \u2018redneck jerk\u2019 stuff, because if acted upon it may become public and then it could be construed as bias on your part. Second point of discussion: Some faculty give their own evaluation instruments in addition to the ones turned in to the department. I do this every term. While they may promise that the feedback is anonymous it\u2019s a guarantee that until recently was hard to live up to. Today, online Learning Management Systems (LMSs) provide a mechanism for feedback that really is anonymous. The only danger here is that with free-form text input your writing style may be so familiar to your instructor that they can tell who wrote it. Third point of discussion: Teachers frequently employ peer evaluation of student work as a learning experience. \u201cEveryone write a five minute essay on TV coverage of the 1952 US presidential election. Done? Trade papers with the person in the seat next to you and everybody critique each other\u2019s work.\u201d In that scenario your feedback should be honest but unfailingly positive and encouraging. Teachers also employ peer evaluation of student work as an important part of grading team projects. I employ evaluation instruments that I call \u201cSelf and Mutual Evaluation\u201d. They are turned in only to me and I will never share one student\u2019s comments with another student. The trick to mine is that each student has to fill out the evaluation about not only their teammates but also themselves. For term projects I usually do these at regular intervals. I ask about what team members are contributing, how well they\u2019re doing, are they pulling their weight, and so on. Then I use a trick I learned from the ten year old daughter of a colleague. I say, \u201cif your had $97 in silver dollars to distribute to reward effective team participation, how would you divide it? Remember to include yourself.\u201d The trick is to use a prime number and a reward token that can\u2019t be fractionalized. It forces the students to give up on the early optimistic \u201ceverybody\u2019s doing a wonderful job\u201d mindset and start remembering \u201cJoe missed two team meetings and didn\u2019t let us know.\u201d In that scenario negative feedback is almost the point of the exercise, but it should still be impersonal to whatever extent you can keep it that way and still be honest.

            "answer_text": "Student evaluations don\u2019t end with college. I attended a software training session at company expense in Orlando for a week. At the end of the course, we did an anonymous evaluation. The course was horribly taught. In addition to the instructor, who did a passable job, there was another employee of the software company in the class helping. He was rude. He frequently interrupted the instructor with suggestions. Usually the suggestions were for topics the instructor had plans to talk about just a bit later. He constantly told stories and anecdotes he thought were funny or reflected well on himself. I ripped the class in the evaluation, and the \u201chelper\u201d especially. I have been an I structor so I have some idea of how to run s class. I was brutal and called out the offender by name. The phone was ringing when I got to my office on Monday morning. It was my supervisor asking why I had been so harsh answering the anonymous survey. I told him to think about the question he had just asked me. Then I hung up the phone. A few minutes later I got a call from my manager(a different person.) he had received a call from the government representative on the contract asking him the same question about the survey. I asked him how he had replied. He said\u201dI asked him if he understood what anonymous meant. Then I told him that I know Dave well. He\u2019s not a troublemaker at all. The next time, just tell him what you want him to say on his anonymous survey. I am sure he will follow your instructions.\u201d It\u2019s good to have a boss who has your back. ",
