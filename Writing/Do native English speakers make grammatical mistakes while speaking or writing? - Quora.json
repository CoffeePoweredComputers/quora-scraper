            "answer_text": "Absolutely. They're typically just different from the non-native speakers. (First, you have to put aside various non-standard dialects--as one or two others mentioned here already, those aren't technically mistakes, just non-standard. English is made up of these dialects; it's just that one or two were standardized and made canon at some point in history. You also find a number of differences between, say, British and American English--at the weekend and on the weekend, for example, or in hospital and in the hospital. That's not what we're talking about. I'm also going to put aside punctuation and other writing-specific errors and focus on oral communication.) Errors--and by error I mean systematic ones that normally educated native speakers of the standard dialect frequently make--tend to be quite different. High-level English learner errors that native speakers would never make: Tense confusion, depending on the origin language. French and Italian speakers tend to say, \"I have gone to that movie yesterday.\" A German speaker might say, \"I am always reading the newspaper every morning.\" Everyone tends to overuse the past perfect--\"I had gone to school last week and had done all my homework.\" (with no context that would trigger the past perfect, such as \"...before I dropped out and burned my books.\") Native speakers rarely select the wrong tense.Modal confusion: \"Tonight I will go home early because I must study.\" This is fine for communicative purposes, as any native speaker would understand immediately what is being said, but no native speaker would normally phrase it this way. We would probably say, \"Tonight I'm going home early because I have to study,\" or \"Tonight I'm going to go home early because I've got to study.\"Prepositions, phrasal verbs, and articles. They're idiomatic and tough. Native speakers tend not to have problems with these.Native speakers, on the other hand, frequently make these mistakes... Confusing the three principal parts of irregular verbs--\"drink, drank, drunk,\" for example, or \"lie, lay, lain.\" Non-native speakers learn right off the bat that the second part is for the past simple and that the third (participle) goes after \"to be\" in the passive or \"to have\" in the perfect tenses. \"I have drank,\" is incorrect but common. \"I'm going to lay on my bed,\" is another. (Non-native speakers may also make these mistakes, depending on their level, but they tend to shed these errors as they become advanced, knowing the rules behind them.)Confusing elements that are phonetically similar: e.g. \"could've\" rendered \"could of\" in writing and then in turn in speech. A non-native speaker probably wouldn't do this because it just doesn't make any sense semantically, and they're more aware of each word that they say than your average native speaker.Subjunctive and conditional errors. \"If I was rich\" should be \"If I were rich\" and \"If I would have known...\" should be \"If I had known.\" The subjunctive is dying, and the correct formation of a conditional sentence is starting to falter as well. (non-native speakers may also make these mistakes, because conditionals are a little complicated.)Double negatives--\"I wouldn't know nothing about that\"--but these tend to be a lot rarer among educated native speakers and frequently associated with a lack of education. (You also find these among non-natives speakers.)Lack of awareness of countable and uncountable nouns: e.g. \"There were less people there\" instead of \"There were fewer people there.\" However, a native speaker would never refer to \"informations\" as non-native speakers frequently do.Adverb/adjective confusion: \"I'm good.\" \"I feel badly about that.\"Subject/object confusion--not just the distinction between whom and who, which is now so rare that most ESL books cite whom as optional, but also subject/object pronouns: \"This picture is of my husband and I at the Grand Canyon.\"Of course, most of these mistakes might also be made by non-native speakers, especially at lower and intermediate levels--but as I said before, non-native speakers tend to be made more aware of them through ESOL classes and instruction. They are, for the most part, actively seeking to eliminate errors from their usage in a way that native speakers usually aren't. It is, however, difficult to get to the point in a foreign language (as an adult) at which one makes ZERO mistakes, especially when it comes to prepositions and more complex sentences, and especially in speaking, when one doesn't have the luxury of leisurely revision. On the other hand, if a non-native speaker isn't studying but picking up the language organically (as most low-income immigrants do), they will probably pick up the language that is being spoken around them, which might include many of the above mistakes.

            "answer_text": "Yes, and in two completely different ways. Most of the existing answers seem to assume only one class of mistake: non-conformance to prescriptivist grammar as taught in schools. But the thing is, any particular class can only teach the rules of one dialect at a time (and those in England will teach things slightly differently from those in the U.S., for example). Given the number of different English dialects in existence, it doesn't matter which one you pick; the vast majority of native English speakers will not natively speak that dialect. And if you judge the correctness of someone's speech by the rules of someone else's dialect, they will get a lot of things wrong. So, yes, native English speakers make mistakes in non-native dialects, including standard taught-in-school dialects, all the freaking time. By this standard, non-native speakers may indeed be observed to make fewer errors than natives, since they will have learned the standard dialect against which everyone is being judged. It's important to note, however, that what looks like a mistake compared to some standard dialect is almost always not actually a mistake to the person speaking. For example, when you come across a Utahan saying something like \"I might could've done it\" (absolutely right out according to high school English and ESL classes the world over- English doesn't have serial verb constructions!), or a speaker of African American Vernacular saying something like \"I be runnin in the mornings\", they are not making a mistake. They meant to say it that way, it is perfectly understandable to their peers, and it is correct according to the rules of their native dialect. There is a second kind of error, though. Ignoring issues of standardization and dialectal variation, mentally normal, non-speech-impaired people do make mistakes in their own native dialects fairly frequently. I.e., they say things that they themselves retroactively identify as incorrect. And this happens in every language. The reasons are quite varied, and observing what kinds of errors people do and do not make tells us quite a bit about how language is produced in the brain. In writing, for example, substitution of homophones is quite common (e.g., writing \"there\" for \"they're\" or \"their\"). In speaking, things like swapping inflectional endings between words (like \"I'm start to thinking\" for \"I'm starting to think\") or incorrect verb agreement (usually a result of long sentences where the speaker loses track, or changes their mind about what they wanted to say half-way through) are fairly common.

            "answer_text": "Yes. Many native speakers of English dash off dangling modifiers as if they were going out of fashion. They occur far more in writing than in speech, and are among the reasons why proofreaders and sub-editors gnash their teeth down to the stumps. They\u2019re annoying because they can\u2019t be easily corrected like simple typos or poor subject-verb agreement; they require rewriting of whole sentences, standfirsts (they\u2019re ever so popular in standfirsts) and, sometimes, entire paragraphs. I may have altered the nouns, adjectives and verbs to protect the guilty, but these are close-enough examples of some of the lines I\u2019ve had to deal with from people whose first language is supposed to be English: \u2022 \u201cFeaturing floor-to-ceiling windows and magnificent chandeliers, you and your wedding guests will love this grand ballroom.\u201d \u2022 \u201cSprinting up the road, the castle was on fire.\u201d \u2022 \u201cJointly held by Ivan the Terrible and Tamberlaine the Great, this is an ideal venue for a party that will culminate in a massacre.\u201d \u2022 \u201cWaking up at three in the morning, the room was in darkness.\u201d \u2022 \u201cLovingly assembled from precious metal parts and set with diamonds, fashionistas will love these vintage watches.\u201d \u2022 \u201cReading a murder mystery, the cat began to hiss furiously and back away from my armchair.\u201d These grammatical errors crop up again and again like never-say-die zombies. So I keep getting brides, bridegrooms and wedding guests who feature floor-to-ceiling windows and magnificent chandeliers; castles that run (whose castle is this? Howl\u2019s?); people holding a venue rather than an event; rooms that wake up at three in the morning; fashion lovers assembled from gold parts; and cats who read murder mysteries. I suppose I do have to earn my keep. And if the murder mystery the cat was reading had dangling modifiers in it, well, that would be good \u2013 kitties like dangling things, don\u2019t they? ",

We have standard mistakes like mixing up fewer with less, and lately I hear a lot of native speakers not using past participles in verb structures: I should have went when the correct usage is I should have gone. These two instances may be examples of change where it may be a matter of time before few and its comparative fewer and fewest disappear along with irregular past participles. Usage rules, as they say. Here\u2019s one that is always a written problem for native speakers of English: it\u2019s versus its. English shows possessive case by adding \u2018s to nouns. Carol\u2019s friend. Possessive pronouns can take the place of the noun: Her friend. The confusion comes in with third person it. I like it. It\u2019s delicious. The it\u2019s is not a possessive pronoun but rather a contraction of it is. So: I like it. It\u2019s delicious and its texture is quite nice too. You can see this error everywhere - in signs, in newspapers, text books, and on tv. ",

Bad English teachers are probably to blame for this. \u201cWere\u201d should be used instead of \u201cwas\u201d in an if clause only when expressing something that is known to be contrary to fact, not when there may be some doubt about factuality.

Rather, they are considered a lower class of dialect. Mistakes are due to a lack of education, laziness and imitating other speakers who use bad English. Popular songs contain these mistakes and they follow clear patterns.  Not every mistake affects the understanding. If they are common errors we pick them out right away and our mind comes up with the correct version.  The problems get worse when one doesn't know express his thoughts in a clear and orderly fashion. Bad syntax can render a sentence incomprehensible. Run on sentences are a serious problem. Using the incorrect word can be a serious error. That often happens when a person tries to use a word he does not really know.  Generally the errors of a native speaker do not impede understanding while the errors of a learner of English can be more serious ",

In written English, natives tend to be even worse. My theory is that this is because often non-native speakers put a lot more effort into learning our arcane grammatical rules than native speakers do. This is because native speakers learn most of our English informally, and often do not think much about whether we are using it correctly. I have found that often, young Germans have a command of written and spoken English that puts young British people to shame. I think this is partly because our shared heritage, and English's German roots, gives Germans a particular sprachgef\u00fchl (feeling for the language) for English. ",

If I write a text, or a reply such as this one, or an email, and can't edit it after I send it, then geez, people make mistakes.  Or we purposely write in an informal manner, to mimic how we might speak.  Speaking grammatically correctly all of the time gets one labeled as a prude. More permanent works, such as a resume, a book, or an article, well, we expect more diligence for those.  More proofreading, rewriting, even having someone else proofread for you.  The standards are higher the longer lasting the work is. This is not a particularly formal setting, so please forgive the informality and errors in the preceding.  ;-) ",

I don't know how it's possible to only speak one language and still not know the difference between \"your\" and \"you're,\" or \"to,\" \"too,\" and \"two,\" yet native speakers make these mistakes consistently, while those who learned English as a second language usually seem to get it right. Maybe they put more emphasis on learning the grammar rules correctly? The most common mistake I see non-native speakers make is unusual word order, but if they are reasonably fluent then their grammar is pretty impeccable. ",

I'd say that no body is perfect n all have mistakes n it's possible that the native speakers do that kinda gaffs more than non-native speakers do!

Anyway, i myself sometimes do that mistakes with my mother tongue ARABIC LANG. Especially me since i study , learn n speak English almost all the time n i use Arabic rarely these days n this is makes me do mistakes in my mother tongue . So it quite normal thing ; ) ",
