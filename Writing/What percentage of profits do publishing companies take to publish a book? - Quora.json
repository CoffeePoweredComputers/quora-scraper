            "answer_text": "You\u2019re probably looking at this wrong. The way it works in traditional publishing is that the author is paid a royalty based on the cover price of the book. There\u2019s plenty of variation, but typically the author gets 10% of cover price for each hardcover copy, 6% for mass-market paperback, 7.5% for trade paperback. Let us look only at hardcovers for the moment. Assume a 10% royalty on a cover price of $25. The author is owed $2.50 for every copy sold. Typically, the author will have received an advance \u2014 this is literally an advance against royalties. If the author was paid $10,000 up front for that $25 hardcover, then he won\u2019t be paid any royalties until the book has sold 4,000 copies: 4,000 * $2.50 = $10,000. For the 4,001st copy, the publisher owes him another $2.50, and for every copy thereafter. However, you did not ask about the author\u2019s share of sales; you asked about the publisher\u2019s share of profits. That depends on far too many variables to reduce to a single number. Let us suppose that that $25 hardcover sold 5,000 copies (which is respectable but not very impressive), all of them at full price. That\u2019s a gross of $125,000. About half of that went to the retailers \u2014 bookstores, Amazon, etc. That leaves $62,500. 10% goes to the author \u2014 that\u2019s $12,500, leaving $50,000. That has to pay for shipping, printing, and binding 5,000 copies (or probably many more, since not every copy will sell), purchasing the cover art, designing the interior, typesetting, proofreading, copy editing, editing, office space, warehouse space, etc. Whatever is left after all that is the publisher\u2019s net profit, and the publisher keeps all of it. For a successful midlist title, it usually works out to roughly the same as the author\u2019s share, or a little less. On a flop, the publisher will lose money, because sunk costs such as art and editing will be more than the book brings in. On a hit, it\u2019ll likely be somewhat more than the author\u2019s share because those sunk costs will be a smaller share of the total. But then, the author\u2019s royalties often go up to 15% above a certain number of copies, so the publisher\u2019s share goes down again. So the simple answer to your question is either \u201cabout half,\u201d if you look on the author and publisher as partners (which is legally what they are), or \u201c100%\u201d if you look at it from the publisher\u2019s point of view, as they consider the author\u2019s share a fixed cost, not part of the profits.

            "answer_text": "Much much more than they should for what they do. The publishing business, like any other middle-man business (think music industry), is extremely unfair to the people who actually make that business possible. The real job creators are the authors, but we aren\u2019t compensated appropriately for this. I say this as someone who has been published multiple times by the Big Five and been in the business for over a decade. You get cents on the dollar for each book sold. In return, the publishing house edits the book, commissions a cover, prints and distributes the book and takes you to dinner every couple years if you\u2019re in New York. They allegedly market your book as well, but unless you got an amazing six figure advance, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll do much to market the book and will expect you to do that yourself. Why? Because it isn\u2019t worth their time. Oh, they\u2019ll promise you all the marketing in the world. They\u2019re very good at that. But the industry is littered with authors who will tell your stories about the marketing promises made and broken by their publisher. That\u2019s just the cold, hard truth. A publisher\u2019s idea of marketing a mid-list author (which is what you\u2019ll likely be if you don\u2019t get that six figure advance) is to send it out to the trade reviewers and various newspaper reviewers. The chances of any reviewers actually reviewing your book, however, are slim unless you\u2019ve really written something special or unusual. If your book sells well, you\u2019ll get another contract and a slightly better advance. Which, by the way, is doled out in dribs and drabs over a number of months or even years, which is why most authors have to have day jobs. If your book doesn\u2019t sell well, you will likely be dropped by your publisher and may have a hard time finding a new one under your name. The publishing house, however, will simply find another author. On the other hand, if your work is good enough to get an offer from a publishing house\u2014but the advance isn\u2019t very high (the average now is about $5,000)\u2014you\u2019re probably better off going the indie route. Hire an editor and a cover designer and publish the book on Amazon. You\u2019ll still have to do the marketing yourself, but that\u2019s no different than if you went with a publishing house. The difference is you\u2019ll make 70% of each book sold. When I published my first indie book I made more in three months on one book than I did in my first half-decade with the Big Five. I tell you this only because I want you to know the possibilities. Bottom line, no matter which way you publish, selling any books at all is tough. Chances are you won\u2019t make much money either way. Or you could hit the jackpot. There was a time when publishing houses had authors over a barrel. They controlled everything from content to printing to distribution. But thanks to Amazon and other services, these things can be handled by the author him- or herself for a nominal cost. I realize I probably sound bitter. Like a disgruntled author. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m quite happy, in fact. Unlike many of my friends, I left the traditional publishing world voluntarily. Why? Because I saw how many of those friends were getting what they were due in indie publishing, and I like having control over my work. When I first went indie I said to my financial guy, I can\u2019t believe how much money I\u2019m making. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re taking in what your publisher used to take.\u201d ",
