            "answer_text": "Yes, having an internship can help your college application. Will it be the reason you get in? Probably not. However, an internship can be a great way for you to figure out what your goals are in college. It helps to show work ethic, meet new people, and demonstrate skills that you learn. Getting an unpaid internship when you are still in high school shows a level of maturity and responsibility. Plus, if you have a great experience, you might have formed a great connection with a manager or someone who can write you a great letter of recommendation. That letter can be a great way to stand out and will speak to your good qualities. However, before committing to just any internship, make sure it is within the field you are interested in studying in college. For example, if you are interested in science, don\u2019t get an internship at a bank. And, if getting an internship is going to interfere with your grades or test scores, it is not worth it. Your grades, standardized tests, and course rigor are much more important than getting an internship. Make sure to keep your priorities in order to ensure that you are giving yourself the best shot at your dream college. ",

Is it an internship if you work the cash register at the local grocery store or flip hamburgers at McDonalds? And yet getting a Great letter of recommendation from your supervisor at the grocery store or from your McDonalds manager will be a Big help towards college admission (I got a great letter of recommendation to MIT from my McDonalds manager). Those colleges want to see: extracurricular activities (in school or in your extended community) that demonstrate: Leadership, Commitment, Passion, Excellent time management, and a Warm interpersonal relationship with others in a team-building setting. And you must get several glowing letters of recommendation that substantiate all of that. Call it an Internship or a Job, but as long as you demonstrate those qualities and get that glowing hot letter of recommendation, you are fine. ",

All your extracurricular activities including sports, clubs, research, and more will help you, especially if it\u2019s all tailored to a degree in which you want to pursue. However, an internship can help you stand out, as most high school students don\u2019t have one, but there are many other activities that you can pursue instead of an internship. Additionally, it also depends on the field of your future career. If you are a future computer science major, a technical internship would enhance your resume. However, if you are a future education major, being a tutor might enhance your resume more than an internship. ",

If you are a high school graduate you must have filled in your college application with all such extracurricular activities to portray your experience in a very positive manner. That will certainly increase the chances of selection in the best colleges. If you are a fresher looking for a job. An internship is an option as you are new to the market your raw knowledge needs to get polished. For that, choosing an internship is always the best option.

But if you do the opposite like study English for maths exam and maths for English exam it does not help for exams but still you get stronger in the field which is better than doing nothing. Similarly if you have an internship in similar field related to your college application it definitely helps. It not only boosts your resume but also compensates if you are lacking somewhat behind in other requirements like GPA or GRE score.Professors give more attention to your professional experience related to your research field than GPA or extra-curricular activities you have been doing in your college. So my advice will be to go for an internship related to your field if you are getting one. ",

You can get that by working at a McDonald's or by campaigning for a local politician (after all, this is an election year). I was amazed at how much I learned by shelving books at the library for six months or so. I had to limit myself to bringing home only three books each week; but it's amazing what you'll see while you're reshelving books about ancient Greece. (Business has gotten busy, but I imagine I'll be reshelving books again come January.) Whether the title is job or intern or assistant, whether it's paid or unpaid, or in school, anything that shows that you took and affirmative step toward learning and doing more than the minimum required should help your application.
