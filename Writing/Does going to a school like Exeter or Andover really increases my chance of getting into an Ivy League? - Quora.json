            "answer_text": "My kids went to Andover. There are a lot of misconceptions about Andover (and I guess schools like it). I think they mask whether these schools increase your chances of attending an Ivy (or any elite) college. One is that all of the kids are from rich families and parents who attended Ivy schools. This was true at one time. On the contrary, Andover\u2019s endowment rivals that of many liberal arts colleges of its size and it now gives a lot of financial aid. Like Harvard, it can afford to have attend any student it wishes. In fact it is also need-blind in admissions. So Andover has students across the gamut of economic strata (more so than the town\u2019s public HS). And seniors across the economic spectrum are admitted to Ivy schools. Second is the idea that Andover students started in the top 5% of high school students in terms of intelligence or ability. In fact, Andover will go 70% of the way into its applicant pool to pull a student who it wants for any of a number of reasons (faculty children, legacies, athletes, or special talents/stories/promise). Andover students may have learning disabilities and anxiety disorders. Now truly many students won\u2019t apply to Andover, particularly those who have no reason to think they\u2019ll get in. I\u2019d say the abilities of students at Andover are similar to the top 50% of public high school students in an upper middle class community. A lot broader than the top 5% by grades. But the students share a quality of greater potential than their peers that the admissions department looks for. Third is that getting into Andover or attending Andover is a magic ticket to an Ivy or elite college admission. Although 30% of Andover/Exeter students may go to an Ivy school (divided among 8 schools), the vast majority of the rest are spread out over the range of top 50 schools. This is both the students\u2019 choice and admissions decisions (based on transcript, test scores if required, and the balance of the subjective application). Andover has a bottom half of its graduating class, just like everywhere else. The work is difficult and their peers may be more prepared or motivated, or less distracted. And Andover has students with very specific college interests, too, or those who decide to attend their state university (often as honors students) that might not be a top 50 school. The truth is that for students who can excel at Andover (and I presume Exeter), many choices open up for them. This is true whether they are wealthy or not, or whether they started in the top 5% of students or closer to the midpoint. Part of this is that elite colleges understand the preparation these students have had, the competition, rigor (in spite of grade inflation), as well as their drive and academic focus. Part of this is the effect of the preparation, competition and rigor itself on student growth and achievement. Part of this are the special supports and opportunities that are offered to these students (including travel, study of rarer languages like Russian and Greek, and high quality arts experiences). Some kids are no doubt legacies or from families of large donors, but by no means all (some of these kids are among the ones who struggle to excel, too). Some are geniuses or prodigies too (though only a few each year would fit that description). Elite colleges admit a large number of these students year after year because they are reliable performers and likely to be successful after graduating and loyal alumni. If you can be admitted, you probably have qualities that could get you admitted to an Ivy or elite college no matter where you go to high school. But even then I\u2019d suspect that if you can excel your chances at such an admission go up. ",

            "answer_text": "I entered Phillips Exeter Academy eight years ago with a long-term vision for myself \u2014 I thought that the prestigious boarding school that I was about to enter would jump-start my higher education and career. The next stop was Harvard. I was wrong. Take a look at the statistics, and at first glance, it seems like Exeter is a feeder school to Ivies \u2014 it sends such a high percentage of students to Ivies, especially compared to other high schools. Exeter may send 29% of its applicants to Ivy Leagues, but Exeter itself admits students who were in the top 5% of students from their middle school - the cream of the crop. So, those who go to Ivy Leagues are the top percent of the top percent. As described in a previous answer, prestigious colleges and Ivies can\u2019t admit every student who applies from Exeter, even if they are comparable to (or even better than) applicants from other high schools. These colleges place a cap on the number of students they accept from a particular school, and thus, even if 150 incredibly well-qualified students from Exeter apply, Harvard can only accept maybe 15. This is not to say that Exeter does not increase one\u2019s chances of getting into an Ivy League, but it definitely does not make it significantly easier than attending a traditional high school. That being said, having a name like Exeter or Andover on a college application adds instant credibility, regardless of where you\u2019re applying. In fact, it can increase one\u2019s chances of being accepted \u2014 just at a college less selective than Ivies. ",

            "answer_text": "It is easy to misunderstand the relationship between getting into the Ivy League and attending Exeter, Andover, or any other prestigious private school. And that misunderstanding is not entirely accidental \u2014 the schools themselves are complicit in the deception. Let me explain. Private schools are populated by the children of rich, influential people, many of whom attended Ivy League colleges. So when those kids apply to the Ivy League, they get an advantage because they are legacies and/or because their parents have given a lot of money. While students from private schools may be highly intelligent, the power of the parents is a big contributor to the results. The raw number of students admitted to the Ivies is a great marketing tool for private schools. Families want a piece of those results. With people banging down their doors, the schools feel no obligation to be candid. Only when a student is in the school, and approaching admissions time, does it begin to become clear that there are have and have-nots, children of powerful people and mere mortals. The mortals may not have the same chance to get into the Ivies. I know from any number of my college essay students who attend these schools that the college counselor often steers them toward the next rung down the ladder of college prestige. In sum \u2026 Andover, Exeter, etc help. But not as much as you think. So think twice before buying the sales pitch. ",

My 2 brothers and I graduated between 1969 and 1975. We all ended up at Dartmouth, even though we weren\u2019t great students at Exeter. The competition was brutal, and we were no one special. And most did end up at Ivies. Those days are gone. Now it is dumb to attend Exeter if you are only looking for a college acceptance. Concerns for various kinds of diversity on the part of colleges now trumps the rigorous atmosphere at Exeter and it\u2019s peer boarding schools. ",
