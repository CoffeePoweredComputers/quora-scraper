            "answer_text": "Officers generally don't have access to modify reports once they are put into the database software system the department uses to keep track of reports. I really think this is mostly because the database would be a screwed-up mess if you let officers muck around in it. In addition to that, once a report is approved by the boss, various hardcopies generally get made and sent around to all the different places where they're filed: records division, prosecutor's office, etc. This is terribly inefficient in terms of how modern office systems are supposed to work, and it kills a lot of trees, but in the legal world everybody wants their own hard copy. So, we end up with hard copies all over the place, and if an officer wanted to alter a report after it's been approved he would have to chase down all those hard copies and replace them. Of course, an officer can always file a supplemental report to be added to the case file to add any new information or even correct mistakes in the original, but the original will still be there. ",

            "answer_text": "In a limited fashion, yes. Policy in my department is that an officer may modify a police report any time before final review by the Records department. To explain, when an officer writes a report, it is reviewed by a supervisor, who then either approves it or sends it back to the officer for clarification or corrections. After the supervisor approves the report, it is given to Records for a final review. After that review, the report is locked and no more edits are allowed by the system. If an officer needs to make a correction or clarification after supervisor approval but prior to Records approval, the officer is required to notify a supervisor about the correction. If something needs clarification later, then a supplemental narrative is opened and the clarification is made in the supplement, which then goes through the same approval process. Things may work differently in other departments.  (Edit) As clarification, our report system has full audit capabilities and you can see who edited what and when (the system requires unique logins).
