            "answer_text": "Yes, every language has naming conventions. These are just conventions they are not strict rules, they depend on the IDE sometimes, some IDE's just dont care.  For classes: HelloWorld For variables: helloWorld For methods: helloWorld For package/projects: helloworld For constants: HELLO_WORLD Its a good practise to follow naming conventions to evolve as a good software developer who writes clean code. Sun uses PascalCase for project names. Eclipse says better to use all lower cases. I have seen somebody using camelCase. There is no strict rule as far as project names are concerned.  No, they don't conflict with your class names. Make sure you use a different naming convention for classes and projects for your own clarity.

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is okay for your project name to match a class name.I prefer to use what Shiva has called PascalCase for project names. For artifact names (if you are producing a jar to go into an artifact repository for dependency management purposes, like a Maven artifact, then all lowercase (sometimes with hyphenated names) seems to be common. But you can have the artifact name use a different convention than the project name. ",
