These are stories that explain who the user is and how they interact with the product. For example, let\u2019s say you are developing an electronic menu and food ordering system for a restaurant at the airport. You might write a story like: \u201cSandy is at the Loadville Airport for a business trip. She has about one hour before boarding and wants to get lunch. She goes to the Yum Food restaurant where she finds an iPad attached to her table. It displays pictures of some of the restaurant\u2019s best dishes and also has areas for News, Flight Info and Games. Sandy is interested in something healthful and fairly quick. She touches the picture labeled \u2018Fast & Fresh\u2019 and sees a list of seven items, all of which can be served in 10 minutes or less. Along with each item is a picture and calorie count\u2026\u201d Such a scenario is often very useful in helping stakeholders understand what the planned product is and how it will be used. User Stories Developers on the other hand often prefer user stories. These are short and straightforward requirements that are written from the perspective of the user. There are several formats for user stories but a typical story will have 3\u20134 elements: Type of user - who is the user Goal -what does the user want to accomplish Reason - why does the user want to accomplish the goal Criterion (optional) - how will the user know when the goal is accomplished The user story is typically written as a single sentence or two. The format is: As a <type of user> I want to <goal> so I can <reason>. I\u2019ll know I\u2019m done when <criterion>. For example: As a business traveller I want to order a quick and healthy snack so I can eat and maintain my diet before I get on the plane. I\u2019ll know I\u2019m done when the iPad gives me confirmation feedback, indicating my menu choices. Large, xomplex stories are sometime called epics which are then broken down into component stories.

These are a good way to communicate with management. A well-written objective is clear and measurable. Here are some examples: Users will be able to order meals on the first try without error or help from restaurant staff. Users will be able to assess the calorie content of all foods and will be able to determine which are vegetarian, vegan or gluten free. ",

            "answer_text": "Your user needs and user goals will be driven by\u2026 wait for it\u2026. \u2026Your Users! So obviously, the first thing you\u2019ll want to do is come up with some working models of who your users are (personas). Even if you later find your picture is completely off-base, it always helps to first imagine your user as a real, flesh-and-blood human being who is using your product because they have needs and goals. See how quickly we got to needs and goals? That\u2019s because digital products don\u2019t have needs and goals; people do. It\u2019s also why storytelling is such a big part of the UX designer\u2019s craft. Think of the great stories you know. What are the character\u2019s needs and goals? Harry Potter\u2019s goal is to become a great wizard so he can defeat/kill Voldemort. Hermione\u2019s goal is to learn as much about wizardry as one person can so she will be taken seriously by the people (mostly men) around her. Ron Weasley wants to support his friends and accomplish something in the wizarding realm that makes him stand out from his brothers. Every person who will use your product is their own Harry, Hermione or Ron. Think about the details of their lives and the benefit the product will give them and your needs and goals will write themselves. ",
