            "answer_text": "Not really, it depends what information you give them. If you open a link, they will immediately know your IP address because everyone has an internet IP address and you could see it\u2026. if you were using your home WiFi internet, then they can know your home address with your IP address. If you fell for a phishing scam and got tricked and type in your passwords, then it's too late and they have your password, you must immediately change all your passwords right away. Sometimes people get greedy and they fall for phishing scams.. responding to messages like \u201cyou won a free iPad! Please enter your information to claim it!\u201d. Or sometimes they pretend that you got hacked and you must log in to your account to resolve the issue but it's actually a fake login page and they steal your passwords. If you click the link and installed some app on your phone, then that will make you vulnerable to hacking\u2026 but other than that, simply responding to a text won't get you hacked.. it will however confirm that your phone number is active and then they may begin sending you spam messages and calls, so never ever respond to a spam text or email, you are only going to confirm your subscription. There are many people saying \u201ciOS is more secure than Android!\u201d Well newsflash, the iOS software in recent times was proven to have a big security loophole through the keyboard.. any app could basically read your keyboard data and this was the whole reason why TikTok got the blame for it. So just because you have an iPhone, don't assume you're untouchable.. Here it is, read for yourself: Security demo reminds iOS users that any app (or widget) can read the clipboard silently - 9to5Mac iOS 14 reveals clipboard snooping is far worse than we thought ",

            "answer_text": "Ooooh, finally an interesting question! Well, it depends if you are on iOS or Andriod. iOS has a reputation for having great malware* protection and defense (*malicious software, \u201cgetting hacked\u201d in one word), though iOS has had its own glitches. Apple does take iMessage pretty seriously, so you would have to be dealing with some smartass hackers. On the other hand, if you click on the link that they sent you at three in the morning with the caption \u201cgood porn trust me,\u201d you can bet your ass your iPhone is gonna be loaded with Malware. On Andriod, you can probably count on being less safe. Maybe get an antivirus or two, especially with Play Store\u2019s reputation. You can probably (definitely) get hacked just by looking at a text, as long as the hacker is advanced enough and the app you\u2019re using is crappy enough and you\u2019re not using SMS or MMS. Conclusion: Yeah, you can get hacked just by opening a text. But the circumstances under which you would get hacked are so absurd, that there is practically no threat. Hope this helped! ",

Why don't I search and copy and paste, something, as my previous answer, implied.\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03 But sure, I will give credits by pasting the whole link, not bits and pieces from it. Giving full credits to another person for their work. I am writing in this answer, so that next time, when people ask questions, they ask more politely. ( My previous question. \ud83d\ude0a) The best way for people to notice and change their behavior to be better, is to put it out there. If social media can be used for c***py values, why can't we use it for elegant/ great/ honest values like Abraham Lincoln did, correct?? \ud83d\ude0a  Android phones can be hacked with a simple text.
