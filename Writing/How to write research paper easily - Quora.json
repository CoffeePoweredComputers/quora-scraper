            "answer_text": "Select a common topic, which has been already been researched in depthFind ways to differentiate yourself, while you can use similar methodology (e.g. if there are a lot of papers in Europe about unemployment, just use this methodology for US)Question their results through the methodology, the sample, the assumptions. \u201cFormulate your own opinion on the subject\u201dCheck whether your topic is too broad or too small for the word limit. Usually it\u2019s easier to add, but difficult to remove.After reading the abstracts and key points of the papers, formulating your own opinion and approach, create an outline of the paperexpand the outline in a manner where you can see whether it needs expansion or contraction to stay in the word limit.ask your instructor or supervisordon\u2019t rush into conclusions. Let your reasoning, paper and research lead you to the results, not the other way around. It\u2019s more important to have a coherent paper with no results, than a paper that excludes a ton of inconvenient parameters just for the sake of nice results.Both of my dissertation took a distinction and I spent most of the time thinking about what I\u2019m going to write, than writing itself. Knowledge of the subject and what you want to do is the most important thing. ",

            "answer_text": "A quality paper takes a lot of time and energy. There is no way to do it quickly that I am aware of, and I think with that attitude you are going to struggle writing a good paper. You will get faster with practice, but it will always be a long and tedious process if you are doing it right. Here are some tips that will help make you more efficient: Create an outline first to organize the flow of information. If you do not, you will find yourself having rewrite sections of your paper simply to move information around.Write immediately in the correct template. Most times you will have required formatting and will be given a template. Do your writing in that template. Some people have the approach of just writing without worrying about formatting and then applying the proper formatting later. While this will work, it will cost you some time.Learn to deal with writer\u2019s block. If you find yourself with writer\u2019s block, use that time to create wonderful graphics. Very often an awesome graphic will motivate you to write. You can also just write terrible words and fix them later. Often, you will find those words not that bad when you read them later.",

            "answer_text": "The response by Vasileios Bardakos is quite good, but I would add one or two things. The best way to write a research paper easily is to have a good research program, constantly work on your ideas, and write a lot. Like anything else, practice make things go faster and easier. Being a consistent researcher and writer will make producing research easier. That said, if you are working with difficult ideas, even the most productive academic writers I know sometimes have to take time to grapple with ideas, and then edit multiple times to get something satisfactory.
