            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by remove. Those paragraph marks (their proper name is a pilcrow) play an important role in Word. Most of them store all the formatting information for the paragraph they\u2019re in. I say most because that very first paragraph mark that is always there when you create a new document stores all the page setup information as well: size, orientation, margins, and so on. It also contains a section break. As such, it\u2019s very important in Word. So, if by remove you mean delete them, then you have to delete everything in the document. But, of course, you can\u2019t delete that last one. That\u2019s always there.
