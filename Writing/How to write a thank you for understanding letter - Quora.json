            "answer_text": "I agree with Mr. Nelson in his answer. You want to make it personal; you want to make it seem as though you are in person, especially if this is someone you are friends with or this is family or something of that nature. If you are sending this letter to someone in the workplace or in a professional setting or something of that nature, I would be a bit more formal. Something like this: Dear (name of person you are writing to), Thank you for _____________ (example: helping me in my time of need or something similar to this)__________ Your (support/contribution/etc.) meant a lot to me. Yours truly/Sincerely/etc. (Your name) ",
