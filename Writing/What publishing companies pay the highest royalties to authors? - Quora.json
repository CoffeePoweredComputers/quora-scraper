            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I am one of the founders @ Notion Press Publishing. Royalties paid out by traditional publishers usually vary from writer to writer. On an average they pay around 7.5% of the the cover price to the writer as royalty. Traditional publishers also need to sell a large number of copies to even recover the publishing costs for the book, hence they take most of the profits from book sales and provide a small percentage to the author as royalty. There is also a perceived risk for them when they publish a first time author as the chances of making the book a success decrease due to the lack of an author brand. If your main concern is getting maximum profits from book sales while ensuring that you don\u2019t compromise on the quality of publishing,distribution and marketing, then you should consider getting your book published through a self-publishing platform similar to Notion Press. The royalty payout is much higher when compared to traditional publishers. In the case of Notion Press, we offer 100% of the profits from book sales as royalty to the author. Most self-publishing platforms on an average provide between 70%-100% of the profits from book sales to the author. ",

            "answer_text": "Independent publishers pay the highest rates. While Madison Avenue houses are still paying 25-30% for eBooks, indie publishers are typically offering 35% and 50% is not unheard of. For eBooks, the standard practice is to apply the rate to the amount net to the publisher. This means the 30-70% that Amazon, B&N or Apple charges is taken off the top before the royalty is calculated. If you have a backlist title, it is in your interest to place it with a smaller house. For new titles, especially if the author is not well established, the big publishers offer some distinct advantages in terms of their ability to market the book, and the rigor of the acquisition and editing processes. Note that my knowledge only covers the trade segment, and more specifically trade fiction. Academic publishing is a different animal entirely and hopefully someone with experience in that segment will weigh in. ",
