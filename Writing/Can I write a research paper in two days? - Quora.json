            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a very broad question so I\u2019ll answer it by considering the various questions that need to be answered for me to give you a good answer: Are you intending to get this published in a journal or is it a school project?Does your paper involve studying something (i.e. people)?What subject is your paper in (i.e. quantum mechanics or comparative literature)?What\u2019s the projected length of the research paper?Generally speaking, unless you\u2019re writing a short (< 5 pages) research paper for a course, the answer will be no. Keep in mind that writing a research paper is quite different than writing a normal document/assignment since you\u2019ll often have to do literature review, sources, come up with a thesis, etc. ",
