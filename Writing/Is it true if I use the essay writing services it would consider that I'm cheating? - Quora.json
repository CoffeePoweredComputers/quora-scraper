            "answer_text": "Dear M Anonymouse, Yes, any teacher or administration would label you a CHEATER if you were to use an essay writing service. It is also called plagiarism, since you would be turning in someone else\u2019s work and claiming you wrote it. (Look up \u201cplagiarism\u201d; it is not a good thing.) Expect one or all of the following repercussions for ethics violations such as this: Failing grade (zero) on the assignmentRequirement to rewrite the assignment under the teacher\u2019s watchful eye so you cannot cheatFailing grade for the courseRemoval from the institutionA stain on your permanent record that will follow you around for life (being labeled a cheat and/or plagiarist is not a compliment)Lack of trust in you as a personI know someone who spent at least five years doing excellent primary research on a complicated scientific topic, but she was kicked out of her PhD program because she copied a couple of pages of someone else\u2019s work into her otherwise well-researched doctoral dissertation (this is basically what you would be doing if you were to turn in work written for you by an essay writing service \u2014 or even by a helpful friend). She modified words throughout the two pages, but inserting synonyms did not remove the fact that she copied those pages from someone else. Her plagiarism was detected by special plagiarism-detecting software schools use these days, and she was kicked out of the university. This was in Berlin, Germany, and it would be standard operating procedures around the world. The purpose of the assignment is not to give the teacher a stack of clever essays for her reading enjoyment. No, dear one, the purpose is to assess your ability to write coherently, think analytically, draw proper conclusions, and act on any feedback your instructor provides so you can continue to improve your writing. Pro Tip #1: Almost every high-paying job requires the ability to write clearly, even if all you ever write is emails to your manager. Now is the time, while you are in school, to hone those writing skills. Ask for help from you teacher or in-school writing lab. Once you are out in the wild (that is, in the real world at a job), will you then have to hire an essay writing service to write your weekly report or emails because you never learned how to write? Hmm \u2026 PRO TIP #1: Do your own work! TRUE STORY: In Germany, at least two older politicians whose doctoral dissertations were written decades ago were recently discovered to have plagiarized their PhD theses. They were then forced to resign from their high-level positions in the government, even though their plagiarism had nothing to do with their current jobs. CHEATING CAN FOLLOW YOU FOREVER, and it\u2019s a stain on your family\u2019s honor. \u2014Sarah M., 17 December 2018 (updated 26 August 2019) \u2014 I write my own words  MERGED INTO: Is it considered cheating when using essay writing services online? ORIGINAL QUESTION: Is it true if I use the essay writing services it would consider that I'm cheating? ",
