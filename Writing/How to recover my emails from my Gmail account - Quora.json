The Gmail call on states to be prepared with a \"robust\" testing tools as well as contact tracing capabilities, before reopening.   \"Robust\" is open to interpretation - the guidelines prioritise healthcare workers, but also recommend having the ability to test all people showing symptoms. Experts at Harvard University have said 900,000 tests a day are needed in the US to reopen the economy. That's about 275 tests per 100,000 people per day - only nine states are around this level of testing currently.

YouTube Dr Fauci says he is concerned that if some areas \"jump over those various checkpoints and dw.de prematurely open up without having the capability to be able to respond effectively and efficiently\" the US could \"start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks\". BBC - Homepage President Trump has promised to work with state governors to expand testing, and says he's \"confident that we have enough testing to begin reopening and the reopening process\".

My worry is that we aren't getting the infrastructure right now while we have a little breathing room.\" Thanks ",
