(Which is actually a pretty decent book about writing, even though I\u2019m not a big fan of his writing.) I could probably give a long list of examples, although sometimes it\u2019s difficult to tell the difference between laziness and utter lack of talent. (I think of 50 Shades of Grey, which was almost certainly the worst writing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life in a best-selling book. Proof that there is no accounting for taste! And probably a great example of laziness combined with a lack of talent.) ",
