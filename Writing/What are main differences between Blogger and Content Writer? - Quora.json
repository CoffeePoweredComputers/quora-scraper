            "answer_text": "There is a clear difference between the two, bloggers writes for search engines while content marketer write for humans(potential customers), though content marketer and blogger might use the same medium of communication. Yea, I could say this because I have the experience of both, 5 years ago I was just a blogger and my aim is just to write optimized contents that will drive me traffic from search engine and then get me money through Adsense and the likes. There was no product or service, so why will I care about you? But few years ago when I truly understood the true power of content and how you can generate more sales with a post on second page of Google than one on the first page. When I was still a blogger, the first thing I do when I want to write was to write down the keywords I want the post to rank for, but now as a content marketer, the first thing is to get my buyer persona. I now care about people (customers), am keen on creating a connection with them with what I write. As a business owner where is your revenue coming from? Adesnse or from your customers? So who would you care to write for search engines or your customers??? ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes they are the samething. A content writer usually applies to someone doing it for a job. Getting paid to write content for other people's businesses. A blogger usually refers to someone writing content for themselves. As the business and blogosphere begin to blur, we are seeing a cross over of people being paid to blog for their employers and private individuals start news aggregated sites. Basically, they are the same mindset. People just use different terms. Blogging may still lean a little more toward personal experiences; even though there is a particular theme each blog has. Don't stress out on defining terms. Thanks for reading, Kevin ",
