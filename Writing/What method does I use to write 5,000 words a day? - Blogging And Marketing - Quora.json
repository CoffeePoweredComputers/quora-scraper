Here how it works; On the very first day write 500 words.Every day, double the number of words you write.On the 5th day, you will achieve your 5,000 words a day mark.Stick with the ROUTINE.Let me tell you my story; When I started my own blog, most of the articles were just 300 to 400 words. If you are writing online then you might know that you can\u2019t get ranked on Google with a post that has only 300\u2013400 words. But, the thing to learn here is that \u201cTo Write\u201d But now, I can easily write 3,000 to 5,000 words articles in a blog post.

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re normally used to writing, for example, 1,000 words a day, you may want to consider working up to 5,000 gradually instead of tackling it all at once. It\u2019s kind of like running. A lot of people who want to start running set really high and unrealistic goals, such as \u201cI\u2019m going to run 5 miles a day.\u201d So on their first attempt, they find that it\u2019s impossible to run more than 1 mile, and they end up frustrated and more likely to quit. To get used to writing a lot, you can practice by writing on platforms like this one. That way you can improve your speed in both writing and thinking ",

            "answer_text": "I personally would set a target to sit down one a day to write, starting with a minimum of 500 words. Make sure you have access to a variety of writing prompts for the days when the blank page seems to be winning, sometimes there is nothing worse than a blank page. Then you can increase the minimum number of words that you are writing ever 3 days by 100 words, but only use these as a minimum, if you are in the zone and really feeling the groove, with the words flowing onto the page like a majestic swan from you fingertips, then go with it until you feel like you want to stop. Make sure you celebrate the wins. Even if you don\u2019t meet your target, celebrate something about the work you have done. If you don\u2019t make your target one day, that\u2019s fine. Forgive yourself and remember that tomorrow is a new day to try again. I hope this helps. ",
