            "answer_text": "Nowadays, email has become the primary mode of communication in business. 90% of the conversation happens over emails so it is important that your email contains the right content and sounds right to the recipient. Let us first break down the components of an email and then find the points that needs to be taken care of while drafting an email. Subject Line: This is more like the title for a book, it should be concise and relevant. For example, if you are sending a presentation, it is important that you add the word presentation and its title in the subject line. If you are replying or forwarding an email, you can leave the subject line as is.Signature: If the person knows you personally then you wouldn\u2019t require this but in most cases, your email signature is important for the reader to understand who you are, your email must have the below components,Font: Use the same or similar font as in your body. The size may vary a bit.Name: Use your full name and not just the first nameOrder: Name, Title, Organization & Contact InformationSalutation: Hi, Hello or Dear are the only 3 permissible ones, If you are using Dear, then remember to include the person\u2019s name after is (Eg: Dear Arun / Dear Mr.Venkatraman)There are a few more things that you need to keep in mind while writing an email, Avoid Humor, if it doesn\u2019t translate well, you become a laughing stock at their office and you won\u2019t even know about it.Be careful about punctuation. A wrong and one missed, can change the meaning completelyDo not hit the send button without proofreading the email.I think I have covered most of the important components of an email. Wish you all the very best. ",

            "answer_text": "There are some tips for writing emails at work .(These tips are for only professional work) Understand the difference between formal and informal english. They differ in choice of words, grammatical structures.and usage of words.Avoid contractions. Do not use words like doesn't, can't, don't. Instead of these use does not, cannot, do not.Try to avoid first and second person. Using \u2018We\u2019 instead of \u2018I\u2019 shows non-personal,yet directive nature of the sentence.Avoid stage directions. Instead of \u2018I am writing to ask you\u2019, \u2018this is to inform you \u2019 sounds better.Avoid clich\u00e9s. Do not overuse the words which hide the main meaning of the particular sentence.Do not make an e-mail longer than it needs to be.Use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation.Use proper structure and layout.Do not write in CAPITALS.Use of active voice is more preferable.Try not to use abbreviations such as BTW(by the way ) , TYSM(thank you so much ) , LOL(laugh out loud) etc.Proofread.Focus on clear message, helping the reader to prioritize.For subject take a moment to write a subject line that accurately describes the content.",
