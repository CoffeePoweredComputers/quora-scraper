            "answer_text": "Soak your foot, or whatever body part in very hot water, but don\u2019t burn yourself, please! We used to use Epson Salts or salt. Soak for 20 minutes, and the optimum is to do it every 2 hours, or as often as you can. This will soften the skin, so the splinter can work its way to the surface. Keep it bandaged, and treated with antibiotic cream, like Neosporin. After about 3 days, it will get infected, which is the body\u2019s way of bringing it to the surface. Then you can squeeze it out or pick it out with a sterilized sewing needle. We used to burn the needle with a candle until it was red hot, and then let it cool down. Sometimes the splinter goes deep, and you may have to dig down to get it out. If that is the case, squeeze out the fresh blood, put alcohol or peroxide on it, and rebandage it. Growing up with OLD hardwood floors, and going mostly barefoot, we were subject to getting splinters. We would get wood splinters, cactus splinters, thorns, and bee stings. This is how we treated them. There is only one time I had to see a doctor about a splinter. It was a pretty long splinter in my foot. If your nearby lymph glands swell, or you get a fever, you should see a doctor. We were poor, and couldn\u2019t afford to see a doctor for a relatively small matter, like a splinter. Let me know if this works for you. I know I am going to get a lot of feedback about this answer! If you can afford it, go to a doctor. That is what everyone will say. ",

            "answer_text": "As long as it's not showing signs of infection, then you're golden. Your body will naturally expel most foreign objects on its own eventually. To speed that up, though, you can go to your local drug store and ask for some ichthammol  (pronounced ick-tha-mall in case you have to ask) ointment.  last year I was absentmindedly placing some things into a low cabinet at work and my finger skidded along the 2x4 frame and got a wood sliver about 1 cm wide, 1 mm thick, and two cm long jammed under my cuticle so far I couldn't see it no matter how far I dug. I ended up just thinking that maybe nothing ended up staying in there. It just kept getting more and more swollen. Anyways, I kept trying to dig it out, but the pain kept me from making progress (it was pretty far in and my finger was starting to get infected). Did some research, heard ichthammol helped, applied some twice daily and within 36 hours I tried gently pressing above the knuckle and the piece of wood shot out. I was amazed at how horrifyingly large it was. Went from the start of my cuticle to mid-way up the first knuckle. Thinking about it still sends shivers up my spine. Anyways, ichthammol is magical stuff and ever since I keep a tube in both my home and travel first aid kits. ",

If it\u2019s a small splinter in areas like hand/feet, however, it usually works its way out within a week or two, so if no erythema (redness), swelling, pain, purulence (pus), you should be fine. If it\u2019s in more sensitive areas, best to either remove it (using sterilised needles/tweezers) yourself if possible, if not, consult your local physician. ",
