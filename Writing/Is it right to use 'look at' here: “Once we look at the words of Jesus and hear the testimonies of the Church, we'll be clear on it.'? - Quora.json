            "answer_text": "In the context of reading something, most people would say, \u201creading the words\u201d or \u201clooking at the words\u201d interchangeably. The latter is a euphemistic form of saying reading the words; it does not mean you are literally only look at the words and not reading them. However, depending on the whole context, it might be more appropriate to say, \u201cReading the words\u201d of Jesus, as opposed to \u201cHearing the words.\u201d The apostles heard the words; congregants in a church hear the words as they\u2019re read by a lector. You, with your Bible, are reading the words. So, in short, \u201clooking at\u201d is usually OK, but your teachers may have another reason to say \u201creading,\u201d beyond their own personal preferences. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cLook at the words\u201d is a shade different from \u201clook at the books\u201d, probably because if you\u2019re literate you can\u2019t look at a word without reading it. \u201cLook at the books\u201d could mean something along the lines of \u201csee all those books on the shelves\u201d with no suggestion that you\u2019re actually going to read the books; \u201clook at the words\u201d implies that you\u2019ll pick up at least a general idea of what the words say. Because of this difference in meaning, I\u2019d say that your sample sentence is correct. ",
