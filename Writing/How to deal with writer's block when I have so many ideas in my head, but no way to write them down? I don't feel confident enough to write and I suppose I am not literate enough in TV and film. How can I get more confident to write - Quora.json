            "answer_text": "Advice that tells you to just \u2018sit down and write\u2019 is as useless as telling a person with a broken leg to just \u2018get up and walk\u2019.  Not being able to come up with ideas is often a source of writer\u2019s block. But equally, and less talked about, is that block can be caused by having too many ideas. This isn\u2019t the same as being frozen by the potential of infinite creativity, as it first seems; it\u2019s about not having the experience or methods necessary to handle a multitude of ideas. It's something you can overcome. Roy Chua, a creativity researcher at the Harvard Business School, wrote a paper on exactly this theory. In his impressively titled (*deep breath*) \u2018Creativity as a Matter of Choice: Prior Experience and Task Instruction as Boundary Conditions for the Positive Effect of Choice on Creativity\u2019, Chua explores this idea. He says: \u2018When given too many options, you can easily be overwhelmed by the number of possibilities. That can be paralyzing, especially if you don\u2019t have the relevant experience to sift through the maze of options. If you\u2019re not experienced enough to discern and choose among the vast possibilities conferred by a large choice set of initial materials, it might actually be better to start small, i.e., with a smaller and more manageable set of materials. I think the key lesson for writers is that we\u2019re often thinking of so-called writer\u2019s block as the lack of ideas \u2013 but my research suggests that too many ideas could also stop a writer dead in his or her tracks.\u2019 Chua suggests that you may be suffering from this kind of block if you find that you keep comparing your options and still have no idea which is better. He suggests two methods for dealing with this: Firstly, progressive elimination, which is where you drop the least promising ideas (instead of searching for the most promising ideas) until you are able to narrow down your options.  Secondly, progressive expansion, which is where you pick a few ideas that jump out at you and use them as a starting point to construct your writing before going back to the pool and picking out a few more \u2013 eventually, the most fruitful ideas will reveal themselves through your exploration, and you can drop the weaker ones.  Eventually, you\u2019ll start to develop an instinct for your best ideas. And if not, it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 as long as you know how to recognise and deal with this cause of block. ",

            "answer_text": "Writing has very little to do with \"ideas\" and nothing to do with confidence.  Get out a sheet of paper (or start up a text editor) and write. If your idea is a mystery about a wife who kills her husband by rubbing contact poison on his TV remote control, start describing the home they live in. Or her haircut. Or what he does while he's at work.  Maybe none of this stuff will make it into your script, but that doesn't matter. You're writing what you're currently able to write, and exploring your fictional world. And the secret of writing is writing. Most writers write many pages of prose they don't use for each page that winds up in their finished manuscripts.   I've never met a confident writer. Writers don't start from a place of confidence. They write their way to confidence. They sit down and write garbage, knowing it will be garbage and that they'll probably throw it out. They keep doing this until there are a few gems\u2014sentences here and there, phrases\u2014buried in the garbage, and then they keep going until there gem-to-garbage ratio is acceptable. At which point they feel confidence. Or they don't. Point is, they've written something.  Then they start all over with the next piece, feeling no confidence but writing their way to confidence.  To be a writer is to sit down at one\u2019s desk in the chill portion of every day, and to write; not waiting for the little jet of the blue flame of genius to start from the breastbone \u2013 just plain going at it, in pain and delight. To be a writer is to throw away a great deal, not to be satisfied, to type again, and then again, and once more, and over and over\u2026 \u2014 John Hersey  Writer's block is a phony, made up, BS excuse for not doing your work.  \u2014 Jerry Seinfeld  A professional writer is an amateur who didn\u2019t quit. \u2014 Richard Bach  I rewrote the ending of \u2018Farewell to Arms\u2019 39 times before I was satisfied. \u2014 Ernest Hemingway  ... The ego is the enemy of the imagination. Anything that you think about writing when you're not writing, is a product of the ego and is absolutely wrong. One hundred percent, all the time, wrong. And if take a step back and think how much time you spend trying to purify yourself in order to get ready to write, that's like 95% of the time. And the reason for that is the ego has a stake in perpetuating the behavior that you've already engaged in. We do not think our way to right action; we act our way to right thinking.  So what I do is I start writing. If I think about my writing before I start to write, what I'm really doing is justifying not writing, because ... I'm not writing. ... I'm going to find a way to keep not writing. So what I say is I don't have the idea yet; it's not fully realized yet... Not only that: I don't have pencils; my pencils are not sharpened; I don't have the right notebook. ... Whoa! Eleven-forty five already. Time for lunch. ... When you think about exercising, what you invariably say to yourself is, \"You know, I'm too fat. What's the point? I'm too old; I'm too fat; I'm too old; I'm too slow; I'm too this; I'm too that...\" And all you're doing is justifying the fact that you're not exercising.  \u2014 TV Writer David Milch, http://biblioklept.org/2011/04/14/the-ego-is-the-enemy-of-imagination-david-milch-on-writing/  Discipline allows magic. To be a writer is to be the very best of assassins. You do not sit down and write every day to force the Muse to show up. You get into the habit of writing every day so that when she shows up, you have the maximum chance of catching her, bashing her on the head, and squeezing every last drop out of that bitch.  \u2015 Lili St. Crow  Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better. \u2014 Samuel Beckett  I deal with writer\u2019s block by lowering my expectations. I think the trouble starts when you sit down to write and imagine that you will achieve something magical and magnificent\u2014and when you don\u2019t, panic sets in. The solution is never to sit down and imagine that you will achieve something magical and magnificent. I write a little bit, almost every day, and if it results in two or three or (on a good day) four good paragraphs, I consider myself a lucky man. Never try to be the hare. All hail the tortoise.  \u2015 Malcolm Gladwell  If I waited till I felt like writing, I\u2019d never write at all. \u2014 Anne Tyler  Keep writing, because not only does practice improve skill, it gives you more chances to score on the market. I did that for eight years before making my first sale. \u2014 Piers Anthony  What I try to do is write. I may write for two weeks \u2018the cat sat on the mat, that is that, not a rat.\u2019 And it might be just the most boring and awful stuff. But I try. When I\u2019m writing, I write. And then it\u2019s as if the muse is convinced that I\u2019m serious and says, \u2018Okay. Okay. I\u2019ll come.\u2019  \u2014 Maya Angelou  Every writer I know has trouble writing. \u2014 Joseph Heller  The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.  \u2014 Mark Twain  The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know what will happen next. If you do that every day \u2026 you will never be stuck. Always stop while you are going good and don\u2019t think about it or worry about it until you start to write the next day. That way your subconscious will work on it all the time. But if you think about it consciously or worry about it you will kill it and your brain will be tired before you start.  \u2014 Ernest Hemingway [I'd been doing this for years before I read this Hemingway quote. I usually quit writing mid-sentence, when the end of that sentence is obvious from context, such as \"He put on his coat, left his apartment, and went to the ...\" The next day, I can instantly pick up where I left off and feel a sense of accomplishment and momentum.]  \u201cMany years ago, I met John Steinbeck at a party in Sag Harbor, and told him that I had writer\u2019s block. And he said something which I\u2019ve always remembered, and which works. He said, \u201cPretend that you\u2019re writing not to your editor or to an audience or to a readership, but to someone close, like your sister, or your mother, or someone that you like.\u201d And at the time I was enamored of Jean Seberg, the actress, and I had to write an article about taking Marianne Moore to a baseball game, and I started it off, \u201cDear Jean . . . ,\u201d and wrote this piece with some ease, I must say. And to my astonishment that\u2019s the way it appeared in Harper\u2019s Magazine. \u201cDear Jean . . .\u201d Which surprised her, I think, and me, and very likely Marianne Moore.\u201d  \u2014 George Plimpton [This is another technique I've used for years, and I was happily surprised to come across the Plimpton quote. The thing is, we're social animals, and we're used to talking and writing to specific people, not \"the masses.\" So sometimes, when I'm having a hard time writing, I put aside my text editor and start a letter in gmail. I address it to my mom, my best friend, or whoever. I write, \"Dear _____, I'm having trouble writing about _____, but I thought you might find it interesting. You see, what happened was...\" I never send these emails. I just copy them and paste them into my text editor. But just the ritual of writing to a specific person frees me.]  You can\u2019t say, I won\u2019t write today because that excuse will extend into several days, then several months, then you are not a writer anymore, just someone who dreams about being a writer. \u2014 Dorothy C. Fontana  Writer\u2019s block\u2026a lot of howling nonsense would be avoided if, in every sentence containing the word WRITER, that word was taken out and the word PLUMBER substituted; and the result examined for the sense it makes. Do plumbers get plumber\u2019s block? What would you think of a plumber who used that as an excuse not to do any work that day? The fact is that writing is hard work, and sometimes you don\u2019t want to do it, and you can\u2019t think of what to write next, and you\u2019re fed up with the whole damn business. Do you think plumbers don\u2019t feel like that about their work from time to time? Of course there will be days when the stuff is not flowing freely. What you do then is MAKE IT UP. I like the reply of the composer Shostakovich to a student who complained that he couldn\u2019t find a theme for his second movement. \u201cNever mind the theme! Just write the movement!\u201d he said. Writer\u2019s block is a condition that affects amateurs and people who aren\u2019t serious about writing. So is the opposite, namely inspiration, which amateurs are also very fond of. Putting it another way: a professional writer is someone who writes just as well when they\u2019re not inspired as when they are. \u2014 Philip Pullman ",
