            "answer_text": "There are roughly three tiers of professional screenwriters in the film and television industry. Those within each have a different general pay scale. 1. One Percenters These are the Aaron Sorkins, David Koepps, Terry Rossios, Joss Whedons, Simon Kindbergs, and so many more. They are the elite. The ones the studios go to with their hottest properties and franchises. If they\u2019re not making the six-figure uncredited rewrite deals, they\u2019re making the seven-figure big assignments. Needless to say, they\u2019re not grinding it out as much as the rest. 2. White Collar Screenwriters These are the screenwriters that are getting the middle of the line jobs. They\u2019ve had some hits \u2014 and some misses \u2014 but they keep getting hired. They\u2019re making those high five-figure assignments that are just on the cusp of six-figure paychecks, or they\u2019re making those low six-figure deals \u2014 depending on the contract and how the payout is structured (it\u2019s not all guaranteed money). They\u2019re working. They\u2019re pitching. Maybe they\u2019re dancing between film and television assignments, writing more mid-level features, or living somewhat comfortably in between more substantial paychecks spread out year to year. It may be a grind for some of them as they battle it out to attain those coveted assignments, but it\u2019s a more comfortable grind to be sure. 3. Blue Collar Screenwriters These are the screenwriters that have managed to break through that barrier most novice screenwriters feel is impenetrable. They\u2019ve gotten some meetings. They\u2019ve likely attained representation. They\u2019ve had some options and maybe some paid assignments that were never produced \u2014 usually mid to low five-figure deals. Some have even had some produced work with a name cast. However, the jobs are few and far between, and the paychecks are nowhere near that of \u201cwhite collar\u201d screenwriters. One year might give them hope until they see another year, or two, or three go by without any deals. They\u2019re not quitting their day jobs. They\u2019re not going all in. They grind away trying to keep any spark they had going. And then there\u2019s the rest. The novice screenwriters that are still pounding on that seemingly impenetrable barrier, awaiting any scraps \u2014 query email replies, phone calls, contest wins, anyone in the business willing to read their script(s), etc. It\u2019s often a strong misconception that most screenwriters sell screenplays for millions of dollars. We\u2019ve all read the stories of Shane Black selling The Long Kiss Goodnight for $4 million, Joe Eszterhas selling Basic Instinct for $3 million, Tom Shulman and Sally Robinson selling Medicine Man for $3 million, etc. And sure, in the 2000s, before the financial crisis hit, we saw David Koepp selling Panic Room for $4 million, Terry Rossio and Bill Marsilli selling D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu for $5 million, Will Ferrell and Adam McKay selling Talladega Nights for $4 million, and Evan Daugherty selling Snow White and the Huntsman for $3.2 million. Those are lottery-type numbers to behold. Even the more \u201crun-of-the-mill\u201d deals that are featured in the trades on a more regular basis are awe-inspiring to most screenwriters. $400,000 against $200,000 (meaning that the writer gets $200,000 first and another $200,000 if the film gets greenlit) or any variant as far as six-figure deals go. That\u2019s a lot of money. Screenwriters dream of getting that six or seven-figure check handed to them. First and foremost, to debunk this misconception, in many cases yes, those deals are very similar to the lottery \u2014 but not as one would hope. Lottery winners are few and far between, considering the population of the world. It would be silly for anyone to invest their time and money expecting to win the lottery, right? The same could be said for screenwriters expecting to join the six or seven-figure club. During the screenwriting boom of the 1990s, those high six to seven-figure deals happened more often than they do now. Studios and producers also optioned screenplays from screenwriters, which meant that a certain price would be paid to allow the studio or producer to have exclusive rights to try and develop, package, and either sell or green light (in the studio\u2019s case) the script. Screenwriters would often receive $5,000 to $10,000 for such option deals. However, since the financial crisis of 2008, such options are few and far between. Studios and production companies are much more frugal with their spending in the development phase. And on that note, selling pitches with no screenplay just doesn\u2019t happen anymore unless you are a successful and proven producer, director, showrunner, or screenwriter (to a lesser degree). Let\u2019s talk about those six-figure deals (and know that this applies to both seven-figure deals and as low as five-figure deals). $200,000 doesn\u2019t come in a single paycheck unless you are a high profile screenwriter that can demand such. Instead, it\u2019s separated into various installments. So a screenwriter that is lucky enough to sign a $400,000 against $200,000 deal isn\u2019t getting just one check-in hope of a second. Many elements come into play thanks to very detailed contracts written by entertainment lawyers and aided by Guild regulations. Instead, that screenwriter might get $50,000 upfront for what the powers that be consider a first draft. Now $50,000 is a lot of money to be sure, however, you need to take into account the ten percent an agent takes, the five percent (or more) an entertainment lawyer takes for facilitating the contract on the writer\u2019s behalf, and then what the government takes as well. At this stage, perhaps the writer has a manager now too. That\u2019s advisable but also costs another ten percent. So before taxes, we\u2019re looking at a possible take-home of $35,000. Taxes may account for almost half of that, leaving the screenwriter with $17,000 give or take. Not much given the big numbers of the contract, right? \u201cBut hey, that\u2019s just the first check.\u201d Well, it depends. Most contracts dictate that after the first initial payment, every other possible payment after that is for a draft of the script, meaning that for each further draft written (after notes are given by development executives, producers, directors, and sometimes talent), another payment is offered. Here\u2019s the rub. That screenwriter can be replaced at any time. So even if they write a second draft, get that second payment, have all of those deductions taken away from that amount, the powers that be could decide that maybe the script they bought needs a new writer. The payments then stop there. No $200,000. Now this is the broadest of examples with very general numbers for the purpose of making a point, however, it rings true all too often in big contracts, as well as smaller ones, because there are different levels of screenwriters. Those six and seven-figure deals all too often represent just the top one percent of working screenwriters in the industry. A majority of the working screenwriters out there are making just five-figure deals, the most successful of which are barely scraping that six-figure barrier. Now imagine the same deductions taken away for a mid to high five-figure deal. In short, selling a script or being hired to write one is sadly not equivalent to winning the lottery. Even selling a spec script \u2014 spec meaning it\u2019s written under speculation that it will be sold to someone \u2014 isn\u2019t a normal occurrence these days. Most of the time, such scripts are used as calling cards to get assignments for scripts that are already actively in development within studios and production companies. In those case, the pay and contract details listed above are generally the same, depending upon the stature of the screenwriter. Writers with more credits under their belt will get paid more. Others won\u2019t. And it also depends on if the writer is a guild member or not. Guild members are protected (or sometimes restrained) from the guild contracts with studios. Those contracts offer certain payment tops and bottoms, as well as certain payout periods. But again, remember that with every draft, that writer can be replaced.   This is just a broad and generalized view of what screenwriters really get paid for a feature film script, whether it be a spec script or an assignment. There are so many variances to behold. Screenwriters writing independent films outside of the Hollywood system are usually not guild members, thus they can be paid anywhere from nothing to just four or low five-figure deals. There are also many production companies making movies, even with name actors \u2014 usually B or C list or below \u2014 that are not affected by the guild restrictions as their projects are non-guild signatory productions. Furthermore, screenwriters don\u2019t share the same type of residuals that actors in Hollywood attain through guild contract regulations. There are residuals due to the screenwriter of any given guild signatory production, but they all too often don\u2019t amount to much for most projects and the breakdowns and percentages are pretty specific overall. They can be found here. Overall, becoming a paid screenwriter is certainly not the lottery 99% of the time. While screenwriters will continue to get to a level of comfort doing something they love, all too often those that will make it \u2014 most don\u2019t \u2014 will have to pay their dues and grind away. Such is the life of a screenwriter. This answer was adapted from an article I wrote at ScreenCraft.

            "answer_text": "That really depends. A fast action script would go in the upper bracket because its much harder to write and in full production. If that is a benchmark you keep coming down the scale. One with lots of dialogue, visual impact, locations, new sets, suggested A listers, travel, transport, breaks, etc.etc will be just about the same as the top bracket ones. Ones with fewer character and less plotting and chopping and changing will come next. Just below may come the simpler dialogues ones with one or two characters but trickier plots and a level of difficulty to produce. Also sci-fi and abstract ones will come here. Where intense imagination is required it will sit here. Low budgets ones may be here but any script not in the hands of a good director and low budget will be down here. The producer will see all of this when he/she sits with his/her production team and Line producers. The script leads the production and the production is based on the various aspects which the scriptwriter knows will draw in the market in. All scripts have variables. My own first feature film is low budget but high art with lesser characters and much re-designed plots from the novels. The whole idea was to keep the cost down and learn the ropes of film-making. Attracting finance begins with the script. and begins to mushroom from there. I really cannot put a price down for the script. Every director sees the script in a different way. The novelist/ scriptwriter sees it one way and the novelist who wrote the book sees it the best way possible. The nicest thing about it is that if the novelist writes the script, produces the movie and directs it there can be nothing more original than that combination. Its one way and the best way. So script pricing can vary from step to step. ",
