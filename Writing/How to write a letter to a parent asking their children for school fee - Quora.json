            "answer_text": "Are you the director of the school? Or have you been assigned this job? The director should know the answer to this question. This is what I would do. First, determine who is going to sign the letter. Then you must either write AS that person OR introduce yourself and explain that you are writing FOR that person. You do not need to explain why. Second, I would come right out and say, \u201cI am asking that you send or bring in [the amount in your currency] for [the child\u2019s name] tuition for [state the period of time it covers] by [a date].\u201d Third, I would describe what the fee is spent on (salaries, utilities, loans for equipment and the building, etc.). \u201cThis money is used to covers these costs and we cannot provide an education without them.\u201d If you offer financial arrangements (such as monthly payments) I would mention it here. Also include who to set those up with and how that person can be reached. Usually fees are paid when a child is enrolled. This leads me to believe these fees are late. If so, you need to say something about this and what will happen if the fees aren\u2019t paid by a certain date. Basically, this is a business letter. They are much more cut and dry than a personal letter. You state the purpose and get to the point. You provide information. You state consequences. You are civil but don\u2019t dance around the purpose of your letter. At least in the US that is how they are done. If in your country it is standard to include a lot of politenesses then do that. Good luck! ",
