That said, there are some simple things you can try, and see if they work for you: Go to a public place (shopping mall, park, sports event, etc.) and watch people. Listen to how they talk. Notice what they\u2019re saying\u2014some of it will be pretty mundane because you\u2019re lacking context, but some will likely catch your ear, and make you wonder\u2026what were they talking about? What happened next? Voila\u2014a ready-made writing prompt. If listening isn\u2019t your thing so much, watch how people interact. notice their clothing. What does it say about them?

I haven\u2019t suggested any because inspiration is really all around you all the time. You just have to learn to pay attention, and you\u2019ll start seeing it everywhere. The suggestions I\u2019ve given you will help you do just that. There\u2019s nothing wrong with using apps or books, but I think it\u2019s better to use the real world as a prompt-on-demand than to become dependent on outside sources. Good luck! ",
