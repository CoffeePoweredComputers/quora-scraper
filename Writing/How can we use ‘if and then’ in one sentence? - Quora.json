            "answer_text": "In the complex sentence, if we have a main clause and one adverb clause of condition, we can use the conjunction if to introduce the subordinate clause of condition, but we cannot use then in the beginning of main clause, For example, it will be wrong to say : If you work hard, then you will succeed. The correct sentence is : If you work hard, you will succeed. A complex sentence can have more possibilities where then can also be used. Let\u2019s take this sentence : If you work hard, you will succeed but then you have to keep on working hard. I don\u2019t think \u2018if and then\u2019 can be used together. I know \u2018if and when\u2019 can be used together to depict uncertainty. For example : If and when I meet her again, I don\u2019t how will I react. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it could be used in the form of conditionals , Example : If water is heated at 100 degree celcius , it boilsAlternatively even this one If water is heated at 100 degree celcius, then it boils. Also it could be used to emphasize on things like giving someone something if they fulfill their demand Example If you complete your work ,then you can play outside. The carrot and the stick rule I guess ! Hope this helps ! ",
