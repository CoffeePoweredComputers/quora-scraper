            "answer_text": "Both are correct. \u201cC'est la mienne/le mien\u201d is descriptive and somewhat carries an implication that the object has belonged to you for a while. For example \u201c- C'est la voiture de ta m\u00e8re ? - Non, c'est la mienne.\u201d (Is it your mother's car? No, it's mine) \u201cC'est \u00e0 moi\u201d is more informal and also more emotional (typically showing pride, or greed). Also, it is often use to appropriate something whose owner is not clear. You could imagine it being used by kids fighting over a toy, robbers fighting over the loot, or a billionaire bragging in front of his palace and 20 luxury cars (\u201cTout \u00e7a, c'est \u00e0 moi !\u201d). But really, I'm deliberately highlighting the specific cases where they are not really interchangeable to show the nuance. For most purposes, they are interchangeable. ",

            "answer_text": "To add a footnote to the nice responses already given, \u201cC'est la mienne\u201d uses the possessive pronoun mien/mienne and so gives a sense of this one is mine (\u2026but that one is yours, \u201cc'est la tienne\u201d etc). \u201cC'est \u00e0 moi\u201d as someone pointed out already can sound awfully egotistical, as the grammar itself suggests: it's all about me, less about the object. The expression uses the tonic or stress pronoun \u201cmoi\u201d. This thing belongs to me, is \u201cfor\u201d me, is all mine. There's no hint that it could be yours or that there's another one like it that is yours. ",
