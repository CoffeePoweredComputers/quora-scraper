            "answer_text": "Unless you have a title that was signed over to your name you likely are going to at least be detained until the police straighten the situation out. In general police are not going to care unless the vehicle has been reported stolen by someone, and if you happen to get pulled over randomly, no theft report and the officer asks you about it then the bill of sale will likely cover you for that type of situation. If someone did call it in stolen then you could end up with some issues you will have to resolve. ",
