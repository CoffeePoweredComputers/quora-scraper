            "answer_text": "Well, they\u2019re just very, very British, and I say this as someone who grew up in America and read them anyway. They felt utterly remote - throwaway phrases were utterly foreign to me, the spelling varied from what I had been taught, the writing style unfamiliar. These books, despite that, fueled numerous exciting hours for me. But to be blunt, they\u2019re unpopular in the US because they\u2019re so different. Books like Nancy Drew were just more American, and therefore easier to mass-market to the general population. Especially because these books were intended for younger audiences, it\u2019s probably much easier to sell stories without such a marked culture clash. ",

            "answer_text": "Blyton was one of the most prolific authors of the twentieth century, writing for children of a wide range of age groups. She did however write at a time when the transfer of children's books over the channel was not the norm. She also wrote about particularly English subjects and settings limiting her audience in the US. Interestingly she was and remains very popular in Germany, in particular her series called St. Clare's in English was translated as Hanni und Nanni and is still read and loved by children here. So much so that new books have been written and find made. This series of books of almost unheard of in the UK. ",
