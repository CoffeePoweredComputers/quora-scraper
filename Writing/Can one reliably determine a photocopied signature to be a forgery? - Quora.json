            "answer_text": "Signatures made with \u201creal ink\u201d invariably show signs of having two or more layers where lines cross. Such layers are not found in photocopies. Additionally, highly magnified photocopies show the \u201cspread\u201d of the ink, if present at all, all being in the same direction, and not in the direction of the lines of the signature. This also rules out most stamped signatures. The biggest problem, by the way, is \u201cauto-pen\u201d signatures, where the real motions used by a person are mechanically recorded. Where only a few masters are used, simply finding an exact duplicate is proof of the copying, but some people may use more than a dozen masters, making proof much more difficult. Secretarial signatures are a quagmire, as are signatures of some artists, such as Warhol who had a number of people sign his work. Traditionally, collectors preferred non-personalized autographs, but the more writing is in one hand, the less likely it is to be the work of a cheapskate forger. \u201cAuto-pen\u201d is the bane of authenticators, with a few being embarrassed by incorrect authentication when exactly the same autograph is shown to them several times.
