            "answer_text": "This may be because of the way you hold your pen. Try writing essays or paragraphs holding your pen/pencil in different ways. You shouldn't hold your writing instrument tightly. Practice writing with less pressure, try writing with smoother pens such as roller ball or gel pens. It may take some time to adopt but just practice n you'll eventually will be able to write without your hand goin numb. If it still doesn't work, maybe their\u2019s some medical problem.
