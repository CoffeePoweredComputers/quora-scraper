            "answer_text": "So there are three points of view you can write from: First PersonFirst person uses words like \u201cI\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d to refer to the character(s) etc. When a story is told from first person it is being told directly by the character using their voice, such as in a diary, auto-biography, or spoken dialogue. 2. Second Person This is the least common POV. It uses words like \u201cyou\u201d to refer directly to the reader and is used to break the fourth wall. Not very common for fiction. Used in self-insert stories, instruction manuals, guides, etc. 3. Third Person. Third person uses words like \u201cs/he\u201d and \u201cthey/them\u201d to address the character(s). This is one of the most popular ways of writing fiction (though first person is still pretty common too), and tells the story through the eyes of a narrator (usually, but not always, unknown and unmentioned). It tends to be slightly less personal than first person POV, but still can offer insight into characters\u2019 thoughts and emotions. There are two types: limited and omniscient. Limited third person POV gives you the thoughts and viewpoints of ONE character, and tracks their actions throughout the story/passage/chapter. Omniscient POV (also called an omniscient narrator) gives you the thoughts and viewpoints of multiple or all characters, jumping from character to character in following their actions and inner thoughts. Here are some examples from a book I\u2019m writing, in which I alternate between first and third person: First Person POV: \u201cThe first thing I can remember clearly is my brother\u2019s face. We were identical twins, and since we both kept our hair cut short and I never saw him after puberty, it looked much like my own face.\u201d Notice the bolded words; these are words that are unique to first person POV. We can rewrite the passage into another POV by changing those words: Second person: \u201cThe first thing you can remember clearly is seeing your brother\u2019s face.\u201dThird person: \u201cThe first thing she can remember clearly is seeing her brother\u2019s face.\u201dThird Person POV: \u201cJust to be safe though, Harib carefully composed herself and steeled her face, forcing it to become blank and stop projecting any emotion. She didn\u2019t want him to know her fear. He grinned widely at her like he didn\u2019t notice, showing straight but slightly yellowed teeth.\u201d Notice here how the characters are referred to with either their names or with third person pronouns \u2018she\u2019 and \u2018he\u2019. That makes it third person, though we can change it into either of the other POVs the same way we did earlier. This passage was written in third person limited, as we know the intentions and inner thoughts of one character, Harib (\u201cShe didn\u2019t want him to know her fear\u201d), but not the thoughts of the other character. We only know that he\u2019s smiling, and that Harib assumes this means \u201che didn\u2019t notice\u201d. Personally I prefer using third person limited for my writing, though I switch in cases when I want the book to be presented as a diary/autobiography. If you do switch POVs in one book like I do make sure they\u2019re in different chapters and you establish a pattern and purpose to this early on so as to not confuse your reader. Never write something like \u201cJust to be safe though, Harib carefully composed herself and steeled her face\u2026 I didn\u2019t want him to know my fear.\u201d That just confuses the reader about who\u2019s talking and who the narrator is. Telling the story clearly and establishing where the story is coming from is the main point of choosing first, second, or third person, and why I like third person as it is the clearest and, though a biased narrator can be useful sometimes, it often comes off as the least biased, which is best for my purposes.

            "answer_text": "Third person means that there is an external narrator looking down at the story telling it, while not necessarily being a character telling the story like first person, which is the main character narrating using words like \u201cI, or We\u201d, or second person which is a side character narrating the story, using words that is a mix of words used in first and third person.

I went down the stairs and I thought to myself \u201cthat man is staring at me.\u201d This is written in the first person. It uses the pronoun I. He went down the stairs and thought to himself \u201cthat man is staring at me\u201d. In this example the 3rd person is used. It's not the narrator speaking about himself(or herself). ",
