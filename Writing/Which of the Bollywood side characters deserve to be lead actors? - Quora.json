            "answer_text": "1. Radhika Apte Famous for her sensational contribution to regional cinema (Bengali, Tamil, Marathi) she made a quiet, beautiful debut in Shor: In The City. After that, she followed it up with films like the critically-acclaimed Hunterrr and Badlapur. We hope to see many more brilliant performances before she is put down as an \u2018art-house actress\u2019.  Source: hdpicswale 2. Bhoomi Pednekar She is the find of 2015. Making her debut opposite Ayushman Khurrana as the pleasantly plump Sandhya \u2013 she broke all stereotypes of what a mainstream Hindi film actress should look like to carry a \u2018hit film\u2019. Adequately supported by Ayushmann, Bhoomi won everyone\u2019s hearts with her performance.  Source: India 3. Manu Rishi Manu made a splash in Bollywood with Dibakar Banerji\u2019s Oye lucky lucky oye! as Abhay Deol\u2019s sidekick \u2018Bangali\u2019. He also cracked us up with his bumbling performance in Phas Gaye Re Obama! We wish to see more of him.  Source: Indian Express 4. Tahir Raj Bhasin You don\u2019t really expect exciting antagonists from Yashraj. Pradeep Sarkar\u2019sMardaani saw the rise of a particular young kid who is the head of a human-trafficking syndicate, engaging in a battle of wits with Rani Mukherjee \u2013 a police officer. Tahir Raj Bhasin impressed plenty of people with the way he held his own, and made a sinister character out of Walt.  Source: bookitornot 5. Surveen Chawala A TV veteran and know for her work in Punjabi films, she grabbed the eye-balls with the racy Hate Story 2. However, she used her oomph and showcased some acting chops in Anurag Kashyap\u2019s Ugly - we hope she arrives.  Source: apnatimepass 6. Anand Tiwari He got everyone\u2019s attention with his line in the Tata Tea commercial \u2013 \u201cIf you\u2019re not voting during elections, you\u2019re sleeping.\u201d He has played many many likeable roles in movies like Udaan, Kites, Go Goa Gone . He was easily the best thing about Aisha along with Amrita Puri and recently came into the spotlight withDetective Byomkesh Bakshy as Ajit. We sincerely hope he gets his due!  Source: Images99 7. Manish Chaudhary He\u2019s been around for a long long time, and yet he made his first solid impact as an actor on me as the Abhay Deol\u2019s elder brother in Socha Na Tha and then as snarling, greedy businessman in Rocket Singh. After that he\u2019s again gone back to the father roles \u2013 when in fact he deserves more.  Source: tellychakkar 8. Abhimanyu Singh He was one of the primary reasons why Gulaal was a solid film. His electrifying presence in the first half of the film as the braveheart in the midst of college politics in the hinterlands of Rajasthan, turned many heads. He\u2019s played few significant roles after that film, barring his portrayals of villains in South Indian films. Highly underrated.  Source: pixshark 9. Naveen Kaushik He made a lasting impact as the senior salesman in Rocket Singh. Sadly no one\u2019s really seen a lot of him after that movie, barring a few ads or some bank manager in some film. Only wish he would get more opportunities.  Source: buzzintown 10. Gulshan Devaiah The psyched-out rich brat from Shaitan, or his Kannadiga portrayal in That Girl In Yellow Boots and now to Bhansali\u2019s Ramleela and his latest outing, Hunterrr \u2013 Gulshan Devaiah has actually played it selective up till now \u2013 however, deserves more fame and spotlight.  Source: Zeenews 11. Ranvir Shorey It\u2019s really sad that THIS guy is still on the list. He\u2019s one of the most gifted actors who made a dent with their supporting roles in Pyaar ke Side Effects, Khosla ka Ghosla \u2013 and he\u2019s had some terrific collaborations with Rajat Kapoor in the form of Mithya and Fatso! With the impending release of Titli - we hope he finally gets the applause he deserves so so so much.  Source: Zeenews 12. Rajesh Sharma Really well-known in the Bengali film industry, this man made a solid first impression in Khosla ka Ghosla as Boman Irani\u2019s secretary. Ever since, he\u2019s played bit-roles with high impact in No one killed Jessica, Special 26, Luv shuv tey Chicken Khurana and Ghanchakkar.  Source: minority review 13. Vikrant Massey Starting out as a TV actor, Massey made a smooth transition into films by playing a supporting role to Ranveer Singh\u2019s character in Lootera . His performance was earnest, and he will next be seen in Zoya Akhtar\u2019s next Dil Dhadakne Do. We wish him luck!  Source: Youtube 14. Brijendra Kala An extremely well-known face in the movies, and shockingly enough, hardly anyone even knows his name. He was that goofy taxi driver in Jab We Met , the idol seller in PK , the reporter in Paan Singh Tomar. Deserves so much more recognition!  Source: thehindu 15. Suraj Sharma The boy from Life of Pi made a huge impact with his heart-felt debut, and then followed it up by playing an integral part in the fourth season of Homeland. It\u2019s strange, being a Delhi boy he hasn\u2019t been approached or been seen in anything closer home.  Source: screenmusings 16. Adil Hussain He won over everyone with his sarcastic-yet noble middle class husband in English Vinglish. He\u2019s a revered figure in the national theatre scene, and he\u2019s also played several small roles in Kaminey, Lootera, The Reluctant Fundamentalist and Life of Pi. He belongs in the league of Irfan Khan and Nawazuddin Siddique.  Source: Collider 17. Pawan Malhotra He\u2019s probably the most recognizable face in this whole list and yet he\u2019s hardly made any fame in this acting profession. Outstanding performances in Black Friday, Jab We Met, Delhi 6, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag have ensured that he will live on in our consciousness forever! Also, it wouldn\u2019t be so bad if we took our hat out for his stellar performances.  Source: blogspot 18. Saqib Saleem Made an impression with Yashraj\u2019s Mujhse Fraandship Karoge and Mere Dad ki Maruti and after that really shone through in Karan Johar\u2019s short in Bombay Talkies. This talented newcomer, who also happens to be Huma Qureshi\u2019s brother, is in the fray for becoming the next big thing in Bollywood. We hope, he does.  19. Swara Bhaskar She played significant parts in Anand L Rai\u2019s Tanu weds Manu and Raanjahana.She has been making headway into the ad sector, endorsing brands like Dove, Sprite etc.  Source: NDTV 20. Ali Fazal Known as the kid who strums \u2018Give me some sunshine..\u2019 in 3 Idiots, Ali Fazal has played many significant parts in films endorsed by big names including Shahrukh Khan and the Bhatts. He even did a small cameo in the seventh instalment of the Furious franchise.  Source: apunkachoice 21. Kunal Roy Kapur That fat guy from Delhi Belly, with the tummy problems \u2013 or better known as the brother of UTV honcho Siddharth Roy Kapur and VJ-turned-actor Aditya Roy Kapur. He\u2019s worked in a few indie films like Loins of Punjab Presents .  Source: Pixshark 22. Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub The antagonist in No One Killed Jessica, he did a splendid job as the despicable Manu Sharma. He followed it up with supporting roles in Raanjhana and Mere Brother ki Dulhan. So underrated.  Source: Midday 23. Amrita Puri The best thing about Aisha along with Anand Tiwari, she hasn\u2019t got any major opportunities apart from Kai Po Chhe. She\u2019s a fantastic actor and deserves so much more in terms of projects, fame and money.  Source: Imgur 24. Jimmy Shergill Known as the Shahrukh Khan for the B-grade films, he\u2019s more than a competent actor which he has proved in films like Sahib, Biwi aur Gangster and so many others.  Source: boxofficeindia 25. Vijay Raaz Not many people might take him seriously for his looks, but it still remains a fact that he was the best thing about Delhi Belly and Dedh Ishqiya . He also plays an integral part in the most tender love story of the 2000s in Monsoon Wedding .  Source: Youtube 26. Shreyas Talpade Stellar debut in Iqbal followed up with another brilliant performance in Dor saw him land a role alongside Shahrukh Khan in Om Shanti Om. And after that a few films with Sajid Khan, Farah Khan and Rohit Shetty spelled doom for his career. Deserves so much more!  Source: moviecelebs 27. Atul Kulkarni Known for his stellar performances in Chandani Bar and Rang De Basanti - Kulkarni made a name for himself for the supporting roles and the antagonist. Still a major proponent of Marathi films \u2013 people should watch him unleash his brilliance in regional film Natrang.  Source: DNA 28. Rajkumar Rao Making his debut in a very unlikable role in Dibakar Banerji\u2019s Love, Sex aur Dhokha \u2013 it took him just one scene in Talaash alongside Aamir Khan to prove his worth as an actor when he gets caught in the middle of a fight between his boss and his wife. With strong leading roles in Shahid , Queen and Citylights - he still hasn\u2019t got his due as an actor.  Source: ibnlive 29. Vipin Sharma Coming into the spotlight with a father routine in Aamir Khan\u2019s Taare Zameen Par - Vipin Sharma has played a few interesting characters after that in Paan Singh Tomar and Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana.  Source: Imageshack 30. Aditya Srivastava Popular as CID\u2019s Abhijeet \u2013 he played the role of lifetime in Anurag Kashyap\u2019sBlack Friday. As Badshah Khan, he owned the film as the misled fundamentalist manipulated to bomb the city of Bombay in \u201993.  Source: Indiforums 31. Pitobash Tripathy Catching everyone\u2019s attention in Shor In The City \u2013 he earned a significant role in Dibakar Banerji\u2019s Shanghai and International project Million Dollar Arm. Amazing actor deserves more work!  Source: Youtube 32. Annu Kapoor He\u2019s been the untapped potential for far too long. Winning hearts as Dr Chadha in Vicky Donor \u2013 Annu Kapoor has been around for far too long without getting his due credit as an actor.  Source: IBNlive 33. Amole Gupte Making his debut in Vishal Bharadwaj\u2019s Kaminey \u2013 Amole Gupte played the role ofBhau with elan and the poise of a veteran. He followed it up with his own film called Stanley ka Dabba.  Source: WordPress 34. Deepak Dobriyal Another find by Vishal Bharadwaj \u2013 Deepak Dobriyal is one of the best things about Omkara. He has also played significant roles in Shaurya, Tanu Weds Manu.  Source: Wikimedia 35. Sanjay Mishra He became a household name when he did his Apple Singh routine during the \u201999 Cricket World Cup in England. He\u2019s been around doing his bit in Rohit Shetty films and Rajat Kapoor films. He finally got a long-awaited role of a protagonist in last year\u2019s Ankhon Dekhi.  Source: Pixshark 36. Rajat Kapoor Virtually unknown before his gig as Mahesh Uncle in Farhan Akhtar\u2019s Dil Chahta Hai \u2013 he became popular after Madhur Bhandarkar\u2019s Corporate. He\u2019s directed a spate of well intentioned films, however, deserves so much more as an actor.  Source: IBNlive 37. Yashpal Sharma Better known as Lakha from Lagaan , he\u2019s played great characters from all those Prakash Jha films and Ab Tak Chhappan . Brilliant actor!  Source: Zeenews 38. Kay Kay Menon So might disagree about whether it would be right to call him \u2018underrated\u2019. Watch Black Friday and Shaurya and ask yourself again, does this man not deserve more?  Source: Bollyspice 39. Richa Chaddha Breaking out in Dibakar Banerji\u2019s Oye Lucky Lucky Oye as Dolly, she came into her own in Anurag Kashyap\u2019s Gangs of Wasseypur as Najma Khatoon. She has a raw energy about herself that needs to be acknowledged before she\u2019s long forgotten.  Source: Santa Banta 40. Vrajesh Hirjee He\u2019s done hero\u2019s best friend routine and the film\u2019s comic element only too many times. He\u2019s a much better actor than the opportunities that have been presented to him.  Source: Twitter 41. Nandita Das Making a mark in a series of films in the late 90s alternate cinema like Deepa Mehta\u2019s Fire and 1947: Earth. She got so fed up with the regular fare of Bollywood, she took a sabbatical and directed the hard-hitting Firaaq. It\u2019s Bollywood\u2019s loss that she isn\u2019t doing films anymore.  Source: eyeonfilms 42. Neeraj Kabi It is difficult to stand out in a film like Ship of Theseus. The concept of the film is unlike anything that\u2019s ever been made in India. And yet Neeraj Kabi does it with the elan of a seasoned warrior \u2013 deft, sharp, not eager to impress. He pushes up the credibility of Detective Byomkesh Bakshy by a notch.  Source: minority review 43. Manoj Joshi Featuring regularly in all Priyadarshan movies for comic relief or the Gujarati-spouting uncle, Manoj Joshi has played his roles to perfection. Only recently, he owns each and every scene in Hasee Toh Phasee as the father of the bride.  Source: fuccha 44. R Madhavan This young heartthrob from South might have had his share of stardom, early on in his career. However, he\u2019s a much more polished actor than the love stories he\u2019s been known for \u2013 just watch that pre-intermission scene in Guru.  Source: cinemagigs 45. Imaad Shah Naseeruddin Shah\u2019s elder son made his debut in the forgettable Dil, Dosti Etc.He\u2019s played supporting roles in films like The Reluctant Fundamentalist.  Source: nh7 46. Ashutosh Rana Bollywood\u2019s take on Silence of the Lambs was only remotely watchable because of this man\u2019s electrifying persona. No one can match his intensity as a villain!  Source: dosthana 47. D Santosh Shot to fame as Rajguru in Rajkumar Santoshi\u2019s The Legend of Bhagat Singh - he\u2019s played significant supporting roles in Khakee and Rocket Singh: Salesman of the year.  Source: kickass 48. Arshad Warsi Such a fine actor and yet needs to make a movie with Jacky Bhagnani to support himself these days. For those who haven\u2019t seen Sehar or Jolly LLB \u2013 his performance lifts these mediocre films by a notch.  Source: Filmykeeday 49. Ronit Roy His discovery in Udaan was almost like a fairytale for any TV actor looking to make it in films. Starring as the abusive, alcoholic father in Jamshedpur \u2013 Ronit Roy steals every scene he\u2019s in. Anyone think that was a fluke? Watch Ugly.  Source: Pinkvilla 50. Rajit Kapur The original Byomkesh Bakshi \u2013 he played only one memorable role in Hindi films. In Vikram Bhatt\u2019s Ghulam he plays the elder brother to Aamir Khan\u2019s character and in one scene\u2019s altercation, Kapoor shows his mettle as an actor. Terribly underutilised.  ",
