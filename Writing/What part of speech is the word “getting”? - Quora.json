            "answer_text": "It depends how it is used. If it is used as a noun (either as the subject or object of the sentence) then it is a gerund. E.g. Getting dressed takes ages! (Subject) I hate getting less pay than Pablo for the same job! (Object) Otherwise, it is a present participle. This means it is used as part of a continuous tense. E.g. I am getting married tomorrow! (Present continuous) Have you been getting enough sleep? (Present perfect continuous) Esmerelda was getting out of bed when she heard a knock at the door. (Past continuous) And so on. I hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "The word getting can be either a present participle or a gerund. In English, a present participle is always required to form the present progressive (\u201cto be doing\u201d) tense or the past progressive (\u201cI was doing\u201d) tense of a verb. A gerund is formed from the present participle of a verb (such as getting in your original question), but it is not part of a verb or verb phrase; instead, it functions as a noun (\u201cI\u2019ve got to get going while the getting is good.\u201d) or as an adjective.
