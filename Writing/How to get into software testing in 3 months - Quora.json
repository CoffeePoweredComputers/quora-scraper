            "answer_text": "Well, if you are a Fresher then I would suggest you to try your hand in other domains first like Coding, Database, System Administration, ERP, Cloud Computing, etc. If you feel that the above mentioned fields are not your cup of tea then only jump into the field of Software Testing.  To begin with, Software Testing (let\u2019s call it simply Testing for the time being) is not Rocket Science. But at the same time it is not that easy as many people believe it to be. You will be testing Applications like Web Applications, Standalone Applications, Mobile Applications and Websites depending on what your Company deals with primarily. The approach or style of testing is of 2 types : Manual approach = Manual testing = all activities are performed manually by the Tester without the use of any tool. Automated approach = Automated testing = start manually, but use Tools to automate the process. Tools used can be QTP, ALM, Selenium, Loadrunner, Rational, etc. To get into Software Testing you need to know some basic concepts like : SDLC = Software Development Life Cycle STLC = Software Testing Life Cyle which is a part of SDLC Bug Life Cycle = which is a part of SDLC Agile and SCRUM basic process or methodology. Basic Validation rules used for Applications. SQL = added advantage SQL injection tools = Helps in strengthening your CV. Test Cases / Test Scenarios = the backbone of Testing. Write these always even if you aren\u2019t testing an application. So study all these and you will definitely become a Software Tester. Also it would be helpful if you start testing on websites and Android apps randomly. You may not get bugs that often but start writing Test Cases for them. That will help in real time scenario.  Last but not the least be prepared for a hard life as you will be responsible if any Bug is reported from Client.  You will be scolded in front of your colleagues like hell. You will get almost no respect or friendship from the Developers team. You will get taunts that Testers don\u2019 know technical things or are not capable of coding, hence they are testers. But you need to have patience and robust frame of mind to ignore all these and continue to find bugs. Both developers and testers belong to the same team. They work in unision to make the application a better application. That\u2019s it. No one is the other one\u2019s enemy here.  It is not that easy to find bugs in somebody\u2019s works. You have to keep searching all the time. Image Source : Google Answer Source : My work experience and coaching from MindQ, Hydeabad. P.S : these are my views. You can differ with me, but don\u2019t post unprofessional comments. ",
