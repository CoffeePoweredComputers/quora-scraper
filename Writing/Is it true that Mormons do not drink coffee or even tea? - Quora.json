            "answer_text": "You may not be aware that we prefer to be called Latter-day Saints or members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Yes, it is really true that we believe that for our day we are to not partake of tea, alcohol, coffee, tobacco, or illegal drugs. This we learned from a revelation from God. Please don\u2019t ask \u201cWhy?\u201d, because we really don\u2019t know. But in the Lord\u2019s wisdom He has commanded that his law for us, at this time, is to abstain from these things. And most active Latter-day Saints do. I don\u2019t give coffee or tea a second thought and it truly never enters my mind to order a glass when I go to a restaurant, unless someone else brings it up. Not only do we not consume tea and coffee, but we give 10% of our income to the Lord as tithing, then we are to pay offerings and be overall charitable, we give many hours of Church service, our young men and many young women volunteer two years of their lives to be missionaries to bless the lives of others as do many retired couples and we do so at our own expense. We spend time in the Temple of the Lord and many of us give a lot of our time to our callings in Church (we have no paid ministers). We are to read the Scriptures daily, have prayer at each meal and at the beginning and end of each day. We are to develop a love for our Heavenly Father and His son Jesus Christ. Further, we are encouraged to get an education, to be active in the communities in which we live and large families are not common. We have a close sense of community and we help and minister to each other. If you want a church, be a Baptist. If you want a way of life, seriously consider being a Latter-day Saint. ",

            "answer_text": "According to the Word of Wisdom, 89:9 And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly. It is interesting that it uses the word \u201cagain\u201d when there is no previous mention of \u201chot\u201d drinks. The only \u201cdrinks\u201d previously mentioned are alcoholic drinks. This appears to me to be a reference to hot drinks laced with alcohol. Back in the day when this was given, a hot toddy was considered good medicine. However, for those with a weakness for alcohol, it could be easily excused and, therefore, indulged. There is also evidence some years after this revelation was given that Joseph Smith did drink coffee. When I mentioned this to one LDS individual, he told me that the coffee and tea restrictions did not begin until after they were in Utah. Excuse me while go get my morning coffee. ",
