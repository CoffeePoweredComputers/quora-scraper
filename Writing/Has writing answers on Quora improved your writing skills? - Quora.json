            "answer_text": "I'm using Quora to growth hack my writing skills. I've been able to test different styles, topics, strategies, wording, calls to action, structure, length, level of detail, citations, etc. Quora gives some real numbers to work with, data I can use to discover the best way to present the information I am sharing. Views are interesting, in that certain subjects are more widely viewed; posting at different days and times seem to influence view counts heavily. Day and time also effects the nastiness of the comments. Upvotes are informative, too. It's abundantly clear that people upvote stuff that's entertaining. Accuracy, details, simple explanations, references, none of these make a bit of difference. The highest upvote/view ratio is the right mix of entertainment with a dab of insight. Not too much insight, or your upvotes will be 0 for weeks or months. It's a shame, but it is what it is. So now, I practice. I experiment with words to try and nail down the strategies that work. I'm learning to be more entertaining in tone and presentation, whether people will realize I'm trying to be funny, whether a piece has appeal to certain followers. I could do a lot more if there was more data to work with, but overall, I do think I'm improving. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it's probably hampered them as there are too many rules and regulations about what can be written. It's made me write in a way that's slightly unnatural to me, not being myself and fitting in to how Quora likes people to be. Social media friendly. This simply isn't me which is ok. Unfortunately, Quora doesn't allow people like me to really be ourselves without risking a ban. It has taught me to edit better as those BNBR rules can be fuckers. ",

Earlier, it was damn hard for me to write even a paragraph about something. Now, I can write about anything. And yeah, anything means anything. My grades in English eventually improved and now I have confidence on myself that what I\u2019m writing is grammatically correct. And yes, this self confidence gives courage to write further. ",
