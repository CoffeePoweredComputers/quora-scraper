Here are my observations: \u201cHe is my oldest son.\u201d (This is perfectly okay in North America, but in other countries, you\u2019ll want to change this to \u201cHe is my eldest son.\u201d)\u201cThis boy is older than I\u201d (No. This is no longer considered natural English. Better to say either \u201cThis boy is older than I am\u201d or \u201cThis boy is older than me\u201d.\u201cTwo and two makes four\u201d (Perfectly fine in speech and in informal writing, but it\u2019s a little to colloquial for formal writing. In formal writing, say \u201cTwo plus two equals four.\u201d",

When I was at school (60 years ago) we recited the tables and said, two and two makes four but I was always left wondering, four what. ",
