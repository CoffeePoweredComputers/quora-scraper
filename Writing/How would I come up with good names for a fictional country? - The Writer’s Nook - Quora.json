Or use a blending of languages that infer a general ecological niche (Greensward, Mountaindale, Fenlake, Seastone, etc.) If you name your country Xzybafid, you better have a reason that makes enough sense that your readers won't come to a screeching halt saying\u2026\u201dXzybafid? WTF?\u201d If you haven't established (or do not later divulge) that \u201cXzy\u201d (pronounced \u201c'Zy\u201d) means \u201cSky\u201d and \u201cb\u201d means \u201cof\u201d and \u201cafid\u201d means \u201cold dwelling place\u201d, then the whole venture is a useless conceit.

For example, \u201cWakanda\u201d sounds like a real African country. You might take something like Estonia and Latvia (they border each other) and make \u201cLatonia\u201d or \u201cEstovia\u201d (I think Wachovia was used in Age of Ultron, or something close to that name). Actually, \u201cEstovia\u201d sounds kind of cool, and you\u2019re welcome to use it. Tom Hanks heralded from \u201cKrakozhia\u201d in The Terminal and that sounds pretty legit. Here\u2019s a list of fake country names, and while you probably can\u2019t use these yourself, they\u2019re good starting points: Top 50 Fictional Countries: \nFrom Ambrosia to Zuy ",
