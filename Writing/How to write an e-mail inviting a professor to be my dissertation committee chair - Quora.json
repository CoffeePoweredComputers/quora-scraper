            "answer_text": "Most consider it an honor to be asked to be the committee chair/advisor. When requesting, it is important to establish why you feel the invitee should be your chair. What qualifications do they have that fit with your study? Also, address possible compensation. What will the chair/advisor be paid for their service? Finally, what are the university criteria for the Chair/Advisor, along with the dissertation/thesis criteria? These are important elements for potential Chairs/Advisors to consider. ",

            "answer_text": "If a student didn\u2019t come talk to me in person about this then I would probably decline to be advisor. I will advise students with whom I have a connection, whose work ethic and ability I know, and who have the confidence to succeed. All that should also translate to being willing and able to talk with me about important topics \u2014 such as leading the advisory committee. ",
