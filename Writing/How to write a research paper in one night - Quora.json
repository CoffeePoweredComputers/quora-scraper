            "answer_text": "Know what you\u2019re going to be writing about very well, have a reasonable idea of what you\u2019d like to say about it, and mix well with equal parts inspiration and caffeine. Having literate friends who won\u2019t mind proofreading on short notice also helps. But if you haven\u2019t taken care of the first two before you sit down at the keyboard, the rest won\u2019t save you. Short version: it can be done if you know your subject well, but putting it off until the last minute means that it\u2019s not going to be very good. ",

In order to write a good research paper, you need to spend enough time researching your topic to become a mini-expert. Otherwise you can\u2019t write intelligently. Hopefully you don\u2019t have a paper due tomorrow. ",
