            "answer_text": "So,, your question implies a pretty significant misunderstanding of film. Nothing whatsoever resembling a story exists before an editor starts working. Rather than \u201ccut out\u201d things that are not suitable, editors actually assemble movies from single pieces of \u201cfilm\u201d, and I use that term as a catch-all for any medium that contains capture motion image, be it actual film, tape, or a digital file. It is far more imagery than can be used in the film, and many, many duplicates, iterations, and incomplete sections of the same part of the narrative. The director will have earmarked (olde language: \u201cprinted\u201d) some (maybe 10\u201330%) of the shots that were captured during production, but even these contain duplicate action; iterations of the same lines and movements, etc\u2026 The Editor uses his/her understanding of the director\u2019s intent in order to choose which parts of which takes using which angles and which lines in order to convey the story. The director is often not even in the room when this happens. The director may actually be on another continent for some of the editorial process. The director will rely on the editor to deliver a cut that is the basis for further refinement by the director, who is probably (in this case) the arbiter of the creative vision for the project. The director will then work with the editor to reconcile the reality of what has been captured for his/her vision with the ability of the images and performances to convey that vision as best as possible.

            "answer_text": "In the U.S., the Directors Guild of America gives the film\u2019s director the right to make the first cut of the film. If the studio does not like the first cut, it usually has the right to make whatever changes it wants (unless the director is a superstar who has a final cut clause in his or her contract). How much of the first cut editing is done by the editor and how much is done by the director is up to the director. If the director does not want to do the first cut, he or she can let the editor do it. It involves a lot of work. ",

            "answer_text": "Relationships between directors and editors vary enormously but it's quite common for editors to do an initial assembly of the footage, choosing the takes and angles that will work best and making choices about timing and emphasis. This gives a starting point for the director who may make sweeping changes, minor adjustments or possibly want to start from scratch with a particular scene or scenes. Directors generally learn to trust their editors and between them they will shape and polish the film, trying different versions and exchanging ideas. However, everything else you can imagine is possible from teams of editors working independently on separate sections of the film while the director is hardly even seen to the editor making the tea and taking a few notes while the director does all the actual work.

An editor makes a scene an emotion journey for the viewer, many times establishing the drama of a scene, even at times changing the sequence of the action from how the director intended. Keep in mind most directors know almost nothing about editing, especially sound effects editing, including other aspects of post production. ",
