            "answer_text": "It's not likely that you can - any discussion of homework would need a big push from parents to start it off. Are there any open-minded administrators at your school who have an open door policy for students? Without that a student cannot access the people who have the power to initiate change in the school. You - and/or the parents who support this discussion - might start by asking for a school website - on which all the evening's homework is required to be listed. Is there any school policy regarding homework? Usually not. An enlightened school would have policy about homework. How much is too much? Some schools say - 20 minutes per subject but don't enforce it in any way - and don't stop to calculate that 20 minutes per 7 subjects is 140 minutes - over two hours right there. Teachers should do their own homework - teachers' estimates of how long their homework takes is not based on any hands-on experience with the homework. Long-term projects can come from several subjects - at the same time and be due on the same day - and are often assigned on top of the nightly homework. It's not likely a school will stop giving homework - but if articulate parents take it up and make reasonable requests - a website and clear policies around homework - that could eventually happen. This book is worth reading - The Homework Myth - it summarizes the research on homework. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you a student, parent, or teacher? Are you sure it would be the best thing for everyone involved if the school stopped giving homework? Are you taking the long view or the short view? Are you motivated by what\u2019s good for you or by what feels good? Once you\u2019ve answered those questions, if you still want to change the school\u2019s policy on homework, you probably want to see if there are others who feel as you do, and you, as a group, make a proposal to the powers that be.
