            "answer_text": "Dear Friend, It was a blessing the day you came to my life. At first i thought you will just be a casual friend to me in my life. but as we spent quality time together i realised that you are a special one to me. I know we don't talk much as i am an introvert by nature. but when i talk to you once in a while. i feel mesmerized. i feel very amusing in my life. I still sometimes remember the crazy things we did in our life. I still remember that day when you helped me to conquer my nervousness while i was trying to gift her the sketch i made for her that day. hell it was scary at first but later on that day, i may had sucked that day at expresssing it but i feel really nice when i spend those times with you. I know we are graduated & soon we may part ways later on in our life, but we will always be connected through the memories we created in our heart. I even know we haven't had much selfies & all that in our life coz we both didn't liked it much but that's doesn't mean we will forget each other. I will always remember you. Always remember we are brother's in arms, Brothers in feud.etc. & i will always be there for you even if the world isn't gonna be. I will always be the person to support you when it comes about the important life decisions you are hesitanting for. Go ahead, aim for the better future so that you may be able to create a paradise for the one you want to spend you rest of you life with.Make a fortune. Don't rely on luck. a real man makes his own luck. A real men does not wait for the opportunities to occur. he creates one. Set yourself some ambitions which will be beneficial to you. Ask me anything when you are in doubt. I may not be able to give you a satisfying solution for it but i will try my best. Our life is going to be enough harder from now on. but we will stood up again. Let's stand up & face the world together. For there are many different things this world has offered to us. Lets appreciate them & aim for a better future together. Lets create a fortune in the next 5 years. a kind of one which will far beyond impressive. As long as we are breathing & are very much alive this world we can do anything in our life. Always remember. A change is the only miracle, according to me which can be achieved through hard work. We are not lions in this world, we are wolves that hunts their prey. & by wolves I don't mean we should be the one of those healthy lazy always being in the middle kind of wolf. what i mean in this is that let's be the leader of the bunch of black wolves. the one with rare white fur, the one who leads the army & the one who holds deeps scars on his eyes & body from the previous hunts & past battles he face in his life. Let's be the kind of person who doesn't ask for anything, instead earns it through hard work. our obstacles are nothing but just the tests that our life takes once in a while in order to show just how much of serious we actually are in our life. Let's just conquer this world by being exceptional. For the kind of life we want in our world. we are gonna get it #whatever it takes. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you write a letter to your friend expressing your feeling about the special place he or she has in your life? I had a good mate through the 1960s and 70s, and when he moved away to ahother town (no internet in those days) we stayed in touch by mail. I missed the guy! He was good company. I wanted to do something special with one of my letters, so I fed a roll of toilet paper into the platen of the typewriter, and wrote him a long letter. That wasn\u2019t without its difficulties because toilet paper, by its very nature, is soft; and typewriter keys are hard and sharp. So the thing kept getting stuck to the platen, and I had to prise it off at the end of every line. Eventually I finished and managed to send him the \u2018longest\u2019 letter either of us had ever written. I have no idea what he did with it after reading it, but I have my suspicions. The content wasn\u2019t important. Australians and Brits (he was English) become very suspicious when people tell us how great we are. I\u2019d much rather have somebody say, \u201cG\u2019day you old bastard,\u201d (which is a pretty normal Australian greeting) than have them bullshit all over me. Getting back to your question\u2026 I once read in a \u2018how to write fiction\u2019 text, that if you have an axe to grind, don\u2019t beat the drum in your story. You don\u2019t need to write about it because your interest will show through in your general writing. And you don\u2019t need to tell your friend how much they mean to you. That will ring loud and clear in the way you relate to them. ",
