            "answer_text": "Spike, do you also have this experience when you are speaking? I am wondering because as someone who has taught writing for many years, my standard answer to a question like yours is to tell someone to write the way that they speak, but that wouldn't help if you struggle with spoken replies as well.   My experience has taught me that some people are just hesitant about writing as a whole because they feel like they can't represent themselves well \"on paper\".  They are afraid that the reader will judge them based on their execution of the language.  Unfortunately, their fears are justified.  Even people who don't write well themselves are often critical of others' writing. The only answer I have for that is that you just can't worry about those people who are more interested in correcting your grammar than they are in basic communication.  If you find it difficult to write for this reason, let me encourage you  to, again, write the way that you speak.  Then, when that is completed, go back and make your grammatical corrections.  Make full use of the many proof-reading/editing programs that are available everywhere you turn.   Writing as you would speak often helps, also, when the problem is you just aren't sure what to say.  In my creative writing classes, I used to tell students who said, \"I don't know what to write about,\" to just start putting words on paper and worrying about going back and organizing and shaping those words later. If you aren't certain what correct email format is, here is a link:   How to Write a Formal Email  If it is an issue of being able to concentrate and focus, you need to change your environment.  If you need complete quiet to concentrate, provide that for yourself. If you concentrate better while listening to music, put those headphones on! You get the idea. :) If it's a matter of some sort of phobia, then I am not qualified to help with that issue. I hope I anticipated your issue in my answers.  If not, please feel free to get in touch with me again.  Thank you for asking! ",

            "answer_text": "As a Wordsmith, i use the following guidelines: Read and re-read the email, noting the jargon that is used in your work (e.g. technical problems). Cut out all the why's and the who's first. It's the what's you need to address e.g. So-and-so is telling me that his laptop is constantly crashing and it's because so-and-so has done something wrong to it. The key words are: laptop, crashing. That's taking out the who and the why.  Then, look at the assumption - so-and-so thinks the other person has done something wrong. The key points here are: Mr x believes Mr y is at fault. Now, look at the facts of the statements: the laptop is freezing up. Mr x has asked you to fix it.  Okay, now you can start preparing an answer. I've given a similar example, using similar keywords. * Use ten words to sum up each point e.g.: Project deadline pushed forward system testing shows errors found.  * Then, add in the words that you need: The project deadline we agreed to has been pushed forward - during the system testing phase, we found errors we need to fix.   End your email with a what YOU can do about the issue. I come across a common mistake here when I proof-read any written content, and that is: you can come undone by adding way too much detail about how you're going to forward the email to your manager, who will send it to the right department that handles these problems and they will sort it out for you and if they can't they'll send it to someone else - and you can really get lost in so much detail, you'll lose the plot. Simply state what you can do. In the case of the project deadline not being met, state that the errors are being corrected and system testing will then be continued. Should any further errors be found, these will be dealt with swiftly.  I hope that helps~    ",
