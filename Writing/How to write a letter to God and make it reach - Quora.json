God knows the inner thoughts of your subconcious mind. If you want to say something to god just open your heart and say it. Have true intentions and always believe that God hears you. If you don't get an instant fulfillment to your wish just remember that god plans the best. Whenever time is right you will get what you want and if your wish is good for your well being it will surely be accepted but when time is right. You have to be a little patient. It is all God's test. ",

You can pray to Jehovah God and He will listen to your supplications. Psalm 65: 2\u202fO Hearer of prayer, to you people of all sorts will come. He is only One who listens to you prayers. In order to understand Gods message to you read the Bible and meditate on it. Thank you for reading. ",
