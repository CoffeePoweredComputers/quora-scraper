            "answer_text": "There is no purpose in asking this question unless programming is causing some strain on some other aspect of your life. If it is, neither myself nor anyone not close to you could provide a fair answer. So weigh the difficulties and decide for yourself what you wish to do. Whether the problem is feeling that you are becoming too distant from your family, that its standing between you and getting homework done, or some other such situation, I cannot aid you more than I already have. If you are not experiencing any form of strain other than the typical difficulty of solving problems and everything you\u2019ve said is true, but you still felt the need to ask this question, determine why you are uncertain about continuing. If it is for any of the following reasons, ask yourself why you program at all, not because you are necessarily a bad programmer or you shouldn\u2019t do it, but because these are motivations unlikely to come to fruition consistently and will almost inevitably lead to disappointment or regret. \u2022Praise/Recognition: You want to receive this from your family/friends/teachers/potential employers/people you are attracted to. This is inconsistent and wanes fairly quickly. \u2022Money/Material Rewards: You want to use your skills to make a program that others will give this to use. Although possible, this is supremely difficult and largely based on luck. There are very many amazingly well crafted programs which become swept under the rug and ultimately are forgotten simply because the right people didn\u2019t find them. \u2022 Full Knowledge of How It All Works: It may not seem like it, but no one knows everything there is to know about a programming language or any other part of programming, with the possible exceptions of extremely basic languages. With those stated, it\u2019s important to take note of some better motivations, such as those in the following hierarchy from the best at the top downward. \u2022Personal Enjoyment: This is the best motivation you can have at this stage. If you do not enjoy it at this point, I would recommend shelving it until/unless you need it. At this point, you need not worry about due dates, team cooperation, or navigating a jungle of other peoples\u2019 code, so it might cause you some problems when you get to the work world if you don\u2019t find coding worthwhile. \u2022 Interest/Curiosity: Even if you don\u2019t necessarily find the act of programming fun, you should enjoy learning how to go about solving a problem with a computer or piecing together the principles behind it all. But be careful not to become frustrated that you do not know how to do everything. It takes years to learn how to do most anything you could coceiveably need to do. \u2022Aspirations for Becoming Better: Think of what all you can do compared to what you could do when you started. Now consider that with practice, you could become much better than you are now. Does the prospect of progress feel satisfying or exciting? If so, then it\u2019s one of the best motivations there is. Otherwise, try something else. However, if both of those were wrong and you just had a difficult time with a problem or something to that tune, then the only advice I can give is to get over it. There will be plenty of problems that are too difficult to solve by brute force. If all problems were direct and easy, there would be little demand for new programmers because just a few would be able to accomplish the same amount as many programmers as a team here and now. Hope I helped. ",

            "answer_text": "YES! If you like what you do then go ahead pursue your passion. Don\u2019t just learn them because it will get you into a great school/ pay you well rather, you should try to enjoy them. After reading your description it suggests me that you are probably not enjoying programming because you are doubting yourself. If you do not like it then you can try something new that you think you will enjoy. Personally, I have always enjoyed programming and learning new stuff in general but the most fun part is when I try to program something new or try to program something that I know I am not capable but just to challenge myself. I am just a senior in high school but I enjoy coding in general and I try to connect it with other things that I like to do. IMO, you should keep practicing the languages that you already know and challenge yourself with new stuff. Being the best at the languages that you already know will help you a lot if you want to learn a new language. Like I mentioned before, your description sounds like you don\u2019t really enjoy programming. The reason could be you haven\u2019t gone out of your box yet to code something other than the stuff that is assigned to you (like the stuff on codecademy or something). But yeah good luck!!! Disclaimer: I hope I don't offend anybody while writing an answer. So, if you are offended I apologize; it was unintentional. Also, please forgive me if I have any English grammar errors I often do not proofread my answers on Quora. However, I encourage you to suggest me with any edits that you believe I should make because it helps me learn new things also fix something if I get it wrong. Thank you! ",

If it is just something to do, but not what you want to do, then find something else. There are plenty of other things to do with your life. I was introduced to computers when I was ten, tried to take a programming class at 11 with a teacher who didn\u2019t really know how to teach, and then started teaching myself at 12. I\u2019ve been doing it now for more than 40 years and continue to learn new things constantly. One thing to be aware of: learning a language is just the beginning. As you gain experience, you\u2019ll discover that there are many different ways to accomplish any given task. The best solution in one application may not be appropriate for another. Performance may matter in one project, another might need to emphasize clear and clean code, yet another might need a quick solution that works, but is neither clean nor fast. Have fun with it! ",

Programming and coding are very quickly going to be come ubiquitous, and the more you know, the better you will set yourself up for success. I\u2019m currently learning software engineering at Holberton School, and only wish that I had started at a younger age. I would recommend working in one language for a few months, do some significant projects in your language of choice, then switch to a new language for a few months. The reason I recommend this is because the ability to transition between languages, frameworks, and technologies is super useful in the industry. Depending on the team or project you are working on, will determine the langue you work in. So if you only master one language, you loose your flexibility to work in other languages. ",
