            "answer_text": "HI, having been on some 35 thesis committees over the years, I can advise not to do a thesis with two subjects. First, a thesis degree is to give the student experience doing research. Second you don\u2019t want to complicate the process to unduly extend the time needed to complete. Education is a process towards a goal. Make that process clean and direct and don\u2019t take more time than necessary to get that goal. Remember concentrating on the process is at least as important as concentrating on the goal. It\u2019s very important to keep the research question clear and doable within the timeframe given. ",
