When English speakers learn Chinese, they may carry over their English habit of not clearly distinguishing between these pairs of Chinese sounds: b~p, d~t, and g~k. This is why they might make mistakes. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s something of a leading question. Most native-born Americans have no knowledge of Chinese and thus don\u2019t think much about how b or p are pronounced in Mandarin. When an English-speaking broadcaster says \u5317\u4eac it will usually be pronounced Bay-jing. \u81fa\u5317 will be pronounced Tai-pay, or \u201cType A\u201d. Of course neither is quite correct. The plosive b in \u5317 is seldom if ever used in standard English, so most native speakers of English don\u2019t get it quite right. Place names get Anglicized by native English speakers. This is not confined to Chinese. The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, not in Pa-ree as our French friends say it. The capital of the EU is Brussels, not Broo-sells. If you want to see Michelangelo's David (and you should!) he lives in Florence, not Firenze. And this goes both ways. I live in Seattle. My home town is not pronounced \u897f\u96c5\u5716 or Xi-ya-too, but if you call it that, I\u2019ll know what you mean. ",
