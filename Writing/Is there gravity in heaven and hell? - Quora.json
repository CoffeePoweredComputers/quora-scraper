            "answer_text": "Well you see it\u2019s all about Gravity! Or rather too much gravity where you the damned are concerned! And a very dark gravity indeed that drags you away from the light and Into perpetual darkness where the fields are waiting To devour you !      Do you not remember the story of Scrooge and the visitation of the ghost of his ex business partner Jackob Marley? Due to a lifetime of selfishness and sin he forged a massive invisible iron chain which twisted round him and dragged him down! Well your weight of sin is a dark gravity that drags you straight to Hell! You can\u2019t escape the gravity of this!  In Hell itself the atmosphere is stifling and hot and you are constantly choking! Air is life air is holy and so in Hell air is limited and you feel as if you are drowning all the time and hard to breath! In Hell you have a new body - This body is blackened and very heavy ! At the moment I do not remember the Sanskrit name for it ! This body is weighted with gravity in the same way as the chains weighted heavily upon the soul of Jacob Marley! You won\u2019t be able to stand it ! Your screaming will never end as they begin to feed! You will scream out in endless Horror and terror as your worst nightmares all come true at once! and you will scream for death, but you see Death is crossing over- and you have already done that ! So death will be lost for you forever ! AAAAAAAAAAAA!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! SO-   ",

            "answer_text": "The way heaven and hell were described to me (by people who claim to know these things) is that heaven and hell are not places you go to like another planet or country. In both, you exist as a disembodied entity, or soul. No body, no senses, none of that stuff. In heaven your soul is in the presence of God and bathes in his radiant love for eternity. Nothing more than that, what more could any Christian want? Hell is the same, but there you soul is tormented by pain, fear and madness for eternity. That is the worst part. You will know with utter certainty that you can never escape. Not sure I would like either option. ",

            "answer_text": "In the Baha\u2019i Faith \u201cheaven and hell\u201d are not in the physical universe, rather they are a spiritual condition of the soul as being near or distant from God. So the concept of gravity doesn\u2019t apply: The Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed teachings state that there is no such physical place as heaven or hell, and emphasise the eternal journey of the soul towards perfection. They explain that references to \u201cheaven\u201d and \u201chell\u201d in the Holy Scriptures of other religions are to be understood symbolically, describing states of nearness to and distance from God in this world and in the realms beyond. \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1 has said that when human beings \u201cbecome illuminated with the radiance of the sun of reality, and ennobled with all the virtues, they esteem this the greatest reward, and they know it to be the true paradise. In the same way they consider that the spiritual punishment\u2026is to be subjected to the world of nature; to be veiled from God; to be brutal and ignorant; to fall into carnal lusts; to be absorbed in animal frailties; to be characterized with dark qualities\u2026these are the greatest punishments and tortures\u2026\u201d1 What Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds Believe  ",

Nobody has any more access to genuine information about heaven and hell than you do, including whether or not they even exist. But gravity only affects mass. We are told that heaven and hell and their occupants are non-physical and hence massless, so if that\u2019s true it would have no effect there whether it operated or not. ",
