            "answer_text": "I answered that same question a few months ago, and it took me 4 versions before I settled with a topic I was comfortable with. I ended up writing about writing. My 4th and final version worked because I realized, before typing it up, that I had gotten the process backwards. It doesn\u2019t matter what you write about. Really, it doesn\u2019t. I remember reading about a college essay, whose author was interviewed on television, that dealt not with the trials of growing up with a single parent, or losing a body part to cancer, or shaking hands with the president, but rather with trying free samples at Costco. My favorite essay that I\u2019ve read detailed its author\u2019s daily commute to his high school. What really matters is your central theme. What do you want admissions officers to know about you, as a person? Are you someone who perseveres through thick and thin? Are you exceptionally compassionate? Do you revel in trying new things? When I first began to work on my essay, I made a list. On this list I wrote, \u201cArt,\u201d \u201cTravel,\u201d \u201cTaiwan,\u201d \u201cWriting,\u201d \u201cMartial arts,\u201d and so on. I tried writing about the first three, but something was missing in all of my initial drafts. The writing itself was decent enough\u2014in fact, I went a little overboard with special effects. My problem was I didn\u2019t have a theme. I had no idea what I was trying to say about myself, as a person. So what if I loved painting? So what if I traveled to all these places, and grew up in a foreign country? Anybody else could\u2019ve taken my place, and it would have made no difference to the reader. Here\u2019s my advice: don\u2019t think about the literal answer to the question yet. Instead, do some self-reflection and decide on a protruding aspect of your character that you believe is crucial to understanding you. The topic you choose to write about will come to you naturally. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "First things first, your college essay is a character statement. It introduces who you are and why you, specifically, are an asset to the institution to which you are applying. In my experience as a student who has written and reviewed admissions essays, the most successful ones are a journey. They expose the evolution of your thought process and goals. Sometimes they are a story, sometimes they are a memory, sometimes they are a symbolic representation of your achievements. I have seen fascinating stories which start as a memory and then link that memory to a career goal, and equally engrossing ones which detail a question that student would like to answer someday. The essay, in addition to being a means of discussing who you are and what value you present to the university, is a way of targeting the reader. Your story telling skills and choices of diction and organization are half the battle. A well thought out story, no matter what the topic, is far more intriguing than one which, although it may be far more novel, is written at an eighth-grade reading level. Make sure to challenge yourself to present yourself in the most mature and positive light you can, while staying true to your voice. Some people have a very matter-of-fact style, while others are poetic. Some people\u2019s essays are practically dripping with charisma. Whatever your voice is, as long as you use it correctly to translate how your life has shaped you to be the ideal candidate for acceptance, you have done your absolute best. ",
