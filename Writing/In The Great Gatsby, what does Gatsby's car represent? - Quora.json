            "answer_text": "Like his house and his clothes, the car shows both Gatsby\u2019s wealth and his poor taste in the way he displays that wealth. Read carefully the description of his clothes when he arrives at Nick\u2019s door for tea with Daisy. No one raised in wealth would dress that way. Gatsby is nouveau riche (new money); he has money, whether it is really his or his masters\u2019, but he has no understanding of the \u201cright\u201d way (\u201crich not gaudy,\u201d as Polonius advises his son, Laertes) to spend it. Tom describes the car as a circus wagon. As a plot device, the gaudiness of the car makes it easy for Wilson to recognize as the \u201cmurder\u201d weapon. ",
