            "answer_text": "You have to argue about something, that's all. For example I would argue that the secret purpose of this paper may be to attack Democracy. The Left would like to have kids working on that sort of paper. Okay, for sake of this discussion, let's assume it's a legitimate topic offered in good faith by a disinterested teacher. So you just have to argue that Democracy is bad; it doesn't work; it brings out the worst in the citizens; it ends up meaning rule by the mob\u2026 Or you go in the other direction and argue that Democracy is wonderful and what every country should have. If there is a problem it would be because Democracy hasn't been done properly or may require secure, generous people willing to share, so they don't have to win every election to be happy. (But look at our Democrats after the last election. They started a coup to reverse the election.) Toss some of these ideas back and forth with your friends, until you find the argument that you feel is most interesting. When you have the argument you like, you have to find reasons to support your position. And so you win the argument. ",

            "answer_text": "An argumentative paper obviously needs to argue for (or against) something. \u201cDemocracy\u201d is a pretty broad topic, as you\u2019re probably aware, so if you haven\u2019t been given any further guidance it\u2019s worthwhile thinking about what you\u2019d be comfortable arguing in that space. You could argue that democracy is the most wonderful thing in the world, or you could argue that it\u2019s terrible - both are pretty broad-brushstroke arguments, but you\u2019d find evidence in either direction. Alternatively, you could try to argue something a bit more specific. \u201cIs x a democracy?\u201d, for example, would involve looking at the political system of wherever you\u2019ve chosen, comparing it with existing definitions of democracy, and drawing a conclusion accordingly. \u201cIs democracy something which suits every country in the world?\u201d is another interesting question, albeit one without a simple answer - so perhaps you\u2019d need more than just one paper to argue this case. Don\u2019t be afraid to adopt a view you don\u2019t personally hold, either. Arguing the opposite view can be very useful as a skill, as it will help to refine your own beliefs on a topic. ",
