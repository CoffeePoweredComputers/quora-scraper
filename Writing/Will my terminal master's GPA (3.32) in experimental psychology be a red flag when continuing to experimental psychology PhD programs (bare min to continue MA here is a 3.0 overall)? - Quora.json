I recommend you contact the specific institutions that you want to attend for the PhD,\u201d but Quora said his answer \u201cneeds improvement\u201d and they collapsed it. I second Steve\u2019s suggestion, but, in addition, it also depends on what the top possible GPA is at the school where you got your MA, and what subjects you got Cs (or lower) in. If the top GPA is a 4.0, a 3.32 doesn\u2019t look that bad, but if it\u2019s a 5.0, the, as you point out, your 3.32 is just above the bare minimum. If you got C grades in statistics, that could count heavily against you, but if it was in a foreign language or a humanities course that might not matter all that much. Another variable is how many other students are applying to do a PhD in experimental psychology in the program(s) you are applying to. Experimental psych is much less competitive than other specialties such as clinical, and you might look OK given their applicant pool. Take Steve\u2019s advice and talk to admissions people at the school(s) you want to attend. ",
