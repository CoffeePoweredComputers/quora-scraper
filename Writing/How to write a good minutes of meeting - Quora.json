Informal session: President first introduces himself to attendees and introduces the interim PnP and Secretary\u2026. An Informal session was led by the president to help attendees get to know some basic information about themselves. Address by the National Y-Clubs Cordinator \u2013 Goddy Nana Mens The YMCA stands for Young Men\u2019s Christian Association. It is the most populated and active youth group in the world. It seeks to empower the youth to find their voice and help them to be heard. Through this it develops the body, mind and soul. It empowers young people for the African renaissance. It might sound like it\u2019s just for males but it\u2019s not. It even has a sister association called the YWCA. Discussion: How to make our voices heard. What is our voice? Our voice is the tool that enables us to be heard by an audience. It could be our actual voices which is the sound we make when we speak verbally or in other forms such as through writing and other extreme actions of communication. Do we access it at all? We have access to our voice when we know what our voice actually is. Except one is prevented from speaking, we do have access to our voice. However we have build upon them to make it relevant. Channels to make our voices heard Channels to make our voices heard include broadcast, online, print, oral language and many others. This could be done by television and radio production, blogging, writing through the print or other online portals not forgetting public speaking and awareness creation campaigns. Are our voices heard by people in authority? No! Why? Are voices are sometimes not heard because we may not be shouting loud enough. It could also be attributed to the fact that we do not do it with consistency to create relevance about our plight. Being consistent and using the right channel of communication will go a long way to being heard and paid attention to. How to build a strong voice Our voices are sometimes heard but ignored because it mostly tends out that it is only one person who fighting to be heard. In such situations the speaker could be easily pulled down but if he is supported by others in unity even if leaders cannot do anything about the situation at a moment they are unable to shut up a group than compared to a single being. We make assumption about how our voices will be paid attention to and this serves as blockades to our voices. The numerical strength is very important in making not just a voice being heard but also the speakers being stronger, protected, difficult to shut up or intimidate and achieving their aim. There is power in unity! Film making seminar and blogging workshop were mentioned among a few as the programs that should be expected for the semester. Interim PnP \u2026 encouraged attendees who had met him previously and requested for a free form for the upcoming to do well to submit it on time.

Africa Alliance of YMCAs guide to AGENDA 2063 was distributed to attendees and the meeting was adjourned sine dire. Adjournment ",
