            "answer_text": "Not only is proofreading something that you should do as a good practice; if the writing is important enough, you should ask someone with top-notch proofreading skills to point out errors in grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and word usage. This is an immeasurable help. In fact, just today I had a proofreader go through a 300-word mini-essay because I know that I can miss my own errors, even when I know the rules. This very short piece of text is destined to be read by many people, so I consider it \u201cimportant\u201d writing, even if it is not profound writing. Anything we write that we anticipate someone else will read should be written so that it is very easy to read. The reason for grammar rules (and even writing style guidelines) is that following them makes it easier for other people to understand what you intend to convey. I know of only one person who does not need to check his grammar when he\u2019s done writing. That\u2019s because he writes and rewrites a phrase at a time so that when he\u2019s placed the period at the end of the sentence, he\u2019s already done his grammar checking\u2026 many times. His readers are typically interested in information and its implications. They do not want to guess what he meant to say. What we write is also a representation of who we are: careless? careful? articulate? inarticulate? competent? incompetent? Generally, our writing and speaking suggest our degree of intelligence, even when that is an inaccurate perception. Those who are articulate (even when they state nonsense) appear to be more competent and knowledgeable than those who are comparatively inarticulate. Similarly, the incorrect usage of terminology is a problem if the reader/listener recognizes the errors. If you are not accurate in your use of language, what else might you not be accurate about? This is a question that the reader is likely to ask if your language is poorly chosen. There are other reasons for checking your grammar and other writing errors, but I believe these are the two that are most important: You want others to understand\u2014 unambiguously and easily\u2014 what you mean, and you want to present yourself as competent and trustworthy regarding the content of your writing.

            "answer_text": "Have you ever read an article or a blog piece and saw a few small, but crucial grammar mistakes? No matter how well written the rest of the piece is, with these few grammar mistakes, the author immediately loses almost all of their credibility. No matter how experienced or professional they are, grammar is still important. The thing is that nobody is immune to these mistakes in spelling or grammar errors. It happens to the best of us, and even the most experienced writers fall victim to these simple mistakes. After all, professional editors exist because all authors inadvertently make grammar or spelling mistakes in their writing. Now, let\u2019s think about the business world. If you were to send an important person an email with grammar mistakes, you just bought yourself a one-way ticket to their trash bin. In professional life, you must double-check everything that you write to make sure it is error free and follows all grammar rules. Now, let\u2019s say that you write professionally for a business. One of the fastest ways to turn customers off is to write a social media post or blog and not double check the grammar. They\u2019ll see the company as unprofessional and sloppy. After all, if they can\u2019t be bothered to double-check their content for grammar, how can they know that the company double-checks their products? For this reason, checking for grammar can mean dollars and sales for any company, so each piece of written content should be treated carefully by the author. If you\u2019re a small business owner that is concerned about the SEO page ranking of your website, grammar is especially important. Google will actually punish websites with poorly written content. If you want to make sure that your website soars to the top of Google\u2019s page rankings, then it is crucial that you use an online more idea grammar checker. With all of this in mind, it\u2019s important to note that not everyone is born with a sense of good grammar. It comes from education, experience, and practice. What if you don\u2019t have time to read books about grammar? More importantly, what if you don\u2019t have the time to painstakingly check over each document after it\u2019s written to make sure that you are using proper grammar? Well, that\u2019s where grammar checkers come in. ",
