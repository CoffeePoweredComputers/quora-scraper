            "answer_text": "It would help to have an example, but off the top of my head, I'd say that both have the same basic elements that create a compelling story arc: a beginning, middle and end; a hero that faces some kind of challenge or conflict; a satisfying ending, and a voice or perspective that somehow resonates with many people or speaks broadly to the human condition.  I suspect what you're saying is that, with genre fiction like fantasy or sci-fi, you can invent thrilling, imaginative and totally unrealistic scenarios and thus it's easier to make the story arc work.  But can you think of a story that you really liked, that pulled you in, that didn't involve those elements? If so, read and re-read it carefully to figure out what the author is doing to pull you into the story, even though there are no aliens or explosions or vampires or whatever.  You might even consider copying the story, by typing or by hand. I've done that and it really helps me understand the author's techniques.  Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Literary fiction is a term principally used for certain fictional works that hold literary merit. In other words, they are works that offer deliberate commentary on larger social issues, political issues, or focus on the individual to explore some part of the human condition. Literary fiction is deliberately written in dialogue with existing works created with the above aims in mind. Literary fiction is focused more on themes than on plot.Literary fiction is usually contrasted with paraliterary fiction (e.g., popular, commercial, or genre fiction). This contrast between these two subsets of fiction is highly controversial amongst critics and scholars who study literature. ",
