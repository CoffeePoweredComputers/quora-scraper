            "answer_text": "I agree with the other answers, write what the heart wants, what you feel, how you feel. Word pictures are always cool. Comparing things to other things to describe the thing also cool. As an example: Lobster as red as a tomato - comparing thing to other thing to illustrate thingShining in the sun like a sparkling ruby - comparing thing to describe thing You have lots of creative freedom, don\u2019t be afraid to write down silly poems if that\u2019s what you\u2019re in the mood for, you\u2019ll improve over time as we all do when we repeat things a lot. It is fun. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi.. Poetry itself is expressive we don't need to make it expressive. Generally we write poem to express ourselves. We don't write in such a way that people should feel it is expressive. So just take pen and paper and jot down whatever you feels. When you'll write what u wanted to express it'll automatically become expressive Thanks for reading.. Keep writing poems ",
