            "answer_text": "When I was working at the Calgary Herald, one of my first jobs there was to lay the Dave Barry column on the page. Berry wrote a famous humor column. I decided to try my hand at writing funny essays and somehow I persuaded a few of the editors there to publish them. Apart from making many, many, many readers laugh (at least three), I ended up having huge quantities of the opposite sex. Maybe you want that too. (Just be aware that if you start losing your funny, the attraction starts to go away too. It\u2019s a lot of pressure. That\u2019s the stage in life I am in now.) For any activity that takes so much time and is so frustrating at times, this is the most fundamental question: why bother? And mostly I\u2019d say, \u201cFor the reader, dumbass.\u201d So this new question, which focuses on the writer, intrigues me \u2014 and gets me to dig into my thinking. That sounds like an opportunity to write an essay. Here goes. (By the way, you will find an example of what I\u2019m saying below in my Quora answer here: Ian van de Burgt's answer to What's an example of knowing how to write a good essay helping you outside of school?). As I see it, there are three main types of essays: there\u2019s a personal essay, persuasive essay \u2014 which would include argumentative \u2014 and expository (the kind you might write in any area of academia, where you explain or expostulate on a topic that involves some expertise or research or ideally both). The three can overlap at times. And they all literally apply to what I\u2019m about to say. (By the way I\u2019m literally dictating this answer into my phone \u2014 literally, it\u2019s about what I\u2019m about to \u201csay\u201d). But in order to keep my discussion broad, I will not focus merely on the specific scholastic types of such writing. As you might guess, a subcategory of each of those three broad categories would be scholastic (intended for school). And the benefits there are too obvious to mention: Good marks. Here are just a few of the other benefits to the writer, and I\u2019m excluding the benefits to the reader which should be obvious (mostly that is to help your reader understand in a deeper way the nature of this world of ours). Frankly, I think it\u2019s the benefits to the readers that provide the most important reason to write essays, but that\u2019s beside the point. So\u2026 focusing on the writer: Writing essays helps you understand your own thinking. Logic does not come naturally to most of us. It takes extreme effort to distill a topic into its component parts. The effort can often help us change our own minds about something.It\u2019s a rigorous exercise for the mind. It\u2019s up there with math and computer science for being demanding on your brain. If you like to stretch your brain, try writing an essay.Here are some less serious reasons:3a. It kills time. When I was writing essays professionally, I would often spend upwards of 20 hours writing a single 800-word essay. That involves a lot of research, including interviewing people. It\u2019s a good way to avoid thinking about the meaninglessness of existence ;) 3b. It\u2019s therapeutic and it costs a lot less than a psychologist. When I was in therapy, and I basically still am, I\u2019d talk for an hour and find enormous relief. I didn\u2019t want to torture any of my friends talking for a straight hour. But it\u2019s seriously what I needed. The only comfort I got from torturing the psychologists this way was that they were getting paid 200 bucks an hour. (At least that\u2019s what I paid one of them.) 3c. It beats all the alternatives. Honestly, think of it. Is it better to be watching TV? You could be texting your friends, I guess. Fantastic. Go for it. You could be inventing a cure for cancer. That\u2019s harder to beat. But even then you might as well write about it in an essay form and share with the world that lovely research. And I\u2019ll keep this entry G rated, and not mention some of the other things you could be doing. But most of those don\u2019t take 20 hours or more. (At least for most of us.) Which brings me back to my main point. Writing essays is ultimately for other people. If you\u2019re like me and get great satisfaction from giving, then that\u2019s the biggest benefit. ",

            "answer_text": "OK. So in a couple of about 4 years ago, I sat down and asked myself this same question, where I wandered what I would gain in essay writing\u2026 I never had an answer to that. When after two years I began schooling, I shared some of my essay work with one of my English teachers. After some time, he called me and said; \u201cI've gone through your essay and I must say that I'm really inspired by your style of writing and all I can say for now is that keep it up and keep writing more. You have the potential and all you need is guidance\u2026\u201d Ever since that day when I began to write and improve my essay writing, I released that it has changed me a lot and sometimes I read my work and I'm like really, did I just do that\u2026 Here's what essay writing does to you.. It builds your vocabulary level and helps you be fluent in which ever language you're writing in\u2026 For instance, if before in your formal letters or essays you wrote sentences like, \u201cI can't tell if the colour is blue or not.\u201d now you write this instead\u201c I can not tell if the colour\u2026\u201dIt widens your thinking ability. Since our schools now a days, give us task like writing about effects of road accidents, benefits of studying abroad, suggest some improvement needed in the health sector, comparing of two professions and other, it allows us to brainstorm ideas and create meaningful work out of them. It also encourages our interests in reading to understand.It builds our confidence level. Through essay writing, many people release their talents in writing and build on improving them. The more you write better and well constructed essays the more confident you become.This and many others are the benefits we get from essay writing\u2026 Essay writing might be stressful especially when you have no or less information about a given topic but what ever the case is you should always take them seriously\u2026 ",
