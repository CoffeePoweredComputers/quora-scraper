            "answer_text": "You walk into a bookstore, looking for a book written in the second person. You look for Bright Lights, Big City but that\u2019s so last century no one carries that book any more. So you you start wondering, why is it you were looking for a book written in the second person? Maybe you were just trying to be iconoclastic? Since I couldn\u2019t find a book in the second person, I started looking for books written in the first person. I looked for The Hunger Games, a great book written in the first person, but that too was out of stock - no longer a popular book. Sadly, David couldn\u2019t find a book written in the second person or the first person. So he went over to the fantasy section and he bought a copy of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - an excellent third person book. And he enjoyed reading it.  Bottom line: First, second, or third person are all great ways to tell stories - I do not have a preference for any of them, as it depends more on the writer\u2019s talent. ",

            "answer_text": "Lately, I prefer to read novels written in the first person format. I like this format because it feels like the narrator is a personal friend.  When you read a book in 1st person, the character(s) pull you into their world, as if connecting with an old friend. The best example I can give is Judy Blume\u2019s, \u201cHey God, it\u2019s Me, Margaret\u201d. Written in the first person through the eyes of a 6th grader, that book felt like a close friend when I was also in the 6th grade. Margaret essentially was me. She had described everything I felt as puberty overcame me. She was the \u201cfriend in my head\u201d (as talk show host, Wendy Williams would say). The first person addresses the reader. I love the intimacy of it. The character tells me secrets and desires that are unknown to the rest of the characters. In this way, it feels like speaking to an old friend. I would recommend this format to readers seeking a closer connection to the characters than second or third person provides. ",

            "answer_text": "I prefer reading a good novel that has the proper manners to grab me from the start over a bad novel that\u2019s slow or pretentious or contrived. I like first person for its immediacy, for the wit and wisdom of the narrator, for its informality. It\u2019s engaging. I like third person for its panoramic vision. The narrator\u2019s omniscience allows us to look into the minds of many characters and to know things and see things a first person narrator might not be able to know and see. I\u2019ll assume that in a good novel the writer had the good sense to choose the best narrative point of view by the final draft. ",

For some nebulous reason I don\u2019t often encounter books in the second person, but as I don\u2019t tend to identify with the main character. I am their sidekick, their shadow, but not them. I can be several shadows, root for the several heroes. I don\u2019t really care in which person the story is told \u2014 as long as I find it acceptable within the book\u2019s logic. Chronicles of Amber are written in the first person. Dilvish the Damned books are written in the third person.

I prefer it because it feels like it\u2019s actually happening to me as I read it. 1st person books and stories just seem to go better in the past tense, since it makes it difficult to create a good ending, but it can be done. 1st person writing also must be cleverly composed because the protagonist can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s happening where he/she isn\u2019t present. I prefer third person present tense writing, and it can be very engaging. ",

            "answer_text": "Both have their own scope of visualization. Let us consider the example of two famous novel series, Harry potter and Twilight (though there are in no standards comparable, but just to give you analogy) Harry Potter is written in third person yet you can attach yourself with every place, person or a moment. On the other hand, twilight which most of the teenage girls connect with is about feeling, the feeling of loving a person and the complications that come with it. This emotions need to be felt and in such case you also limit yourself for one character's account and it is okay to do that if he/she is more than a protagonist but a center of your story.  Now, you decide for yourself whether your story is more about the plot or about the person and go ahead, at the end the reader should connect with it.  All the best!! ",

            "answer_text": "I often write short stories. I prefer third person view. Although it depends totally on the story but still I prefer third person view. I think it has more of a psychological effect. Like when you tell a story in third person view. People try to relate themselves with that person, the situation, and all the feelings. They get more dissolved in the story try to empathise with him/her.  It becomes more than just a story. Whereas when you tell a story in first person view. People just know that its just a story and the author is telling his story narrating it himself. I think they don't get empathise as much with protagonist as they do in third person point of view. And more importantly sometimes they start judging the protagonist. So I prefer third person view. But thats just my opinion :) ",

I would be hard-pressed to express a preference for one style over the other and stick to it. ",
