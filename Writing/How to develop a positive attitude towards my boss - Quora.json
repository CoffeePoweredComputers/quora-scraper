            "answer_text": "Answer to your question largely depends on the personality of the Boss. Without knowing the background of the person, you can not simply develop an attitude towards Boss. I am giving below simple suggestions.. Use it, if you find it appropriate.. Understand that Boss is also a human being just like you, except that (s)he has additional experience and qualifications to become your boss. Respect that.The Boss will also have own emotions, tensions, pressures with higher management as well at home with family. Reality of Life.So some times (s)he may behave irrationally when it goes beyond control. In such situations, do NOT react. Just listen patiently. Most of the times, they feel sorry as well for their rude behaviour. If it becomes a habit, then you have a concern to deal with. Observe this.From your perspective, I suggest you to consider the Boss more of a Mentor or Senior rather thinking he/she is a God / Goddess. Do NOT try to overly please the Boss. It may help in the beginning, but when it becomes an expectation and habit, you will have tough time to please him / her later. Maintain your self-esteem..Watch out how your Boss is treating other employees, colleagues, helpers etc.. It speaks a lot about own personality. Especially the words, language, expressions and tone (s)he uses gives a clue as whether Boss treats others as equal or not. Yardstick for respect.Figure out, whether the Boss does micro (or) macro management on employees daily works. It becomes unbearable some times, when the Boss does micro management style. Trust Factor.People generally prefer the Boss, who delegates and only wish to discuss the outcome at appropriate time rather questioning every step of the process. This will help the employee to self explore and learn the process in own way. Builds up Confidence.As you get to know the Boss well, you will slowly develop a positive or negative attitude to Boss. If negative, you have a reason to think over as what is causing this.Try to ascertain your rights calmly where necessary without being submissive or arrogant.Be prepared for any meeting well in advance, so that you leave a good impression with your Manager. Earns you respect.Say what you can do and DO what you say. This will builds up confidence in you and Manager can always count on you in critical situations.Hope this helps.. ",

            "answer_text": "There seems to be some past history and strong reasons why you have developed negativity towards your boss. In any case this is not good for you in the long run and can impact your professional life immensely. Please feel free to try the following measures to get rid of negative attitude. Consciously look for the positives. You may be focusing too much on the negative side. Think and act professional. Get often the attitude we develop is more a consequence of our personal nature and traits. Maintain safe distance. This may well depend on the job profile you carry. The more the proximity, the larger the tendency for this attitude to breed. Maintain documentation. For all that you say or do, keep record. This will help you explain things in correct perspective to your boss, should you find an opportunity. If all this does not help, may be you should work for another boss!! ",
