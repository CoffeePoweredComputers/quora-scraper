            "answer_text": "I don't see that as being essential one way or another in regard to the aid to memory. The text itself is the main thing and if well written it can aid memory. If not, then memory is hindered by such phrasing. I remember the problem from my School studies when I tried to rephrase what the text book said for the Physics homework. It led to no end of aggro. Cryptic this and cryptic that. That's basically what I got from the teachers remarks. My friend just copied the text in the text book and got no problems in doing so. The original text in the text book was obviously black. Maybe black ink is cheaper than blue ink and that's why it's used. :I liked blue ink as well as black ink for my pens yet switched to purple-black later on as that looked more distinctive to me at that time. Nowadays it's pick up a pen and write with it. But the days of fountain pens are basically behind me now. I would also question whether the pen itself has a better chance of us remembering text. I used italic pens till teachers began to dictate text to the class and quickly discarded that type of pen in favour of a biro. :Later on, I got even faster-flowing pens. That led to the ability to write more words in a limited time, such as for homework and exams. Another factor is using a fine point rather than a medium or broad tipped pen, whether a fountain pen or some other pen. Another factor is that web pages have guidelines and shorter lines are easier to read and to understand. It's the same with writing poetry for poetry publishers and competitions. Perhaps a maximum of 70 characters including spaces. So presentation matters as does the use of handwriting styles, or calligraphy styles, or basic text that separates each letter for easier reading displays.:Memory aids like highlighting text will prove useful, yet my teachers encouraged us to provide headings for our paragraphs to identify topics quickly. Even so, the aim was getting top marks and that led to writing more text. That meant trying to learn more text later on. So the more we read, the more we need. Whatever makes it easier to read gets my vote, but blue tends to fade, while black tends to be a dominant colour when using broad point pens. So I'd suggest a fine point black ink pen's text would be easier to read and to remember.: ",

However, I seriously doubt that there\u2019s a statistical correlation when someone habitually uses blue or black ink. You\u2019d rapidly numb yourself to any attention getting effect or psychological advantage. Mixing up the colors and correlating them to subjects, note type or other patterns would likely be more impactful that just sticking to a blue or black pen. In many fields, the color of the ink was actually correlated to the seniority or authoritative nature of what was being written. Blue was the standard \u201cworker bee\u201d color, black was for managers and green was either an intern color or for senior managers (depending on the field/office). That way you could immediately tell how much authority a note had or the level of any signature. Offices tended to maintain large stores of blue pens and much smaller batches of black, green, red and light blue. ",

Mine is a medium blue ink and I do enjoy even the feel and the shape of the pen. Black is a color of a notebook or even titles of a books. Have you found a book with blue printing in it. The chances are not. So the medium blue ink is rarely used, but does stand at the ready. Then the other thing is the color blue itself. My own computer has a limiter which reduces at a certain time of night and the blue color is shifted to the other colours. This is a gaming computer so not everyone uses these sorts of monitors. Outside in the sunshine. The glare from the snow is almost blue shifted. Night arrives and then becomes almost calmer. I even have yellow tinted reading glasses. What colour is the blue car when you see this in the darkness of night. I also have blue eyes and I do get that remark at times often in a store when I walk inside and \u201cbig bright beautiful blue eyes\u201d. May I help you lady. There is no reason and every reason to recall nothing, but your own school work comes to mind you like the touch and feel of the pen. The words you see as blue but both calming and as reminder this is something I shall need in the future. Try those ideas Ozzie Sims ",

            "answer_text": "I am not sure of the other answers but they sound intuitively correct. I am going to say that if you study memory techniques, color is significant for bringing the right brain into the pattern. Most of what we are doing in learning is left brain (verbal skills including writing, naming, logic, sequential. Color is often urged in mind mapping and other note taking and it is used to have the memory connection of dendrites pass through the medulla oblongata where the two hemispheres of the brain are connected. There may be uncertainty as to why it is true but there is no doubt that it is a way to amplify transfer from short term to long term memory. It is inherently a major aspect of any effective memory technique whether conscious or not. But using blue ink instead of black ink is only one small piece. It is like making a cake with flour but no eggs, sugar, etc. Get a good book on memory, study and note-taking techniques. I recommend Tony Buzan. When you visualize and associate, use a lot of imagination and COLOR. ",

This has started around third grade and kept on all the way. I only had black pens basically. And I did very well in school, excellent in the memorization exercises which are basically daily... I still prefer black ink, however I rarely hand write these days. As it is not a regular habit, I can just use any pens I find. Actually, I gotta keep blue ink pens as certain documents must be signed in blue. ",

If two colours or more are used in the paragraph, it brings our attention easily on the lines of different colours especially other than blue and black. And therefore memorization is easy as it requires attention first and repeatation plays a major role. So do not depend on colour of the ink but depend only on attention and repeatation.  ",
