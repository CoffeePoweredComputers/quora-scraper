            "answer_text": "The first question I ask while writing a story is \u201cWho is my reader?\u201d If the answer is that everybody or only a targeted reader can read my story, then i tailor the words and plot accordingly. Next question is that \u201cDoes the reader understand my story or is the story written in a simple way to understand.\u201d If it is, then i definitely can move to the next question and that is \u201cIs my story enough to keep the reader engaged and does it get him curious to flip the page to go onto the next part of the story. He needs to be like \u201cWhat happens next? \u201c Decisions of genre, format of book, roughly how it ends should be decided prior to beginning writing according to me. Hope my Answer helped. ",

            "answer_text": "WARNING: I'm just an aspiring author. You can skip this answer, but I'll try to be of help. Basically every story starts with an absurd idea. Assuming that you already got that, I'd start with asking the 5Ws: when, where, what,who and why. Mostly, one or two of these doubts are already answered. Elaborating on my previous statement, assume it's a love story between two people. Ask yourself, who are these two people, what is their personality like, where,when and why did they meet and most importantly; WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? Proceed with asking all sorts of random questions with every passing phase of your story like a reader. Like a writer, ask yourself what can be better than that with one objective: how to make things interesting. ",
