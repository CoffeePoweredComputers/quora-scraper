            "answer_text": "What Are Primary Sources? Primary sources are documents, images or artifacts that provide firsthand testimony or direct evidence concerning an historical topic under research investigation. Primary sources are original documents created or experienced contemporaneously with the event being researched. Primary sources enable researchers to get as close as possible to what actually happened during an historical event or time period. As an example, a diary from an immigrant from Vietnam to the United States documenting her travel experiences from Vietnam to Orange County would be considered a primary source for research on Vietnamese immigration to Orange County. However, a book written by a professor that analyzes the various writings of Vietnam immigrants and interprets the experience of those immigrants is a secondary source for this research. Examples of Primary Sources : Archives and manuscript materials, photographs, audio recordings, video recordings, films, journals, letters and diaries, speeches, scrapbooks, published books, newspapers and magazine clippings published at the time, government publications, oral histories & interviews, records in and of organizations, autobiographies and memoirs, printed ephemera (e.g. admission ticket, play, movie, advertisement, etc.) artifacts, e.g. clothing, costumes, furniture, tools, etc., research data, e.g. public opinion polls Secondary sources are works that analyze, assess or interpret an historical event, era, or phenomenon, generally utilizing primary sources to do so. Secondary sources often offer a review or a critique. Secondary sources can include books, textbooks, biography, historical novels, newspaper editorials, journal articles, speeches, reviews, research essays, and more. Generally speaking, secondary sources are written well after the events that are being researched (non-contemporaneously). However, if an individual wrote about events that he or she experienced first-hand many years after that event occurred, it is still considered a primary source because it is a direct account from a participant or witness to the event. Examples: Sleeper, Jim. The First Forty Years: The Story of Old Newport, 1868-1908. Newport Beach, Calif.: Irvine Company, 1968. Raup, Hallock Floyd. The German colonization of Anaheim, California. Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press. 1932. Barron, Hal S., et al. Citriculture and Southern California. San Francisco, Calif.: California Historical Society, 1995. Finney, Ben R. Surfing: a history of the ancient Hawaiian sport. San Francisco: Pomegranate Artbooks, c1996. ",
