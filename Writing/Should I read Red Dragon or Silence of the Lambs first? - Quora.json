            "answer_text": "If you're watching the films then definitely Lambs, but as for the books then it doesn't really matter that much. There's only a couple of references to Red Dragon in Lambs. Red Dragon is the first (and in my opinion the best) though, so you might want to start with that. Definitely don't start with Hannibal or Hannibal Rising, though. ",

Thomas Harris created a great character in Hannibal Lecter, then blew it by giving him an \u201corigin story\u201d. Lecter was much scarier without it. (\u201cNothing happened to me, Clarice. I happened.\u201d) ",
