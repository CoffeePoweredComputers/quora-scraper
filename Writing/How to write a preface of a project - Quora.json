            "answer_text": "What I include below would be appropriate whether your project is one related to hard science, social science, or the arts. If you are proposing a project, normally there is not a preface to the project proposal. However, you will likely need an executive summary. An executive summary should be no nonsense. It tells the executive the purpose of the project, the promised deliverables, the potential value of the project (which is usually more than a financial value and can be stated as the motivation for the project), the cost per month (or year), and the number of full-time-equivalent personnel needed and any other substantial investments that would need to be made. If any of the project team members has exceptional qualifications, that should be stated early on in the executive summary. Unless the project is very complicated, the executive summary should be under 500 words or about one single-spaced page. Often, if you are applying for funding for a project from an organization or institution, there is a standard template that you must follow. If the \u201crequest for proposal\u201d (RFP) describes what kind of projects the funding agency is looking for, make sure your project actually addresses the project requirements in terms of topic and approach. The guidance for a final report on a project is similar: There is no preface. There is almost always an executive summary that is followed by a more complete restatement of the original project purpose, specifics about what deliverables were produced (in fact, you can include the design and documentation deliverables as appendices), more complete information about what value there turned out to be from completing the project, and what it actually cost. If you\u2019ve delivered value beyond what was anticipated, it\u2019s nice to state that after the financial information. It is also important to briefly summarize the next steps (a follow-on project, for example), if there are any. ",
