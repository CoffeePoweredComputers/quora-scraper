            "answer_text": "There is nothing in terms of materials used in a Mont Blanc pens that is different from all other fountain pens. So, if an ink works in other fountain pens, it should work in a Mont Blanc. So, if an ink is made for fountain pens (as against dip pens, in which case, it may be thick and may also clog the insides easily) then it should work with a Mont Blanc. I do not own a Mont Blanc, but I know people who own Mont Blancs and use non-Mont Blanc inks without problem. Further, first hand feedback on this specific question is already available on fountainpennetwork.com, for instance there is a thread that goes \u201cother ink in Mont Blanc fp\u201d.. ",

Never use registrars ink or calligraphy inks in a fountain pen.Any good quality ink (and many poor ones as well)  will work in any fountain pen although the manufacturer might try to tell you that only their ink will work. In that case, I suggest you avoid buying into a pen that is so fragile.Experiment ",
