            "answer_text": "I don't disagree with anything posted thus far, but I would like to add to it.  To me at least, when I finish a book or a TV series I really loved, I suffer a sort of temporary depression.  As noted already, you have invested a lot of time to the story by the time it's over.  If either was well-written, and especially if the TV show was well acted/choreographed/filmed/etc.  you may very well have lost yourself in the fantasy while watching or reading.  This is the whole point of art- or at least much of art- to trigger a deep emotional response.  In the case you're talking about, it's not just the beauty or truth you are emotionally responding to, but it's also the characters themselves.  In a really good show or book, you may not consciously realize just how much you relate to the characters.  They become close friends, possibly even family to you- at least while reading or watching. But once the show ends (or you've finished the last page) the illusion falls apart.  You remember, often very consciously- that what you have just subjected yourself to is a work of fiction.  However, the \"heart\" or the unconscious mind if you prefer, simply remembers the empathic connections you've felt for the characters and/or story- often the protagonist- but definitely not limited to it.   But your conscious mind overrules it, and now your heart has to suffer the loss of some of your closest friends (albeit only while reading or watching the show) with absolutely no sense of closure.  How do you mourn the loss of people who never existed in the first place?   So it hurts- often pretty badly- if it was a long show or book, and you really got into the story.    ",

            "answer_text": "I relate to this a lot and infact searched up this question to see what others are saying. I've noticed from a very young age ( I'm only 15 but had a lot of the same feelings when I was around like 9, though I've obviously matured since thus seeing things through a whole different lense) that anytime I read a book, watched a anime or movie ect, if it's really well written, you actually feel, for the duration of the series, immersed in their world. It especially hits hard characters we relate to in some manner, but even if they're just likable and someone you could see being friends with. The more you relate and feel their emotions, the more they feel, like a friend in a way. You may even find yourself gasping or even vocally cheering or talking to the characters even tho they can't hear you. This is all ofcourse, signs of a good writer. I love books, and also anime, movies, tv shows, video games ect (though books are my favorite and movies a close second) and want to be a writer myself. I always like to fully digest anything I get into, everything from how the characters feel, why things might happen the way they did, and even symbolism down to the past detail. That is the beauty of literature and fiction. Every artist's goal is to create a complex world around their characters and bring them to life. The writers want us to feel these characters feelings and relate and the whole reason we read these stories is to take a break from reality, thus we become a part of their world for a while. So when you finish a book, anime, movie or whatever, it is natural to feel a sadness similar to a friend moving away. Like that world just closed its doors on you. But it's okay. If you enjoyed the book hold onto it read the same book years later and visit them again. You might learn something you didn't pick up the first time. If the book was a darker story, and has a sad or bittersweet ending, it is normal to feel concerned or mournful of the characters. I just finished reading Scorpions by Walter Dean Myers, and Jamal had to be one of the most tragic, and in s lot of ways painfully relatable protagonists I've ever known. This book made me cry and the ending was also very sad and I felt concerned for Jamal, even after finished the book. But I love it with a passion cuz of the deep, very real problems and feelings of the characters. Mr Myers was amazing and this book made me forever a fan of him. It's so sad but he touches very real problems and brings his characters to life. Another favorite of mine is Agatha Christie. Hers feel a little less relatable cuz it's more historical like, but Hercule Poirot is very likable and her mysterious are the best. Again the story just sucks you into their world cuz she is also an amazing writer. I read lots of books but those two authors are the most prominent household names for me. What helps me when I feel sad cuz I just came back from a fictional universe and miss the characters is to just sit there and think for a while about the good things. Think what you might have learned from these characters, how you relate to them, if you do, what the deeper meaning the authors are trying to tell you about might be, and so on. Think about how this all relates to you and how what you learned from them can help you. Also think about the symbolism and what it might tell you about then as a character and maybe think about the author. Go online and read about the author and who they are as a person, maybe check out their other works, or just pick up another book and find another world to visit and maybe another author will make his or her way to your list of favorites. Also it's great to check out biographies of the artists themselves if you can get your hands on one, like Bad Boy, from Walter Dean Myers is a look back to his childhood. It's sad but it shows how he got stronger from all he endured and the main character is literally Mr Mr Myers himself as a kid. I didn't get a chance to read it yet but I told my friend I like Walter Dean Myers and she told me about it so it's on my list of books to buy and I reccomend other fans of Mr Myers to buy this book as well. Also its good to read up on other stories based on real people. Political Activists, Heroes of WWII, anything about real cowboys or Native Americans, all these people are also heroes to me. Unwrap their stories and see what you can learn. Feel their pain, their triumphs and get to know them. Now a lot of the stories I read make me tear up and mourn for them, but it just reminds me I still have a heart. Take care and hope I was of some help too ",
