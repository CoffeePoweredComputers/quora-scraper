            "answer_text": "Nobody really needs a pen these days, but here are the reasons I love mine: I like the feel of it in my hand more and I think it writes more smoothly than regular pens. I like that is refillable. I think it is better for the environment. However, the main reason I love my fountain pen is kind of silly: it makes me feel more like a \u201creal\" writer. I am not a fountain pen expert, but I hope this was helpful. ",
