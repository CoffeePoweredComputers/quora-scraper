            "answer_text": "A good professor is there to help you be successful not make you struggle to learn the material. I\u2019ve only ever met one professor worthy of being called a \u2018good\u2019 professor. All his classes were easy and you didn\u2019t have to put forth much effort. Crazy right? College? No way\u2026 At my College, people know this professor and his classes as \u2018easy\u2019. But I love it, at the beginning of all his classes he talks to us about his goals for the class. It goes something like this\u2026 \u201cI\u2019ve designed this course to help you succeed as long as you attend class and do the work I\u2019ve assigned, you will be successful by simply doing. I\u2019m not here to trick or make you struggle, my goal is teach you what you need to know. My exams are exactly what I teach and have assigned for practice, do it and you will succeed.\u201d He made learning easy and that\u2019s what a great professor is/does. He\u2019s able to get his message and teach his material without inciting fear, stress or any other unnecessary emotional state that professors tend to do. Being able to teach is a skill. A skill that you need first before your knowledge can become valuable to students. All that knowledge is near useless if you can\u2019t effectively communicate/convey it. This is a great professor and the people he\u2019s worked with in the past (post grad students etc) have gone on to achieve greatness in the tech industry. I won\u2019t mention his name here in respect for his privacy. ",

            "answer_text": "You know that you have a good professor once you see that they\u2019ll commit to the student learning experience. I go to UCLA, which is a large public research institution. Many of the professors there are there honestly for the research grant. But there are a select few that genuinely want to teach. I\u2019ll give you a real world example: My math professor of my freshman year dedicates not only office hours 3x a week but also holds review sessions before midterms and finals. How is this so special you say? It is the fact that he chooses to stay for the entire review session until every student\u2019s questions are answered, which often take up to 6 hours. That is how I knew that my professor was not only a good professor, but one of the best. But to quickly answer your question, you could simply go on ratemyprofessor.com which is a website that has a collection of student reviews. There you could look up your professor\u2019s name and see what other students have to say. Beware however that many reviewers are simply students that either really like the class or really hate it. This leads to the ratings being skewed to the extreme. ",
