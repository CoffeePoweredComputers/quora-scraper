            "answer_text": "I suppose it depends on how you'd like to learn it and what for, but in either case it really suffices to determine the \u201chow\u201d part. That being said, if you're looking to take the more abstract theory based approach, then I'd read Axler\u2019s Linear Algebra Dome Right. It isn't necessarily a beginners book by any means, but it's nicely written and isn't entirely incomprehensible if you've got some experience with those types of books. There are also plenty of books published by Dover, I forget their names, but there's a few. I'm not really a fan, but I've got them on my shelf anyways! The problem with learning Linear Algebra for the first time with these books is that many of them tend to be verbose to a fault and use mathematical terminology that may beyond the first timer\u2019s comfort zone. Another problem that often occurs with learning the theory first is that while you may be able to understand what you're reading and prove some nice theorems, you might not actually know, in practice, how to solve a linear system, find a basis with Gram-Schmidt, find a null space, get eigenvectors and values, or even use Gaussian-elimination. If in that case you decide to go the other route and learn what I'll call the practical part first, I'd recommend starting with Khan academy videos, they should be a good introduction, then read something like Strang\u2019s Linear Algebra. Once you understand it all from a practical point of view you can go back and learn the theory behind it and have a better idea of what exactly you're working with when your reading or writing the proofs.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. There's lots of other answers here, encouraging good study habits, practice on problems, looking for other resources, and so on - and they're all good answers. I thought I'd try a different type of answer - see Chris Nash's answer to Is linear algebra a hard class? Why or why not? as an explanation of why I think this can be a hard subject to get to grips with. The difficult bit is understanding - once you have a mental model of what's going on, things will become much easier. Depending on how your mind works, that can be different for different people. However, I'm going to take a risk and give you my \"aha!\" moment. It may or may not work for you. Here it comes: Everything's a matrix. Everything - at least in this subject anyway. A row vector? It's just a matrix with one row. A column vector? Same again. You can view a matrix as a set of row vectors, or a set of column vectors. Often, it makes sense to switch between the two ways of thinking. But wait, I said \"everything\". What about all those operations, the things you can do to matrices or vectors? Well, they can also be treated as matrices too. Vector products? Treat them as multiplying two matrices - one a row vector, one a column. Row reduction? Turns out that's just pre-multiplying by a matrix; similarly column operations are post-multiplying by a matrix. Maybe \"everything\" is a bit of a stretch. But one thing is certain - if you are fluent in matrices, linear algebra will make a lot more sense. If you can manipulate matrices as comfortably as you can manipulate numbers, the subject will be easier to study. After all, the \"linear\" part in \"linear algebra\" essentially means - there's matrices here. Get comfortable with those, and you'll be as familiar with them as you were with \"ordinary\" algebra - and, if you're fortunate enough to get a \"aha!\" moment, it may all fall into place. ",
