            "answer_text": "No, because plot is one element of a story rather than a synonym for a story. Other parts of a story can be characterization, foreshadowing, description, setting, ambience, the dramatis personae, and style. Plot is merely the story\u2019s backbone. So, it\u2019s no more redundant to say \u201cthe plot of the story\u201d than it is to say \u201cthe backbone of the person,\u201d or \u201cthe engine of the car.\u201d Both spinal columns and engines are very important, but they aren\u2019t equivalent to the whole person or the whole car.
