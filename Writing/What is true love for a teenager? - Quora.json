Just because you like someone, you bear with all their habits good or bad, and you two bond really well doesn't mean that's love. Love is a lot more. And it surely is impossible to know in a teen age. Your true Love right now can be food, some tv series character, Some sports or any stupid ass thing Enjoy your life. Don't even think about Love from now on. ",
