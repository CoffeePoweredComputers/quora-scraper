            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t create a horror book, you write a horror book. The tip to write a successful book in any genre is to avoid using cliches. Vampires, werewolves and the like have been exploited so often that you\u2019d be hard-pressed to come with something innovative. Honestly, the best thing you can do is to read other horror books. Stephen King, for example, tries putting ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, and that\u2019s one of the reasons he\u2019s famous. I can\u2019t name horror writers off the top of my head, but a bit of googling can always help. Remember, don\u2019t try emulating their style unless for practising. If you\u2019re just starting off as a writer, I\u2019d advise you to consider writing short-stories first. Take part in competitions, too. Finally, with a bit of experience and imagination, you\u2019d be able to start writing your book. Good luck! ",

Work from your best effort, but remember to rewrite painstakingly, and embellish it. Then do an expanded outline from there, and write and rewrite the story. ",
