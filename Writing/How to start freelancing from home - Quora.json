            "answer_text": "First buy a pc / laptop + good internet connection according to your skillset. For example; If you\u2019re a writer/coder \u2014 even normal and cheap laptop/pc would be fine. If you\u2019re a video editor / graphic designer \u2014 get a very good laptop / pc When your car is ready then start driving on the road: Find a marketplace (e.g. Upwork, Guru).Create an account (prepare, setup, verify).Start finding projects (scanning / review / understanding).Start offering your service with solution (proposal).Communicate and close the deal (have good English).Deliver beyond expectations (blow away with quality result).Get an excellent feedback (and also provide back good feedback).And yes, if client comes back later on for any issue, welcome with smile, don\u2019t leave in the darkness just because you had been given money. Repeat from point #3 to point #7 \u2014 you can also become a top freelancer one day with consistency and top-notch services. And if you need access to a top 1% legendary freelancer for one day to consume from a lot of experience then feel free to come here and have a 1\u20131 meeting :) ",

            "answer_text": "Search for remote jobs. There are many ways of searching for remote jobs. I use freelancing platforms like Freelancer, People per Hour and Guru. UpWork and Fiverr are other popular ones. These platforms charge a fee from the amount of the contract - sometimes before you get paid but often after you get paid. They typically have an Escrow service that takes the money from the employer and keeps it, releasing it after the task is complete. The types of jobs posted here include jobs for writers, web designers, coders, data entry, transcriptionist, book keeper, translation, etc. ",
