            "answer_text": "This is going to be a controversial answer, but I think Mayella Ewell from Harper Lee\u2019s novel To Kill a Mockingbird gets a lot of unnecessary hate. Mayella is not as great a victim as Tom Robinson, but she is a very real victim in her own right. Atticus recognizes this when he speaks to the jury about his sympathy for Mayella\u2019s poverty, ignorance and abusive circumstances. No one should ever excuse Mayella for lying about Tom Robinson\u2019s raping her. However, hating Mayella is emotionally and intellectually lazy. Hating Mayella is a safe route for readers\u2014particularly white readers\u2014who would rather pat themselves on the back because they aren\u2019t like her. It\u2019s easier to hate Mayella than to confront the issues of poverty, ignorance, and abuse that shape her. It\u2019s also comfortable to overlook the self-righteousness in oneself that the citizens of Maycomb reflect in their contemptuous tolerance of the Ewell family. Why does Tom Robinson pity Mayella Ewell? She is a white woman whose racial privilege conveys the power of life and death over him. Readers do well to examine why Tom pities Mayella before indulging in uncritical hatred of her. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a feeling I might know who you had in mind when you A2A\u2019d me on this, Sujata. Of course, the first unfortunate fictional soul who comes to mind is the Lady of Winterfell herself, Sansa Stark of A Song of Ice and Fire/\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d. I\u2019m going to go mainly on the show here, having still not finished the books. ***Potential plot spoilers ahead for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d*** Look, I get it - Sansa didn\u2019t acquit herself especially well early on. She was bratty and selfish. She had stars in her eyes; all she wanted was to marry the handsome prince, wear pretty dresses, be Queen, and have lots of little princes and princesses (and eat lemon cakes, of course). She wasn\u2019t quite truthful about what happened with Joffrey and Mycah at the Trident (a decision her father explained to Arya fairly well, I thought, and one that Sansa ultimately paid dearly for). Yes, she still wanted to marry Joffrey for a time even after seeing him for what he really was. But by the end of the first season, that silly, starry-eyed little girl began to learn and to evolve. Here\u2019s the thing that really grinds my gears: a lot of the hate I see directed at Sansa is less about her actions and more about her being a feminine woman, with traditionally feminine interests and behavior. She\u2019s not a \u201cbadass\u201d like her sister. She likes singing and needlework and - gasp! - knitting (oh, the horror!), not archery and swordplay. She likes being a lady. And people hate her for that. They call her weak. They call her useless. She\u2019s just a victim. They don\u2019t see that the things she endured required their own kind of strength and toughness. They don\u2019t see that a woman can be strong without swinging a sword. They don\u2019t see that sometimes, especially in a situation like the one she was in in King\u2019s Landing, one of the best ways to protect yourself is to know to pick your moments, to know when to keep your mouth shut, to wait for the right opportunity. To wear your courtesy like armor. And in keeping her mouth shut and picking her moments, she learned a great deal - from some real pros, too. Now she\u2019s ruling the whole damn North - and doing a bangup job of it. Look, badass women are great. I\u2019ve always been a tomboy myself, while my sister has always been the \u201cgirly\u201d one. But I refuse to believe that a woman has to act in a traditionally masculine way in order to be strong. If a woman likes swordfighting and archery and doesn\u2019t want to be a \u201clady,\u201d I totally support her. And if another woman likes knitting and getting dressed up and singing songs, I support her, too. If everyone was the same, life would be awfully boring. So leave my girl Sansa alone and let her do her girly thing, people.  (Photo credit: Entertainment Weekly) ",
