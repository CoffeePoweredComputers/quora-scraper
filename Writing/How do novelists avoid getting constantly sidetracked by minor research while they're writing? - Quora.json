            "answer_text": "\u201cHow do novelists avoid getting constantly sidetracked by minor research while they're writing?\u201d With a bit of self-discipline and a trick that helps postpone minor research. You\u2019ll mark the place in your novel where some information is lacking and you need to be consistent in what characters you are using to mark the places. Like: Marcus hollered: \u201cWe need to get the car fixed. I guess it is the [insert tech babble here] \u2026\u201d\u00a0Or: Every year on the day of saint ## need to research what saint\u2019s day it is ## our little group of friends came back together, to \u2026\u00a0After you\u2019ve finished your prose, you\u2019ll use the search feature of your word processor to go through all the minor research and fill it in. This way your writing flow won\u2019t be interrupted by minor research and you will get actual writing done. ",

            "answer_text": "I always find myself sidetracked. Personally, I think it works best for me. I never do an outline and I usually just have some basic idea in my head. Right before I start a new project I will do basic research, get back round knowledge on my people and setting, and find stuff that I will need to know. After I start writing I will add in details and inevitably will need to fact check them. I personally don\u2019t see anything wrong with getting side-tracked from there (Unless you end up on twitter or something). The more you know about the subject the better. Actually, the more you know in general, the better. ",
