            "answer_text": "No. A speech writer knows pretty much what the president (or presidential candidate) wants to say, and will often have a list of main topics and/or points. By the time someone has won the presidency, they will have a team of speech writers. The team will usually put together an outline or a draft, and then see what the president (or candidate) thinks of it, then produce a complete draft for the president (or candidate) to read through. My limited experience is that the read-through will include parts of the speech (maybe the whole thing) spoken aloud, so see if the tone works, and the overall rhythm is comfortable for the speaker. Peggy Noonan apparently had Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cvoice\u201d down pat. Depending on the venue, the topic, and the time allowed, there may be some cutting necessary. Despite all that, some presidents (or presidential candidates) just can\u2019t deliver a speech well. Walter Mondale comes to mind. And the current POTUS likes to depart from a text, because he seems to feel he can read the crowd, and the specific contents of much of the speech are not that important. That leads to some objectively bad deliveries, but his fans seem not to care. ",

It\u2019s hard to speak in front of a large number of people and/or the press and always be erudite and on top of your game. They have many different events and issues to attend to, so speech writing if they did it themselves could end up taking all their time, so it helps to have people who know how they think about issues and what they wish to express to do it for them.

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. The speech writer puts what the President wants to say in prose. The writer is skilled at inciting people by how his words are structured. JFK is known for having said, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, but what do can do for your country.\u201d RFK - \u201cSome people see thing as they are and ask why. I see things that aren\u2019t, and ask why not.\u201d Being able to put words together that catches the imagination is a gift. These speech writers have an idea or outline of the President\u2019s agenda. It is his job to put words together to convey this to the American public, as the President attends to other details. Often their are numerous speech writers as the President can give numerous speeches in a single day to different groups and rallies. It take time to write a speech, often time the President doesn\u2019t have with his busy schedule. Speech writers often have to review facts and do hours of research, that relate to the audience they are trying to connect with. How well they write, and the President can deliver, does a lot to create a positive image of the President. The President also has the option of editing and the ability to ad lib. President Ronald Reagan went to Berlin, and mentioned he would like to make a statement about the Soviets removing the Berlin Wall. All his advisers cautioned against the President about making such a statement, so the speechwriters left this out. Reagan was overlooking the West German crowd standing in front of the wall, was overcome, and stated, \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\u201d This was one of President\u2019s most memorial lines he ever spoke as President. So in the final saying of words uttered, the President came say anything he wants. ",

Trump doesn\u2019t have the words himself for these. But in the other kind, he is given notes from the voter samplings of new or tried and true epithets conjured for these folks, as test groups, to see if they\u2019re still valuable. And then he tries them out in his stand-up routines to see what happens. He may already have something in the prompter, but he is known for going off script, to the great amazement and delight of his cult. So to be brief, in the one kind he is told what to say, and in the other, he is telling others what to say. ",

What we do is get to know our principal (client) as well as we can, try to capture his or her voice, find out what he or she wants to say, and then say it as compellingly as possible. It is usually a collaborative effort; often we can be very helpful in pulling stories from the client that make the subject vivid and real, or finding the perfect detail or turn of phrase to illustrate a point. Occasionally it is up to the speechwriter to come up with the appropriate thing for a President to say, such as when William Safire was given the unenviable task of preparing remarks for President Nixon in case the Apollo 11 mission failed. And it does seem as if the speechwriters for the current occupant of the Oval Office are sometimes trying to tell him what to say, as with the remarks after the recent shootings. It very clear when he is reading something off a teleprompter or when he is speaking off the cuff, and the messages are often diametrically different. But usually speechwriter and client are on the same page. Thanks for asking. ",

Trump\u2019s speech following that tragedy, echoed the views of concerned voters who are upset at the carnage. A couple of days later, he was walking all that back as he again incited his followers to trash minorities.
