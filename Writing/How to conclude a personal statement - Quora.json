            "answer_text": "Target Your Audience Begin by targeting your central message to your intended readers. If you are applying to a college, graduate or professional school, state specifically why that school or specific program interests you and why you would be a good fit for the program. Main Message Determine the main message you wish to convey in your conclusion. Rather than merely summarizing the rest of your statement, use your conclusion to expand upon the themes you developed earlier in the statement and show them in a wider context. For instance, if the body of your statement describes how your interest in studying speech therapy was piqued by your childhood stuttering problem, your conclusion could discuss how this experience will shape the way you study and work in speech therapy in the future. Answer any questions or address any required themes or topics in your conclusion. Use Interesting Language Use vivid, clear language and provide concrete examples to convey your message. For instance, don\u2019t just state you are resilient and handle adversity well. Instead, describe an incident in which you used these traits to your advantage. Be Honest Be honest when writing your personal statement. Don\u2019t second-guess your readers and write only what you think they want to hear or what they expect in a statement. Use this written opportunity to reveal your own unique personality and character. Revisit Draft Set your conclusion aside for a few days after you complete it and then revisit the document. Imagine how a potential reader who has never met you and knows nothing about your life story would react to it. Ideally, your personal statement will make your readers want to meet you in person. Convey Professionalism Check your grammar, punctuation and spelling or have a trusted instructor or friend do this for you. Make your statement, especially the conclusion, convey professionalism and competence. Give yourself several weeks to write and revise your personal statement. No matter how good a writer you are, you will need more than one draft to complete a strong statement that also expresses who you are. Don't write it all at the last minute; give yourself several weeks to write and revise your personal statement. No matter how good a writer you are, you may need several drafts to perfect it. Finally, before submitting, enlist trusted instructors and friends to read over your drafts, give you honest feedback and check for any spelling or grammatical errors. ",

            "answer_text": "The process of applying to any higher education institution can be pretty complex, competitive and take plenty of time. If you\u2019re already a Bachelor, then you know it like nobody else. It\u2019s a long way to the top before you actually get admitted to the university or college of your dreams. You\u2019ll have to submit a set of different application papers required by the institution you\u2019ve chosen and the Personal Statement for Graduate School is the most crucial one here.  It\u2019s your opportunity to \u201ctalk\u201d directly to the admission committee and convince them why you deserve to be accepted to a particular program. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to make it as effective as possible. Your PS may even be the basis for your interview so the more compelling it is, the more chances you\u2019ll have to get accepted. Show why you\u2019re a good fit for the course you\u2019re applying to and state the reason for choosing their university in particular. When building your personal statement, make sure that you sound confident and convincing. Explain why you want to study a specific subject, mention any relevant past experience than might help you succeed in the chosen field and what you\u2019ve done to contribute to the university community. Also, it would be appropriate if you tell what makes you an interesting and unique person (your hobbies, sports, special achievements, skills, any significant responsibilities, other extra-curricular activities and, in fact, anything that reflects your personality from a positive point of view.  Don\u2019t forget to clarify why you\u2019re the one who should be chosen among all other candidates since it\u2019s essential to make the admission officers understand what makes you unique compared with the rest of the applicants. If you have any work experience, voluntary work or you\u2019ve taken part in some projects related to the program you\u2019ve chosen, you can include that information in your PS as well. When you\u2019re finally done with the introductory and body parts of your personal statement, it\u2019s time to think how to end it in such a way as to make a long-lasting impression on the admission committee. Your conclusion has to be memorable and catchy. Tell the reviewers how important it is for you to become a part of their school, how passionate you are about the course, what your goals are and in what way you can contribute to the university\u2019s community. Don\u2019t exaggerate because being too dramatic or emotional will only confuse the selection office. Be concise, sincere, confident and know your own worth. ",
