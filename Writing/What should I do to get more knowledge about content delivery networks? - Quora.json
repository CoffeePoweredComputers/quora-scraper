            "answer_text": "I would suggest to start with the basics, that includes :1. Read about how CDN works at high level and you can find a lot of information on internet e.g. search on SlideShare.net2. Read about what technical, operational and business problem CDN is solving for the companies who rely on Internet. Read the websites of the service providers providing CDN services e.g. Tata Communications (http://www.cdn.tatacommunications.com) , Akamai, Limelight, Edgecast, Fastly etc.2. Read about the building blocks : (1) Internet, (2) Internet Peering, (3) Web Server and the basic protocols like TCP, HTTP 1.1 (4) Streaming server and streaming protocols like RTMP, RTSP(5) HTTP based Adaptive Delivery like HLS, HDS, MSS, DASH I think it's enough for now and write to me once the basics are done.

            "answer_text": "First things first, there is tons of info on Quora to start with. All CDN providers tend to share informations on their blog and you can find lots of info too just using google.You can also read some books such as \"High Performance Browser Networking\" from Ilya Grikorik which is really good. Feel free to follow my twitter account too (Laurent_Perche), I share all I find about CDN, Security and Overall performance. Best would be to find an internship in one of these companies or take a sales job fresh from graduation to learn the basics. Regardless of what you want to do later, having Sales experience is always good. ",
