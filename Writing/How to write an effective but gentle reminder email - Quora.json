            "answer_text": "Ooh, this is a tough one.  I have had to write emails like this more often than I ever cared to. It's so difficult to remind someone of a deadline or a meeting when they really should actually know about it in the first place. The biggest issue is to not hurt that person's feelings, even though that shouldn't even be an issue at all!  The reality of it though, is that his/her reaction to your email, and the subsequent resulting emotions, isn't something you can control or even guess at.  The consequences can also seriously blow up in your face - I've had times where I've emailed a colleague to remind them about a meeting or a letter that should've gone out but hasn't, and that person became surly and even harder to manage.  Regardless of the person's station in your work place, be it a supervisor, a manager, a team member or a subordinate, every person has at one time or another had to be reminded about something. With the hectic lifestyles we have, the rush and buzz of working, home, career, family, friends, social interaction....well, every minute does, actually, count. I found I had greater success in getting the response I wanted (which was for that person to remember and actually attend the meeting, or to let me know if there was an obstacle that is making meeting a deadline harder), when I first checked why I had to remind the person at all. This requires an on-point awareness of the circumstances in question. Again, I use the example of someone having missed a meeting, which you've had to reschedule because they forgot to attend because they forgot about it (or got the date wrong, or had an emergency or any number of such reasons for missing the meeting. You need that person to attend the meeting, which is tomorrow at 09:00am.  You know that all the managers will be there, and because it's a big meeting, a notebook and pen is needed as notes must be made.   Okay, now you have the basis of an email - the what, the why, the when and the how. A gentle reminder is something along the lines of: The meeting about the new system implementation is tomorrow and it'll be held in conference room 6. We need to be there by 8:50am, so I'll meet you at the coffee station at 08:30 and we can walk down together.  Putting the reminder in this way brings the person into it in an almost conversational yet pointed manner. There's very little room for misinterpretation.  It sounds much better than writing: 'you missed the first meeting about the new system, and now the managers have had to reschedule it because of that. Make sure you attend the meeting tomorrow, it starts at 09:00am and you can't be late.'  While this might actually work for those staff members who just need a smack upside the head sometimes, it could land you in a lot of hot water. The way I structured the first email not only gave the relevant information the person needs to know, but also helps the person to 'save face'. It also goes a long way to that person being a lot more conscientious about remembering important meetings in the future! Hope that helps! I'm always open to more discussion about these sorts of questions, so drop me a question and we'll take it from there.  Jules  ",

We need the collaboration of all the sales reps, since you are the owner of most contacts in the CRM and blah blah blah\u2026\u201d Remember this might be just one out of 50 messages I\u2019ll receive today.Make it as EASY as possible to execute the task:DO: \u201cHere is a list of your contacts: <url>. Please check the \u2018Season\u2019s greetings\u2019 box for those who should receive a card.\u201dDON\u2019T \u201cPlease make sure your contact entries in the CRM are up-to-date\u201d. How does that work again? I only do this once a year\u2026Explain WHY you need it (including the deadline if there is one):DO: \u201cWe need your input by 1st Dec so we can order the cards and send them on 15th Dec, in time for Christmas.DON\u2019T: \u201cThe deadline is 1st December.\u201d Good for you, I have other deadlines too.Explain WHAT\u2019S IN IT for me:DO: \u201cIf you miss the deadline but still wish your clients to receive a card, you\u2019ll need to send them yourself (there\u2019ll be a limited number of spares).DON\u2019T: \u201cPlease don\u2019t miss the deadline.\u201d Goes straight down the \u201curgent, but not important\u201d hole.Oh, and one last thing: don\u2019t write \u201creminder\u201d, \u201ckind reminder\u201d, \u201cgentle reminder\u201d. That\u2019s just passive-aggressive. We all have way more work than we can possibly ever achieve, don\u2019t rub salt into the wound. Focus on helping me rather than making me feel guilty. ",
