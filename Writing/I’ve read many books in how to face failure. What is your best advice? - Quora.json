            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t be defensive towards life. If you will be, it will come on offense. I once kept very long hairs and one of my uncles, he said me that if you keep having long hairs at this age(17) you will go bald later in life. I was like\u201dHell if I care! I don\u2019t even know if I am going to live that long\u2019. So, my satisfaction was that, why not stay in the moment and enjoy where I am, on what I have. Long hairs!!!! If I become defensive towards live, in this case, keep my hairs short so that I wont go bald, I may not go bald by doing this, but I will lose the charm of living myself up-to myself. Or, second case will be that I will go bald by worrying too much about it.So, bottom line? Don\u2019t think you are gonna face failures. You will cope thru it no matter what it is. It is good to anticipate problems before they come, but not too much. Just live it and when an obstacle comes, enjoy it, learn in it, and try to get around it and then keep moving.!! Cheers ",

            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as failure, there is only success and progress, when we think we are close to success but we realise we are far away we call it failure but it is just progress. If you think like this failure is easier to deal with. In music, when i have a bad show where i played badly it is not a failed show, bur progress in my overall musical ability, because i wont make the mistake i made during that show every again. ",
