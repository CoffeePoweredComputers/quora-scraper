            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to give you a short answer. I used to feel this way. I remember hearing that song by Nine Inch Nails \u201cEveryday is Exactly the Same\u201d. Was a dark time in my life, emotionally. It\u2019s how you eat. You probably think that\u2019s ridiculous. And if I were you, I wouldn\u2019t take me seriously either. I discovered that it\u2019s how I ate in an indirect way. I was a big drinker, and aspiring novelist. That\u2019s suppose to be a romantic combination, but I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy. My health and drinking got worse. I was watching an influencer talk about cryptocurrency and financial topics when in passing, he mentioned the Allen Carr books on the easy way to stop drinking. It stuck in my mind. A month or two went by. Then I decided to check it out. The book worked. I quit drinking cold turkey. Why am I telling you all this alcohol stuff? Because when I quit, I felt so much better. I had tons more energy. Which lead to the thought\u2026what if I start eating better and being healthier. Will I feel even better? And of course, it\u2019s true. If the world is bland, it\u2019s not the world. Your mind is fooling you. It\u2019s your diet. Whenever I feel that way, I can always trace it back to something I ate. Try an anti-inflammatory diet like keto. Go for food high in omega 3s. Educate yourself and listen to your body. You\u2019re at a stage in your life where you have the opportunity to learn an important lesson. Your feelings and mood towards the world, have almost nothing to do with the state of the world. It\u2019s the state of your mind, your chemicals, your spirit, your physiology. Nourish your body with brain food like healthy fats and walnuts. Change your food, change your mood. If you want a resource (I am not affiliated with this person, but I have great admiration for her) here you go. A good place to dive deep into this topic: Free Downloads - Kelly Brogan MD EDIT: I saw and read your comment, and I see it was removed. I\u2019d like to respond to it. I was \u201cborn\u201d with depression. I spent about the first 30 years of my life being miserable. There were no good days. There were some good moments. There were breaks. If, when I was feeling that way, I saw my answer above, I would hate my gutts. I\u2019d want to rant, and beat the crap out of me. You are a lot more open minded than I was. Am I depressed now? No. I\u2019m good at spotting it. I have a soft spot for those struggling with it. I wouldn\u2019t wish the depression I went through on Stalin or Hitler or Ted Bundy, or anyone. Even if I felt intense hatred. I\u2019m not capable of it, because there\u2019s no justice in it. It\u2019s like abuse. It\u2019s hell. You\u2019re on fire. There\u2019s no rhyme or reason or logic. And that turns you into a sort of nihilist over time. How can life matter. How can their be a purpose. This makes no sense. I\u2019m miserable for no reason, while others are joyful for no reason. Keep searching. Fight to keep your mind open. Challenge your own beliefs. Take some time to stop listening to everyone. Friends, family, internet, doctors, people smarter than you\u2026 At least for a little while. Don\u2019t give up on your own powers of deduction. Live a day or two like it was your last. Be in charge of you. If you do that, your world, the one that always has been, can change over night. All the horror and suffering in the world will remain. As is profound beauty, as are things that you will never come to know or believe if you stay closed to them. There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to why the world is bland to you. A dog is better at being happy than you at this point because he\u2019s present in the moment. You\u2019re not. You\u2019re stuck in your perception and there seems to be no way out. How can that be? There\u2019s something hijacking your thinking. And it\u2019s not invincible. Even if it\u2019s the only thing you\u2019ve known from birth for the first 30 years of your life. If you want to accept things the way they are, then maybe you should. But if it were me, I\u2019d want to know for sure. Is there, actually, anything I can do? Is there a way? Or is this all that there is? How do I know? I\u2019ll end with a quote that stayed with me. I have no idea who originated it. It was said to me by sage that quickly appeared and disappeared in my life. \u201cNo one can stand on the ground under your feet.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Motivation is the driving force that determines whether you choose to perform a task, what the task will be and how persistently you'll continue. Tiredness is defined as lack of energy and motivation, which means that the two are related. If you\u2019re tired, you\u2019re most likely also unmotivated. The first step is to explore why you\u2019re tired. Fatigue  Consult your physician to rule out medical problems. Photo Credit amanaimagesRF/amana images/Getty Images Whether you call it weariness or tiredness, fatigue is a natural response to exertion. It occurs in regular daily cycles, but it shouldn't continue for a long period of time. If you have fatigue that\u2019s not helped by getting more sleep or eating properly, consult your physician to rule out medical problems. Some common causes of fatigue include being overweight, anemia, depression, thyroid problems, medications, arthritis, diabetes, sleep disorders and malnutrition. Lifestyle  Make sure you are eating healthy and balanced meals. Photo Credit Robyn Mackenzie/iStock/Getty Images One of the most common causes of fatigue is stress, so if you can\u2019t avoid it, find time to relax, practice meditation and exercise. Regular exercise not only reduces stress, but it also helps you control weight, improves your mood and boosts energy, all of which remedy tiredness and provide motivation. Proper nourishment is also essential. Eat regular meals that include complex carbohydrates, proteins, vegetables and fruits. Your body needs water to sustain metabolism and produce energy, so keep yourself hydrated. You also need to eat enough calories to get through the activities you want to perform, so even if you need to lose weight, never eat less than 1,200 calories a day. Set Goals  Write down your goals in a list. Photo Credit lucky336/iStock/Getty Images If you\u2019re not feeling motivated, begin by writing down your goals. Putting them down on paper \u2013 making them visual \u2013 helps you get organized and gives you a place to begin even if you're not motivated. Start by making a list of things to do, use the list to prioritize tasks and then focus on the first one so you don\u2019t get overwhelmed. List the steps you need to take to reach the goal. Keep the steps small, realistic and achievable. Be as specific as possible; define what needs to be done, how you\u2019ll do it and, most importantly, set a time frame. Give yourself a date to finish each step and check it off your list as you do it. Motivation and energy increase in proportion to your achievements. Reward Yourself  Reward yourself with something that will help motivate you. Photo Credit Jacob Wackerhausen/iStock/Getty Images Rewards are a bit controversial, with some arguing that they eliminate motivation. Overcoming tiredness and rebuilding motivation, however, require effort and dedication. Acknowledging success contributes to a positive cycle that boosts motivation to continue. Don\u2019t reward yourself randomly; use your goals and pick a time when you\u2019ve reached a specific level of success. Then reward yourself in a way that doesn\u2019t undermine other efforts. For example, if exercise or eating properly are part of the plan, don\u2019t reward yourself by skipping exercise or overindulging in a big meal. Instead, reward yourself with a new MP3, go to a movie, treat yourself to a day at the spa or devote time to reading a book. Source : What to Do If You Are Tired & Unmotivated ",
