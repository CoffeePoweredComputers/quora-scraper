            "answer_text": "There are already so many great answers, but I wanted to also throw my two cents into the mix as journaling has significantly enhanced my life. I think I have over a dozen filled journals all around my house. Partly because I write so much and partly because I can\u2019t find it inside of me to throw any of them out. There are quite a few benefits of writing in a journal, and while I could list off twenty different things, I am going to stick with the benefits that I have directly experienced through writing in my personal journal on a daily basis.  Expression and release You get to release all of the thoughts, ideas, and emotions. Your diary is just yours. You can curse, express your anger and annoyance with the world (and those in it). You are basically talking to yourself when you\u2019re journaling, but you won\u2019t be seen as a nut because you\u2019re doing it in the comfort of your own space. FYI - Keep your journal in a safe place. I once had an old girlfriend find my journal and read all about the struggles that I was having surrounding being in the relationship. I planned on talking with her about it, so this was not an ideal way for her to find out that I was unhappy in the relationship. Acknowledging your emotions You get to organize your thoughts and get clear on where you are in the moment. Our emotions and feelings are constantly changing and shifting and it\u2019s important to take a few moments each day and tune in with what\u2019s going on inside. It\u2019s private and all your own You can say the things that you don\u2019t want others to hear. We all have a lot going on. Most of us have struggles that we deal with daily, we have aspects of our lives that we would rather not share publicly and writing in a journal gives you the space to talk things through with yourself and figure out what your next steps should be regarding any situation. Everything that you write is all your own. There are no outside forces or distractions that can influence your thoughts. While writing in your journal, you are given a few moments to tune into yourself and write everything that you have been thinking over the course of the day. Manifestation Journaling is a great way to work on your manifestation skills. I use my journal to write down my goals and the things that I wish to manifest in my reality. Again, your journal is all your own, so you can make it as personal as you would like. Making Decisions Making decisions can be tough enough, but I\u2019ve found that writing out the options that I have in my journal can actually help me. Listing out the pros and cons, the possible outcomes and so forth can clear space inside of your mind and give you the perspective that you need to decide accordingly and efficiently what your next move is going to be. All in all, there are massive benefits that can come from journaling. I\u2019ve found that journaling after my daily meditation practice has helped me in getting clear on my intentions for the day. I have garnered an appreciation for written words and firmly believe that it\u2019s important to exercise this part of our brains as often as we can. I also believe that those moments that are all our own are some of the more important parts of our days. We are constantly with other people, talking, writing, interacting with others. So, taking a few moments to be with just yourself and your thoughts, in my opinion, is a crucial component of mental health and have significantly helped me in maintaining a positive state of mind.

            "answer_text": "I kept a journal written in first, second, and third person for over 17 years and it has done wonders for my life and career. Thanks to journaling, I was able to achieve a lot of success in the business world and launch a career as a journalist and now become an Amazon Bestselling author. After about a year of being back in the states, it became apparent to me how lacking my English skills were. I even wrote as if I were my friends, colleagues, and business associates. It has done wonders to not only my personal life but my career as well. After about a year of being back in the states, at the age of 16, it became apparent to me how lacking my English skills were. As a matter of fact, I was even placed in remedial English courses because I couldn't keep up with my peers. I understood well enough to know that I was missing out on cultural engagements and social opportunities. So, I made a pointed effort to improve my English and get a firm and intimate understanding of the culture within which, for better or worse, I was now living in. My first course of action was to write in and maintain a journal. I would aim to write in and, in turn, think in English. To process information in English. I also had the idea to write not only in first person, but in second and third person as well. Writing as others, many times about myself was profoundly insightful. But I was extremely interested, more so, in the culture of America opposed to its language. SO, my peculiar way of journaling began. The goal was to answer questions such as: What are my American friends thinking?How does someone tick?How do I become a better friend and person?How do I improve as a personHow do I think more like an American?What can I do to assimilate into American culture faster?How do I master the language?How do I communicate better?Here are the benefits of keeping a journal in such a way. You Develop Empathy Because you are always thinking about your interactions as well as putting yourself in their shoes.Your Communications Skills Improve You are constantly practicing your language skills and writing gives you the opportunity to express things in a much more tailored and elegant mannerYour Writing Improves Not everyone speaks the way they write. This is quite apparent with me. I improved my writing and reading long before my speaking and listening in English. Sadly, most folks are better speakers than writers. Having good writing skills let\u2019s you scale your thoughts, allows you to have a digital voice, and become a thought-leader in your profession. Another weapon you can have in your arsenal to expand your career. My writing for 17 years, helped me recently launch my book, The Outlier Approach, which has been a bestseller for more than 4 weeksYou Introspect More You start to notice the smaller things in life. You appreciate the small moments as well as the big ones. You are ability to take a look back when making decisions, which gives you the patience to deal with othersIt is Meditative Because journalism is linked to stress reduction and you are allowing yourself to \u201cvent\u201d, studies have shown that even if you are \u201ccomplaining\u201d in your journal, you will be in a much better mood.Learning They say youth is wasted on the young. Writing a journal let\u2019s you relive your mistakes and helps you remember them. By noting your best growth opportunities, you will become a constant life-learnerHere\u2019s a picture of my journals. I went digital in 2011 (You can still see my Korean name on the red notebook)   Thanks for reading! :) If you liked this, don\u2019t hesitate to follow me on Twitter or check out my new bestselling book, The Outlier Approach ",

            "answer_text": "Hello! I made my first blog entry when I was 9, and I've been consistently writing for four years since 6th grade. Throughout all these years, I think that blogging has been one of the most important -- and influential -- outlets for letting out my creative thoughts, daily ramblings, and feelings. There's plenty of benefits to keeping a journal:  1) If it's a personal journal about yourself, then the most rewarding part of it is being able to look back on your life. After a couple or so years, people usually forget about those little things in their life; but writing it down and reading it years later will make you laugh, cry, or feel extremely nostalgic. I've found that I went from saying \"Nothing happened today, it's boring\" to writing more philosophical things about life, friends, family, dreams, and goals. And sometimes, one entry takes up five pages or more in a word document if I feel particularly inspired. 2) Keeps your feelings in check. Writing is helpful in sorting out your feelings, especially if you're feeling angry or stressed. In a way, it's like a form of therapy. It also helps me go back to my state of rationality and think to myself: \"Wait a second, why am I even angry again?\"  3) Personal development. This is also related to the first point, in the way that you see yourself grow. People can track their personal development easily with writing, be it achieving satisfaction in life, reaching goals (i.e. losing weight), writing about their career and how they're doing, etc. There's the possible danger of feeling impatient on whether you progressed or not, and in the end, people will feel frustrated when they don't feel it happening. Learn to differentiate wanting to always improve yourself, and writing only to expect drastic improvement. (Because it's usually too subtle to notice.) 4) Connecting with others. I can't say much about this part, but if you're on a social-networking type of blogging site, then sharing your thoughts with others often make you feel you're not alone and sometimes, you're able to meet people with similar interests as you. Writing and opening it up to close friends is also a nice idea, and might make you feel motivated to keep writing for them. I think public blogs are helpful in achieving a similar goal, like losing weight, or learning something together. The only downside with the whole thing is that you're less likely to write about your deepest, most inner thoughts. (I'm the kind that prefers privacy.) 5) Improves your writing. In terms of literacy of English, then I'm probably well ahead of my peers. Blogging consistently made it happen. Downside to this: I cringe at terrible spelling mistakes and write faster in proper English than in gibberish, or \"chatspeak.\" Haha! :)  So in the end, journaling is a rewarding experience, and I encourage people to try it. The problem with it, like with most things, is that people often quit all too fast before they're able to see the true potential of writing and of themselves. Sometimes, it's because writing on a day-to-day basis is hard to keep up and it becomes tiring. The best way to counter this is to make writing a hobby, not a chore, and to never limit yourself when writing. Explore a variety of topics. Write about what you feel, see, hear, etc. You don't need to start off with page long essays about your day: just start off small. (Hell, writing about what you ate this morning is enough.)  The 6th-grade-me had a dose of nostalgia on a fine February day, and wrote one short entry out of boredom. I was never aware that all it took was one short entry to lead another entry to another. Even now, I'm writing the story of my life.  And that, is a beautiful thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Many of us are guilty of thinking about a 13 year girl documenting her days in junior high when someone mentions the word diary, journal, or journaling! But, in fact there are a lot of positive benefits that come along with journaling: Promotes Mindfulness Journaling has the ability to bring past frustrations and thoughts to the surface! What\u2019s so great about that? There is a very strong connection between mindfulness and happiness. When you write about past frustrations or situations that may have caused you anxiety, they begin to lose their edge! It\u2019s a form of therapy and increases emotional intelligence! Helps you achieve your Goals Expressing whatever comes to mind tends to bring out your goals and dreams! When we\u2019re able to visually see these listed in front of you, we tend to place importance on them. Journaling can be used as a roadmap to get you where you want to go! Improves Communication Journaling is a form of written communication! Being able to write down your thoughts naturally translates in actual vocalization. While you\u2019ll have the be deliberate in tidying up your writing in order to improve on your verbal communication, it can be done! If you\u2019re like me, you simply just don\u2019t have the time to sit down and write every single thought that comes to mind. Have you thought about talking into your phone to journal?! There\u2019s SO many apps out there that make this possible! I\u2019ve only been doing it for a day or so, but it\u2019s been amazing to vocalize and document my thoughts, goals and dreams and be able to see them visually as well! ",

            "answer_text": "I am a big fan of diary writing. I have been writing it for the last 10 years and I wouldnt trade my diary entries for the million dollars in the world. If there is a single piece of advice which can have the maximum impact on the quality of your life , it is to start making journal entries. Here is the thing. Your life is a movie with various characters moving in and out. Various events- good or bad happening all the time. How will you learn the lessons from the bad and cherish the good if you dont keep the track of it. People are reluctant to write journal entries because- They are lazyThey over rely on their memory to recollect events instead of writing them downThey lack writing skillsAll the reasons will take care of themselves if you force yourself to write diary for just a week. Writing is therauptic as well as addictive. Why do you think quora is successful today ? Besides , writing helps you to recollect your thoughts of the day and organise them in a linear fashion giving you much needed clarity. Writing is like diving deep inside the brain and churning the gems out of it. It give results similar to meditation as it helps you to enter into the realms of your subconscious brain. There is nothing against making journal entries except it can be incredibly hard to begin with. This is true for any new habit. So lift your lazy ass and start writing. Revisit your diary entries an year later and see you evolution folding before you like the petals of a sunflower, like the cocoon of a butterfly. You will understand your behaviour traits with amazing clarity and in turn will respond better to the life events. Your diary will be the single keyhole to your life mysteries 5 years down the line containing answer to all your problems. Your diary will be master key to your brain and your development. You will be able to take uncertainity out of your life. Your diary will be your personal psychiatrist at your service 24* 7 with just a flip of few pages. If you are not writing diary , you are probably living a movie, the beginning of which you ll never remember and hence the end of which you will never comprehend resulting in a wasted life full of confusion. Will you go to an unknown sea on a ship without compass ? Then why do you want to venture into this ocean of life without diary. Your diary is your compass showing you direction. Dick doesnt write diary Dick has made bad life and career decisions Dick has always been confused about life Dick has always felt lost Dick has made a mess of his life Dont be dick. BE SMART. WRITE DIARY. ",

I don't exactly know the kind of benefits one could enjoy in a long run but, I could share my experience of writing a diary as a beginner. It was quite a good feeling having a book for myself and letting my thoughts just flow into the papers initially.then I at times I would forget that I had a diary, and regret not writing it for half a month.then I would write for another half a beginning of a month and it went on .it was quite therapeutic. Then I realised that writing a diary is not just to let your emotions out, instead it a steady inspection of oneself, a way to befriend yourself ,and could act as a reflection. It\u2019s a very good way to understand ur pychological state and help you to resolve any kind of problems that you are facing ..and the most intriguing part,it's not someone els that would solve your problems instead, it would be you.this would help you build confidence. Then comes the section of managing your tasks.There is no doubt that writing your goals on a paper would make them more likely to get accomplished since written info constantly triggers your memory. And as you start achieving bits and pieces of your goals and record the experience in your diary, there would be a point of time when you would start enjoying your experiences rather than being anxious about basically it would help you evolve. As far as vocabulary is concerned ,I prefer to keep my diary simple and straight .so I haven't found asmuch improvement in it . But yea, your grammatical errors would definitely get reduced. This is what I could say as a beginner in writing a diary .hope you would enjoy ur journey ..ie, if you choose to write\ud83d\ude0c ",

            "answer_text": "In my blog post and podcast \u201cThe Power and Purpose of Journaling\u201d I share the benefits of writing a journal with this story. James Pennebaker, a distinguished professor at the University of Texas, got married right out of college in the early \u201870s. Three years after his marriage, he and his wife started to question their relationship, and Pennebaker, confused and unsettled, sank into a depression. He ate less, drank more, and started smoking. Embarrassed by what he saw as emotional weakness, he became more and more isolated. One morning about a month into this decline, Pennebaker climbed out of bed and sat down at a typewriter. He stared at the machine for a moment, then started writing freely and frankly about his marriage, his parents, his sexuality, his career, and even death. As he wrote, and continued to write in the days that followed, something fascinating happened. His depression lifted and he felt liberated. He began to reconnect with his deep love for his wife. But the writing had an even farther-reaching impact. For the first time, he started to see the purpose and possibilities in his life. Pennebaker\u2019s own experience getting through this rocky period sparked 40 years of research about the links between writing and emotional processing. Over and over again Pennebaker did studies in which he divided people into two groups and asked some to write about emotionally significant experiences, and the others to write about common things: their shoes, or maybe the cars passing on the street. Both groups wrote for the same span\u2014about 20-minutes a day, three days in a row. In each study, Pennebaker found that the people who wrote about emotionally charged episodes experienced marked improvement in their physical and mental well-being. They were happier, less depressed and less anxious. In the months after the writing sessions, they had lower blood pressure, improved immune function, and fewer visits to the doctor. They also reported better relationships, improved memory, and more success at work On a personal note, I have always journaled to download and to write down my goals and dreams. The power and purpose for my journaling for me has been manifested in my life over and over. There are 3 ways to attract anything into your life. First you think it in your mind, then you speak it into the atmosphere, then you write it down to give it form! Journaling can also help you out of a bad mood.You Can Write Your Way Out of an Emotional Funk.

            "answer_text": "1. Awareness of self growth.You can look back and see how silly you where. This can be valuble both for appreciating how much you have evolved, and as a tool to help you not to jump to the conclusion that the current you will look so smart in the eyes of you-in-five years and not to mess things up up for that you. 2. Recollection.Memory is fluent, to a rediculus extent. People just think they remember the same thing year after year because it is the 'original disk' that is being edited so they cannot compare their memory to any previous version. And above all, most memories are wiped out / sorted far back in the filing cabinet. Here the paper backup is very valuble. It can make those neurons fire and bring up those old memories that you didn't know you had forgotten or distorted that much. This can be positive in two aspects, 1. It can be fun/interesting, and 2. It is a good idea to train our brains and minds. Keeping them active is like oiling a machine. 3. It can be a therapeutic tool. Putting things down in words, especially written ones, can help bring up and work through things you better resolve. This might be that the boy didn't want to kiss you infront of the other boys on the school yard, or that you are worried your husband does not feel the same about you now as before you got kids. Many things are resolved just by being written down and read by the writer. Some things may come up, that need to, while others just need forming for you to be able to deal with them, and so on. 4. It can be a social tool, It can be helpful for making you come closer to your friends. (Side note: Reading each others diary is one of the most gender deviding things in the world. While being quite common for girls, this almost never happens between boys.) In any case, it can bridge social barriers to see/show that most of the things you worry or think about are shared with others. And yes, it is ok to fall in love with that many people in one year. :D 5. The 'accidental read'. If you happen to go through some serious life crisis involving drug abuse, sexual abuse or so on, that you just cannot talk to your mother about but almost want her to find out about, and trust her to be a respectful person who would not go poking trying to find, open and read your diary, then you may just forget to put it away, and instead happen to leave it open on your bed.. 6. Argument settlement.\"Nope, we dated for FOUR months, not three, I looked it up!\" 7. It is sweet to have. Nostalgia at its coolest. Pictures can show how things looked, a daily diary can show you what you were thinking. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was just thirteen, I met one of my best teachers who started his first class holding up a pen and paper, and said \u201cjust utilizing these 2 objects you can be one of the smartest person in the world\u201d. He insisted me to write at least 1 page a day. Scientifically it\u2019s proven that daily writing can change your life dramatically. Here I\u2019m going to write about that 8 amazing things will happen if you keep writing every day. 1. You will become hungry to write Once you have started, then you will need not to force your brain to generate new stories, your pen/keyboard will find it by their own. It will become your daily habit like cleaning your teeth every morning and night. Even if you don\u2019t write, you will feel like something is missing. I guarantee you, you will always find a new subject to write. 2. You will feel accomplished Most of the writer find difficulties when stats writing for the first time, because then it takes long time to finish even a small article but once you finish that article then you feel accomplish. Fist you need you force yourself for a little then it will find its own path. It\u2019s like going to gym; it\u2019s become very tough to continue gym for first time. Statistics says more than 80% people give up within a month but those who survive; they become stronger and get attractive looks. 3. Your will able to take effective decision Writing slows down time, for a short period you\u2019re not in the rush and you can clarify and take your time. When you practice writing in a daily basic then you will able to take effective decision without any stress. 4. You will able to speak more smartly You won\u2019t be able to speak fluently if you do have enough vocabulary. By practicing writing you will able to gather large vocabulary. Then will get lot more option for words when speaking, which will differentiate you from others. Even If you don\u2019t realize, you friends and parents will must realize the difference in you. 5.  You will become a disciplined person Statistics says every writer starts their career through hobby. They keep writing beside their study or job. By this practice they get used to manage their time even in a tough situation. Like others they don\u2019t do random stuffs. Writing will make you more disciplined. 6. Your thirst of knowledge will increase If you build up your writing habit then you will always thirsty for knowledge. You will start reading anytime which is available to you. You may do it consciously or subconsciously, always finding something to read, and if you don\u2019t get anything then you will observe your around deeply. 7. You will able to connect with new people Once you start writing then you will start finding new things. If you write on social networking type blogging site then sharing your thoughts with others then very often you will feel that you are alone. You might get some good friends and follower also. I think public blog sites are goods platform for this. 8.  You will able to keep your feelings in control Writing is more helpful when you are stressed and angry. Then writing is like oil massage. It will help you to get back to your normal life soon. Believe me, it\u2019s too relaxing. Keep writing, best of luck ",

            "answer_text": "Keeping a journal has been one of my primary coping and self-improvement methods. What is my big problem? I am too easily influenced. So I have had to really focus on recognizing what were my true needs and wants, and I have done that with writing in a journal. My mother kept a journal, so I picked it up from her and ran with it. Most of the time, stuff happens to me, I deal with it, and later I realize what happened and I break down; there is a big disconnect between my mind, my body, and my emotions that I have achieved as a result of coping with things I found threatening when I was a child. My life has been a constant peeling-back of each of these obsolete defense mechanisms, which I have discovered by dialoging with myself in my journals.  I often don't see people's bad intent when it's coming my way because I refuse to focus on their shit (unless they have asked me to, but that is a different matter). I am especially adept in mentally leaving my body when necessary. When I was young, this manifested in a pattern of psychosomatic illnesses.  Because of the physical manifestations of my mental wanderings, I became convinced that I had to figure out what was going on in my head. And that's when I started writing. I was also inspired by other young journalists. When I was 14 Go Ask Alice was added to our required reading in school; this is a diary format story of a nice girl whose family doesn't understand her, and she gets sucked into a life of drugs and prostitution. I saw that a person's life story could be useful as a warning to others. When I got to college, our Freshman English professor had us keep a diary. Later when I was hired as the catalog editor at Samuel Weiser publishing, I learned about the importance of the magical diary (Ceremonial Magick) and the Book of Shadows (Wicca). With these practices, you record your spiritual experiences the way a scientist might record all the steps taken in an experiment. Now I have decades of journals, as well as my mother's. Not sure what to do with them. But I do have an occasion to see how far I have grown when I peek inside them. Sometimes I find interesting dreams I had in the past that end up seeming prescient when I revisit my descriptions of them. I do worry about what will happen to my journals when I drop dead and I think of shredding them now and then because I don't want to hurt anyone with my words and my imperfect understanding.  I'm not what I write. My writing is a symptom of my existence. ",

Barrie By creating a habit of writing daily, You will almost immediately become better at expressing yourself. Whenever I force myself to write every day because of my personal book deadline, I am always amazed at how quickly my writing and verbal communication skills improve.You will remember things long forgotten. As you write about memories it is like opening an old photo album. Your pen begins to expose feelings and details you had forgotten, and dreams you had lain aside. You suddenly remember people you would like to reconnect with.Writing is a focused activity that keeps distractions at bay long enough for you to explore wonders of the past. Sometimes it is frightening, sometimes wonderful and almost always beneficial.Writing about daily experiences and feelings provides a recorded history that will impact how you make future decisions.There\u2019s a reason that the greatest leaders in history were students of history. They learned from what had happened before. Your history is important. Don\u2019t let it be forgotten.Writing reminds you of your dreams and keeps you moving toward them. It is a means of keeping track of your purpose and the goals that will lead you to fulfilling them. Reviewing what you have written is a perfect way to see your progress and to reveal when you have been distracted and may need to refocus.Writing gives you a record of God\u2019s faithfulness. In the midst of troubled times it is so easy to forget what He has done for us.Writing a little every day could provide the material that someday becomes a published book. When I used to write about my troubles and angst as a teenager, I never dreamed it could be in a book.~ Soniya ",

            "answer_text": "Writing is a powerful intellectual tool to express and analyse your thoughts and emotions. The French-Romanian philosopher Emil Cioran mention that he found in the art of write a therapeutic method to deal with his feelings and ideas. Nowadays, science confirms that journal writing have important benefits for your mental health: Can reduce anxiety. Keeping a journal will help you to understand and identify what's causing that stress and anxiety. Letting go of negative thoughts and tracking your progress as you undergo treatment. Deal with traumatic events. A research, pioneered by the psychologist James Pennebaker has linked written narrative to enhanced your physical and mental health. They asked participants to describe a traumatic personal event in writing, whereas the others wrote about a trivial topic. The researchers found out that individuals assigned to write about a stressful occurrence in their own life typically experience improvements in general physical health, compared to those who wrote about trivial events. Write about gratitude. The American psychologist Susan Jeffers mentions in her book \"Feel the fear and do it anyway\" the importance of have a list or even a exclusive journal of gratitude, of all the things that make you feel grateful. Cultivate gratitude by your daily writing could increase your optimism and help you to make progress toward your goals. Write about your aims will increase your happiness. Writing about your goals and visions specifically, will make you feel happier. Studies show that write well explicated goals will make your brain release the neurotransmitter of serotonin, a chemical which contributes to wellbeing and happiness. The benefits mentioned above are specifically about mental and physical health. Writing a journal can help you as well to improve your writing skills, learn new vocabulary, or even improve in a language that you are learning. Nevertheless, it's important to mention that journaling is just another habit to improve your mental health and not a substitution of a medical and psychological treatment.

            "answer_text": "A few stories, instead of dry theory: The result of journaling is deeper self knowledge. It is useful in absolutely everything. You\u2019ll get gains in purposefulness, resoluteness, single mindedness, strength of will, strength of character, firmness, intentness, and decision making. You\u2019ll definitely start saving a ton of time when making decisions. I remember being contacted at the beginning of April 2014 by a man from Germany who offered to translate my book. I experienced a surge of anxiety. What guarantee did I have that he wouldn\u2019t steal my work? What guarantee did I have that he would do his job well?  If you don\u2019t know yourself well, such anxiety is the ideal feed for procrastination. Every time you are about to do something about a problem at hand, apprehension like this will fill your mind. In the end, you\u2019ll do nothing. The only way to get rid of these doubts is to take action. Thanks to my journaling sessions, I immediately recognized and targeted these anxious thoughts. Then I ridiculed them and sent the manuscript to the guy. What did I have to lose? Publishing rights in a market I wasn\u2019t going to publish in anytime soon? That was the worst-case scenario.  And as usual, my fears didn\u2019t materialize. My new partner in Germany, Christian, has turned out to be a very reliable fellow. I\u2019ve received several payments from him, from 1.7% to 4% of my \u201cday job\u201d salary. That\u2019s quite a tangible output from the intangible power of self analysis, isn\u2019t it? I need just 25 to 60 such deals and I could quit my job.  Decisiveness is hard to estimate, but it is absolutely huge in terms of saved time and energy (instead of wasting these precious resources through doubting and second-guessing yourself). Thanks to the level of self insight I\u2019ve developed, I\u2019ve been able to make similar decisions in a heartbeat, multiple times. When Chris Bell volunteered to edit my book Master Your Time and help me market it, I didn\u2019t hesitate a second. The worst he could have done was steal my book. Well, I could always write another one. But he didn\u2019t, and Master Your Time was my first professionally edited book. It was also the first to become a best seller.  Another example of this decisiveness is my contract with Archangel Ink. I was contacted by them just a couple of weeks after finalizing the purchase of my house. I had spent every single dime I had, except for the last 1,000 euros from my book royalties. When the publisher requested a $1,500 initial deposit, my internal warning mechanism went immediately on overload. I didn\u2019t have $1,500 to spare! But my consciousness also immediately recognized the opportunity. That was my chance and I knew it.  The rest is history. I signed the contract and my sales increased, my royalties doubled, and the number of my readers expanded. I\u2019m firmly convinced that journaling provides you concrete and measurable advantages.

But how far do you now about weird advantage or side positive effect that journaling get? Let me introduce the top 3 weird benefits of writing to your life. Number 1: Feel distinguish Imagine that you are a guy sitting alone at a coffee shop, wearing casual, then you take a leather notebook out and start writing in your daily journal. While everyone in this 4.0 era is on their phones, you, only you, are writing and using a non-digital note which once dominated the world. While everyone is too lazy, just read, you write. While everyone seems rushed, you calm. That looks cool and distinct. Number 2: Sleep better As you write your daily life onto the notebook, or you may call it a diary, this means that all your thoughts, your ideas, your happiness, your angriness, and your plan are presented in this can-look-back platform. The brain is no longer feel sorrowed or confused because of missing anything or mixing things up, it will feel relaxed and rested. This also means you could sleep better for the night time. Number 3: Turn it into a business and make money You will find keeping on track of writing daily is hard. But once you addicted to it, you will find the hidden part of the iceberg. For writers who own blog platforms like Medium, Wordpress,.. Writing could bring you money form marketing or mentioning their products, backlinking to others\u2019 money sites (in case your library is resourceful enough and they find you good at writing). A lot of bloggers know that and they just don\u2019t talk about it. It a source of profit that one day, you wish you could get. https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-i-made-11-000-from-writing-in-30-days/ I\u2019m not sponsored for posting this link, but look at the number, I want I get it one day too!!

This Street  Or this one   It\u2019s simple. Order > Chaos. Certainty > Randomness. Writing helps me to think coherently. Writing helps my mind to calm down, when there\u2019s a storm in there. And it necessarily not has to be just on Quora. I just write. Whenever I feel like it. Whenever there are random thoughts cluttering my mind. Remember the times when a small petty issue bothers you. Write it down. Couple of days later, when that\u2019s over. Come back and read it, only to feel how stupid you were to get worried for such a small thing. Remember the times when you felt you\u2019re lucky, and blessed. Write it down. When things get tough in your life, read them again. You\u2019ll feel grateful and better, and hopeful for a better tomorrow. Remember the times, when you fell short of innovative ideas in your life. Write 10 ideas each day. That will help develop your idea muscles. I owe this to James Altucher though. And even on Quora. It takes some time before you start writing. You just can\u2019t write anything. So you sit down, and let your thoughts come in randomly. Once they are there, you take each of those thoughts and align them in most beautiful way possible. And that\u2019s it. Then you start putting those thoughts into your keyboard. So the next time, you\u2019re feeling happy, sad, depressed, concerned, confused or grateful. Write. Not just to publish. Not just to improve your grammar skills. Not just for upvotes. But for yourself. Because once you start writing, you\u2019ll be a different person all together. ",

            "answer_text": "A diary or journal is something very private. I am a bit old school and I always prefer a diary over some fancy app. I still love books more than Kindle. That being said, there are some clear cut benefits of writing in a journal or diary. For the starters and obvious, your writing becomes better. Also, your spellings remain intact because you aren't dependent on auto-correct or dictionary. This is just my personal observation.When you are writing in a journal or diary, you are putting your very private thoughts on paper- no where else. Not on social media, not on Quora, not with friends- it's just a connection between you and the paper.Writing in journal or diary is one of the excellent ways to bring your subconscious thoughts into physical form. It is quite possible that if you are upset or alienated for some reason and you write it down on paper, you will no longer think about it anymore because it is out of your mind.There are a lot of things that you wish to speak out, but don't want anyone to hear you out. For writers, a journal or a diary gives that kind of freedom- to speak without the fear of being heard.And finally, it is something that will remind people of the kind of person you were when you're gone. Because, you are the most honest with your diary.This is my diary.  ",

            "answer_text": "You should, and I really mean should keep a diary. A diary serves several purposes: Not only does it report on your day, it makes you recall whether your day has been productive or not. It can register your intent to do something like checking on someones health or birthday. It can reflect on something needs to be done in the future.Example of a normal day.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Had another nightmare about being lost in a hotel and couldn't find my room? What's that about? Felt very disturbed when I woke up. Another wet day. Must remember to get a spare umbrella to leave at the office. Had two calls from Sally on the answerphone. Still asking about her computer problems. Need to sort it out for her once and for all. Letter from optician about checkup. Had forgotten about it. Must call Harry tomorrow for sure about arrangements on weekend.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A personal diary is not like an appointments diary.  It is where you can record your mood, the eather - with might have an effect on you. The outside influences that impose themselves on you, duties or commitments, and future arrangements. As isolated items they are not meaningful, but together they show a negative day in this case. A week of negative days can add up to a bad weekend. And a few of those can be a sign of things to come. You can also underline good events and bad events. Use red for good and black for bad. At the end of the month flip though and count up the good and bad things that happened. These will give you some idea on whether your life is improving or not. On a monthly basis sum up whether it was a good or bad month, and try to set out what you would like to achieve in the coming month. One month won't tell you much but over a year you will be surprised about how your time was spent. It will be the best guide you will ever have on how to spend your time wisely for the coming year. If you are really keen then try keeping a Dream Diary. That will tell you more about yourself than any psychiatrist ever will. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was in my 12th my maths sir asked me have a diary and to note all important things i do on a daily basis on it. I revolted it. But he forced me to. Not just me everyone in the class. We all unwillingly wrote it. Later in my college, i used to have a diary. That was for my boyfriend who lived away from me. I wrote all my feelings, my happiness, sadness,succes, friendship love ,missing everything on it. Everytime he came to India, i gave him to read. When he went back i got it back. But last time before we broke up he took them and did not return. He said he is still having them and that really happy to know. Then probably in my 3rd year i got that habit back. Every previous day i would write down my to do list. I would do everything as per it and the next day would certainly analyse what I did, what i havn\u2019t. I would also note the money i spent. Any important assignmnts or test that i have a chance to forget. My periods i would note on it to check whether they are regular. So that was my first effective journal. Coming back to the question, A journal or diary is something that you write for just yourselves. It may contain your feelings, your to do, you expenses, anything.  Journal keeps you updated about your progress. Its a written record of ourselves which help us to analyse our progress on a daily basis.Help us to look forward. It always keeps notified about the next step. Being aware of the next day keeps us more planned and productive. The daily to do list make us more efficient in life.Learn to spent time for self. Journals requires to go thorugh the how what why and when on ones own life. It helps to find answers for our doubts. And open up a new dimension of life.Journals can make one a goal digger. Writing done daily, weekly, monthly or yearly goals on a journal makes you more goal oriented. The chances of reminding of goals helps to achieve success faster and thereby a happy life.Make you more creative. Finding new methods to note everything and creating your own fonts and writing makes you more creative.Story of you. A journal serves as an absolute story of you. You have a permanent record of it to recheck whenever you want to. So just start it\u2026 most difficult part is to begin. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m astonished by all the answers here, seem like the topic of journaling and diarist draws such an interesting crowd. I would also want to throw y 2cent with what I have gained from keeping a journal (and a diary). To me, a journal can be viewed as a personal note-taking system with versatile sets of structures, content, and usages whether you were the great genius da Vinci sketching out the beautiful observation of human anatomy, or a small child documenting his feelings of the day. So that means a journal contains what we call a diary. For the benefit of writing a journal, it can range from boosting your productivity, enhancing your creativity, writing skills to overall just be a therapeutic process that deepens your understanding about yourself. I find that we don\u2019t often classify journaling into its many distinctive forms. Which would lead us not really get what we expect from our little notebooks (or a digital screen, depending on your liking) I\u2019m currently keeping 3 types of journals: A Productivity Journal: which I log in the priorities, the responsibilities, important deadlines and the reflection in little working sessions.  Keeping things in order: I\u2019m forgetful and seriously messy in my time-management. Every time my life gets tough, I need my journal to keep me in check, days in and days out, telling me what to do and when to do it.Boosting Work Performance: I use my journal to note down how I am being ineffective at work. And just after an intensive 7 days of journaling this way, I have found numerous way to improve my efficiency at work.Living life with Intention: I find myself making more out of my time with when I sit down and decide what I would do the next week, what I would learn, what I would accomplish. In the long-run, this has served me well with getting more meaningful things done.A Writing Journal: I use my personal Wordpress as a place to get all of my emotional and creative ideas out. Whatever that gets me excited, I turn them into words and store them to revisit later on. Connecting with my Emotion: I don\u2019t censor or block any thoughts from fruition into words and sentences. From writing whatever comes to my mind, I feel more at ease, less anxious with how I feel. As a boy growing up with other boys, I wasn\u2019t really taught how to handle emotion, how to grieve, how to overcome jealousy, lust, greed\u2026 Writing those negative energy down has taken away its power over me somewhat.Making me more of a creative individual: the more I write, the more ideas I have. Not only ideas for writing, but ideas that I can take my work along, ideas to better my life also. All the spontaneity adds up and turns into creative ideas to be used again later.A Contemplation Diary: this is my most personal journal out of all, where I ask myself big questions and attempt to answer them. Increase Self-Awareness: I am shocked when I first realized I don\u2019t even know what I like to spend my free time on when I ask myself a simple question: \u201cWhat do I really like to do?\u201d The more I ask myself with my journal, the more I realize I have so much to discover about myself.Better My Thinking: the diary makes me aware of the vastness of what I don\u2019t know that I don\u2019t know and gradually sink that part down. By trying to answer it as best as I could, I find out ways that I am not thinking rationally, where I\u2019m taking a dogma as a truth, where I\u2019m making assumptions about myself and others.I\u2019m sure there are still many more ways to journal and many more kind of benefits that journaling can have. I found this how to start journaling article[1] to be nicely feet with the way I\u2019m using journaling to improve my life, I would recommend checking it out.

            "answer_text": "For Jilliene Helman, writing in a journal has helped her to become a better CEO. I talked to Jilliene, CEO of Realty Mogul who was included in Forbes\u2019 30 Under 30 list in 2015, about the benefits of journaling: \u201cA new tool that I\u2019ve started using in the past year is journaling. I journal every day now and it helps me to check in with myself, figure out how I'm feeling about the business, where I think we should go.\u201d \u201cI do a lot of my own strategic planning in my journal and it's a stream of consciousness. It's not structured. It's just for me. I don't intend for other people to read it but it helps prepare me for my executive team meetings.\u201d \u201cI will, before an executive meeting every week, go back and read my last week of journaling and then come back with thoughts or ideas, or questions or things of that nature.\u201d \u201cThat's been really, really impactful on me and I think helping me to be a better CEO.\u201d \u201cI'll sometimes journal twice a day. My practice is in the morning, so in the morning before I go to work, I've got pretty dedicated morning routine, so I rarely miss it in the morning. But if I've got a busy day and I want to kind of decompress at the end of the day, I'll journal when I get home at night as well, and just kind of share with myself.\u201d \u201cAgain this isn't meant for anyone else, but how did the day go, what could I have done better, what are things that I'm thinking about, what am I worried about, what's keeping me up at night. Because I feel that when you get it on paper and you sort of get it out of your mind, you can allow your mind to rest, to get back to a place of equilibrium so you can go back the next day and do it all over again.\u201d \u201cIf you don't give yourself that rest because you can't get stuff out of your mind, it becomes a lot harder to be at your best.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it\u2019s completely your choice to write a Diary or a Journal. I do write a Journal, not on daily basis but, Yes, I do keep a Journal. If you write a Journal make sure you write only the good happenings and not the bad ones. Because when you write about a bad occurrence, it significantly affects your mood and may lead you to depression and recursive over-thinking about the event. When you write about a good thing, it positively enhances your mood and emotions. Journal writing is a good thing as it helps you in consolidating some important memories that have passed, on a single page. It also helps in developing your creativity and writing skills. Retrospection of these wonderful memories in the future will surely bless you with nostalgia. Make that Journal a confidant of your good memories and not a bundle of pages that bear the distraught of your bad luck in life. If I have to give you my personal recommendation then I can tell you that I always write an anecdote whenever something interesting happens in my life. I LOVE WRITING; hence, I carry a book in my bag wherever I go and whenever I get time to write, I transcribe in it. I also indulge myself in story-writing sometimes. I am not inferring that whatever I write in this book is true but there also some bad things that I\u2019ve wrote in it. But here\u2019s the twist: I never write that bad event in a bad way. For an example: (This is just an example, honestly :D ) I approach my crush and have a conversation with her BUT it doesn\u2019t turn out the way I expected it to. She doesn\u2019t reciprocate me with same enthusiasm as mine. In fact she is not even interested in having this conversation; so, she averts the talk and bids me an adieu. Now I am really disappointed at this and disgusted and angry and humiliated and repenting that I shouldn\u2019t have approached her in the first place. So what do I do now? How do I get rid of these negative feelings? The answer is: I write about it, but in a positive way. When I write this \u201cCRUSH-ING\u201d tale in my Journal, I\u2019ll write it how I wanted that conversation to happen. I\u2019ll imagine - What if my crush liked me the way I liked her? What if my crush puts in the same amount of efforts as I put in her? What if me and my crush talk for an hour? I\u2019ll imagine all the answers to these questions and write them in my Journal. And it always works in cheering me up. I read it again and again until a wave of positivity engulfs me. I hope this helps you too\u2026 :) ",

            "answer_text": "Come on. I show you. Today when I look back, and turn pages, and also memories, from the pages diary, she reflects how I progressed, and made through all those years of which I had thought I will never survive. When you read someone\u2019s autobiography, you get motivated. The best motivation is the motivation that is within, that comes from you\u2014 and my journal gives it to me every time I open her, undress her. Diary motivates you. I don\u2019t mind sharing few pictures I took:   I name my diaries. I love them all. They are my darlings, my light. You see the one in the pink jacket? It was one of the messiest, emotional period in my life. I was attached, abusive, jealous, possessive, hopelessly romantic and to sum it all\u2014 a lover. I\u2019ve come a long way since June 2014. When I read, I see agony, my immaturity and yet they all make me smile. She holds letters that were never sent. She has notes I ever wrote, but were never read. It\u2019s my beginning to something better. And, I can see it in her. You see the red one? I wanted to crack IIT-JEE. Oh, yeah! Obviously I could not, and I failed. I did not cry. I was more composed this time. I\u2019ve been through a tougher phase before. My diaries have letters that people gave to me. I love to keep memories, especially the piece of paper they wrote. I have kept a note from a very young girl, who wrote to me, \u201cHappy Teachers Day.\u201d I remember she had ran across the hall, and searched for me in the school, just to give that note. I don\u2019t remember her face, but my diary does. Diary helps you keep memories for an average mind cannot hold subtle details forever. She tracks my thoughts, plans, and everything\u2014 how I failed, how I conquered. She knows secret of my failures, and of my success. She knows my past. She knows who I am. She is someone who will listen to you, but won\u2019t interrupt. Diary is the best listener, if you write yourself down in ink. No, no. Diaries won\u2019t make you write better. All those who say so are either lying, or don\u2019t write diaries. They practice scribbling words not feelings on paper. A diary is someone on which you make black, blue and red tattoos. It does not need to be great, and art every time: it\u2019s your life, it\u2019s your thought after all. Let it be messy, and let it show you someday who you were and what you\u2019ve been through. The words you write need not to be that of pearls. Sentences don\u2019t not to be structured. Be it runny. Baby, let it flow like a river. Scribble on her in every way. Let even your handwriting, and sentence structures, show what have you been thinking. Diary is your history, your nama. Write it as you create one. In the end, I tell you one thing. Don\u2019t write diaries because you need to. Write your diary if you want to be a lover: unattached yet romantic, sophisticated yet clear. You don\u2019t expect anything, and this is what a journal teaches you. You learn what a life can never teach you. You will end up loving someone, which most of the people see as a lifeless being. ",

            "answer_text": "I think I'm eligible to answer this as I'm maintaining a journal from a very tender age. I can't remember the exact date or year, but yeah I was exceptionally young when I first experienced penning down my thoughts. I used to write on bulky white sheets pinned together by a thread. At that age, I didn't even know what a diary/journal is, still my inner-child was dying to write. One day my mother discovered those pages and burned them all. Why? Because, she found me writing on my journal in the study hours.She got so mad and burned them to ashes. That night I cried my heart out. But she later consoled me and told me that I'm too young to maintain a diary. I understood!! [Image Source : My Phone Gallary]  Now,let me share the pros of keeping a journal from my point of view :- It's a life-souvenir : Through your journal you can keep a note on your everyday life by penning down your experiences. Your old self can relive the long lost memories of life through the pages of diary. In simple words, its a token of remembrance.It's a secret keeper & a friend for life : Those, who maintains a journal can relate with the above point. A diary/journal can never betray you. You can be assured with all your deepest & darkest secrets as your diary is never going to judge you or gossip about you.It reflects the kind of person you are : You can hide your inner feelings from the world, but not from your diary. You feel free to share every bit of your life without any hesitation. And hence, your diary is your mirror.Its a source to get rid of all your toxicity : Well, I'm not saying that people who don't keep a journal are toxic. But, yeah it works for me. My journal helps me remain non-toxic & optimist. When I find myself sorrounded by negativity & hopelessness,it acts as a saviour.It keeps you grounded : Journals are a medium through which you can have a constant check on your background & your past life. You can check on your life and how you evolved as a person throughout the years.You become a better person : Now you might wonder, how? As you write more often, you gradually get to know about your strength & weaknesses. And with time, you can channelize your strengths in a good way & overcome your weaknesses.It's a safe place for introverts : I consider myself as an ambivert but still the scale is more tilted towards introvertedness. I naturally prefer to end my day by curling up with my journal. It's therapeutic & soothing. We get a way to voice our feelings which we usually suppress.. . As I've started writing on Quora, I feel this to be also a part of my life. Quora now feels like a virtual journal for me. I write here, share my experiences, my life incidents. It feels great. Thank you. Peace Mishti\u2764\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "ADVANTAGES OF WRITING A JOURNAL DAILY When it comes to keeping a journal, stereotypes of Sweet Valley High and Napoleon Dynamite quickly come to mind; \u201cDear diary\u201d is reserved for the high-school sweetheart or awkward recluse. Others see writing merely as a tool, a pragmatic means to an end, certainly without value in and of itself. But science continues to dissolve skepticism. For those sitting on the fence, these 10 benefits of journaling will convince you to start writing. 1. Stretching Your IQA hot topic, but strong cases support the ability to change your IQ. A report by the University of Victoria noted that \u201cWriting as part of language learning has a positive correlation with intelligence.\u201d Journaling is an exploration of language, you\u2019ll have the natural urge to search for new words and increase your vocabulary. The report goes on to say, \u201cOne of the best single measures of overall intelligence as measured by intelligence tests is vocabulary.\u201d 2. Evoking MindfulnessIt\u2019s the buzz word for good reason. There\u2019s a strong connection between happiness and mindfulness. Journaling brings you into that state of mindfulness; past frustrations and future anxieties lose their edge in the present moment. It calls a wandering mind to attention, from passivity to actively engaging with your thoughts. 3. Achieving GoalsJournaling often includes your dreams and ambitions, yet the idea that scribbled words can help achieve goals is understandably fanciful. But consider building a house without a blueprint. That makes more sense. Writing goals signals to your brain \u201cthis is important.\u201d Your reticular activating system (RAS) then flags relevant opportunities and tools to achieve that goal. More detailed goals provide a psychological blueprint, and increases the likelihood of achieving them. 4. Emotional Intelligence Emotional Intelligence is the ability to perceive and manage your emotions, and that of others. Journaling is an outlet for processing emotions and increases self-awareness. This internal familiarity becomes a bridge of empathy, you\u2019ll better intuit and understand what others are experiencing. Being able to get on the same page with someone is a mark of emotional intelligence, and allows for a much deeper connection. 5. Boosting Memory and ComprehensionThere\u2019s a unique relationship between the hand and brain, sparked by the composition of thoughts and ideas. Words are representations of ideas; the formation of letters and causes the mind to compose or re-compose ideas while journaling. This strengthens previously covered information and forces you to engage in cognitive recall. 6. Strengthen Your Self-DisciplineSetting time aside to write, whether morning or evening, is an act of discipline. And discipline begets discipline. Like a muscle, the more you exercise it, the stronger it becomes. And habits formed in one area of life have a tendency to spread; as keeping your office clean leads to keeping the bedroom tidy, your daily practice of writing will domino onto other healthy habits. 7. Improve Communication Skills\u201cWriting has critical connections to speaking\u201d according to a Stanford report. Journaling is a form of written communication, albeit to oneself. Nonetheless, the subvocalization of tracing your written thoughts naturally translates in actual vocalization. Of course, anyone journaling must have a deliberate aim to tidy up their writing in order to see benefits in their verbal communication. But making that decision during writing will benefit your speaking. 8. HealingExpressive writing is a route to healing \u2014 emotionally, physically, and psychologically. Dr. James Pennebaker, author of Writing to Heal has seen improved immune function in participants of writing exercises. Stress often comes from emotional blockages, and overthinking hypotheticals. He explains, \u201cWhen we translate an experience into language we essentially make the experience graspable.\u201d And in doing so, you free yourself from mentally being tangled in traumas. Studies have also shown that the emotional release from journaling lowers anxiety, stress, and induces better sleep. 9. Spark Your CreativityJulia Cameron\u2019s \u201cMorning Pages\u201d has become the panacea for unlocking creativity amongst anyone and everyone. Our struggle isn\u2019t whether we\u2019re creative, it\u2019s how to let it flow. Her powerful tool is simply to write without thinking \u2014 \u201cstream of consciousness\u201d writing. Beyond overcoming writer\u2019s block, stream of consciousness writing brings out thoughts and ideas you never knew you had in you, and loosens up your expressive muscles. She recommends three pages, done first thing in the morning. Including even one page as part of your journaling will get your creative juices flowing. 10. Self-ConfidenceJournaling about a positive experience allows your brain to relive it. And reaffirms your abilities when the ugly head of self-doubt appears. The release of endorphins and dopamine will boost your self-esteem and mood. These reflections can become a catalog of personal achievements that you continue to go back to. As you work to incorporate journaling into your life, remember the elephant is best eaten one bite at a time. Patience and consistency are crucial in forming new habits. Begin writing perhaps three days a week, first thing in the morning or before sleeping. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many benefits to journaling. Writing your thoughts down gets those thoughts out of your head. The real benefits of journaling comes when you add a reflective element. Reflective journaling is writing about your experience and your interpretation of the experience. From that interpretation comes self-growth and learning. With this type of journaling, the biggest benefit is self-awareness. A consistent journaling practice cultivates an awareness mindset. This mindset will be part of your everyday life. You will notice events and your reaction to events as they happen. Your interpretation of past events will help you interpret current events better. You will learn not only while you are journaling but while you are living life. You will notice events and interpretations of events that you did not notice before. You will have mental models of situations in your head based on what you have journaled in the past. Your brain can then use these models as you experience and interpret new experiences. Written problems, issues, and obstacles tend to be smaller and more manageable. The process of writing them forces you to articulate your problems. Once articulated and written down, you can focus on interpretation and creating solutions. An awareness mindset will lead to you taking responsibility for your life. You will understand yourself at a deeper level. Positive and negative experiences will be opportunities to learn and grow. A continued focus on understanding yourself will reveal your deeper \"Why's\". This understanding will lead to understanding your life purpose. Journaled Life provides more insights on life design and journaling. ",

Here is one of MY FAVOURITE journaling strategies: Dump, Dump, and then Dump the Dump Maybe you\u2019ve just gotten into a fight with someone important. Maybe something bad has happened at work. Or maybe you\u2019re just stressed out over a bunch of things. Something is going on in your life and you\u2019re feeling it on an emotional level. This journaling assignment invites you to write about the event, what happened and how you feel about it Dump #1\u2013 Express all of your thoughts and opinions. Dump #2\u2013 When you think you\u2019re done, keep going. Get it all out of your system and write even the stuff that you would never, ever share with another soul. Then, when you are completely done, write the following words: \u201cIt\u2019s time to turn myself around\u201d and start to think about releasing yourself from the bad, rotten, frustrated, feelings you are having. (Dumping the Dump). To redirect yourself ask, \u201cWhat do I want to do about this problem?\u201d or \u201cHow do I want to view the world differently from this point forward?\u201d Once you generate some answers to these questions, you\u2019ll feel much clearer, more powerful and more at peace. How Can I Apply This Strategy? We ALL have so many incredible things we want to do with our lives. We seek to improve our businesses, our health, and our relationships with loved ones and with ourselves. The bottle neck is that we carry a whole host of narratives that do not fit or equate with the lives we would LOVEto lead. Use your journal to just unload, to dump it out and to write it down: \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going on, here\u2019s why it creates this type of emotion, this is why I\u2019m stressed or overwhelmed,\u201d etc. Write down what\u2019s happening. Then when you think you\u2019re done, keep going. Keep dumping. Keep writing about it to make sure that it\u2019s all out of your system. And then when you\u2019re completely done, unload it. Unload all your frustration, your anger, your fear, your anxiety, your pissed off-ness, whatever it is. When you\u2019re done unloading, write the following line: \u201cIt\u2019s time to turn myself around.\u201d At that point, you want to stop dumping. You want to dump the dump. In other words: \u201cI\u2019m done dumping. I\u2019m finished with that, and I\u2019m ready to head in a new direction.\u201d To head in a new direction, we can start answering questions like, \u201cWhat do I want to do about it? How do I want to view the world from this point forward? How can I move forward from here? What would I rather have?\u201d So that\u2019s the moment that you turn yourself around. You begin your journal unloading and you end your journal refocused. ",

            "answer_text": "Connection is so important.  Creating it, building it and nurturing it. This is true in so many aspects of our lives, but also true as the fundamental benefit to writing. Read all of the self-development online content and the key overlap answer to a lot of those questions is keeping a journal or diary. What they never mention is why and how. Lets take it back\u2026 way, way back. Dump your laptop. Find a tangible journal and use your good ol\u2019 fashion handwriting skills to really put this benefit into play. Why? It is different. Writing with your hand and onto a piece of a paper is very different than typing into your laptop. It may be a slower process, but the benefits are much greater. 3 key reasons why: Emotion. Channeling your thoughts from your mind to a piece of paper involves an honest broker and none is more honest than your penmanship. It is not about your legible (or illegible) handwriting, but more so about being able to tell how you are feeling as you dictate those thoughts. It could tell you a lot more than just actually writing down how you feel.You will find your thoughts to be more raw and unfiltered because with each stroke you exert to create those words, you will be able to connect with how you are feeling at specific point in time.Escape. Life throws a lot at us on a day by day basis. Managing your work life, career, while ensure your personal life is well-kept and if you have children to care after? It is easy to see why so many people are just overwhelmed, never mind the fact that we carry personal computers in our phones filled with so much content and people fighting for our attention. Writing helps you escape. It helps you channel your mind, your thoughts, emotion and better able to focus on that particular aspect in that particular time\u2014aka the art of mindfulness.Mental Health. A lot of mental health researchers have found positive correlations between the benefits of journal vs. their non-journaling counterparts. For one, it lowers stress, anxiety and improves organization and more importantly gratitude and happiness. You will find yourself having the space to think about the lines you are writing and cut yourself some slack in a lot of areas.",

            "answer_text": "Life can slip by so fast so that most of us don't realise it. Document your feelings, thoughts, victories, struggles etc. Keeping a diary is a good habit & I have also kept it. There are some points that I have discovered. They are as listed below:  First of all, you write all your minor & major details of your life like all your events, daily activities, crush, stories, motivational quotes, some specific topics etc.  From my experience, I write all my daily activities like what happened with me, my family, friends but one thing that changed my life is, that many times if I don't perform well then, I would write my target on one side of the page and the current resulton the other. Comparing both of them helped in improving my result You can write your goals, dreams, role model & the real exciting thing is that, it becomes your memories. If u are depressed then  it you re-read it & can  fix your goals Also u can write your resolution of the year like it is really good thing cause there is no one who wil always remind you about what you want to do this year, your personal time, selftalk but dairy do these things. Also, your English becomes good.      You make your timetable in your          dairy & you allocate your time so           that you can achieve your goals.   You can write your crush stories so after some time whenever you read your  dairy the simple cute sweet smile occurs on your face. In your college time, your life changes every year & if you write your small things then you can understand yourself better cause no one understands you better then you.  You can write your secrets in the diary cause if u can't keep your secrets yourself then don't think that anyone do  You become more creative &  also your communication skill increases.  And I really feel all these things works cause I can do these all things & my life changed. If you can't do this, you are really missing something. Cause in this world, no one has that much time that they try to talk with themselves. All people are running for money & you need to talk to yourself. Cause Your memories are happy & sad moments of mixtures",

            "answer_text": "TL;DR - Read just the Bold sub-headings.   Coherence in communication\u2013 How many times have you felt that you perfectly understood an emotion or a feeling but are unable to express or explain it in the form of a coherent sentence to the listener? When we don\u2019t write, it is not necessary for our brains to articulate thoughts into coherent words/sentences. They are just mental images that run like a fast-paced movie enough for our own comprehension. When we try to write, our brain takes an effort to express these images in clear understandable sentences. This gradually helps you to be more precise in communication.  Vocabulary\u2013 Assume you heard/read the word \u2018furious\u2019 for the first time somewhere. You would have understood that the meaning of that word is \u2018extremely angry\u2019 and you might have related to somebody or yourself being extremely angry at some situation. Due to the infrequent usage of \u2018furious\u2019 in your day-to-day vocabulary, you might tend to forget the word. When you write a diary and you came across an event on a day that you were extremely angry, your brain digs up and resurfaces that mental picture and gives a better word to describe that particular event of the day. Note that you now have a real-life event to relate to that word and in due course of usage, the word gets added to your vocabulary permanently.   Grammar & Spelling\u2013 When people correct other\u2019s grammar mistakes, do you think they go around grammar-checking each and every sentence they read/hear? No. When you ask them how they found out, most of them would answer \u201cIt just sounded wrong\u201d. Regular usage (Reading, Listening or Writing) of a language will inherently teach you the correct and incorrect sounds of the language\u2019s grammar. Writing doesn\u2019t need an external entity like a person, book or a movie and so it is the easiest form of regular usage. Nostalgia\u2013 This is by far the biggest reason one has to write a diary. Do you wish to be happy? Yes, of course. How long do you wish to remain happy? For as long as possible. The memories of ecstatic and agonizing moments of life don\u2019t fade away quickly like other memories do. But the intricate details concerned with those moments do fade away. When you describe a happy moment of the day in your diary, you include almost all the minute little events that were part of the joyous occasion. Read it back immediately, the next day, the next year or 10 years later. You completely re-live that moment and literally extend your happy moments.    Additional Memory\u2013 \u201cI remember meeting this fascinating/abominable person at that wedding. But I don\u2019t remember her name.\u201d Go back and check your diary. Bingo!! Not only does it serve as an extended memory to your brain but remember it is enough to recollect one small event or one person\u2019s name and all other related memories come flooding back into your brain. So it\u2019s more than you've just written in your diary.   Self-Reflection\u2013 It goes without saying that the diary serves as an irrefutable proof of how na\u00efve or ignorant you were \u2018X\u2019 months ago. It gives you a clearer measure of how much you've grown (or not grown) in a given period of time.  Emotional Outlet\u2013 The diary is your best emotional outlet. The days I\u2019ve felt sad, angry or frustrated, writing it down not only calmed me but also helped me think clearly. You can vent out as much as you want to your diary like it is your best friend.   Silent Motivator\u2013 When you keep writing longer descriptions of your days, your short-term and long-term goals automatically gets written to your diary. Not only do they serve as written reminders but since you\u2019ve written them down, you've already subconsciously reminded yourself of working towards that goal. You THINK\u2013 You are your thoughts. Recollect a bad decision that you made in your life and carefully inspect the regret of having made that decision. Many times it comes down to \u201cI wasn't thinking clearly\u201d. \u201cHad I thought clearly, I wouldn't have bought that house.\u201d \u201cHad I thought clearly, I would have expressed my love for her.\u201d Diary is one form of quiet retrospection. It is the closest form of quantifying/measuring your thoughts and actions. The more you think clearly, the better, calmer, clearer and firmer are your decisions.  ",

            "answer_text": "Justin Bieber\u2019s \"Where Are You Now?\" is on auto-repeat in my head this morning. It\u2019s annoying. Two days ago, \"Little Yellow One\" by Los Angeles punk/post-punk band Twisted Roots greeted me when I woke. A day before, White Zombie\u2019s \"More Human than Human.\"  I am not a Justin Bieber fan. I haven\u2019t listened to Twisted Roots in decades. And White Zombie appears at random times in my life. Earworms are annoying. But I find them interesting so I dedicate a page in my journal to them. In the past three months, other ear worms have included Joy Division's \"Transmission,\" Peter Murphy's \"Cuts You Out,\" Justin Timberlake's \"Sunshine in My Pocket,\" Van Halen's \"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love,\" DJ Lag's \"Trip to New York,\" and Major Lazer's \"Hold the Line.\" I'd like think writing those songs down will help me forget them. It doesn\u2019t. Maybe writing them down might help me figure out what\u2019s going on in my life. It doesn\u2019t. Somewhere I read - can\u2019t remember where - that music is one of the ways God speaks through you. But I wonder: Why would God speak to me through Justin Bieber, Twisted Roots, and White Zombie? Through the hundreds of other songs that take up precious neural space? I suspect that if I sat down and thought about it, I could figure out what triggered each song. (I know the Joy Division and Peter Murphy are from the Google Play channel Goths Just Wanna Have Fun. I used that while editing a middle grades novel I'm working on.) Writing things down helps you memorialize things. It helps you hone your power of observation. When you write things down (like I do with that list of songs), you are in complete control. You choose what you're paying attention to, and how much attention you're giving that thing. You can deep dive as much as you'd like. If you choose to understand something you are interested in, writing increases that understanding. It takes discipline and if you write every day, your ability to focus on what is in front of you will increase. When I have an idea for a book, I read and take notes in my journal. I watch videos and take notes in my journal. I interview people and take notes in my journal. My journal is the place where the ideas percolate and come together in new ways. It's the place where I capture those ideas to make sure I don't lose them. What I end up writing may be totally different. But I'm OK with that. ### [I've written a different answer on how keeping a journal will make you a better writer here.] ",

            "answer_text": "Writing a journal has many benefits, but here are a few I think are important to consider:  Writing in a journal is a way to establish a writing routine. By making the time every day to jot down thoughts, whether one page or six, creates a good writing habit for those looking to improve their skill.Writing in a journal gives you the power of perspective. Revisiting past times and selves will help you realize that day-to-day life changes so much and you have, too. Writing in a journal is a way to say what you would not have otherwise said. Some of us have a lot rattling around in our brains - the release of a journal can not only be therapeutic, but it can also be life-saving.Writing in a journal is a productive way to spend your free time. By having it as an option, you can sit down and be quiet/listen to music and just be.Writing in a journal is an excuse to be creative. The space can be used in any way you choose - whether to write a daily account, doodle something you saw on the bus, or write lists of things you want to do this week. Having creative outlets is good for you.Writing in a journal is something that's privately yours. Having a secret or place like this can be freeing.",

            "answer_text": "So why am I doing this? And why do I think you should too?1. You can record special events.People take photos so they can remember days out, parties etc. A diary is like a completely personal, written photo, recording the things only you saw in as much or as little detail as you like.2. You can record normal events too.You might think that normal days are boring, until you start writing. I\u2019ve started seeing the special aspects of normal events, such as funny remarks or interesting things I\u2019ve seen.3. You can record your thoughts and feelings.You remember how things made you feel on certain days or in certain places, so your memory is more detailed.4. This is a kind of therapy after bad days.Getting your feelings written down on paper feels much better than keeping them to yourself. It can also help you think about things more clearly, and maybe even help decide how you feel about things if you are unsure.5. In fact, it\u2019s therapeutic even on good days!Make a hot drink, snuggle into a comfy chair, and take half an hour just for you and your diary. It feels great!6. You can improve your writing skills.Practice makes perfect! Seeing your writing develop is very rewarding.7. Why not try a foreign language?Practise your language skills and improve your vocab, without worrying about mistakes \u2013 it\u2019s for you, not for anyone else!8. Appreciate your successes.Sometimes, we don\u2019t appreciate what we achieve \u2013 writing down a challenge you overcame and how you did it makes you realise this!9. Assess your mistakes.On the other hand, you can understand things you could have done better, if you have to write something down and consider it.10. Leave the future You something to look back on!In a year or so, you can see how you have developed as a person. If you revisit a place, you can read what you saw or felt last time. Maybe you\u2019ll even show future generations what you used to be like!I wish you the very best of luck with your diary!

            "answer_text": "Thanks User-11824412406100059207 for A2A. I make a note of all the days I am happy! :) We have a tradition at home that every year on 31st December, all four family members sit together and discuss the good and not so good things of the year. We also discuss the challenges faced and how we overcame them. On the chilly night of 31st December 2015, when we were doing this round table family conference, in our cosy blankets, I realised that we were forgetting the good things that had happened to us...and we discussed more on the tough stories.We actually had to remind each other of the good things that had happened throughout the year. That day I decided that next day onwards, any day I feel happy, I jot it down in my diary. And I started that...in few months I observed the following: 1. I used to be excited to make as many entries as possible 2. Subconsciously, I started focusing more on what made me happy through the day. 3. I started having a sense of gratitude towards people in my life 4. I was happier than before 5. I felt lucky By the end of the year: 6. I could observe a trend of the things that actually make me happy 7. I could have candid conversations with myself and I came to know myself better 8. I was elated to follow my resolution throughout the year 9. I have set a target of making more entries this year than the previous one \u200c10. I have a documentation of all important events of this year that can be used if I write an autobiography This is how writing helped me :) I wish you all have a great year ahead! AMEN. -Prachi  ",

            "answer_text": "There are quite a few of benefits of writing a journal or diary: 1) They remain with you forever, A memory or how I like to call it \u201cA Memoir of your life!\u201d I initially didn\u2019t begin with diary writing directly, but I wrote small notes/letters to my Parents and my siblings way back when I was in my 1st or 2nd grade. I still have one of them and it is truly special to me.  Seems so na\u00efve, but holds a tons of memories. 2) You tend to increase your vocabulary, writing speed, writing skills and also increase your interest in reading books. If I like reading books today, one of the main reasons is I like writing diary. And it also increases your creativity. 3) It\u2019s like you have a friend, forever. I write Diary when I am sad, happy, angry, afraid, surprised, and any other emotion I am going through. You can express your \u201ctrue emotions\u201d and not be ashamed by it (or) even have a fear of it spreading through gossips.  I even went to the extent of giving kisses!! (Haha) This is from my 2008 diary, when I was in 6th grade. 4) You have a secret for yourself. And you can pretend to have something very special written inside(even though there isn't) and tease your siblings.  This( the pic above) is from my 2010 diary.  This particular picture is from my 2013 diary. 5)And when you read it years later, oh that emotion can\u2019t be put in words. When I read what I have written years ago, it brings a great feeling of nostalgia blended with- \"Oh! I don't wanna grow up, I wanna be that innocent and carefree forever!!!\u201dAnd when I see the spelling mistakes, grammar mistakes, and lots of other mistakes- I draw a picture of how I have grown through these years. So, diary writing is truly like you writing your own movie with you being the hero of that story!! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve kept a journal for years\u2014not always daily, but frequently enough that it provides a pretty good picture of what I was doing and thinking about in any given period. It\u2019s helpful to go back a year, two years, three years and see what I was doing\u2014 were there problems I was able to work out? Were there things I spent a lot of time worrying about which in the end didn\u2019t matter at all? Keeping a journal in this way helps me be more realistic about where I spend my mental and emotional capital. That thing I spent so much time worrying about in April turned out to be nothing\u2014showing me that maybe I shouldn\u2019t worry so much about a certain type of problem. I use my journal to talk to myself when I don\u2019t feel so great about something\u2014to get it down on paper helps me move from a vague \u2018feeling\u2019 to a more concrete statement of the problem, helps me to think things through. Often to get some clarity alone relieves the mood. If it doesn\u2019t, it points the way to a solution. I also use it conventionally to record things that happen\u2014who I saw or where I went, giving the feel of the moment, the highs and the lows, so that in the future when I wonder what the heck did I do with my year, with my life, it\u2019s there in all those black-bound artist\u2019s sketchbooks I like to write in. My life is not the blur it sometimes feels like, but rich and varied. I sometimes write poetry in it or draw things related to what I was thinking about\u2014so these things are all in one place instead of on doodle pads or scraps of paper. I think if I didn\u2019t have a place to do these things, I wouldn\u2019t do them. It pleases me when I\u2019m able to get a poem out of something I was thinking about or experienced\u2014capturing some essential impression. And the drawings and paintings are fun and make it livelier looking. Normally, I write everything on the computer\u2014except my journal. It\u2019s the only handwritten thing I do anymore, so it\u2019s more personal and intimate, more like talking to a friend. I think most of us could use more of that. And will be far more of sentimental value to my daughter when I\u201dm no longer here than a bunch of emails. So basically it\u2019s an arena for self-examination, a record of self-expression, and a compendium of events. I like the idea that these black volumes contain thousands of hours of my life, as I saw it at the time\u2014it tickles me to go back and see what I was doing in 2004, relive that moment, to see how I\u2019ve changed or how I\u2019ve stayed the same.

            "answer_text": "Writing a diary can have many benefits. Among the obvious ones would be the fact that keeping a private journal can help you with sorting out your thoughts. As a person whose head gets pretty crumpled from time to time, I can say that writing it out really helps me clean my mind a bit. Or, at least, calm it. The other obvious thing is that it makes your past more organised in your head. You\u2019ll be able to go back and take a look at some aspect of your past. You can return to that strange date that happened last month to refresh your memory and then tell it to that friend you\u2019ve been dying to tell it xD Or you can use it to remember again small details from days long gone. Another plus is that it gradually improves your writing abilities! It can boost your vocabulary usage and improve your creativity and you get better in composing complicated sentences or holding thoughts in your head while you\u2019re writing. Yo can also use your journal to let out emotions - unwanted onew as well as the pleasant ones. You can make one page very messy or write violently to let out your anger. You can tear the page with your pen and mark your journal this way instead of bottling up your negative emotions :) You can also use it to express happiness or creativity, though. You can practice doodling in your journal. You can try caligraphy without anyone judging you. You can try to write a short story no matter that it wouldn\u2019t make sense out of the context of your mind. When you look back at your past journals, you can also tell how your personality changed. You can observe the way you evolved and compare your reactions to similar situations to find out wether you succeeded in breaking a long time habit, for instance.. Also, your journal is basically a friend that has time for you whenever you need it. You can be sure of being always able to get out whatever needs expressing, writing down whatever needs to be remembered. A private diary is a place where you can express yourself. Unapologetically, fully, without any fear of being judged. ",

No matter what crap you write, how many times you complain about one particular thing, no one is going to stop you or roll their eyes at you. It'll act as a filter for your emotional turmoil and help you calm down before facing the world. Ever felt like no one understands you? Or, you can't really connect to anyone deeply? As if you feel like an outsider and they can't enter your world too? Great! Now, they don't have to. Moreover, no one really understanding you, is not a bad thing. It's never a bad thing. It means that you are your own unique self plus it keeps the mystery alive. You're unpredictable! And, if it ever gets too much and you crave for an outlet? Your diary is right there waiting for you.

            "answer_text": "There are countless direct and indirect advantages of maintaining a journal. In addition to providing daily practice, it becomes a convenient way to unload your feelings and emotions into a diary. You can always come back to it whenever you want to reminisce. Apart from these obvious advantages, dairy writing helps you to 1)Focus on your goals and objectives: We lead very hectic lives where proper management of time becomes a crucial aspect of life. In order to set priorities and not get distracted, writing helps you in reinforcing these goals and objectives in your life so that you do not stray from what you desire. 2)Mental well-being: Did you fight with your family? or is your girlfriend mad at you for some reason? A diary becomes the perfect silent companion as you write about your feeling and emotions instead of bottling them up. Once you write these thoughts on paper, You can finally be able to process these incidents in a healthy way. It definitely helps you in making better decisions rather than the ones based on impulse. 3)An everlasting record: I had started writing, as a hobby ever since I was a child. At that time, I used to buy huge notebooks and diaries and record everything that happened in a day. I soon ran out of pages to write, not only that the ever-growing pile of diaries was difficult to carry around and I ultimately had to give them away when my parents decided to shift to a different city. This is why I decided to go digital. One of the apps that I use has a very simple Interface, provides you with daily reminders to write so you never miss a day! How cool is that?

            "answer_text": "Joys of Journal writing If you want to grow from your worries, rather than get bogged down by them, try journaling. The main cause of unhappiness for grownups is their unmindful nature. There is a strong connection between happiness and being in the present. Unfortunately most people constantly brood over the past or worry about the future. As their minds rapidly rush from the past to the future, they are lost and the reward for this mindless tossing is mental exhaustion. Journal writing promises an end to this tiring mental clutter. When you write, you are in the present; although you write about a past event or wish a better future, your thoughts are penned down, and you do connect to the \u2018Now\u2019. And that\u2019s a liberating experience. Many strong left brained people find it difficult to connect to others emotions; and the right brained often feels a need to be more organized and logical. Journal writing helps both parties; as the logical kind get to regular writing, their creative muscles and finer sentiments blossom. On the other hand when the creative and intuitive write journals, they find clarity and reason to express what they feel. Medical research has also confirmed that regular journaling strengthens T-lymphocytes, the immune cells of the body besides also reducing the symptoms of asthama and rheumatoid arthritis. James Pennebaker, a psychologist and researcher at the University of Texas, in his \u2018Writing to Heal\u2019 has explained how stress often comes from emotional blockages and an overdose of thinking or a thinking addiction. When we write journals, we are essentially translating our experiences into a language, and that helps us grasp our experience- we actually see it for what it is, and our awareness of its insidious effect or otherwise increases. And that inevitably releases us from mentally unhealthy entanglements. It\u2019s easy to begin; just pick up a paper and pen or your laptop or your smart phone and start writing. You need not follow any rules except that just write down your feelings and thoughts without editing. You aren\u2019t looking for an \u2018A\u2019 through these journals; you are simply letting out your emotions and thoughts. And what follows is a natural and organic growth of the consciousness. We see our minds and feelings. Rather than being absorbed in the daily thoughts and feelings governing our lives, we can for a change become an observer- we get an aerial view to our life. Sparing twenty minutes daily may seem a challenge for the busy bees of twenty first century. But we do spend that much time daily over so many trifles anyway. Try an experiment now, and then read further: Resolve to \u2018just write\u2019 for the next 10 minutes. Set the watch and start. As you write, don\u2019t worry about what to write; \u2018just write\u2019 whatever comes to the mind. But remember an important principle: let the pen or the keyboard not stop for the next ten minutes, and even if you go blank, write that you are going blank but don\u2019t stop the pen! Start now\u2026. How did you feel? Restless, joyful, or indifferent? In either case, you have slowed down your life for ten minutes and inadvertently, as your life is rapidly speeding by you\u2019ve just pressed the \u2018pause\u2019 button.

            "answer_text": " 1. Journal writing helps you think things through I like to bite my nails, throw stress balls at the wall and overthink things, which isn\u2019t a good use of time. I spend so much time in my head I forget where I am sometimes. Journal writing helps me wake up! Writing about your inner life is a useful practice for getting ideas out of your head and onto the blank page Journal about problems you\u2019re having in your personal life, business or elsewhere. You can even use journaling to work on messy first drafts before turning them into Medium posts later on. Try these questions on for size: \u201cWhat went well yesterday?\u201d\u201cWhat didn\u2019t go well?\u201d\u201cWhat could I have done better?\u201d2. Journal writing is like having a personal therapist on retainer Anger. Jealousy. Disappointment. These emotions surprised me while journal writing because I thought all was rosy in the garden before sitting down to write. At first, I found negative thought patterns alarming. I even considered hiring an expert to help me work through these problems. Then I realised it\u2019s okay to leave negative thoughts on the page because nobody else will read them. Plus, it\u2019s cheaper than handing over thousands of dollars to a fancy therapist! Try: \u201cWhat am I angry about?\u201d\u201cWhat disappointed me?\u201d\u201cWhy do I feel that way?\u201d3. Journaling gets you into the habit of writing regularly I tear up so many first drafts, I\u2019ll have to plant a small forest outside Dublin when I\u2019m older. Journal writing helps me get over the problem of lousy first drafts. Let me explain: You don\u2019t have to worry about publication, criticisms or self-editing. Your entries are for you and you alone. Don\u2019t rip anything up! Now, if you haven\u2019t journaled before, being honest on the blank page is tough. It takes time to develop a habit of writing entries regularly. So, start by writing without expectation about your day. After all, who doesn\u2019t like to talk about themselves! Try: \u201cWhat did I accomplish yesterday?\u201d\u201cWhat would I like to accomplish this week?\u201d\u201cWhat ideas are on my mind?\u201d4. Journal writing is an ancient practice  Virginia Woolf (pictured) was a prolific journal writer So you\u2019re in good company. Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, Raymond Carver, John Cheever, Herman Miller, Vladimir Nabokov, Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf all kept journals. And they did alright! So, if you want to document your progress or even see how you\u2019re improving at your craft, keep a journal too. Try: \u201cWhat painful lessons did I acquire this week?\u201d\u201cHow can I avoid repeating my mistakes?\u201d\u201cWhat should I stop doing?\u201d5. Reading old entries is illuminating Our memories like to play tricks on us. We imagine things that didn\u2019t happen. We think back on Bitcoin hitting nearly $20,000 with nostalgia. Or we tell ourselves it was a great holiday when in reality, we ate a lousy paella on the second night and spent two days in the bathroom with food poisoning. When you read back in a journal entry, it hits you: \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s how it was. It\u2019s also bizarre to read back on events you\u2019d long forgotten like the time you broke up with an ex-girlfriend over text message. Was I really that much of an ass-hole? It would appear so! Try: \u201cHow should I have reacted in hindsight?\u201d\u201cHow are things different now?\u201d\u201cWhat would I say to a younger version of myself?\u201d6. Journal writing helps you express gratitude At the end of each journal entry, I sometimes write down three things I\u2019m grateful for. Sometimes these are high-level things like my health or having a job. On other occasions, I\u2019m grateful for simple things like the sweet taste of a cup of strong coffee or when I learnt the value of HODL. Expressing gratitude at the end of a journal entry is also an alternative to ranting and raving about the time an SUV driver cut you off at the traffic lights. Try: \u201cWhat am I grateful for?\u201d\u201cWhat do I value?\u201d\u201cWho helped me?\u201d7. Journalling helps you find ideas to write about Coming up with ideas for things to write about is a little like having sex, if you haven\u2019t done it in ages, it\u2019ll feel awkward and clumsy. What\u2019s worse\u2026 New writers, bloggers and artists often worry they don\u2019t have ideas or complain about writer\u2019s block. And the answer? Journal consistently and you\u2019ll discover anecdotes you can use in your fiction and non-fiction. Your brain or your subconscious will start to look out for ideas if you prompt it with introspection regularly (the brain is a funny organ like that). Plus, if you write just 300-words a day, you\u2019ll write 3000-words in 10 days and, possibly, a book within a year. Sure a lot of those entries will be personal, but you\u2019ll find a Bitcoin in the compost bin\u2026 if you know where to look. Try: \u201cWhat\u2019s on my mind?\u201d\u201cWhat skills am I developing\u201d\u201cWhat would I like to learn?\u201d",

            "answer_text": "I love journal writing. This habit has changed my life several times over and I know it works to get back on track when things are starting to slip.  There are several benefits to keeping a journal or a diary. The writing process helps you sort through the junk in your head and get to clear thinking. It can give you focus as you start your day. It can help you determine your goals for the coming year, month, week...and it can even hold you accountable if you use your journal as a way to sort of self-coach.  Yup. Those are awesome reasons to keep a journal.  But I think the benefits can be a little deeper than that.  Something magical happens when you sit down to write about yourself and your life. Whether you write out your own thoughts or regale stories about the people in your life onto the pages of your journal (or the screen of your computer) the magic potion is the actual movement of thoughts to words to the page (screen) in front of  you.  Thoughts come from your head, travel down your arm, and pour out through your hand (or fingers). They have a way of untwisting, sorting themselves, and taking the events of life and making them simpler, easier to understand. Writing in my journal, especially about things that leave me running in circles feeling confused and unclear....writing about those things literally sets them right.  The process of releasing the words and emptying out our thoughts can lead to problems solved, plans of action set to be taken, and old wounds healed.  I know it sounds out there and definitely full of woo woo, but this stuff works. You can change your life starting with pen and paper. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey, there! There are several benefits of keeping a journal or a diary. The first is that it helps you take note of important things, such as time, names, and ideas. Second, journals or diaries gives you space and freedom to express your emotions privately. Third, it develops your writing skills and abilities. Writing is also a form of communication, so being able to write in a journal or a diary helps you improve the way you write. Lastly, journals and diaries are like time capsules where you record your thoughts and experiences throughout your life. I think that the last one is very sentimental because it allows us to look back to those moments and memories we\u2019ve made with the people we\u2019ve bonded and formed relations. ",

            "answer_text": "They say that if you don't have the time to meditate then it means that you really should start meditating.  With a journal it's a similar story. If you don't know whether you should start a journal or not, then you really should. The main benefit is that a journal slows up your mind. It makes your thoughts easier to grasp and more understandable, purely because you have to structure them enough so you can transfer them onto a paper or a computer screen. So in the end, the main benefit of writing a journal is not the final journal - the record of your thoughts - but the process of writing itself.  I guarantee that every time you sit down to write an entry, you will discover new things about yourself, come up with new ideas, solve some of your old problems, and have an overall better connection with the reality and where you are right now.

            "answer_text": "I myself have recently started a journal; no more then 8 months.. But I have noticed so many benefits, that I have continued to do it daily. I became more productiveI would write down any tasks I would have to do; or any random ideas I would get. The idea was to SEE what had to be done, and clear up my mind of ideas so I could think more CLEARLY.Achieving goals became easierWhen keeping progress or writing down reflections during the day; I was able to notice certain things I was doing that WERE NOT helping me. This allowed me to build routines and systems that upped my chances for ACHIEVING any of my goals.Something to look forward toOne simple habit; led to so many positive outcomes. Knowing that, I am always excited to write in my journal. I\u2019ve learned it to be very such a powerful tool, and the more I do it, the more I love it.I hope this gives you some inspiration to start. ",

My thoughts are elevated- I don\u2019t need to suppress my emotions to feel better. But I don\u2019t experience the same energy everytime- I mean there are times when I feel gloomy inside. There are nights when I sleep after crying- umm! Yes it keeps me motivated. I cry to release it. Release the pain. I keep a check of my thoughts. Like what is the real cause of me- feeling empty, feeling upset or sad.  I maintain a regular journal to exactly know my thoughts, my feeling more. I live, talk, sense, walk with honesty. That\u2019s what I write everyday. I write when I loose my focus. I write to set goals- I make a plan for short term goals to make myself better each day. I write when I just feel terrible. I fake the reality- and use good words to bring back my power. There are times- when I just write to get uplifted. Like this. I praise myself - for everything that I\u2019m grateful for. I write to revatalise.  I am completely honest to myself. . PS: I know my handwriting is writing and thoughts are ambiguous sometimes. But atleast I know.  .My quora fam: Saumya Pathak . ",

I actually have a planner in which has ready set questions, but you can look at it if you feel of it to be useful. Secondly, you know, asking yourself great questions like, what did I learn today or how can I make it better or what did I do that was successful today, are fantastic brilliant questions, you know the questions you ask will change your life, change your thoughts, if you\u2019ve done any sort of personal development, you know the body affects the mind, and mind affects the body, if you didn\u2019t visit read a book, or something, I have a blog that contains many books which you could look at, but the key thing is, get reading, get writing, take notes, learn things, your life is got to have more meaning that the daily 9-5 or school or I don\u2019t know where you are, but if you want to make progress sometimes writing and journaling is a great habit to have because it solves problems. I have tried it myself, and whilst I ask myself every night, a question, it does sort of make you aware of how you spend your time, and how you could change your patterns or habits, so I don\u2019t know if this is making sense to you, but if you want to learn more check out my blog, or contact, me on the blog. Your thoughts, habits, and actions will shape your destiny, if this was useful, you\u2019ll find more details on how to change your destiny on my blog. Thanks for reading! ",

            "answer_text": "I have been writing journals for years, here is what I think. a) When writing you tend to recall the events for the day. This process improves your memory power, sharpening your memory with each passing day. b) Writing enables you to collect and de-clutter the thought process. It also increases the production of dopamine, a hormone that controls the brains reward system. The very thought of having completed a page of detailed summary gives me a sense of accomplishment. c) I would not recommend to use the journal in pouring out the darkest deepest secrets, but it will always serve as a reference when you need to look up a date as a reference to any specific event. Years later, go through the journal to see how much you have grown as a person. You might start seeing the world and yourself in a completely new perspective. ",

            "answer_text": "You gift yourself an awesome novel. Diaries can be the best gift we give ourselves, if written in a creative way. A usual diary goes like , I did this today. Tomorrow I've to do this as well. Today my friend said so and so. Can you believe that? He was being stupid. I corrected him.... Let me give you an idea how I write my diary. It has three characters and I've named them too! Manu, Baji and Billa.  Manu is short for 'Manasakshi'. It's the Malayalam word for Conscience. Has the features of an elder who speaks only when he has to. Very serious guy. Gives all the advices. Baji is the emotional guy. The sidekick. My heart. Random name from some movie. He explains how I feel about everything. Billa is the brain. He thinks of the practical side. The name Billa sounds like badass. He is kind of a hero of this diary.  My diary is a conversation between these three characters. I didn't have any guy friends that time so gave them guy names.  They are three different people, and the pages look like its a chat screen, with all the smileys :P  I write with three different inks. Red for Manu, Blue for Baji and Black for Billa. Three languages according to the mood. Malayalam, Tamil and English. I wrote diaries everyday in the beginning. Eventually it became once in a month or so, feels like we meet our friends after a very long time. I was basically an introvert in school. Small friend circle, ardent reader, average student. So it's like I put all my creativity in my diary, locked it in my almirah, hid the key, took all measures for it's safety. The best part is I write it with all the code words and inside jokes just like we talk with our friends. Only I can enjoy reading this :P Let me quote some of my diaries here. (I took them out of the almirah. Read them, laughed so much. Writing this after the one hour nostalgia part :P ) Scene:  Diary entry after the first  two months in my college.  11:40 p.m.5 October 2014Sunday ManuBajiBilla (Names written in 3 different inks indicating who is who) Billa: Guysss! Baji: Yep.. -_- Manu: Good evening :) Billa: I know we ain't excited about anything particular and that we are here only for the sake of a get together, but come on! At least pretend to be excited :P Baji: Yo yo  \\m/  -_- Manu: Haha... since when did these meetings turn out to be sooo boring? Billa: I know how to change this boring mood! LANGUAGE! Switch the language! Baji: Will that help? Billa: Let'shope so :P Baji: Enthadey aarum onnum mindathe? Nammal oru 2 months nu sheshamalle kanunne, pinnenthu pati? :O (Why is no one talking? We are meeting after 2 months, what happened?) Manu: Oru karyam chey, Admission day thottu thudangikko... shey namal nerathe meet cheyenda airunu... ippo dhe plot twist ellarkum ariyam. [Do one thing, let's start from the admission day...We should have met earlier now we all know the plot twist (plot twist indicates a love proposal by a really unexpected batch mate)]] Baji: Hmm admission day enthuvaairunnu.. kure forms okke fill cheyth, aalkaare okke nallonam vaainokki, Biscuit okke thinnu... xD (Hmm... admission day...? Filled up many forms, 'observed' a lot of people, ate many biscuits... xD) Billa: Hehee..orma undo? Keri vannapo kandath nammada Pachakkili, Thathachundan, Angrybird :D (Hehee.. remember?  The first people we saw were the greenbird, Parrot beak, Angrybird) Baji: Pachakilikkoru koodu....Pachakarimbazhiyulla koodu.. :P (Popular malayalam song featuring the word pachakili, greenbird) Billa: Ayale ippo kaanane illa.. enthu patiyo entho..Pinnenthuvaairunnu..? August 4 nalle open cheythe... DGP Alexander sir inauguration...kidu speech aairunnu.. pashe 2 mani aai food kittiyappo :'( (Haven't seen him for many days. Wonder what happened. Then what? DGP Aleander sir inaugurated the function with an awesome speech.. but we didn't get the lunch until 2'o clock ) Baji: Namda Adarsh nte mono act, Pooja de dance... Anchors.. powerpoint presentation... HODs intro... (Adarsh's mono act, Pooja's dance... Anchors... powerpoint presentation. .. Heads of the Department intro...) Billa: Guys fast forward... One week orientation class ^_^ <3 Baji: First day meet cheythavar... Baby Akhil, Audi Fathima, Angrybird Abhiram, Pattalam Abhishek.. heheh..  [People we met the first day... Baby Akhil (as cute as a baby) , Audi Fathima (she came in an awesome Audi), Angrybird Abhiram (performed 'very well' in an anger management session :P) , Military Abhishek (He wore a military print t-shirt )] ...... *and then stories of two months... including the part where one guy proposed his 'one week old love' to me, describing all the funny incidents ..* This one is just a sample. Not boasting about anything but I love my diaries... it has all the sad parts and happy parts of my life.. but reading it helps me to understand how much I have evolved over years. The tragedies became comedy.  So my point is, if you are going to start writing a diary, make it the most creative gift for yourself. It's not necessary to write it everyday... though it helps to remember all the details. Happy writing! Enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "This question reminded me of the Oscar Wilde quote from his play The Importance of Being Earnest. The character Cecily says: \u201cI never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read on the train.\u201d After all, a diary does reflect your thoughts and feelings at the time of writing, and these will often be unique to that very moment that you wrote them down. Reflecting on how you felt then can help you get over how you feel now. In addition to that, a diary can act as a soundboard. A way of writing things you always wanted to tell someone that never could. It could be a letter that goes unsent, a eulogy to a relationship, a tribute to your old self. I have to admit I don\u2019t actually own a diary that I write in consistently, but instead I write to myself when I feel the need to in the form of journaling. It\u2019s a form of mindfulness that encourages you to write solidly for a period of time. What you write is ultimately up to you, but it\u2019s generally your thoughts, feelings, and general stream of consciousness. Diaries are like writing your own first draft on the story of your life.

So it\u2019s not as if there\u2019s something bad about looking back, thinking about what we call the past; we\u2019re looking ahead to what we call the future. \u201cAll this information, all these ideas of living in the present are really saying it may be more effective and functional to handle what\u2019s in front of us and not worry as much about the past or the future. But still, that isn\u2019t to say it isn\u2019t valuable to look back.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re writing your journals in longhand or speaking your thoughts into a recording device.

            "answer_text": "Statutory warning: A very frankly written diary may be harmful for your future and may not become as famous as the diary of Ann Frank. The dairy in question is diary actually\u2026 right? I wrote a diary just during the first Iraq US war period. It was the period I was attempting my entrance exam then. Years later when you read it, it gives a vivid thought and even the emotions then come back to you. During our shifting and transfer I lost them I do not write diary now. I know i am not going to be consistent with it. My father writes expenses daily. Every year one diary. About 25 dairies are there with him. He is 80 now and still writes. He sometimes goes through them and narrates certain incidents looking at the entries and their sequence. Even expense and account entries will have a story. I am using expense manager app and it also has time recorded in it so after many years it will tell more interesting stories I suppose. So both diary (for sure) and expense records too will tell stories in future. Finally caution: Years later you may risk living with a spouse who may not relish those entries and those notes in oyur diary and this can be a problem in future. An innocent comment which you entered can cause big problems. I know of cases where this has landed the couple into big problems and these get amplified during the routine/trivial arguments. A few of my friends have confided this to me. Some cases it went beyond control. So if you think the content can be controversial burning the diary may be better. Your emotional stickiness to the past may cost your future. What, when and how to deal is left to the readers imagination, volatile nature of the entries and volatility of the spouse \u2026.;)\u2026.. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, diaries are a very personal thing, or they can be.  Someone could sit here and list hundreds of reasons, but the important thing is discovering why you think it's a good reason.  Some reason I think it's nice to do (despite the fact I can't seem to keep one myself): If you're a writer: it allows you to free write without focusing on a major project. It also allows for getting ideas out of your head that may be blocking you from focusing on a major project. It's a place to store memories: Depending if you ever plan on sharing it with anyone or not it is nice to have something to pass on to children or friends to memorialize your life. That is if you use it as a record keeping device. Helps with memory: I think this one is pretty obvious. If you right something down, you'd be able to reference it if you can't quite remember something. To express yourself: Sometimes it's best to keep our mouths closed in regards to feelings and observations. But if you're anything like me, sometimes those feelings and observations stick with you and it's nice to have somewhere to put them so you can move on without it hurting someone. Those are the reasons that come to mind for me. Whether that is a good reason for you I'd have no way of knowing. What do you want out of a diary? Is that a good reason to start one? It's up to you.

            "answer_text": "Yes, writing a diary is an experience one ought to have. Not only does it let you vent your emotions out in a way you perceive events, but it also provides you with an additional benefit of introspection and improves your skills of analyzing. When you repeat the events in your head while writing in a diary, you think through all the events again in a coherent manner. After my first year of college, I was a bit depressed and used to feel extremely lonely. I started writing my feelings in the form of documents on my laptop. After a few months of writing regularly, I found it all to be repetitive. I had written about my feelings to the point of exhaustion. I found that I no longer felt lonely - in fact, I felt bored of loneliness. And that was my time to move on. Diary writing is definitely nothing bad, or wrong. Be sure, though, to protect your diary if you are writing about other people. It's better to type your diary in a document and password-protect it, if you are comfortable with typing. Great part is that you can compile all documents. You will have a part of your life \"documented\". All the little details about incidents are there, if you ever need to refer. ",

The value for me was the act of privately expressing my feelings. Looking back on them, I realize how emotionally stunted I was and almost never wrote anything of insight or value.  As I've aged, I've done mostly electronic journaling. I tried LiveJournal for a while and that helped improve my writing skills considerably. I also used Daily Strength when I was going through a terrible period when I became agoraphobic. I would write about my fears and my CBT treatments. That journaling was quite cathartic and I'm happy to say my anxiety has remitted considerably. The journaling didn't cure me, but it gave me solace.   Journaling won't turn you into a great writer or a better person, but it will give you time to pause with yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, First thing to realise is that u have got this question which means your giving a thought about writing a diary. So, first suggestion is start doing it and then you yourself will get to know many things. Now coming to the actual question which is about the advantages. First is the satisfaction. We always have a best friend or someone close who we tend to share our things with or at the end of the day you need someone to tell your whole story. A diary can be that friend when u can't find anyone outside. Even when things go wrong if you write about it in your diary you don\u2019t have a fear of that person making it a gossip out of your personal sorrow.It gives a satisfaction that you have shared it someone and even that the secret is safe. Second is that analysis of yourself. The actual reality of your life and your desires comes out only when your are alone and your focus on your thoughts. And \u00e0 diary will give you that time to think about you. You tend to know your inner self and you will be amazed to know the actual you and what you want out of your life. The next thing is memories. (Both good and bad) a small reminder of incidents where you cherish your good memories and learn from bad ones. Well, of course there are a few more but there is also disadvantage and it's the only negative thing that I can think of and nothing else. And that is the security of the diary. If you can keep it safe the diary is the best habit. Hope this helps and have a good day. ",

I suppose it's a form of therapy. \"Talking\" to someone about your hopes, dreams, fears - even if that \"someone is just a blank piece of paper - is cathartic. I find I usually pour my heart out during challenging, unhappy times, and I always feel better with everything out, rather than swimming around in my head, playing reels over and over again.I probably don't go back and read 99% of what I've written, but it's there if I need it.It was interesting to learn, after recently reading a few of my years' old entries, that I and my problems really haven't changed much, despite the maturity and wisdom that comes with age.

Certain things can be noted down in a diary or a journal. It's a record of noting down your life events on daily basis. Being an introvert if you are, then you are into the category of people surrounded by events happened only around you.Ultimately, you need someone to talk to, open up yourself and share your feelings, ideas or thoughts. You really don't need a person to talk to. Just talk to yourself by writing it down. Anything noted down will stay only with you as long as you want,it's your little secret :) There will be no one to judge you or laugh at you. You are your own as long as it's your little secret.

            "answer_text": "It kinda depends on why you\u2019re contemplating doing it. Are you a writer? Want to be a writer? A journal will help you find your voice on the page. Stories will start there. They will also end. You can ask yourself questions that only you can answer. Keeping a journal might help you sort through your stress points and understand your frustrations. There are many benefits along these lines. But practicing your writing without pressure, with an audience of one, it probably the main reason I\u2019ve been filling up journals since I was a youngster. The only downside I can think of is having your private thoughts written down. Unless you destroy the books before you die, your descendants will have an opportunity to learn much about who you were. Depending on how you think about this stuff, that could also be a benefit. When you let a journal go, your audience is no longer just one. A journal is an intimate personal history. I differentiate between a journal and a diary. To me, a diary is a chronicle of daily events and feelings while a journal takes on a more literary air. Oh sure, my journal reads like a diary sometimes, but there are also threads of ongoing essays in there. It is a place to discover what you really believe and who you really are. Sometimes, that\u2019s different than what you think. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd say it's good for developing your writing skills. The way I see it, maintaining a diary has no drawbacks if you can do it without fail. The advantages are: Better understanding of the language you write in. Improves your vocabulary substantially if you're diligent enough to try and improve upon what you write.Better understanding of yourself and who you are. In turn, this will help you become a better person.If you're an introvert (like me), you can vent freely and without feeling like you're bothering someone(and yes, it feels good).Writing is a good hobby. You can spend your spare time simply penning what you feel like onto a piece of paper. Also helps develop your imagination.Being an author, I'd definitely recommend diary writing. It's not necessary to become an author (if you're aiming for it), as I never maintained a diary. I've been writing stories all my life (short stories for 8 years, novels for 5) so I've never really felt the need to maintain one. I hope this helps to motivate you into starting a diary! If you think that maintaining a diary is actually fun, you could take it to the next step and make it a regular part of your life. Best of Luck!! ",

When you read about yourself from the past and analyze your thoughts you realize your strengths and weaknesses in an amazing way5. You know exactly what mistakes you keep repeating and you can take better steps to correct them6. You can identify people who keep doing wrong to you and you keep forgiving them, which can be useful if you'd like to change7.

            "answer_text": "We keep a great deal of things in our minds, yet we put less down in writing. Every one of those musings and thoughts ricocheting around can here and there feel overpowering. You need plans for the day,dreams, insider facts, disappointments, love, misfortune, good and bad times. Thoughts go back and forth, sentiments pass. How would you recall every one of them? How would you keep them sorted out? An incredible method to keep your musings sorted out and clear your psyche is to record them in a diary. Composing or writing is an extraordinary exercise for anybody and by communicating in an individual spot is a superb method to remain normal. ",

It takes a great deal of 'guts' for some to openly talk about writing into a diary. This is is something that I use on a daily basis, my 'journal' not only serves as a space for me to write my daily thoughts, ideas and dreams, but as the pages accumulate and life passes us by, upon reflection of the pages and what you have written, you will be able to see growth, not only personally, but in your confidence!  Being able to appreciate yourself is one of the keys in life to happiness, and writing to oneself is not what some ignorant individuals would deem 'pathetic', rather it is a powerful tool in self growth, self appreciation, and it will help you if used as a tool on your tool belt on life. It is invaluable in your continued growth and development. We are human beings in the end, and whilst our body may be seen as a depreciating asset, don't let your mind and brain be left without constant upgrade, studying and reflection!!!! Keep up the good work and I truly and honestly support anyone who thinks of writing a diary. ",

I find they are just a good way to let out my feelings, as well as to look back on and remember certain experiences and such. I have never regretted having a journal or diary, simply because I do not see any harm in them. When I was younger, I used my journal to describe what I did that day and what I was excited or sad about. Once in a while, I\u2019ll take a trip down memory lane and flop on my bed with a journal from a few years back. It will make me smile, laugh, or just simply remember activities or events I took part in. Now, I have a journal with a lot more depth and thought put into it. Sometimes I will feel just so apart from the world that I have to confide in something non-living. Other times it can feel relieving to just spill everything out on paper. I would highly recommend keeping a journal or diary, even if you do not write in it often. ",

It\u2019s the art of documenting your life. If you\u2019re not Casey Neistat, then probably your whole life is not recorded and uploaded to the internet daily. Journaling is then the easiest, hassle free way to record your daily actions and reactions. Now why should you care about documenting your life? Because, that\u2019s how you build integrity. Your deepest desires, all the hate and jealousy you possess, every regrettable reaction that you acted out ... these need to come to light. When you write these on a paper, they will stare at you. Everyday. You\u2019ll discover stuff about you that you didn\u2019t know before. Thus, you\u2019ll be presented the opportunity to get better today than you were yesterday. And when one gloomy evening you are feeling depressed, just look at some of your journals from 6 months ago to see how far you\u2019ve come. These pages will stay with you forever reminding you to be better today than you were yesterday. ",

It is something like taking care of your parents/kids yourself rather than sending them to the best foster-care/day-care of the world. The bond which you create when you write with your hand on the paper is on a totally different level.When you write on the paper, you see things taking shape - word by word. The time lag gives you the thinking space which you require. Compared to typing where you can punch in 80 words per minute, writing is slow and hence you get the added time.When you see your handwriting, your mind captures the image. It sticks longer in the mind. Lastly, when you see it again, it is easier to create the emotional connection with the same. Just by seeing your handwriting, you can think about the mood you were in.I would recommend you to have a physical journal on any given day. You can also have an online diary to supplement your physical journal and not the vice-versa. You can update your online journal with the snapshot of your handwritten note but go the old-way. :). ",

A way to make friends in parts if the world.  Journals can also be a way of recording one's creative endeavors: poetry, short stories, plot lines, notes and even photography.  But, it is something more. For some, this is the most important reason of all for journaling. Many people have emotional and psychological issues. Often, journaling provides a way of expressing those issues, at one's own pace. Journaling, for many becomes a way of exploring and coming to grips with issues, both through individual exploration and through group sharing (in electronic journals). It becomes a cathartic experience. A very necessary one sometimes.  ",

Write about the incidents and happenings of the day and your feelings and thoughts about them.  2. Try reading some of the previous posts to realise and analyse yourself. This will help you understand yourself more clearly. 3. Go back to step 1.  Once you get good with the habit, it will become your tendency to understand yourself as you write.  This will give your thoughts and ideas in your mind, an outlet in the form of words which you will be able to understand and hence the purpose of self-reflection will have been achieved. ",
