            "answer_text": "How practical or impractical is it when 'willing suspension of disbelief' is employed in situations of real life? Not practical at all. I would say: not impractical either, because the term\u2019s not applicable to real life. It applies to fiction, for fictional elements we\u2019d disbelieve in real life - but for our enjoyment of the fiction, we prefer to suspend that disbelief.  \u201cWilling suspension of disbelief\u201d describes an approach to experiencing something you know to be a fiction account. Film, book, tv show, play, whatever. You know absolutely know beyond doubt: This is not happening. This is not real. It\u2019s pretend. Willing suspension of disbelief is used in a case where we know it\u2019s pretend, and we pretend it isn\u2019t. Just for a better, more seamless enjoyment. You engage willing suspension of disbelief when you let go and immerse in the story. In the story\u2019s theory and rules. You accept certain things that may be a bit implausible for real life. For the story, it\u2019s just part of the package deal on offer. These unbelievable elements are established parts of the established story. Jet-packs and scum-ray blasters. Magic staves that make vwoo-vwoo noises when waved, and can conjure crap special effects at an arcane SHOUT. Three hundred feet monsters. I don\u2019t mean that tall - these things have three hundred feet each. Human feet, looks like. Attached to a weird golf-ball body, with a staring eye in each dimple! Point is. You accept what\u2019s presented as part of the story\u2019s world and rules. This only gives the storymaker so much latitude. We\u2019ll accept the different rules of the world, but if characters presented as human, and in particular, as reasonably intelligent keep making stupid and impossible-to-believe decisions just to keep the plot going - that\u2019s not covered. That\u2019s nothing to do with the rules of that reality. It\u2019s just crap writing. Poor storytelling. It busts suspension of disbelief. It breaks deals with the audience. It takes them out of the story.  Point is. The term was invented to describe a specific thing about appreciating fiction. What the term means does not have applicability to real life. We are not in a position of first, knowing beyond doubt: this isn\u2019t happening. This is not real. And then saying \u201choo hoo, accept it anyway for fun! Dive on in. Let go.\u201d If that happened in real life it wouldn\u2019t be real life. Just an impromptu bit of fake-ass live-action role playing you decided to put on. Knock yourself out, but that\u2019s not willing suspension of disbelief, so much as it is deliberately being an ass. The fact what you\u2019re immersing in is not in reality happening is the fundamental condition of the term \u201cwilling suspension of disbelief.\u201d It\u2019s what the term means. In real life, it is actually happening. There\u2019s no \u201cdisbelief\u201d to suspend, in anything like the same sense. Everything that happens is real. Real people and things in motion, saying one thing, doing another - it is all really happening. We don\u2019t have to suspend disbelief of fictional elements when there are none.  However, for real life we do have two other excellent terms. Perhaps you\u2019re thinking of one of these? They\u2019re not the same thing, but at least they would not be torturously misapplied: \u201cbenefit of doubt.\u201d Here\u2019s where you don\u2019t know the truth of it. You may have some idea, but you don\u2019t know. You suspect, but you don\u2019t know. You\u2019re poised between believing the worst (probably of someone) or just\u2026believing the worst isn\u2019t true. And you cut someone a break. You don\u2019t know they\u2019re innocent, but you decide you\u2019ll take the risk and act as if. You give them the benefit of your doubt in the matter.\u201csuspension of judgment.\u201d Nothing like \u201csuspension of disbelief.\u201d Nothing like \u201cbenefit of doubt.\u201d Here is skeptic inquiry: rejection of final conclusion. Provisional conclusions only, with a purpose to act and test. You do not decide the truth. You do not believe. You do not disbelieve. You suspend judgment, pending compelling demonstration.That first one can be risky, but not so risky as trying to live without it. The second one\u2026you would not believe the difference it can make in every facet of life. ",

            "answer_text": "Having the ability to suspend disbelief for a limited time in order to hear someone out, research something more intensively, keep an open, but not gullible, mind, and avoid the pitfalls of blinding cynicism, can be a very practical approach when endeavoring to get at the truth. Any kind of obstacle to potential truth that can be removed at least temporarily can only be helpful in most situations, except perhaps, for those situations which require immediate emergency action with no time to investigate the veracity of what one is seeing/hearing. Those are the times when we have to be able to trust and depend on our intuition, instincts, and gut feeling. Can you trust and depend on yours? ",
