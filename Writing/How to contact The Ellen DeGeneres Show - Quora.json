I have a BS Mechanical Engineering Degree courtesy of a local Engineering University here in the Philippines I am writing to inquire if there's any posibility of me joining your show. I am now unemployed and financially burdened for the same reason,. I really enjoy wstching your show and wanted to find out if there's any possibility of me being a part of your show. I am now here in the Philippines but I can borrow money for an airplane ticket to able to go back to the USA to submit to an.interview. I hope that you'll be kind enough to respond to my inquisition. By the way my son-in-law is a local actor hired by Robin Williams to appear in one of his movies. I just can't remember the title of the movie Tnx a lot in advance for any opportunity you can give me. Sincerely, Ricky R. Valencia ",
