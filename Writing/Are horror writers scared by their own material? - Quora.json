            "answer_text": "For myself as a writer of horror, the macabre and sci fi, I write what disturbs me, or would scare me were in the scenario I'm writing about. In my latest work, Death of Heaven, I found it terrifying as a concept on a variety of levels from the base to the highest levels. It shakes your foundation. No matter where you want to run for safety, there literally is nowhere to go.  I worked in the 80s in a hospital, in the sub, sub basement, at night. I had been working there for a while when, one day, I realized that while I was sitting there waiting on mainframe processes to finish, I was killing time by reading horror novels. When I had to walk the empty 2AM hallways of an empty and immense medical center, it was pretty spooky and the books enhanced that feeling. I found I enjoyed the feeling I got in bringing the effects of the book on me to greater activation in my real life. So I thought I should try writing there and maybe that would carry over to the reader. I decided I would just write what unnerved me. I knew I had done a good job whenever I entered those hallways on the other side of that thick, locked security door, and felt uneasy, maybe a touch paranoid.  I once ran into a cadaver, lying on a gurney, sitting there alone in a hallway with no one about. It was an unnerving feeling and one I tried to put into the story I was writing that night (the feelings, not the situation). I put some of those stories into the book I mentioned above and then I started to tweak things and push the envelope and, from what I'm hearing from readers, I did rather well. So to answer the question, and I can't speak for other authors, but for myself, yes, I get spooked by my writings at times when I'm writing them. Because I feel that if it disturbs me, it will disturb others. Even when I reread them long after I have written them. Anyway, that's my goal, to translate what I feel when I write, to my reader.  I've had a life that has led me to repeatedly face my fears. So when I write something that scares me, I figure that it must be pretty intense. Obviously this is up to the reader to decide if I've done a good job, but so far, it would seem that I have. ",

However, I did once successfully manage to disturb myself while writing a scene, and have never been able to read the sentence since without shivering. During the most gruesome scene in the book, during which a young man has his cheeks opened up in a \"Glasgow Smile\", I wrote this: \"A human face reveals the truth once its teeth are exposed - that it is nothing more than a mask of flesh covering a skull.\" Human experience requires us to forget, at least momentarily, that we are more than separable body parts.  We need to see people as a whole, because who could interact from day to day if they constantly dwelled upon the fact that flesh can be removed from bones, blood emptied from veins, and faces divided into pluckable eyes, removable teeth, and tearable skin?  The sentence above was an insight into how one of the more vile characters from the book sees the people that surround him: as nothing more than puppets of meat. ",

Whenever something frightens me - whether it's a creepy place, a terrifying experience or a full-on phobia - I write a story about it.  Cowards like myself make great horror writers, because we know what it feels like to be afraid, and we never run out of ideas to write about. Writing stories inspired by our own fears requires spending time with that fear. Sometimes, I've been so frightened, I had to stop writing that story and put it aside for a while until I felt braver.  Once the story is finished, though, the fear is replaced by a sense of triumph: By fictionalising the fear, I've gained control over it. By writing about what frightens me, I can make it less frightening. ",

Then, once I start writing (I'm very good at being descriptive) I scare the crap out of myself then go get my cats to snuggle with me.
