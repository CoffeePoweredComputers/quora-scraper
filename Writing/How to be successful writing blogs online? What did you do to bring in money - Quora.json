            "answer_text": "Tips On Structuring A Successful Money Making Blog  Ever heard the saying with success comes money? Well that is the case with blogging and building a blogging brand. Attributing your focus on success instead of money is essential and it is the only way you can make money blogging because it requires patience, time, hard work and consistency. Most bloggers quit within the first 3 months of blogging after realising that it is not an easy path and in order to build a successful blog, you should treat it like a business with a brand name. As I have discussed in an earlier article that the reason why most bloggers don\u2019t have a viral post is because they never aim for one. It is easy to spot an opportunity if looking for one! If you dedicate the right amount of time on using powerful strategies to structure a successful blog, you are most likely to have a well-known blog. I have seen many videos on YouTube giving ideas on ways which you can generate passive income working from home. Blogging is usually number #1 on the list and that is because it is one of the most flexible jobs you can have, and the earning potential is limitless! When you get a nice amount of people reading your articles, it brings in a nice income. Possible money earnt? I know bloggers making between $2,000-$100,000+ per MONTH. What is SEO? SEO stand for search engine optimization and it is a process that optimizes a website, so it performs extremely well in organic search. As simple as that! Why Is SEO important? With today\u2019s world most consumers search the internet to buy a product or look for a service. They submit their keywords in for search and get a list of relevant websites in return. People tend to visit websites that are on top of the list because they appear to be more relevant to their search. This can be achieved through the right SEO strategies such as a fast loading website, having internal and external links, using the right keywords and the relevancy of the article\u2019s information. SEO is very essential when it come to building a blog. The most amount of traffic that you will get will be from organic search and this can only be achieved when you have an SEO friendly website/blog. ",
