            "answer_text": "Great question.  The terms and industry are still new enough that right now there there is some flexibility in the way we can define them.   The way it makes the most sense to me in filtering all of this is to define two types of transmedia.   One is just as described above.  It is a story world, or maybe really a canon, created by many stories across multiple media.  Those stories, while sharing the same canon are still separate stories, but ones that help to form something greater than their individual parts.  They may interact with or acknowledge each other's plots but they don't necessarily have to as long as they are joined by a common canon.  There are too many examples to name here but it is the most common and most popular form of transmedia.  Star Wars, Batman, Star Trek, Harry Potter, etc.  There are many wonderful and terrible implementations out there. The other type of transmedia is a single story that uses multiple media.  These are less frequent and less well-known.  Many Alternate Reality Games (ARG) I think would fall into this category but really any story that exists in a state in which you can not actually \"consume\" the story without crossing into other media would count for me.  That is not to say that there can not be multiple characters and plots and timelines and experiences, but it is a single cohesive story with all elements adding to the understanding of that fictional narrative. So that's my take on it.  There is some overlap of course.  I guess you could call one transmedia and the other transmedia storytelling.  I grant that it is a personal distinction but one that I find to be useful when producing transmedia or doing research into the narrative space of transmedia fiction. ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of commercial transmedia efforts fall flat because they're uncompelling, shallow, or easily dismissable as desperate marketing tricks, but this doesn't mean that transmedia can't tell stories. But your comment suggests to me that you have a strict internal definition of \"narrative\" or \"story\" that transmedia doesn't fit into. If you're still defining \"stories\" as single instances of narrative locked onto single isntances of traditional media-- you probably need to change your opinions about what art can be. That kind of opinion isn't going to do you any favors if you're trying to \"get\" transmedia. Loosen it up a bit. ",
