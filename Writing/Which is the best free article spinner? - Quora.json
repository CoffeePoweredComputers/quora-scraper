            "answer_text": "I tried many article spinners and I have found that Cleverspinner is the best. It rewrites content just like a human writer. I guess it is so good because of the highly advanced technology it uses. I attached one example. You will notice that the text is spun perfectly - there are no errors at all. And it is unique from the original. There is nothing more one could ask for.The tool is also sometimes able to rewrite complete sentences, but I get more unique results with just word and phrases rewriting.  The articles usually pass various plagiarism test\u200es, but I usually do check this for every article I paraphrase using any method just in case. It is really painful to have to rewrite manually. This software saved me a ton of time. I also have tried various other content spinners, and have found that they usually have bad synonym suggestions, so I have to check each and every word in the article, and change quite a few words. I takes a lot of time to do so and this is really boring thing. I prefer doing other things instead. It is not a small thing when you have to check individual words and phrases for mistakes in 500 word article. It takes me between 30-60 minutes to do so per such a piece of content. And with the CS tool it is possible to do so completely automatically. Sometimes you need to change a few synonyms but this takes just several minutes per article. I adore that its web-based so I can use it from any browser. It is not free, but it is well worth the price. All hard word is done on their servers, and its actually a quite fast software. I get typical articles done in around 10-15 seconds. Interface is simple and clean, and there is also a spintax editor that can be used to change synonyms. It is also possible to add your own synonyms. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, there are hundreds of free article spinners you can find online. And they of course create unique copy of any content you throw at them. But you know what? They have only one feature, and it is to replace word with its synonyms so it becomes unique. They don\u2019t understand what the heck on earth context means, and hence they don\u2019t bother about it. For instance, if you throw a sentence at them like \u201cOnce I finish reading this book, I will open my laptop and book a hotel for our next trip\u201d Now, you and I can easily understand that word \u201cbook\u201d here has different means. But those free \u201cspinners\u201d don\u2019t. And guess what? When you use them to spin this sentence, well \u2014\u2014\u2014 you will get a unique copy of it for sure, but it will make no sense. So, free article-spinners are available all over the internet, but to be honest, they are not worth using. Sure if you have enough time to spin an article manually, and you need a little help of spinners, then they are a good fit. But if you have lot more contents to spin, and of course, you are serious about your spun contents, then I think you better buy a premium article spinner. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to break the bank to buy a premium spinner. There are many advanced spinners which come up with whole lot of features, and of course, at a reasonable price. The Best Spinner 4, for example, is one such affordable spinner that I recommend you to go for. It is at it 4th generation now, so you can get your hand at tons of exclusive features. And most importantly, it is incredibly affordable, so it will suit your budget for sure. Hope this helps Cheers\u2026. ",
