            "answer_text": "Reading in general is a crucial part of editing. So if you aren\u2019t an effective reader, than your editing goes out the window. This has major major effects on your writing quality. If you read slowly, you become a better reader. Even though reading isn\u2019t solely about speed, it more so depends on how well you understand what you\u2019re reading. Reading slowly is a good way to do that rather than skimming and potentially missing key points. I used to skim everything I read just to get done with it. I didn\u2019t take in the imagery, tone, setting, plot, etc. To be honest, that began to kill my love for reading. Then I\u2019d try to edit my articles and I\u2019d have a very hard time with it. My editing skills were basically fixing grammatical issues. There\u2019s so much more to editing than that. Here is my new editing process since I started reading slower: Cut all unnecessary fluff (almost 1/3 of the article)Wait another dayCut all unnecessary fluff again (about 1/5 of the article)Run through grammar checkerRead aloudEver since I started reading slower, I can enjoy other people\u2019s work more and properly edit my own. As I always say, editing requires you to be a student of the reader. To do that, you have to place yourself in the reader\u2019s shoes. That means, taking in all the nuances of your writing. And that means, reading slower. ",

            "answer_text": "That doesn\u2019t even make any sense. In order to write better it takes practice, being taught right from wrong and a purpose. Meaning when you start writing, you encourage yourself to develop the skill better through writing about things that interests you. How would literally reading slower help? Yes, you may be able to soak in the words, but that\u2019s also a no at the same time. If you\u2019re not interested in what you\u2019re reading, then you\u2019re less likely to give af about what words are stated infront of you. For example, I\u2019d rather read a manga in comparison to a mystery novel. If I\u2019m not interested in that specific manga, in comparison to the mystery novel\u2026.then I will soak in the mystery novels words more than manga. And the same vise versa. ",
