If it\u2019s fictional, you can do what you want. If you must have the speaker meander, in order to show character traits, I recommend the commas. However, if it\u2019s straight communication/exposition through dialogue, I would sincerely consider restructuring the conversation for clarity. If it\u2019s fictional, and the narrator is speaking direct to the reader, once again consider restructure, or use parentheses if you must. ",
