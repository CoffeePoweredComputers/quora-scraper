            "answer_text": "Below are only a couple of \u201cG\u201d samples in cursive. The bottom one is how I learned it in grade school. The first one seems to be used just as often. As people get further into adulthood, they sometimes create their own way to write the alphabet, and as long as it can be read and interpreted, I don\u2019t see any problem there. Often, a person will shift back to printing the letters, or some combination of both. Just make it readable.   ",
