            "answer_text": "The potential employers care about getting accurate information in proper format. Since a professional resume writer is working according to your instructions,you are responsible for the accuracy and content of your resume. Most of the job seekers understand that resume writing is not an easy task and many spend days, weeks or even months to perfect their resume. Since a perfect resume is an important factor on the basis of which the employer decides to give you call for the interview or not, it explains why some job seekers choose to rely on professionals to craft their resume. The fact that resume writing requires certain skill sets which most of us don\u2019t possess and without those skills we might struggle to properly convey our real potentials. In today\u2019s day and age of highly competitive work environment, hiring managers have become adept in filtering out the bad resumes and they have software such as Applicant Tracking System (ATS) which rejects the resume that doesn\u2019t meet the job requirements. Now, the bottom line is, if you do not have a resume that looks professional and does not have a correct format, that resume of yours could very well prove unfruitful as you\u2019ll never even get a chance to have it looked at by human eye. In the end professional resume writing services is there to ensure that your skills and experiences are properly conveyed to your prospective employer. There are various platforms that perform resume writing services, but i would advise you to go for Edu4sure, which is a very known platform for its certification courses, resume writing services and training services.

            "answer_text": "Job searching sure is expensive. After all, it costs money to dry clean your interview suit, fill up your tank and drive to each and every job interview. And at a time when you\u2019re counting every nickel and dime, you don\u2019t want to spend any more cash than necessary.

Here\u2019s why you might need a resume writer, and why it\u2019s such a good investment.  U Can\u2019t Right Good  Let\u2019s say you\u2019re an accountant.

From the quality of the paper it\u2019s printed on to the template used, the writer will make sure that your resume reads and looks its best  You\u2019re Not Getting Interviews on Your Own  You know your work experience is impressive and your workplace skills are stellar. So why aren\u2019t you getting any interviews?  The main reason could be your subpar resume. A professionally written resume can open doors for you that might lead to a great job. It\u2019s also good to keep in mind you might even need several versions of your resume, depending on the type of job interview you have. These advanced nuances are things with which a professional resume writer can assist.  You\u2019re Shy  To you, a resume is a necessary evil. It\u2019s basically a one-page depiction of all your previous accomplishments and accolades, and frankly, you\u2019re not the bragging type.  You might need an expert to help you through the writing process if you have a hard time talking about yourself, much less writing it all down on paper. There\u2019s no shame in getting help with this because writing about yourself is one of the toughest assignments, and you\u2019re often your own worst critic.  A professional resume writer will know how to spotlight your most worthy accomplishments because he\u2019s looking at them with fresh, unbiased eyes. Let him turn your resume into a top class and standard resume. Writing Isn't Your Forte  Not everyone is a born writer. You may be a pro when it comes coding, but that doesn't mean you know how to advertise your expertise in a way that will entice prospective employers. Focus on sharpening your marketable job skills. Let a professional writer figure out the best way to convey your talents on paper.  You Don't Know What to Include  Writing a professional resume can be a stressful process. How far back should your employment history go? What will recruiters care most about? Do you have to mention that job you hated, or can you remove it altogether from your work history? If you don't know where to start, consider getting some help from a pro. It's the resume writer's job to know what recruiters are looking for and how to best highlight that information.  Your Resume is Getting Lost in The Black Hole  Do you apply to job after job and never hear back? If so, then your resume may be falling into the infamous job-search black hole.  Most job applications must pass through a software program known as an applicant tracking system (ATS) before they make their way to the hiring manager. If your resume isn't formatted properly or optimized with the right key terms, there's a good chance it never got past these initial screens.  A professional resume writer can help your application avoid the resume black hole and make it through these initial reviews to the top of the hiring manager's pile.  Your Situation is Unique  Perhaps you're interested in changing careers and are unsure how to show off your transferable skills for a new industry. Or maybe you find yourself with some substantial employments gaps or a string of short-term or unrelated gigs that are dominating your resume. While you can't change the past, a professional resume writer can help smooth out a bumpy work history by calling attention to your strengths and downplaying any weaknesses in your career story.  Hiring a professional resume writer might not be an option for everyone. But if you're applying to the right opportunities and still struggling to land interviews, it may be time to seek out an expert's opinion. Investing in a professional resume may give you just the edge you need to shorten your job search and land the right job, sooner.  Benefits of Using a Professional Resume Writer  The main benefits of hiring a resume writer are saving time, saving frustration and hassle, removing the guesswork from the writing process, and likely completing the document faster and better, so you can get more interviews in less time.   However, it\u2019s possible to write a stand-out resume on your own. There\u2019s enough information available on the web for you to learn it, if you\u2019re willing to dedicate the time.

They just copied exactly the same lines and re-sent it to me. I did make changes at least 3 times, as was not happy about the outcome. Finally, I had no choice but to accept it. When I did not reply for few weeks they sent me a email saying. My request is complete and closed. ",
