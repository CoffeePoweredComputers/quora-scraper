            "answer_text": "Good question! And the truth is that clever, unprecedented originality is very rare these days. Mostly due to the idea that money talks, I would imagine. These big box office companies and television companies want to make money and they don\u2019t want to to risk losing money. So instead of trying something new and innovative, they rehash, repeat, or replicate because \u201clast time\u201d it was a hit. What they don\u2019t realize is that the reason \u201cexample\u201d was a hit is because at that time it seemed new and different. One of my guilty pleasures used to be watching Big Brother, but even that seems to have become stale and overdone this year. Indeed, someone needs to find new blood wherever it is hiding and bring it forward because all this bland repetition is really old. ",

            "answer_text": "Not to point only to one culprit, but it is the majority of the problem: Walt Disney Studios. Now, this corporation pretty much has a monopoly on all animation and other forms of entertainment media in television and merchandise. As they are in control, most of the content being made recently is a rehash, as you mentioned. Think of any example in recent times in entertainment media, and see if Disney produced it or not. I\u2019m betting on that they did. It\u2019s sad in an ironic way, though. Disney was known for retelling classic stories in a fresh, vibrant way, but they, like all big things, have fallen into greed and lost what made them distinctly special in the first place. ",
