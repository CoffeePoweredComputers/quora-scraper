            "answer_text": "There's not really a step by step method, but I can add a few things. For the record I only have a BA in history, but I've presented at an academic conference and and just submitted to a second, and both papers were history and political science blends.  The first thing is simply to read widely. That helps you identify patterns, recognize similarities, and build a generally good picture of whatever time period you work in. I specialize in ancient and medieval, and I read widely on those areas. You can't know everything, for example I'd never suggest I'm competent to write on an academic level about Chinese history, but I can get a basic understanding and read other's work if I need a reference. Sometimes having a basic idea of what happened in China circa 900 CE is helpful to understanding what happened in Central Asia in 900 CE.  The second is to read skeptically. Historians have biases, older works may be out of date, and some very intelligent scholars have weirdly unreliable pet theories. Recently I've been working in medieval Central Asia, so I picked up a book from a well known scholar of the area. He has some....very novel....ideas about Indo-European linguistics. Reading widely and critically will help you separate the good from the bad, which is important for your own research. It an be easy to get mislead, even for professionals, if it's too far from what you know. On that note I'd also say book reviews, academic ones, are very helpful in separating good scholarship from fringe theories.  My last bit is to remember to check other fields. For me, anthropological and archaeological papers can be hugely helpful to understanding a given time or society. Try to avoid thinking of history as a narrow focus, and more as a spectrum with the other two. Particularly before the modern era it won't hurt to have read some basic archaeology papers.  I think the actual process of research is very different for individuals. I've known people who kept copious notes, and others who use relatively little notes but probably read more than necessary. It's really about whatever path works best for your brain to access and make sense of the information. The end result is the most important, though you need to make sure to use reliable sources and limit your potential for bias.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well, firstly we read a lot of history... because professional historians are not normally lone wolves, they take part in larger conversations. As we engage with these conversations, we identify seeming inconsistencies, blank spots, etc. Robert Darnton, actually has a really nice discussion of this in his classic The Great Cat Massacre. Darnton suggests finding events or examples or narratives or actions that appear nonsensical, and then try and make sense of them. In his exemplary case, it is a joke about killing cats, which just isn't funny... so by finding the humor in the joke, he learns something about how people in an earlier time period thought. After finding a potential topic, we identify potential primary and secondary sources, we decide how to frame the topic in terms of geography, chronological scope, and the people or organizations which we intend to study. At this point we should have a preliminary argument. Typically then we research the topic for 6 months to 2 years, pretty intensively... ideally this will include new  archival research. Then we begin the process of making sense of the primary materials, change or refine our argument based on what we've learned, and perhaps present a paper or two at conference and in study circles with other scholars... we use the feedback to further organize and refine the material, and if necessary, conduct a bit more primary research (if a hole becomes apparent).  Then we write and write and present facets of the work at conferences until we have a manuscript. To support all of this work, we regularly apply for grants and fellowships... A typical project will take 4 - 10 years from start to finish. ",
