            "answer_text": "You can buy any ink you like - most inks are well behaved except inks like Noodler\u2019s Bay State Blue (Stains almost anything and does not mix well with other inks) or shimmer inks from Diamine or J Herbin etc which have shimmer particles that tend to clog the feed over a period of time or Iron Gall Inks (which have become a lot better in recent times). Montblanc and Visconti inks are extremely color limited. Please consider Iroshizuku, Diamine, J Herbin, Noodler\u2019s and other brands for a wide variety of inks. PS : Do consider Montblanc\u2019s warranty condition which forces one to use their inks. ",

            "answer_text": "Why is the bottle important? Surely the quality and colour range of the ink  as well as the price is more important? Look at Diamine inks - try them out - they are about $5 for 80ml (at least in the UK) and they are some of the best inks available in the world unless a fancy bottle is more important to you. Diamine Inks - Fountain pen inks  They have 100 standard colours and they don't clog pens in my experience. The biggest difference is that you are not paying a price premium for a big brand name and a fancy bottle when it's the ink that's really the important element. In my humble opinion at least.   i sell these inks as a sideline to my pen making business and have never had a complaint but I have no other commercial link to Diamine Inks other than Ive found them to be top quality and I use them personally every day ",
