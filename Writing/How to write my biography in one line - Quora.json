            "answer_text": "Focus, focus, focus. You won\u2019t be able to fit your whole life\u2019s story in one line and have that line hold any meaning beyond the fact that you were born, you lived, and will someday die. So decide what you NEED to convey in your biography. The needs will vary depending on context. You say in the comment that people often ask what you\u2019re up to. They don\u2019t want a biography in most cases. Again, context matters. Are they a coworker? Then make your line work-related. \u201cIt seems like I\u2019m spending all my time answering phone calls. How are things going with you?\u201d A friend? Then make it personal. \u201cI haven\u2019t been sleeping well. I keep having nightmares about my house falling off of a cliff while I\u2019m in it.\u201d Now, if it\u2019s in context to a biography, say, on Quora, you can focus on what you want to be known for. I\u2019m a writer and so I prefer my single line to mention my work and pseudonyms so that people can look me up if they want to. When I write a single-line bio to go with a story that I\u2019ve written for publication, I try to give the reader a sense of who I am as a person and a writer. That usually involves where I\u2019m from and the fact that I have a small farm and weird hobbies, though sometimes I\u2019ll just mention my other work instead so that readers can look up my other writing. If I\u2019m presenting something on gardening at a panel, my bio will consist of my education and experience in gardening. If I\u2019m going to write about physics principles, my bio will focus on my math and physics education and activities. Usually, if you put some time and thought into it, you can get a lot of information into very few words. When you have only one line, it\u2019s often more useful to transmit a small amount of information very well than to try to summarize a bunch of information that doesn\u2019t connect and leaves people feeling confused. On Facebook there\u2019s often something in a window that says \u2018what are you up to?\u2019 or whatever. Again, it\u2019s not asking for a biography. Your friends on FB will just want to know what\u2019s on your mind, or what you\u2019ve done that day or the day before, or plans you\u2019re making for the weekend or whatever. It\u2019s very informal. I hope this helps! ",
