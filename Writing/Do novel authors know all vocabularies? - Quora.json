            "answer_text": "No, absolutely not. You should, of course, have a solid working knowledge of language\u2014that doesn\u2019t just mean vocabulary, but grammar, spelling, etc. Think of it this way: would you hire someone to be a programmer if they didn\u2019t know programming language, couldn\u2019t type, and had no logic skills? NO. Writers have a toolbox. That toolbox is full of words, grammar, and spelling. Having said that, you don\u2019t have to know every word in existence. I\u2019m 57 years old and I still run across words I\u2019ve never seen before. The trick is this: look up their meaning, and learn how that word is used in a sentence. Then you\u2019ve added it to your \u201ctoolbox.\u201d You may or may not ever need it, but it\u2019s good to have it. I hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Usually not. In fact, most authors of fiction have weak vocabularies and not very much knowledge in the disciplines. In fact, it is unfortunate that people are guided to read novels to acquire an English Vocabulary, because novels rely upon modifiers such as Adjectives and Adverbs, both of which serve very little use in daily conversation. People who read more nonfiction develop a much more complete vocabulary. If you want a way of measuring an author\u2019s vocabulary, you can get an idea by the vocabulary of the book reviewers. For example, if you study book reviewers for \u201cHarry Potter\u201d novels by J. K. Rowling, you are going to see many reviews like; \u201cI love this book!\u201d; but that 4 letter vocabulary is about as advanced as it gets. ",
