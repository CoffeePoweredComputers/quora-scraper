If I want to learn something, knowing that I can sit down and read a number of books in a topic and each author is going to explain the same topic in their own words, makes the process a lot more approachable. If you don\u2019t want this to happen, the solution is just as easy. Read different topics and genres. If you were reading a romance novel, go with a crime, if you were reading science, go with a biography, and so on. That\u2019s the best advice I have found. It adds novelty to your life. I like the fact that everything I read has a really thin connection though ",
