            "answer_text": "Um\u2026 paraphrasing? Here\u2019s the thing: what is that \u2018everyday life\u2019 doing for the story? I mean, you can show a lot about a character by what they wear and how they go about their day. You can even evoke sympathy, like if the character is a little girl that tiptoes in her stockings because she\u2019s terrified of waking her father, passed out drunk on the couch. You can set it up as a contrast between the mundane and the magical for when supernatural story stuff goes. However, if you story is just life\u2026 well, I live that. Unless your life is more interesting than mine, I probably won\u2019t be reading it. ",
