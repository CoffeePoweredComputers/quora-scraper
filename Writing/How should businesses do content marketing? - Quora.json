            "answer_text": "Here is a simplified way to build your content marketing strategy. Each and every content piece comes under 4 quadrants and I will explain each of them with an example of gaming. 1- Perception - Focuses on the way your TG perceives the business and how you want it to be perceived as. Example: Gaming today is perceived as a way of connecting with friends, all thanks to the content strategy. 2- Education and awareness - It is very important for a business to educate its TG about the \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of the product/services. Example: From a 13 year old to 35 year old today knows what is/how to play a Battle Royale. This is the result of a strong content marketing campaign. 3- Contests and Campaigns - Contests and campaigns keeps your TG engaged with the business. Example: Consistent sweepstakes and in-game rewards as a result of participation in a certain contests hosted by the gaming business keeps the TG happy and loyal to that business 4- PR and Events - PR is what drives the the business\u2019s interaction on a macro level whereas events give you a chance to interact with your TG at a personal level making them feel wonderful and related to the business. Example: A webinar with top gamers talking about the game just like an online influencer meetup. People love to see and hear from people they consider their idols. No content in this world is out of the above 4 points. Basis the above points content can be further divided into sub-buckets and can be disseminated on different platforms. ",
