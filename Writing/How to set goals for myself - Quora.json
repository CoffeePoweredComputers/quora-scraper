            "answer_text": "The first mistake people make in working towards the goal, is setting the goal itself. Say you want to lose five pounds. Why? There are two basic parts to the goal. Let\u2019s break it down. Firstly, why do you want to lose weight. Secondly, why five pounds? The time to achieve the goal wasn\u2019t even mentioned. Whenever you set a goal, ask yourself, Who, What, When, Where, and Why. Who is the target of this goal? You. What is this goal? For you to lose weight. When do you want to accomplish this goal? Two weeks. Where are you going to accomplish this goal? You\u2019re residing home state/country. How are you going to lose 5 pounds? People say, walking. Running. Working out. Great, those are methods. But HOW are you going to achieve this? What are the mechanics behind the goal? Your calories have to be less than what you burn. That means you have to eat less than the energy you use. Calculate how many calories you need to cut in order to get to that goal. The ways of losing 5 pounds are so vast. Understand that. The options we have available to us, sometimes hold us back and slow us down. But at least get a daily number, a weekly number, and a monthly number of a caloric deficit you have to accomplish in order to help you visualize not only the goal itself, but also to visualize the magnitude of the goal, the level of effort focus and discipline needed to be undertaken, in order to create the micro fractures to our identities that strengthen over time, which we call goals. And lastly, why? Why are you choosing to lose 5 lbs? Is it because you want to start losing weight because you\u2019re overweight? Is it because you\u2019re insecure about how you look? Is it because you\u2019re unhealthy? Is it because someone made fun of you and you want to get back at them? If you can\u2019t come up with a good reason as to why you want to do something, dig deeper and find meaning. Sometimes meaning and purpose can\u2019t be described in words, which is completely fine, but you must understand why you want to do something, before you start making sacrifices to something that you may end up realizing seems stupid, senseless, or even irrelevant to your life. So there you have it. There you have a hopefully, stronger goal. Once you have your goal defined, approach your solutions, your options towards achieving your goal, the how of your goal, given the what of your goal, by keeping The Who, What, When, Where, Why questions in the back of your head when finding a solution. Add one more thing to ask yourself that we didn\u2019t talk about earlier; ask yourself, if. What do I mean by that? When are you going to do your action in order to do goal y? 3 times a week 9pm every Monday Wednesday and Friday after work\u2026. But if you have something Monday, what are you going to do (and if you don\u2019t like that word do, and it makes you feel nervous, simply change do to change)? If you have something Friday night, what are you going to change? (If you don\u2019t like either of those words, do or change, use then) If you are sick Wednesday, what then? Don\u2019t stress yourself on all the ifs, changes, and thens. You can\u2019t prepare for everything. However, you can prepare yourself for how you react. Do prepare yourself to react to change. Do prepare yourself to react to when something unforeseen and out of your control, or sometimes weakness, sets in. Prepare to deal with it. In other words, don\u2019t only be prepared to accomplish your \u201cHow\u201d portion of the goal, but also be prepared to quickly, and effectively deal with consequences. Consequences are what fail people. Adversity is what sends people running for the hills, never to come back. Working through your actions, and being prepared for dealing with pitfalls, consequences, setbacks, and adversity helps validate the quality of the goal you\u2019ve created for yourself. On the surface, achieving goals isn\u2019t one thing. Sometimes it\u2019s a race.  Sometimes it\u2019s a marathon.  Sometimes it\u2019s an obstacle course.  And every now and then, sometimes, it\u2019s even a walk in the park.  But at its core, it is always one thing,  and that is a fight against yourself. ",

            "answer_text": " Make it as simple as possible. Here\u2019s how I do it \u2014 I set ONE main goal for a single day. Why? To make it easy to focus, and make it impossible to ignore. What do I actually do? I ask myself the following question every morning when I wake up: What is the ONE thing I am committed to completing today? Let me explain. What are some examples of \u201cthe ONE thing\u201d? The one thing refers to a single task, a single activity, or a single project that I promise myself I will finish completely by the end of that day. It can be: Writing. An outline for an article I'm preparing, a plan of work for the upcoming week, a blog post, a letter to a friend I want to reach out to today.Completing tasks. Proofreading my work before publishing, cleaning up and organizing my inbox, preparing for a meeting or presentation, sending off an email with a completed task or project.Making progress on a project. Reading one chapter from a book and taking notes, doing preliminary research on a work topic at the library, listening to a 30-minute podcast on the commute, finishing homework due the next day.Personal development. Doing a short workout routine for 20 minutes, creating a strategy on how to build a new habit in the following month, scheduling 30 minutes in the evening to read my book.What are steps to identify your ONE thing? Write it down. Take a large sheet of paper and write the question in big bold letters with a thick marker.Hang it on your bedroom or bathroom wall. The point is that you make it easy to see every day.Ask the question out loud. You can do this as you are brushing your teeth, stepping into the shower, or getting dressed.Take a few moments to think about your answer. Ask yourself what\u2019s on your agenda for the day, then pick one thing that has top priority for you and give an answer out loud to yourself.Keep your answer top of mind as you go about your day. This will help you to avoid getting distracted by other things that might take you away from what\u2019s important to you.Start working on your one thing early. Your brain is more capable of tackling analytical and complex problem-solving tasks in the first few hours of the day.How does this practice improve your goal-setting habits? It simplifies your decision-making. Our brain functions so much better when it\u2019s not bogged down with evaluating priorities, considering the pros and cons, and going back and forth on small things that can be a huge waste of time. If you have to make a choice on something, you should do it as early in the day as possible.It taps into your willpower when it's at its peak. We all have only a finite amount of willpower that we can distribute on what we want to do each day. It\u2019s not negotiable. So, in order to maximize it, it\u2019s best to have a plan of attack early in the morning so you know exactly where to focus your energies, and why.It encourages strategic thinking. In order to accomplish something that is of value to you, you\u2019ll need to assess what needs to be completed on that particular day. Maybe you know there\u2019s a deadline at work for one project that you can\u2019t delay any longer, and asking the question will push to you think about what you need to do right now.It keeps you focused. Once you ask the question, you\u2019re much less likely to give a frivolous answer, and instead you\u2019ll push yourself to be honest about what\u2019s top priority for you. Maybe you didn\u2019t give it a lot of time or maybe you procrastinated, but that\u2019s over now. It\u2019s time for action.It boosts critical-thinking skills. By posing the question to yourself, you\u2019ll come up with a few scenarios of what the answer might be. Maybe it\u2019s starting a difficult task, or tackling a problem you haven\u2019t been able to solve for days. Either way, you\u2019ll need to assess your why and how before you give an answer, which should keep your brain alert and focused so it can operate optimally the rest of the day.",
