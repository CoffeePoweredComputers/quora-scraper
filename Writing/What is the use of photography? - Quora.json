            "answer_text": "Photography is the art, science and practice of creating images by recording light either by film or using an electronic sensor. The word photography comes from the Greek saying \u201cDrawing the Light\u201d. Photographs are perhaps the most mysterious of all objects that make up and thicken the environment we recognise. Photographs really are experiences captured, and the camera is the ideal arm of consciousness in its acquisitive mood. Through photographs, the world becomes a series of unrelated, free-standing particles; and history, past and present, a set of anecdotes.The camera makes reality atomic, manageable and opaque. It is a view of the world which denies interconnectedness, continuity, but which confers on each moment the character of a mystery. Unlike any other visual image, a photograph is not a rendering, an imitation or an interpretation of a subject, but actually a trace of it. No painting or drawing, however naturalist, belongs to its subject in the way that a photograph does. A photograph is not only an image (as a painting is an image), an interpretation of the real; it is also a trace, something directly stenciled off the real, like a footprint or a death mask. Now coming to some specific areas of photography. Landscape photography Landscape photography is a genre intended to show different spaces within the world. Most of the time it shows little or no human presence as it focus on the landscapes. The best landscape photography shows strongly defined landforms. These can be very simple but very effective with great detail. Landscape photography can be used as a powerful way of preserving natural landscapes. It can also be useful to capture the aesthetic value of a landscape.  Macro photography Macro photography is typically used in nature shots showing insects and plants. It represents great detail of the subject, as it is so close. It can portray the most harmless insects to look like monsters. Often the photo is larger than the actual life-size of the subject.  Advertising photoraphy Advertising is a form of communication for marketing and used to persuade and audience to buy their products. The aim of advertising photography is to make the audience feel the need to buy the product. Good adverts stand out from the rest, they are sometimes unusual, and makes you want to find out more.  Portrait photography Portrait photography simply captures the likeliness of a person from their face and expressions to the mood. There can be formal and informal portrait photography, as a posed photo to a captured photo in the moment.  Formal portrait  Informal Portrait  Photojournalism Photojournalism is a form of journalism but it creates the images in order to tell a story.

Ironically, several early photographic portraits art to a fault stiff and formal. With exposure times that might simply be 0.5 a second, subjects had to be in poses during which they may stay UN moving. because the chemistry of photography improved, exposure times shortened. the general public competency for pictures grew quickly. By the 1860 , portraits on cards bestowed once visiting somebody, and stereo graphic photos, that used 2 pictures to form associate degree illusion of three-dimensional area, were churned out by machines in massive batches. As with the chamber, one among st the most important initial uses of photography was to record travel and exotic scenery. Photographers lugged the cumbersome instrumentation used for wet solution prints through Egypt, India, and therefore the Yankee West. At the time, Europeans were progressively curious about exotic places (and were colonizing a number of them), whereas most Americans got their initial glimpses of a geographical region they'd ne'er see through photography. With a lot of folks living in cities and dealing in industrial settings, views of unspoiled nature were in demand. England's Francis Faith became renowned for his pictures of the center East within the centenary. when the tip of the war in 1865, photographers like Edward -bridge and Timothy O'Sullivan did a similar within the Yankee West, usually accentuation its desolate grandeur. photographic studies of motion later helped result in motion footage.) The West was still associate degree undiscovered frontier, and infrequently these photographers traveled as a part of mapping expeditions. the photographs they took of geysers in 1871 and 1872 and brought William H.

            "answer_text": "What an interesting question indeed and so I will challenge myself to give you a great answer. Each one of us who hold a camera in our hands at some time in our lives do qualify to call ourselves an Amateur Photographer and for each of us the purpose is slightly different. In my earlier days when our kids were little then we were snapping away at babies and cats and dogs and Children posing in front of Christmas trees or birthday cakes. Sometimes I would take the Camera with me in the 22 wheeler that I drove and would photograph stuff that I thought might interest the Kids. I had a lot of shots of Drilling Rigs and associated machinery. When I retired from work and decided that the Guys could carry on without me which was about the same time that I was Evicted from the Matrimonial home as apparently \u201cLove Had Died\u201d and so myself and my little Dog left town with a second hand Travel Home or Caravan to travel around Australia and start a new life somewhere else at aged 64 years old. I was in a really bad place in my head as I lost every piece of \u201cStuff\u201d that I had accumulated over my lifetime except for a few basic tools and my clothes and My Camera which was a Canon Rebel and the two rather basic Kit Lenses. I called into the local Camera shop on my way out of town to get some more SD cards and they had a 50 mm lens on the counter and so in some sort of Impulsive move I bought it. Travelling and learning the history of each little town along the way and photographing any thing that looked interesting and a lot of things that didn\u2019t matter as well sort of gave me the will to go on and put all the nasty stuff behind me. I started following some of the U-tube or podcasts by the likes of David duChemin and Ted Forbes and so I upgraded the Canon Rebel for a later model Canon Rebel which had a few more features like \u201cDust Delete\u201d and a swivel screen. I found myself focusing on Photography and buying and reading more stuff about composition and working with Natural Lighting and all. that I could find about Light and shadows and dynamic and static balance and so on. I knew that I was battling Depression and that the best therapy ever is to wake up early and take the Dog out and watch the Dawn break and the sun rise over the lake or ocean or even the desert landscape. Slowly I was able to turn my life around and now I have a purpose in my life and a reason for Living once again. Thanks in no small part to a Cavalier Dog and A Canon Rebel camera and a 50 mm lens and the opportunity to learn how to use the latter two. So what was your question once again \u2026. What is the Purpose of Photography and so My Answer is that It can be whatever you want it to be. Trust Me. ",

            "answer_text": "There was no original \u201cpurpose\u201d of photography. Photography was the result of persistent experiments since the 15th century when artists like Leonardo da Vinci experimented with the \u201ccamera obscura,\u201d literally a dark room. If a tiny opening was made on one wall, the image of what was outside that wall was reflected (upside down) on the opposite wall. But how to capture that image? Photography means \u201cwriting with light\u201d (graph + photo) and was based on two principles. The optical principle, known since at least the beginning of the 15th century, tells us that light waves carry images. The chemical principle, discovered by Johann Heinrich Schulze in 1727, states that certain chemicals -- especially silver halides -- will turn dark when exposed to light. Schulze\u2019s discover was widely discussed in scientific journals and published in popular books of amusing parlor tricks. The trick was to capture that image through the use of chemicals but then STOP the darkening that produced the image. The \u201cstop bath\u201d was the great discovery that moved photography forward. But there was no purpose to the invention. The first photographic images were still lifes and cityscapes. Movement was a major problem. Portraiture developed as faster exposure times made it possible to capture eyes open. Soon masses of camera works, countries around the world, experimented with photographic processes to see what photography COULD do. Like produce images of the moon (1840). Or portraits (1839, the year the daguerreotype process was demonstrated in Paris). Or to document events like war (1847 to 1850s). Photography was a discovery whose applications were determined over following decades. In fact, we are still finding ways that photography can do something new. ",

Photography is used in books to show as figures for better understanding of a topic It is used to keep a memory of a certain time like life events It is used for journalism like news and newspapers Space photography is done to know more about space and the planets and stars present in space It is used in sports to show the decisive moments to the sports fans Photography helps to take product pictures which are very much important for marketing and increase revenue of a business It is used to study about geography Some photography is used as decorations like photos on walls on a frame So there are limitless uses of photography.

            "answer_text": "The purpose of photography can vary from person to person. For me it is a way to capture a moment in time, or a way to share my views with others. If I am covering an event, then purpose of photography is to freeze time and share that moment with others. The smile on a child\u2019s face when they open a present, the look of love in a couples eyes when they say I do. On rare occasions, to record the anger felt by others resulting from some type of injustice. All of these situations can be viewed and remembered by those that were involved or described to those that were not, but memories fade and details can be lost or changed as they are shared down the line. Photography eliminates that by showing what took place at a specific time. if I am conducting a portrait session, then the purpose of photography is to allow others to see things how I see them through my eyes. I can take a picture of a person in flat or basic light, which would be how others see them as well, or I can move some lights, reposition myself or my subject to fit the way I see the final image. In those instances you are creating and not taking. So photography\u2019s purpose I don\u2019t think has just one answer. ",

The purpose of a photograph is to frame a moment and stop it. A video is a framed span of time, a 360 3D video is walking into a lucid dream of a part of historical time. I take all three. I take photos to concentrate on a frozen moment. I take videos to record my point of view of a memory. I take 360 3D videos to store those memories as vividly as possible so those moments are not lost forever. Time passes, we all eventually die, and memories fade. But through the genius of photography we can relive memories as they happened in vivid detail. We learn from history. Memories told by witnesses of events are subjective and imprecise. Imagine watching your parents\u2019 wedding wearing VR googles and seeing it in 3D with spatial sound. You would see body language of the guests, hear the words spoken, and learn things you could never learn by hearing oral accounts or looking at photographs. ",

Photography is how you stop the time, Videography is how you rewind the time.\u201d \u201cPhotography will ask you to freeze that one moment you desire, so you can see it again next time. But Videography is not just that, you created it so you can see the moment in full sequence.\u201d \u201cOnce you understand this basic, you will know how to take the best picture, or in my context, the best moment. Great moment cannot be replicate, so you have to understand how to do it in one shot\u201d. I only nod at that time. Thinking what that mean.
