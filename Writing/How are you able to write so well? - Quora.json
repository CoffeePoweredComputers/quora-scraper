            "answer_text": "Well, I think I\u2019ve got decent skills, but nothing that\u2019d be a New York Times Best-seller. I took time by simply writing my own stories. When I was in 4th grade, I began taking an interest in reading and writing stories. I would read books and I\u2019d study how the quotations worked in the sentences. To be honest, that\u2019s how I learned how to place quotes in sentences. I would scrutinize each sentence, write it down, then I\u2019d replace some of the words in it with my own. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget I had the basic required English classes as well. My advice is to just read books to enrich your grammatical and vocabulary skills. If you\u2019ve got time to spare, you can always take notes on a novel you\u2019re reading. Examine the sentence structure and punctuation. Once you start writing on your own, you\u2019ll begin to get better. Practice makes perfect. ",

            "answer_text": "Practice! Reading! Research! Trial and error! One of the best things I can ever recommend anyone who wants to get better at writing is to RE-WRITE YOUR WORK. As someone who learned and is still learning, rewriting can do wonders for your draft. I don\u2019t know what the magic is, but when you write something down and rewrite it later, it gets a whole lot better. Another thing is: DON\u2019T STOP. I know it\u2019ll get discouraging. I know it\u2019ll look like gosh, if those fan fiction writers can do it better than me, why am I even doing this? And i can guarantee that the longer you keep at it, the lovelier your work will become. And be open to criticism! If someone says they don\u2019t particularly like your work, ask them why. If their answer is \u201cI dunno,\u201d ignore them and keep on moving. But if their answer is something useful, take it! ",
