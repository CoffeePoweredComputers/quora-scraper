            "answer_text": "Okay, picture this. It is a Saturday morning. The sun peeking through your curtains cascades onto your bed and you can feel the heat it emits. You slowly sit up in bed and gaze over at your spouse, content and asleep. From the room next door, you hear faint cries, so you tiptoe out of bed and into your baby\u2019s nursery. As soon as the child sees you, she smiles. You hold her close and walk back into the bedroom where you find that your spouse is barely awake and your seven year old son has made you all breakfast and is smiling wide. The toast is undercooked and the juice looks like it\u2019s had a sip or two out of it, but this makes you smile even more. Your spouse whispers how beautiful you look, then takes the baby to hold. This seems like it could be a good start to a day. Edit: This is a hypothetical situation that has not happened\u2026 yet. ",
