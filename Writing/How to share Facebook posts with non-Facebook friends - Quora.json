            "answer_text": "If you are not friends with them already and they are not in your \u201cnetwork\u201d you can\u2019t. Someone you know or that shares your post would have to be in their \u201cnetwork\u201d to see it. Even if they are your friend they are likely to not see it unless it gets it gets a lot of engagement of others. Facebook only shows your post to nearly %7 of your followers starting out with organic post. Often times these are the people closest to you that interact with you the most. This is often times why people decide to go with paid advertising where they can reach targeted people more easily. Hope this helps give you a better understanding. Let me know if you have any more questions or would like to discuss things further. ",
