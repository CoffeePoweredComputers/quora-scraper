            "answer_text": "The hell is created by God not with vengeance against sinners but due to kindness to reform the souls. God is always kind to reform the souls, which are His children since the souls are created by Him. The father will never have even a trace of vengeance towards his issues. Jesus always addressed God as father and He propagated this concept by saying that all your sins will be excused by God if you are reformed. Practical knowledge, the practical realization, which is the reformation, will cancel all your previous bad deeds or sins as told in Gita (Jnanaagnih\u2026.). Except this one way, there is no other way to cancel the sins and escape from all the present problems in the world and future torture in the hell. 1)   The hell exists in the space far above our earth, which can be seen only by the grace of God. The reason is that the souls embedded in the energetic bodies reaching hell for punishments and the divine administration staff including the entire hell is made of energy, which has frequency far above the reachable frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum. The concept of hell will give some control on the sin, which is very much advantageous to anybody. If the faith on the existence of the hell shades away, your future will be very serious and I assuredly tell all of you about this point. You may argue that I cannot take you into the space and show the existence of the hell to you. But, at the same time you cannot also take Me into this infinite space up to its boundary and show Me the non-existence of the hell. In such case, the hell may exist or may not exist. Both the options have equal probability. In such case, a wise person will select the probability of lesser risk, which is to believe the existence of hell. If you are careful in not doing the sins, based on your faith in the existence of hell, nothing is lost even if the hell is absent. If you take other option to disbelieve the existence of hell and go on doing the sins, you are lost if the hell exists. Therefore, the first option is always far better than the second one. You need not believe that much only whatever is seen by you. Inference is also an authority of the knowledge in which you believe in the existence of something, which is not seen by you. The miracles exhibited by the devotees in this world prove the existence of unimaginable areas. The Veda says that the past memory of the hell or previous birth is nipped off with the nails of God (Paraanchi Khaani...). This means that the memory in us is lost by the will of God only. The reason is that if the memory of the hell remains, the individual will just shiver with fear and will be unable to do anything or even to read the scripture. This is not desirable to God, who likes the soul to start a fresh life forgetting all the past and achieve not only the worldly goals but also spiritual goals. Similarly, if the memory of the previous births exists in the mind of the human being, such a human being will utterly confuse due to millions of family bonds that appear whenever it goes out of the house.  In such a confusion, the human being will become mad and the same situation of inactivity results. Hence, everything set-up by God has its own meaning and do not criticize God in hasty manner. A passenger suffering with heat in summer came under a huge Neem tree to rest for some time. He thought that God is foolish because the huge tree is having tiny fruits where as the tender pumpkin creeper is loaded with very big fruits. Thinking like this, he slept for some time. He awoke after some time and found the tiny fruits, which have fallen on him from the tree. Then he realized his mistake thinking that he was foolish where as God is very wise. If the huge tree has proportionally huge fruits, his head should have been broken by the fruits, which are fallen on him! Therefore, patience must be the first quality of the spiritual knowledge as said by Shankara (Shamadamaadi...). ",

            "answer_text": "That heaven and hell exist in another supreme physical or metaphysical place, is a matter of belief and faith in religious scriptures.Having said that, earth itself is heaven or hell depending on your attitude to life. Assuming of course that by heaven we mean a state of happiness and hell being the opposite. Without consciously realizing it we are dependent on so many things and people for our happiness. This includes family, friends, career, wealth, house, car, facilities (like electricity, A/C, fridge, TV etc) and the like. Dependency means having expectations from that which is depended upon. You want to watch your favourite soap on TV but there is no electricity and the generator too has run out of fuel! You think you have done wonders at your work place but your boss is not impressed! A less qualified or competent colleague moves above you in corporate ladder! You are madly in love with someone but that someone has eyes only for your friend! Your Windows Laptop hangs! We could go on like this, taking examples from daily life.  Expectations form the biggest source of disappointment in life since they are not always fulfilled; then, life is hell on earth. Heaven and hell both exist on this earth; it all depends on how you manage your dependencies and expectations. Dependency is the toggle switch between Heaven and Hell, available at our command! Be independent to experience heaven on earth.Likewise, we need to accept a few facts of life:  Everybody\u2019s life will have ups and downs. It will not be happiness or ups always. Life is like an ECG graph; a straight line means you are dead!The future is unpredictable. There will be situations which are beyond your control.Most people are unable to accept these facts and the reality they are faced with; life is then hell. Accepting these facts will help one to successfully manage the \u2018lows\u2019 in life with equanimity. ",

            "answer_text": "Heaven and hell are not on Earth. Earth has become a testing ground for deciding who should go to Hell and Heaven. What is \u2018Testing\u2019 to God is \u2018Temptation\u2019 to the devil and mankind. God wants us to be \u2018Tested\u2019. Those that pass the test will be sent to heaven and those who fail will go to hell. It is for this reason that God has not destroyed the devil - because he fits in with God\u2019s plan for mankind. Let us study this further: Satan who is a fallen angel i.e. devil, has been thrown out of the presence of God, down to Earth. He is the ruler of this world and prince of the air i.e. space above Earth - Ephesians 2:2). From the Book of Job we find that Satan has access to heaven and the throne of God. He has been given control over the elements to inflict suffering (Job Chapters 1-2). We find that God is so proud of us, that He invites the devil to TEST us (Job:1:8). What is TESTING to God is TEMPTATION to the devil and mankind. Thus God uses the devil to fulfill His desire to TEST mankind - Job 1:6 One day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them. 7 The Lord said to Satan, \u201cWhere have you come from?\u201d Satan answered the Lord, \u201cFrom roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.\u201d 8 Then the Lord said to Satan, \u201cHave you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil (GOD IS SO PROUD OF JOB - THAT HE IS INVITING THE DEVIL TO TEST HIM).\u201d 12 The Lord said to Satan, \u201cVery well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger (GOD IS GIVING SATAN PERMISSION TO TEST JOB AND SETTING THE LIMIT).\u201d ",
