            "answer_text": "read this experience : As a writer, I\u2019m naturally curious about the publishing industry. Since we published that first book, I\u2019ve talked with three other publishers and dozens of authors. I\u2019ve learned a lot about publishing a book, including a few dirty little secrets. #1 Publishers Look for Audiences not Authors When publishers look for new authors, the number one thing they\u2019re looking for is somebody with an audience. Publishers don\u2019t dump a lot of money into marketing a book unless it\u2019s already selling. Whether or not the book sells is dependent upon the author\u2019s ability to sell it. If you want to get published but don\u2019t have an audience, the best thing you can do is start blogging. It\u2019ll build your audience and validate whether or not you\u2019re a good writer. #2 Big Names Use Ghost Writers I used to struggle with the fact that most big-time authors don\u2019t write their own books. It seems sleazy, but it\u2019s not. Here\u2019s why: People with big audiences don\u2019t have a lot of time. One way to save time is to outsource the creation of your book. It\u2019s not like Steve Jobs assembled iPhones, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that it was his product.Big-time authors aren\u2019t necessarily good writers. They have influential ideas and can communicate those ideas as speakers, but they struggle to put those ideas in writing.Oftentimes, a ghost writer can write and communicate those ideas better than the author, which results in a higher-quality book. #3 Know How to Sell It Before You Write It Just like with any product, you need to know how to sell it before you create it. Thomas Edison: \u201cI never perfected an invention that I did not think about in terms of the service it might give others\u2026 I find out what the world needs, then I proceed to invent.\u201d Yet, most authors write about what they think is interesting and hope that other people find it interesting. Before you write a single word, figure out: Who you\u2019re going to sell it to.Who the end user is (sometimes the buyer and reader are different).What price point you\u2019re going to set it at.How you\u2019re going to distribute it.What you\u2019re going to do to promote it.The answers to these questions will help you write a book that people want to read. If it\u2019s not marketable, it won\u2019t sell. And if it doesn\u2019t sell, what\u2019s the point? #4 Amazon Best Seller Status is a Crock You ever notice how many people claim to be best-selling authors? Like, pretty much everyone who\u2019s written a book, right? Doesn\u2019t that seem fishy? You only need to sell about 300 books to become an Amazon Best-Seller. If all of those sales come on the same day, you\u2019ll be bumped to the top of your sub-sub-sub-sub-category. In turn, your book is a best-seller for a few hours. Since people figured this out, they pre-sell their book on their site months before it\u2019s launched. Then on launch day, they manually submit those orders to Amazon so it appears as though lots of people are buying it. Not all Amazon Best Sellers do this, but many of them do. When someone claims to be a best selling author, ask them how long they were at the top of the list. #5 Traditional Publishing is Dead A few weeks ago I pitched a book idea to Mark Victor Hansen, who has sold over 500 million books, and he replied with, \u201cPublishing is dead.\u201d For the first time in history, publishers need authors more than authors need publishers. That doesn\u2019t mean publishers accept any dead-beat book off the street. It just means that if you\u2019re a good writer, you have a better chance selling it yourself. Instead of taking 10% royalties from the traditional publishing route, self-publish your book through a service like CreateSpace and pay someone to put your book on Kindle and iBooks. #6 70% of Books Don\u2019t Make a Profit According to Jenkins Group, a premier publishing firm, 70% of books don\u2019t make a profit. When people joke about the cover designer making more than the author, it\u2019s often the case. There are lots of upfront costs with creating a book. Some of ours where: Promotional copies. We printed and shipped 30, 100-page promotional copies to get blurbs.First running of print books. We bought 250 copies for our initial running.Shipping and materials. We fulfilled the first couple hundred orders ourselves. We didn\u2019t get paid, however, until months later because the money had to run through the publisher.Traveling expenses. We were invited to Chicago to give a break-out session at the CEO National Conference and we paid our way.All told, we spent over $8 grand on our book. And, yes, we did make it into that 30%. #7 Nobody Gets Rich as an Author If a book sells 10,000 copies, it\u2019s considered successful. The average royalty through a traditional publisher is 10%. So even if you sell 10,000 copies of $10 book, you\u2019re only walking away with $10 grand. If it\u2019s not profitable, why do so many people write books? Because being an author opens the door for other opportunities like speaking, training programs, and consulting. Plus, it makes your parents proud. Now is the Time If you\u2019re an aspiring author, I want to encourage you to move forward with writing your book despite some of these stats. Working on that book with Nick was one of the most fulfilling projects I\u2019ve ever been a part of. Start with a blog. Then write a book for your audience. Sell the book on your blog. If it\u2019s good, you\u2019ll find other ways to sell it. 7 Things I Learned from Publishing a Book - How To Make Money Online ",

            "answer_text": "Good way to make money as in \u201cmake a living\u201d? And writing just one book? Not, unless you hit the bestseller jackpot and even then you probably won\u2019t get rich unless you write an ultra-bestseller and sell the film rights etc. All (but a very few, very lucky) writers I know who are able make a living writing, do so by a mix of different things: They write their books as well as articles or they write for other media, they work as journalists or have gone over to the dark side and work in advertising (like me), they do readings, they teach writing courses, they provide editing/proofreading or they rely on the kindness of not-so-strangers like their spouses for support. My story: I have written six book so far, five are published with a respectable amount of success in my market. And I am happy to report that just this month I finally reached the break even point, meaning I have made the money back I have invested in research, marketing etc. over the years. Still, my books are extremely valuable to me - as acquisition tools. I work as a freelance copywriter and whenever I meet a new customer I bring a copy of one of my novels along - as a gift, as a conversation piece and to show that I am creative and able to successfully finish even long-term projects. On top of that: Who doesn\u2019t love a good mystery novel if it is free and signed by the author? This is to say: Writing a book may pay off in other and sometimes surprising ways than just in advances and royalties. If nothing else, it may give a you a very satisfying sense of accomplishment. And that\u2019s worth something. ",

This is not usually because of poor quality writing, but because of the other factors that contribute to success i.e. researching the market, packaging the offering and then marketing the book effectively. For those who are determined and committed, all of the necessary skills can be learned (see here for some useful tips). Unless you are extremely lucky, don\u2019t expect to write a single book and start raking in the cash. In today\u2019s climate, it takes a concerted effort, producing a series of books in a popular genre to gain traction. So - all in all - yes, it can be done by almost anyone, however, most people do not take the necessary time to hone their skills, or they cannot seem to summon up the necessary determination and persistence to make it a success.
