            "answer_text": "I comment on Franklin Veaoux's and Mercedes Lackey\u2019s answers here quite often. Mostly to say things like yeah! And truth! And I really love your books because\u2026.. The last letter I physically wrote to an author was addressed to Madeliene L\u2019Engle. She absolutely transformed my childhood with \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d arguably her most famous book. I was given this book over Christmas when I was eight by my third grade teacher, Mrs. Davich. She was an amazing teacher. I will never know if she did this for every kid in her class that year or if she just did this for a select few. Probably it was all of us but you know at the time it did not matter and still does not. I read it. I read it again. I curled up to read it again and finally many years later when I knew L\u2019Engle was in failing health I gathered up the courage to write her a letter and tell her in writing how much all of her books meant to me. I wanted her to know that her stories were amazing, that her characters live on in me, that sometimes I feel like Meg Murry and sometimes like Charles Wallace and most days I am more like Vicki in \u201cMeet the Austin\u2019s\u201d than is good. I wrote that I thought \u201cA Live Coal in the Sea\u201d was both tragic and uplifting, that \u201cA Severed Wasp\u201d makes me cry every time I read it. of course what I did not know at the time was that she had lost her eyesight and I doubt if she ever was read my letter. I am sure she had so much correspondence at the end of her life that a mere fan letter would not make the cut. But I wrote to express my appreciation for her mind and ideas and sensitivity to a harsh and unjust world that so often abuses us in whims of fate and fury. I wrote it and I am glad I did. Her words had and have still so much impact on me that it doesn\u2019t matter to me that she never read it or heard it. All that matters is that I wrote it. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever written to an author? If so, what was the reason? About 28 years ago, I wrote the author of Clear the Bridge, Rear Admiral (ret.) Richard H. O\u2019Kane. I don\u2019t remember what all I said in the letter, but I complimented his exciting writing style, his war record, and his honorable person. By the time I wrote the letter, I had probably read the book at least eight times. He answered my letter, in part thanking me for \u201cthe award of your letter\u201d. He had commanded the US submarine Tang during World War II, which sank enemy ships at almost twice the rate of any other US submarine, for a credited total of 33, the most of any US submarine in the war. One of his salvos of six torpedoes sank four ships, possibly unheard of in any other navy. On Tang\u2019s second patrol, 22 US airmen were rescued off Truk, more than any other single submarine rescue in the war. On Tang\u2019s fifth and final patrol, it\u2019s last torpedo erroneously circled back and sank the submarine, with only nine of its 87 crew, including himself, surviving the sinking. O\u2019Kane barely survived his imprisonment in the Japanese Ofuna and Omori POW camps. After the war, among other notable service, he commanded several submarine tenders, taught at the Submarine School, and commanded the Submarine School. The Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS O'Kane (DDG-77) was named in his honor. It\u2019s odd that I came across this question today, for just yesterday, I finished reading the book for the estimated eighteenth time. O\u2019Kane passed away less than three years after I wrote him. I\u2019ve commemorated his submarine in the following music video:  Richard O'Kane - Wikipedia ",

It was back in the 90s and i wrote a letter to John Barth, a picture of a copy of which i will include here. The reasons for writing the letter are stated in the letter itself.  About 4 months later, i received a personal response from Mr. Barth, pictured here.  I still haven\u2019t figured out what the last word of the body of his note is, after the plus-sign. \u201cDear Mr. Benedetti / Nicely said, nicely done; happily received + ________.\u201d If anybody could decipher that, it would be most appreciated.  And, finally, here is the front of the postcard he sent me, should anyone be curious. All in all, i found it to be a rewarding exchange. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure I have. I've done it several times, to ask questions about what they said and why. Once I asked an author why he detracted a solution he proposed, and he very cogently explained. In my experience, authors are very happy to talk about their book and ideas. One was even so grateful to me for carefully reading a book he felt was neglected, he asked me to review a presentation. Don't ever be afraid of authors, they write books or articles to invite questions and argument and response. It helps them. ",
