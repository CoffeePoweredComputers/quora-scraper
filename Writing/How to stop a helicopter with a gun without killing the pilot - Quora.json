            "answer_text": "It depends upon how big the helicopter is and how dramatic you want the downing of the helicopter to be.Some how from your question I am suspecting there are no passengers - just the pilot. So perhaps a small helicopter would be best for your story.Now how to bring it down?Does it have to come down immediately or can it fly on a for a little while? If the pilot needs to escape the gunman, then perhaps a well placed bullet in the fuel tank would be best and thereby enable the craft to continue flying for some time. The size of the hole and the amount of fuel at the time would determine how far he could travel.For something more dramatic, again a well placed bullet bullet could cause numerous scenarios. Here are a few. Hitting the tail rotor - which would quickly disintegrate - forcing the pilot to enter autorotation and if he is the hero he can then display his skills for a run on landing. Similarly the main rotor could be the target but that would probably be less plausible because if that broke up then even Tom Cruise would not be able to save the day. A hole puncturing the engine oil sump would quickly cause the engine to seize and again an autorotation would be possible - similar to a hole in the fuel tank but much quicker results.The gunman could shoot a large bird in front of the helicopter, which would then get ingested into the engine and a rapid downward descent would follow. But now I'm getting carried away.Hope your book becomes a best seller. ",

            "answer_text": "A rifle bullet, not pistol. Do not say pistol or you may get laughed at. A hit in the engine will produce an interesting failure if in the right spot. I am talking jet turbine, not piston engine, a serious helicopter. A hit in the high speed compressor section can cause lost of numerous turbine blades, some of which may come back out the side of the engine. An immediate autorotation will be called for. A hit in the engine oil cooler will bring down a helicopter in a less dramatic fashion as a power on landing is possible in the next few minuets. The pilot will get a low oil warning, then loss of engine oil pressure, then soon the engine seizes up and autorotation if he hasn\u2019t already landed. ",
