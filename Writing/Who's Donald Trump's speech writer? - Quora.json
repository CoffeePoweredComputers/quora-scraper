            "answer_text": "When he is not reading from a teleprompter, he\u2019s just ad-libbing, rambllng, reading from lists, no speech writer involved. When he reads from the two tele-prompters, Stephen Miller and White House aides prepare his remarks, which is why they tend to be a bit amateurish, derivative, disjointed and formulaic. I know one of the White House staffers, a college freshman, who worked on the Cuba policy speech. As the Washington Post notes, Teleprompter Trump\u2019s speeches are usually cobbled together by several staffers: In part, that is what happens whenever a speech is drafted by committee. It\u2019s plainly obvious from reading the transcript (of the UN speech) that different sections of the speech were written by different people with different world views.  So if a speech to the UN or Congress sounds vaguely like a divisive, bombastic campaign rally speech, that\u2019s because it is - both speeches were drafted by anonymous political staffers. He just slurs them out.  Based on his speech to Congress or to the UN, it is clear that Trump does not have a professional political speech writer like Peggy Noonan. Likewise, there is apparently little fact-checking involved in what he says. Indeed, his press agent claims that Trump wrote his speech to Congress himself. 5 fact checks from President Trump's joint address. For instance: \u201cNinety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.\u201d This is a Four-Pinocchio claim, based on a real number. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, relying on a monthly survey known as the Current Population Survey (CPS), shows that, as of January 2016, 94.4 million Americans 16 years and older were \u201cnot in the labor force\u201d - meaning they are retired, full time students, incapacitated, stay-at-home moms, etc. Not \u201cunemployed\u201d looking for a job. Trump then lead the audience in a standing ovation for the widow of the SEAL that he sent on the misbegotten raid in Yemen. Chutzpah ! Why should he pay someone to distort the truth when he\u2019s a master at it ? Why fact-check when your primary intention is to deceive the audience or threaten the world ?  ",

            "answer_text": "He does not have one. I present as evidence the full text of his speech given at this morning\u2019s event to launch Black History Month (February 1st, 2017) Well, the election, it came out really well. Next time we\u2019ll triple the number or quadruple it. We want to get it over 51, right? At least 51. Well this is Black History Month, so this is our little breakfast, our little get-together. Hi Lynn, how are you? Just a few notes. During this month, we honor the tremendous history of African-Americans throughout our country. Throughout the world, if you really think about it, right? And their story is one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work, and faith in America. I\u2019ve gotten a real glimpse\u2014during the campaign, I\u2019d go around with Ben to a lot of different places I wasn\u2019t so familiar with. They\u2019re incredible people. And I want to thank Ben Carson, who\u2019s gonna be heading up HUD. That\u2019s a big job. That\u2019s a job that\u2019s not only housing, but it\u2019s mind and spirit. Right, Ben? And you understand, nobody\u2019s gonna be better than Ben. Last month, we celebrated the life of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., whose incredible example is unique in American history. You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office. It turned out that that was fake news. Fake news. The statue is cherished, it\u2019s one of the favorite things in the\u2014and we have some good ones. We have Lincoln, and we have Jefferson, and we have Dr. Martin Luther King. But they said the statue, the bust of Martin Luther King, was taken out of the office. And it was never even touched. So I think it was a disgrace, but that\u2019s the way the press is. Very unfortunate. I am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things. Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I noticed. Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today. Big impact. I\u2019m proud to honor this heritage and will be honoring it more and more. The folks at the table in almost all cases have been great friends and supporters. Darrell\u2014I met Darrell when he was defending me on television. And the people that were on the other side of the argument didn\u2019t have a chance, right? And Paris has done an amazing job in a very hostile CNN community. He\u2019s all by himself. You\u2019ll have seven people, and Paris. And I\u2019ll take Paris over the seven. But I don\u2019t watch CNN, so I don\u2019t get to see you as much as I used to. I don\u2019t like watching fake news. But Fox has treated me very nice. Wherever Fox is, thank you. We\u2019re gonna need better schools and we need them soon. We need more jobs, we need better wages, a lot better wages. We\u2019re gonna work very hard on the inner city. Ben is gonna be doing that, big league. That\u2019s one of the big things that you\u2019re gonna be looking at. We need safer communities and we\u2019re going to do that with law enforcement. We\u2019re gonna make it safe. We\u2019re gonna make it much better than it is right now. Right now it\u2019s terrible, and I saw you talking about it the other night, Paris, on something else that was really\u2014you did a fantastic job the other night on a very unrelated show. I\u2019m ready to do my part, and I will say this: We\u2019re gonna work together. This is a great group, this is a group that\u2019s been so special to me. You really helped me a lot. If you remember I wasn\u2019t going to do well with the African-American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting\u2014and I won\u2019t go into details\u2014but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years. And now we\u2019re gonna take that to new levels. I want to thank my television star over here\u2014Omarosa\u2019s actually a very nice person, nobody knows that. I don\u2019t want to destroy her reputation but she\u2019s a very good person, and she\u2019s been helpful right from the beginning of the campaign, and I appreciate it. I really do. Very special. So I want to thank everybody for being here. (Source: Donald Trump's Black History Month Remarks) ",
