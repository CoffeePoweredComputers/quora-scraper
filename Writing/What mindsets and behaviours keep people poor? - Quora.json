            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written about wealth, on Quora, for two years. Had millions of views, thousands of upvotes and comments. Most are appreciative. A few trolls, who have no life. Occasional complainers. Who comment at great length, in minute detail. They explain how I don\u2019t understand. And why, what I wrote won\u2019t work. I reply and try to clarify, if I feel they\u2019re asking an honest question. I used to answer the other complainers also. Not anymore. They have endless rebuttals and I have far more fun things to do. In my profession, I counsel people everyday about how to succeed financially. Thankfully most listen and respond positively. Which works for them. And otherwise I\u2019d need to find a job at Walmart. A few explain to me all the reasons they can\u2019t do what I advise. Occasionally, one just never comes back. I guess, I didn\u2019t open my box of magic tricks and show them how they could keep doing what they\u2019re doing. Which isn\u2019t working, except now, they\u2019ll be rich. Yet, I went through a near bankruptcy in a business I owned. Learned to invest. Most times successfully. Sometimes by taking very costly seminars also known as dumb ass mistakes. Spent personally rewarding and financially retarded years pastoring a church. Then started my current business. During the first six months it looked like it was going to be a very exciting and costly experiment. Through it all I learned about building wealth. Built it myself. And helped many others navigate successfully the piranha infested waters. So when someone says, \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand.\u201d I usually respond, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d And I think, \u201cNo I don\u2019t understand making excuses. And, \u2018May the Force be with you.\u2019\u201d We can choose to play the victim or the victor. Only one leads to wealth. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to assume that you\u2019re referring to poor people in the developed world.  As I\u2019ve written about elsewhere in this forum my wife & I come from humble beginnings and we\u2019ve known a fair number of \u201cpoor\u201d people.  A small number are family, mostly related by marriage.  (As much as possible we keep them at \u201carm\u2019s length.\u201d)   The poor tend to \u201clive in the moment\u201d and not think long-term.  I\u2019m reminded of the saying, \u201cThe rich plan for the next three generations and the poor plan for Saturday night.\u201d   From their point-of-view nothing that goes wrong in their lives is ever their fault; they were in the grip of forces or circumstances, to include events that happened long before they were born, beyond their control.   They tend to act on impulse. They tend to be poor at weighing risk versus consequences and doing \u201ccost/benefit analysis.\u201d  Arguably anyone who smokes is deficient in those two skills. They tend to not understand the Principle of Causality; cause-and-effect relationships. Cause:  Don\u2019t apply yourself in school; have children out-of-wedlock; engage in substance-abuse; avoid work.  Effect: Remain poor. Cause: Spend your money on cigarettes, drugs, alcohol, fighting DUI/DWIs, lottery-tickets, \u201cbling,\u201d the latest smart-phone and flat-screen TV (even though there was nothing wrong with the phone & TV that you already had).  Effect: Don\u2019t save any money; remain poor.Life at the Bottom ",
