            "answer_text": "Choose poems or poetry wisely. It helps to try rhyming poetry that doesn\u2019t have any alliteration style tongue-twisters and the words flow gently or powerfully and there\u2019s room for keywords to be emphasised. If you dress appropriately for the venue as well as the audience that surely helps improve your confidence as would learning microphone skills. The way that you breathe may affect your phrasing style so study the text for those issues as well. : Consider if the poetry suits a male voice or a female voice or an adult or junior voice as some poetry and songs weren\u2019t written for one and all. Also, consider if a poem fits a well-known hymn tune or not\u2026 as singing the poetry may provide the audience with far better performances than the audience didn\u2019t expect. Audiences are more likely to applaud a singer than a poem reader\u2026 and song lyrics seem to be easier to remember as well. : If using plain text on a piece of A4 paper, consider switching the short poems from A4 portrait format printouts to A4 landscape to get the text to be printed in a larger font size instead. : Perhaps it\u2019s a good idea to print out copies for each member of the audience for their reference, too. Some may even consider creating laminated copies to share or to sell\u2026 : Check the acoustics if rehearsals on-site are possible prior to the event itself\u2026 : ",
