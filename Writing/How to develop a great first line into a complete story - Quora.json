Start off with a first line that contains a puzzle (from my novel Child of the Cloven Hoof); \u201cIt began the day she took her little brother out into the forest to get rid of him.\u201d The question is all but automatic: Why does she want to get rid of him? Within this first line lies the entire plot of the book. An exploration of she will answer the Why question while raising a further number of questions. Some will be answered immediately, while others linger, teasing the reader and ensuring they will continue to read. This creates that fundamental construct, flow. Also, you never find yourself at a loss as to where to go next. Some people might say, good grief, why get so technical? but a close examination of some good novels will reveal this method or one very like it. ",

As a way to lower your anxiety, there is a website devoted to really good awful writing of the sort that Bulwer-Lytton has been somewhat unfairly lumbered with.
