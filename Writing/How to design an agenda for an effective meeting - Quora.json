            "answer_text": "Ask some basic questions What are you trying to accomplish in the meeting? Goals and objectivesWhat needs to be discussed and/or understood?What decisions need to be made?Who are the decision makers?Are all of the people you need to supply information and make decisions going to be present?Some other important things once you have your agenda Start the meeting by reviewing the agenda and telling everyone why they are here.Take control from the start and keep control.Time box the meeting and make sure it\u2019s realistic for the agendaWhen the meeting starts, review what everyone is there to accomplishRemind everyone how long you have in the meeting to accomplish the meeting goalsKeep a parking lot for issue topics outside of meeting goals that require additional discussionAs people are discussing topics try to make sure they are staying in their discussion topic lane. For example, you want Tom to discuss how security requirements can be handled. If Tom strays, add his topic to the parking lot and ask him to move onAs time ticks away remind everyone in the room how much time we have left. As Tom tries to drone on and on tell everyone, \u201cWe have 15 minutes left and we still very much need to talk about subject x\u201d.Five minutes before the meeting ends wrap it up. This means reviewing what was decided, action items for anyone that took them. Review what any follow up meetings or discussions must includeAfter the meeting is over send out meeting notes that reiterate the step aboveSomething else that can be really important is to draw pictures if necessary. As complex topics are discussed it amazing how people can get different ideas about what everyone assumes is a shared understanding. Drawing a picture of a complex system or topic gives everyone a shared understanding and context. If you don\u2019t know how to draw, learn. It\u2019s not hard. My handwriting and drawing skills are not good, but I still do it anyway. A badly drawn picture is better than none.",

            "answer_text": "An agenda for a regularly scheduled meeting can help produce the results you seek by including some basic items. You can also use a agenda management software to set up and manage the agenda. Make sure to include the following items. 1. Solicit Feedback Ahead of Time Your bosses and colleagues will be more engaged if you ask for their input. Getting their buy-in will make it more likely that they will attend the meeting and champion its outcomes. 2. Follow Proper Meeting Agenda Etiquette After you\u2019ve drafted the agenda, be sure to run it by your supervisor, your supervisor\u2019s boss, and each person cited on the agenda. Never include a speaker on the agenda without first taking this precaution. Avoid listing workers who are out of town or attending other meetings. 3. Respect the Timeline If you have reserved the office conference room for an hour that is the longest your meeting should last. 4. Find an Organizing Principle for the Meeting Agenda Streamline your agenda so that the attendees will leave having a clear sense of the outcomes. You may want to prioritize, listing the most important projects that must be discussed first. 5. Consider the Number of People Who Should Report Five minutes of uninterrupted time is often long enough for an update on a particular meeting. It\u2019s the interruptions that add time. Use a Meeting Attendance Management Software to track attendance of those selected attendance. 6. Pay Attention to the Order of the Speakers In some companies, senior management speaks first. In other companies, junior associates do. When figuring out the speaker order, be sure it aligns with your company\u2019s culture. 7. Format Meeting Agendas in the Same Way A meeting agenda should be made on the organization\u2019s letterhead \u2014 or at a minimum, include the company logo. Place the title for the meeting and the date at the top of the agenda, along with the meeting\u2019s projected start and end time. 8. Include a List of Documents Needed for the Meeting Oftentimes in a meeting, the group will be asked to react to a report or proposal, and it is helpful to list these documents at the bottom of the agenda. The above mentioned points can be taken into consideration for effective meetings. Use meeting management software to raise efficiency and convenience. ",
