            "answer_text": " A picture would have sufficed but a story is always a better option. Meet Barney Stinson, a musician in a coffee shop who was in love with his girlfriend and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.  Meet Alcatraz Dey, who had been heartbroken once and again fell in love with a girl, and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.  One fine day, Barney\u2019s girlfriend told him that she cannot accompany him anymore as her father was supporting her and it would be unfair on him. So, Barney decided to let her be for a while because he loved her truly.  Alcatraz\u2019s girlfriend also told him that she wanted more out of life and that she did not want to be in any sort of relationship at all. So, Alcatraz decided to let her be for a while as he truly loved her.  Barney realised that his girlfriend\u2019s life was her own and should not be controlled by her father, so he decided to go back and tell her to be strong only to find her girlfriend kissing someone else. She had been cheating all along. Barney left broken hearted and made a tape for her.  Alcatraz also decided to talk to her girlfriend but found out that she was already posing for intimate pictures with a new guy everywhere. She had been cheating all along. He wrote a long letter to her and even called her many times.  Barney met her after a few days and asked her if she saw the tape. She and her boyfriend made fun of him and the song he sang for her and left. Barney was left devastated.  Alcatraz kept trying to call her but she wouldn\u2019t pick up the phone. Finally, one day she did and he cried and begged for her to come back. \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t pick the call because I know you\u2019d cry like this.\u201d She replied and kept the phone. Alcatraz was devastated.  Barney decided to stop being sad and be awesome instead. He suited up and became a real bro, he did everything he wanted to and enjoyed his life.  Alcatraz also decided to stop being sad and do things which he always wanted to. He became a bro and travelled and met new people.  Barney wrote a book called \u201cThe Bro Code.\u201d  Alcatraz wrote a book called \u201c The Devil Never Loves.\u201d  Barney loves to suit up and meet his favourite people.  So does Alcatraz.  Barney is really smooth with ladies.  Alcatraz at least, likes to think so.  They always have a plan and a guy for everything . Both Barney and Alcatraz follow the Bro code to the core and are the perfect wingmen. They love their moms, their brothers and enjoy a perfect drink with their friends.   However, the most common thing amongst them is that they are very emotional and value people around them. They would go to any extent to bring back people and never give up on them.   They might act all cool, but deep inside they are just kids trying to survive in this world who cannot hide their real emotions.  Hence proved : Alcatraz = 5% Of Barney Stinson. Come on, no one can beat the legen\u2026. Wait for it, for you\u2019re going to love this if you\u2019re a HIMYM fan\u2026.. Dary, legendary bro! ",

            "answer_text": "Earlier today I watched The Book of Mormon  It was obviously hilarious, and I laughed. I laughed a lot. But I also found myself sympathizing with characters and appreciating it for the story, which is strange, seeing as it\u2019s a comedy about the Mormon religion. The main reason for this sympathizing and appreciating mainly belongs to the main character, Kevin Price. For those of you who have never watched the play, Kevin, more commonly known as Elder Price, is a Mormon who is the \u201cshining star\u201d among his peers. He always did everything that was asked of him. He was good at everything. He studied, he worked. And, when it all comes down to it, he did it because he believed. He believed, all that time, that if he worked hard, and did everything asked of him, it would all pay off. He would get his greatest desire. But, when it does come down to it, and he gets sent on his mission trip, he is paired with someone who never worked as hard as him, to a place where nobody wants to go. And he feels cheated. And I empathize with that. My entire life I worked towards something, thinking it would all pay off. And what do I get? I get the things that nobody wants, and I get given the short end of the stick. Why? Because they expect me to be okay with it. Because I\u2019m always okay with it, right? No.  That\u2019s the fictional character I am. The one that rigorously followed something, thinking it would all pay off in the end, only to be given the short end of the sick, once again. ",
