            "answer_text": "Book God Emporor of Dune (Dune Chronicles #4) By Frank Herbert Goodreads: God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles, #4) Amazon: God Emperor of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 4): Frank Herbert: 9780441294671: Amazon.com: Books Metadata: It's the middle book between the first triology of the Dune Saga and the unfinished (by the original author, that is) second. I have a review of this book on Goodreads, but I'll paste it here for convenience. I've edited the Goodreads review to be more up to date with my thoughts for the occasion. Review This was a very interesting book indeed. The writing is classic Herbert, with stilted yet fun to read dialogue and sometimes weird turns of phrase. It recovers a lot of the mystery of the first book, especially in world building as Leto's new empire unfolds. Although some might dock it for being largely static and preach-y for the first half, that didn't bother me at all. In fact, Leto II was so interesting that I honestly could have read an entire book of him talking. The Stolen Journals are on my TBR list now... However, there were some Not Great aspects to this book. Firstly, after the midpoint we switch largely to other characters and they all act like hormonal teenagers (that's actually an insult to teenagers). Worse, no one seems to understand how long term plans work; except maybe Siona who has a random character change in the last parts of the book and decides to carry on the God Emperor's plan. Secondly, sometimes it really felt like Herbert went too far in making Leto overly circuitous in his speech. Thirdly, I think the mystery of the Golden Path and the enemies of humanity is really interesting and should have been played up more. [This is more just a criticism of all the Dune books including and following Children of Dune.] I really love this book, though, in spite of it's flaws. Leto II is probably the most interesting, conflicted, and alien character I've ever read about, and it really lends new depth to the story and meaning to the Golden Path. The exploration of what being a mental colony organism would be like, combined with presence, is truly amazing; what's more, Leto's understanding of politics and religion are fascinating and play out very well in the world of the book. Seeing an entirely new yet strangely familiar culture and planet is massively rewarding. Parts of this book have stayed with me much more than Dune or Dune Messiah did. What's more, even though I disagree with the other characters in the book and what they ultimately decided to do, it does make sense. I've seen and known and talked to people with similar overarching beliefs in the real world. Perhaps if Herbert had been less focused on the romantic plot he could have developed their philosophies more and it would've felt more satisfying. Overall, the first half of the book was an intriguing and captivating quasi-religious exploration of a society built for long term planning. The second half was a somewhat unsatisfying conclusion and devolved into the operatic once too many times. Edit: On further thought, Leto's almost Platonistic dialogues in the first half of the book, and the way they explore his political philosophy (as well as his more general philosophy) with such poetic sensibilities and often subtlety, really propel this book into whole new levels of profundity. And it's not simply Leto's preaching, either: the narrative itself both confirms and denies various parts of Leto's thought in a very satisfying interplay. Moreover Herbert's success in making an omniscient tyrant a sympathetic, even tragically heroic, character--while still keeping some moral ambiguity--is quite simply a literary tour de force. Also, upon reflection my initial reaction to the actions of the characters might not be justified--I still feel that it is, but I might be biased by the fact that I was siding with Leto so much without even really noticing that I was. All this considered, God Emperor actually finds its way to the top of my sci-fi list: IT IS MY FAVORITE SCIENCE FICTION BOOK EVER. I don\u2019t say that lightly either: I actually haven't had a \"favorite\" sci-fi book before because I was suspending judgement until I found something \"worth\" the title; a book so good I probably wouldn\u2019t have to change my favorite pick again. But this book satisfies that. One of the interesting things, too, is how GEoD really ties up and shows the final result and most extreme consideration of the themes of the previous books: predestination, prescience, charismatic leadership, religion. Conclusion I\u2019m a naturally pretentious person and somewhat of a showoff, so if I wasn\u2019t particularly interested in being truthful, I could say my favorite book is David Copperfield, The Count of Monte Cristo, Les Miserables, The Iliad, The Aenead, Crime And Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, Don Quixote, The Tale of Two Cities, or any of the other objectively great works of literature that I\u2019ve read\u2014but although I can see their merits might outweigh GEoD (although perhaps not by a very great margin for some of these) I cannot claim that I like them better. Or that they stuck with me more. Burn me at the stake if you want but I stand by this pick. Author As far as ability, consistent output, and enjoyment, I'd have to say Herbert. But Dostoyevsky is a close second. Don't even mention Tolstoy to me in the comments. I'll beat you to death with a feather. ",

            "answer_text": "THE BOOK OF NIGHT WOMEN by Marlon James. It explores in depth the everyday lives of black slaves, and genetics and mixed race and intra slavery hatred. The predatory behavior of the slave males toward the slave women, sanctioned and encouraged by the master\u2019s manager, is exposed. The slave women meet at night and the reason is fascinating. These women carry real scars such as a missing breast and plow rows in the skin along the back and belly and get up every day to work. The action remains mostly with house workers rather than the field ones. Those slaves come across as walking dead to me. The punishments are barbaric given by men who are savage. But one or two of those woman will rescue and hide a child from terror and earn an uneasy trust from the master overseers. Temporarily. Nothing remains the same from day to day. And the white men need comfort and safety from each other and their own women. It is a world upside down, scary and the horror is told in a hard honest way and without pathos. At my suggestion my book club will discuss in a few days and I am wide eyed with awe and respect and humility. ",

            "answer_text": "The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger One of my favorite books! The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of 16, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children\u2019s voices, adult voices, underground voices \u2014 but Holden\u2019s voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. ",

Here is patriarch Esteban, whose wild desires and political machinations are tempered only by his love for his ethereal wife, Clara, a woman touched by an otherworldly hand. Their daughter, Blanca, whose forbidden love for a man Esteban has deemed unworthy infuriates her father, yet will produce his greatest joy: his granddaughter Alba, a beautiful, ambitious girl who will lead the family and their country into a revolutionary future. The House of the Spirits is an enthralling saga that spans decades and lives, twining the personal and the political into an epic novel of love, magic, and fate. ",

The title of the story is Bear Town, which is the name of the town where the story takes place.  BearTown is a small secluded community in rural Sweden, with an entire economy and lifestyle that surrounds the amateur hockey organization.  Although it was written in Swedish, it was translated beautifully into English and earned a spot on the NYTimes bestsellers list. It has all of the aspects of the kinds of stories I really enjoy, sports, mystery, and coming of age, combined beautifully into an incredibly fast paced and enjoyable story. Seriously, I couldn't put the book down. ",
