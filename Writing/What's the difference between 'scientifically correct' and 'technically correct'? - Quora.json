            "answer_text": "Scientifically correct is used when an event or a situation is following the rules of conduct of a scientific discovery like the Laws of Motion. Technically correct is more of a Logical term. For an example take two people A and B running a lap race.A wins the race. Technically, \u2018A\u2019 could be called the faster of the two, but if upon taking the average deviation of the lap times reveals that \u2018B\u2019 has lesser deviation, he would be faster Scientifically[Or Mathematically].Technically, the Earth is round but Scientifically, it is spherical.Technically, a neutron has no charges but Scientifically, it\u2019s charges undo each other.Technically, we can speak but Scientifically we are just vibrating our throat muscles at a certain frequency.",
