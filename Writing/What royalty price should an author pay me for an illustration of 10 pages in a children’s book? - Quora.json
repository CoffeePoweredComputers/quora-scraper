            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a tough call coming to children\u2019s books. I know illustrators simply get hired to create an image for magazines. They don\u2019t get paid royalties they simply get paid a flat fee of hundreds or thousands of dollars for the image to go into the magazine. But for children\u2019s books it\u2019s not a simple illustration to join a story, for children\u2019s books the illustrations drive the success. Arguably the illustrations or more critical to the success of a children\u2019s book in the story itself. But if it is a small venture, you could end up putting a lot of work into 10 illustrations\u2026 Only to make pennies that year in royalties. In the end, you and Arthur need to come to an understanding of sorts. Maybe you split the royalties 50-50 and provide illustrations without any upfront money. If the story seems incredible to you and you were certain it will be a huge success, this might be the way to go. If it became huge that could pay more in the long run. But if you have read the story and it just seems OK, you might insist on being paid upfront with little or no royalties. ",

            "answer_text": "I would begin by asking the author how much they are making on royalties (if the book is being sold by a publisher), and then figure out your pricing from there. Given that illustrations are at least half of any good children\u2019s book, I would compare the royalty fee you are thinking of asking to the fee the author would collect. If the author isn\u2019t receiving royalty (i.e. they are their own publisher), I would ask them how much they plan to sell each book for, how many copies they plan to print, and what they expect the overhead to be. Then you can estimate how much profit they are expecting, and figure out an appropriate royalty for yourself. In terms of specfiic pricing, I would look at forums for artists like: r/DesignJobs ",
