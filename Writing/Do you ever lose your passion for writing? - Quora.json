            "answer_text": "From July of 2015 to September of 2016, I wrote a 300 page book (first draft was 106,000 words) and published 60 articles (so roughly 60,000 words.) I loved it. I loved the process of sitting down at a computer, with coffee in hand, writing those first words, and seeing those words progress into an article. I still love writing. I am passionate about writing. However, I\u2019ve stopped writing as much, and have the same fear you do. Rationally, I can explain this with justifications I\u2019ve created. There\u2019s only so much time in the day. I have a job that requires me to do other tasks. To be completely honest, as I\u2019m writing this, I\u2019ve realized my own potential block that has prevented me from writing. It almost sounds funny, coming from the guy who wrote almost 200,000 words in a year. With topics ranging from my own life experiences, human behavior, psychology, book reviews, and travel, the ideas seemed to pour out of me. I think the fear is this: who will care what I write about and what if my writing is a waste of time because it won\u2019t progress my career and brand? As I write these words, this fear sounds ridiculous. However, it\u2019s true. My book, which is endorsed by 2 NYT best-selling authors and has gotten decent press, has only sold about 1,500 copies in the first year. My email list, which I honestly never seriously took time to grow, is only at about 150 people, despite the 60+ articles I wrote. So, at some point, I know my thought process went something like this: What\u2019s the point? What\u2019s the point if not many people read my work? What\u2019s the point if my writing isn't progressing my career and brand? Whats the point in spending so much time and effort writing goddamn words on a computer? Here\u2019s the fucking point: I enjoy it. I write for myself, because writing allows me to understand my life. I write because I love the way I feel after I overcome writer\u2019s block, and express my ideas through words. I write because, even if it\u2019s just one person, it feels great to share my thoughts with the world, and see how people take it. I write for me\u2026because I enjoy it. As I\u2019m answering your question, I\u2019ve just gone through internal therapy to figure out why I\u2019ve stopped writing (lol.) This is precisely the reason why I write. What I love writing about most is my own life - how my experiences, coupled with the books I read and the lessons I learn, allow me to reflect, and make progressive changes to improve my life. This is what I personally love to write about. I have no idea what you love to write about. I know it\u2019s there, because you wouldn\u2019t have asked this question unless you love writing. Here\u2019s my advice, as Ive discovered in the last 5 minutes writing this: Just start writing. Sit down, with a cup o\u2019 joe, and start answering questions on Quora that call out to you. See where it leads. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve just done, and I feel fucking great! Thanks for asking your question. It helped me tremendously. I hope, through dragging you through the internal battle of my own mind, you are able to take something away. Here\u2019s to writing, because at the end of the day, it\u2019s for us - the writers - first and foremost. The pleasure it brings. Everything else is a cherry on top. ",

            "answer_text": "I did, actually. When I first started writing it's because i needed to. There was so much in my head that I have never put to paper. I was bursting at the seams trying to arrange my thoughts properly in my head. It seems odd that I didn't start sooner. Now, when I started writing it was just to release whatever thoughts had been building up. When I was through with that\u2026. Nothing. Nothing new came into my head. I was happier and more focused, now that my head was clear. But I was done. I had tried to keep going because I didn't want to feel like a quitter but I didn't want to go anymore. Not because I was scared of the outcome or insecure about my talent. I wrote for about a year. Not continuously, obviously. But there was always a couple days a week where I was typing on my tablet. It's not that I didn't enjoy writing. I just don't have a passion or need for it anymore. I'm sure once I get my head full again I'll write again. ",

I've felt hopeless but I realised that I write for myself first, I am always happy if I like my own words, everything else is just secondary. If I could write one thing that I feel I'm more passionate about is, writing. Cheers!!! All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but it always returns. My personal experience is when something really stressful happens in life it can consume my attention and make it extremely difficult to even think about writing. Maslowe\u2019s hierarchy of needs is true for me in this case-writing falls into the top tip of the triangle: self actualization. If I\u2019m worried about my job, safety for myself or loved ones, writing is far from my mind. Fortunately, stressful events in life usually get resolved and my passion for wrting returns with a vengeance. I\u2019d like to say it just goes dormant, hibernating until the storm has passed. But I\u2019d also like to say I wish I continued to write during those moments. The book \u201cHow to be a Famous Writer Before You\u2019re Dead\u201d by Ariel Gore talks around this. Writing is the all important need and bills and household chores are secondary. I wish I had that kind of dedication and focus and mental strength. I hope you keep writing. Even if writing is not your topmost passion, the act of writing contributes to intelligence and thoughtfulness. ",

I dare not term this a \u2018writer\u2019s block\u2019 since considering my credibility (or the lack of it) in generating outputs, I am hardly qualified to attach the term \u2018writer\u2019 to myself!
