            "answer_text": "I have been through this phase which you are facing right now . And I know how it feels when you see your friends getting admission in one of the best colleges and you are left with regrets and hopelessness. Everyday when you wake up in the morning your family and parents are there to taunt you and the condition gets even more severe when you have \u201csharma ji ka beta\u201d in your neighbourhood whose mom comes to your house with sweets or talks to your mother on a routine basis to make ur mother realize that her son is \u201cTHE SHRAVAN KUMAR\u201d and you are an asshole .Well I got carried away now let me come to the point .There is no one who is going to lift you in such situation its only you who has to overcome it .Yes you need moral support but who is going to give it. Your parents have lost faith in you and its genuine you cant blame them . So I tell you brother start loving yourself start fantasizing with your own thoughts and observe your surrounding. Its well said that people are going to leave you in your odd days and you are left all alone. The world is very cruel and you have to be more brutal to cope up with it. By this I don't mean you have to be inhuman or do cruel acts. See you have to fight from your bad days to earn good days in ur life. First of all stop comparing yourself to other and put yourself out of this league of competition . 1)Just make sure you are competing with yourself and improving your skills in any direction that you have opted or going to opt for. 2) Make a habit of reading novels but the real ones like inspirational ones of any sport stars . I read controversially yours by shoaib Akhtar and got highly motivated the way a frail child who could not even walk two steps overcomed all odds to become the fastest baller ever in the world. I don't say to pick the same there are many more 3)Try to do meditation in the morning or in any free time you get .It will give you inner peace and most important thing it will make you realize your strength if you cant do this then just do some basic exercises. 4)Work hard harder than ever . People are only going to love and respect you if either you are rich or very successful . And you cant be a rich or successful if you are lazy. Work hard in silence so that you can make people silent in future .The same people who press you today will come up to praise you that day. 5)Set a goal and prioritize ur studies and everything according to it and work according to a strategy . You can also follow strategy of those people who excelled in that field for e.g - If you are preparing for gate then you should be familiar about the strategy of toppers in that exam . Well I feel there is a lot to tell but no motivation is going to work till you self realize the things and prepare yourself to face the upcoming consequences readily and lively .Motivation is just like a catalyst that may only work if your reaction is exothermic otherwise its just a waste of time .Its just a bad phase of your life don't worry there are many more to come that's what makes life very unpredictable . ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR FUTURE ",

            "answer_text": "It's not motivation that you need right now. It's strength and stubbornness to do better because you can and the belief in you. It\u2019s because you want to and so will do it. Motivation is just a temporary fuel. It runs out and so we can\u2019t depend on that. What you can depend on, is yourself. You, need you right now. You, need to push yourself regardless of how you feel. You, need to keep going, because that is strength there. Strength is going on after something occurred, regardless if you feel it or not. It\u2019s about moving forward. And you also need stubbornness to keep going ahead. You don\u2019t need anything external, you just need you to keep going on regardless of what. Failures happen, but they\u2019re not permanent. Don\u2019t allow them to drag you down, you\u2019re making them live longer than they should and you can cause another failure. Life goes on and you should too. ",
