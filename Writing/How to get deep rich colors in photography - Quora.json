            "answer_text": "Q - How do you get deep rich colors in photography? A - For sunsets (and dawns) you can get deep rich colors best by not over exposing. I photograph a lot of sunsets and as I run photo contests for a coast side community, I see a lot of sunset photos by others. The number #2 problem is over exposure (#1 is horizons not level). If you have over exposed there is little that can be done. Do an experiment. Take a photo of a sunset normally. Now repeat (use manual mode) one stop down. And again, and again until you have underexposed what the camera thinks is the right exposure by maybe 5 stops. See what comes out best with your camera. Also adding more contrast can help. I became tired years ago of people asking me if I added Saturation in post-processing step. I never use Saturation in sunsets. It isn\u2019t needed and does not look natural. Have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "Longer exposure and raise iso to the desired setting. Timing and proper settings make perfection. Practice makes things better. The other part is using a camera that shoots RAW and you get more color after post processing in Lightroom, etc. which camera are you working with? ",
