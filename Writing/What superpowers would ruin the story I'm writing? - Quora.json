            "answer_text": "Design your characters so that their powers or skills don't ruin your story. Consider the Illiad. Achilles was a great warrior with power approximately equivalent to Luke Cage in modern media. However, he sulked and refused to fight and had one crucial physical vulnerability. I have a character who could kill anybody without equivalent powers and greater skill within sixty yards. However, despite thinking about it a lot she is reluctant to hurt people because of her upbringing which stressed some violent skills but also not hurting people just because they are mean to you. The sixty yard limitation means she could be taken out by a rifleman and the upbringing means she hesitates to actually harm people. Your character could have similar limitations. Finally, remember that one on one violence never solves problems worse than people or animals trying to attack you. Tremendous violence was necessary to stop the third Reich but it wasn't something a superhero of less than godlike power could have delivered by themselves. If you want to be bit realistic, your character, powered or not, will be working eith allies and getting and keeping them together will be part of the story. ",

What gets most people off is ordinary people coping with extraordinary circumstances, with no more than skills they have gained through their life. Figuring out what skills a person would Require to get out of a particular situation, is the authors job. Unless your readers are from around the age of ten, suddenly developing super powers that can instantly overcome any problem isn\u2019t a turn on. This is my opinion only. ",
