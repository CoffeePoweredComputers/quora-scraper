            "answer_text": "Well, if you're following the law, you should have a trail of behavior to justify said \"write-up\".   Let me be clear, I failed as an HR manager at the end because of a few characteristics about me (I don't really watch my mouth, politically), but I also had some amazing success as an HR manager in my career and was well-known for my diplomatic and thoroughness in documentation.  I lived by a rule that I beat into everybody's head and if you don't follow it, frankly, I think you'll fall on your face one day.  It's a tough lesson to learn, because it's labor-intensive:  If it isn't in writing, it never happened.  Document everything.  You will NEVER be able to submit your \"eye witness testimony\" later on.  It will be considered invalid.  Email yourself.  Print the email.  File it away.  Every one of those emails are legal documents and can and must be maintained for (I believe) 7 years (depending on the state).  When I say \"document everything\", I mean fucking deplete a small rain forest with all the printing you do. Buy a big file cabinet and keep your shit organized.  This really thorough habit made me \"win\" many, MANY cases in my career.   I also had a rule, if I was told that someone did something wrong and there was only one witness, without some serious evidence, it never happened.  Rank doesn't count as power in \"witness-ness\".  So, even if the goddamned CEO came in and said, \"Suzy Chapstick rubbed her tits in front of me.\"  Without a video, or photo, or multiple witnesses or Suzy's admission of guilt, you've got nothing to go on.\" Whoever this manager is, is roping you in to break about a dozen rules.  Your first step (LISTEN CAREFULLY) is to conduct a dispassionate investigation.  You are NEVER on anybody's side.  I don't care what you think went on.  If there were no other witnesses to this behavior, you need to start a process of investigation. (If there were witnesses to this behavior, then keep reading) You will question and take statements from your manager just like you would from a subordinate.  Your manager's \"authority\" does not extend to \"forcing\" you to write someone up.  That's your decision.  You conduct the investigation.  If there were 18 people involved, you question them using NON-leading questions. But be honest too.  Don't play fucking legal games.  \"Tim.  Look, rumors will abound, I cannot help that.  But, I obviously need to ask you some questions.  Last Wednesday, manager Dickhead informs me that there was a conversation between himself and supervisor Smartmouth.  Obviously, I wasn't there.  I cannot form an opinion.  But I was told that you may have been a witness to the conversation.  I need you to--as best as possible--tell me what you saw.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.\" So, if he saw it, his testimony counts.  If there were no witnesses and only manager Dickhead and supervisor Smartmouth, then you question those two.  \"Okay, Manager Dickhead.  I'm going to do what you want, but I have to keep it above bar.  Please tell me, as best as possible---in your own words---what happened.\"  Write everything down.  (typing is faster, BTW) Now on to supervisor Smartmouth.  \"Okay, so obviously I heard about your conversation with manager Dickhead last Wednesday.  I'm only involved in so far as taking statements.  I'm a neutral party.  As honestly and technically (no verbal flourish) as possible, tell me what went on.  I'm going to take notes.  So be mindful of your pace so I can keep up.\" ALWAYS have a witness with you, even if you're talking with manager Dickhead.  Make it look like you're taking his side if you need to.  \"Hey Manager Dickhead. So, I'm obviously going to follow your instructions, but I need to keep this official so it doesn't appear to be under-handed.  I've partnered with Jane here to help me keep it official.\" If the stories between the two involved don't \"gel\", then it's a no-go.  If you feel pressured to do so against your best intentions, then you get corporate HR involved and take your hands off.  That's the best you can do. ",

            "answer_text": "In what industry is speaking in a loud tone of voice worthy of written disciplinary action? That's a bit over the top unless he was like name calling, yelling obscenities, or some other similar thing. If you don't want to write the guy up, then don't. If it bothers the HR person so much and since she was the person disrespected, why doesn't she write the employee up? Are there any witnesses to this or is it just your manager and the HR coordinator? My other question in this - did the HR coordinator ever tell your manager that she felt disrespected directly? One of my common sayings is: \"It's not a problem unless you tell the other person it's a problem.\" Meaning that if you are upset about something but don't ever actually have a conversation with the person about it, the other person generally has no clue why you are upset and the problem can't be solved. People can't read minds.  1) Just tell your manager that he is a \"loud talker\" and that it might be useful for him when dealing with people outside your department to try to see if he can modulate his volume a little bit.  2) You should have a chat with the HR Coordinator and tell her that the manager is just naturally loud and didn't mean anything by it.  3) And then have the manager apologize (but without admitting guilt for anything other than being semi-loud naturally) to the HR coordinator just for the sake of internal politics and smoothing ruffled feathers. Stick to your guns. I've seen a lot of things in my HR career and this doesn't sound remotely write-up worthy - granted this is only one side of the story - but when I've helped write up people for disrespect, they've actually done something significantly disrespectful (ran through the office screaming profanities, etc) ",
