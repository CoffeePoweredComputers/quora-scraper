            "answer_text": "They are not prejudiced against new writers. If they were, they would go out of business. That new, unheard of writer could be the next J.K. Rowling or Steven King. If another publisher gets that writer, they will be the ones leading in the market. You will hear writers talk about \u201cB-list\u201d and \u201cA-list\u201d writers. A-list writers are those who receive top billing because they consistently come up with books that are hits. B-list compose authors who are not so famous or successful, but sell enough books to make a decent living or are known well enough among fans of the genre that author works in. But there is one more list of writers, and those are the stars. These writers are household names that everyone knows. They put out just one book, and that book sells millions of copies in a matter of a week or two. These writers can make a publisher\u2019s entire annual budget in one shot. A new writer is a big financial risk for a publisher. They are unknown, have never sold a book and therefore have absolutely no track record. The publisher needs to pay this author an advance on royalties on their new book so the author doesn\u2019t starve to death. They must pay editors to wrangle the mess of the manuscript into a book that will sell well on the market. They need to pay an artist to create the cover. Even after all that, they must pay a book manufacturer to print up several thousand copies, then pay to distribute those copies to bookstores. And then they have to pay for advertising so readers know that this book exists and is available. All that and there is no guarantee that readers will ever notice the book sitting on a bookshelf and buy it. If a publisher is constantly picking manuscripts that turn out to be duds, they won\u2019t remain in business for very long. Often, that one star-writer and a couple of A-list writers are the only ones that keep a publisher in business. So the publisher has to look at trends to judge what new books might sell. If everyone is drooling over darkly romantic novels about vampires, then they are going to look for stories similar to that. Then someone comes along with a story about a little kid who discovers he his a wizard and goes to a magic school, it just isn't what they are looking for. So they pass on it, going for the other submitted manuscript about a romance with a hot werewolf because it is similar to the romantic vampire story. At the same time, they have to keep a lookout for that next A-list or Star-writer that might be out there somewhere. Writers don\u2019t last forever, so the publisher has to find potential replacements in order to stay relevant in the industry. All the money they make from the star-writers is used to subsidize the cost of supporting all those new writers, hoping that the investment will pay off and that new writer will squeeze out a huge hit. Thus, they can add a new star to their stable. It makes for a strange catch-22 where they have to be picky about what manuscripts they accept to stay in business and yet they can\u2019t be too picky because their supply of writers and manuscripts could dry up and that could put them out of business. So keep submitting despite rejections as you may eventually hit the right publisher at the right time and get an acceptance. ",

            "answer_text": "They\u2019re not. Publishers have a quota to fill each year. It might be 20 books. But authors send them 10,000 manuscripts. First books are crap. Direct quote from Mercedes Lackey by the way, who is a trad published author of long standing. She says it here periodically. And I do agree with it. First time books need a huge amount of work. Existing contracted authors are a known quantity. So they go with existing authors because the costs are defined, and the returns already more quantified. Publishers can\u2019t tell if a book is the next best seller or not. They play the field, betting on 20 books in the hope one of them makes enough to pay for all the others, and make them a good profit. But from what I hear, it\u2019s little more than gambling. All first time authors think their book is the next coming. 1 in a million might be. And that book when a publisher first sees it, will still be crap. No-one can tell, until it\u2019s out there and selling. New authors don\u2019t follow the rules. All publishers have submission guidelines. They are there specifically to find out if you do what you\u2019re told. They specify exactly how they want the submission. Anyone doing anything differently will get binned. Most of the better publishers now only accept submissions from an agent. But all agents have submission guidelines as well. They want to know you can follow rules. The last thing an agent wants is a loose cannon for a client, because publishers don\u2019t want them either. And they want to know you can do what you\u2019re told, because deadlines require it. The vast majority of submissions are binned unread because they were made to a publisher who doesn\u2019t accept unsolicited submissions. This is not prejudice against new authors, this is new authors failing to do their research. The vast majority of submissions which are looked at get binned because they dont comply with the submission requirements. Again, failure of the new author to find them out, and adhere to them, even if they don\u2019t make sense. It is a test, and those who fail, get binned. And this can be as simple as including the whole manuscript when the guidelines ask for specific chapters. Amazon has been around since 2008 for Kindle. In those 12 years, 50 million books have been uploaded. Of that 50 million, only the top 250,000 are performing. The first time author is just a drop in the ocean, one which has a hidden abyss in it. No-one takes them seriously. Not until their book performs. And they do it again, twice. Going the trad publishing route means you follow their rules. But while going Indie means you drop your book into the ocean, going trad means you submit it for someone else to most likely bury it. That\u2019s just reality in publishing. ",
