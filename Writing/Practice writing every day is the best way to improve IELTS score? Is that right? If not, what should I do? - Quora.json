            "answer_text": " It completely depends on an individuals weak areas as to what they should do in order to improve in their IELTS score. Writing :- If an individual's writing is weak, they should practice using cohesions, connectors and impressive vocabulary in order to improve in writing. Care needs to be taken with regards to grammar, punctuation and sentence construction as well. There are methodologies which can be used in order to build up valuable content in your passage. Its important to do proofreading before submitting your answers. Speaking :- In case Speaking is the area where they are lagging behind, they should try to speak in English with colleagues and friends in order to get rid of the hesitation to speak. An atmosphere needs to be created which includes English throughout, even in thoughts. This will help the focus to shift from mere translation to using modulation, intonation,cohesions,connectors and lexical ability. It's by doing the above, that improvement in Speak\u00ecng would reflect slowly but surely. Reading:- Focusing on the key words is essential in Reading. Also, most questions will have hidden meanings and synonyms. With a little common sense, the answers can be identified. Do not expect the answers to be mentioned word by word. Further, the more you practice, the better you improve. Listening:- According to me, listening is one of the most easy sections of the IELTS. Ample time is provided to go through the questions before the recording questions are played. A sharp concentration is required in order to excel in listening. Moreover, thinking in English goes a long way in order to achieve a good band. Note :- I work at Achievers Point. ",

Do what will make you score higher. Although it is a learning experience, keep your objective in mind. More importantly, keep the objective of the examiner scoring the paper in mind. There are a bunch of tips online to help you through to reach your desired score. Also, a bunch of practice papers to help you do that, practice. As long as you are focused and mentally prepared enough, there is no way you should score any less than what you are aiming for. Good luck! :) ",
