            "answer_text": "Kindle\u2026hmm. Let\u2019s see, I own kindle touch 6\u2033 (most basic version)  Advantages Light-weight (than most of good books)Green (from environment point of view)Hassle-Free (You can find everything just at one place)Makes you lazy (You can buy everything, just sitting on sofa)Handy (Keep it in a pocket)Flexible (Not physically, but you can start reading anywhere even in darkness provided you buy better version than mine)Bookmarks (Infinite number of bookmarks available)Dictionary (Pretty helpful to a starter in English reading)Translator (Helps much when you come across French/Spanish/German words, occurs too often in some books)Wikipedia (Just select the word and you can find translator+wikipedia+dictionary for that particular word, makes it easy to learn new words, abbreviations, other language)Vocabulary Builder (A feature that can help you build your vocabulary)Goodreads (A social community of readers, easily accessible)Highlighter (You don\u2019t actually need to carry a highlighter alongwith book)Charge (Lasts too long. but don\u2019t compare with books, they don\u2019t need charging ever)I guess that is all. Let me also justify buying the kindle. Some preliminary requirements before you buy a kindle: (Hint: Your answers to my following questions must be yes, yes and yes/no respectively in order to justify buying a kindle) Do you read enough to cover the cost of kindle you are going to buy? (Compare the cost of books you\u2019ll buy (and also read) in a year and then cost of kindle)Do you find it comfortable to your eyes?Do you wish to also spent some more money on books on kindle?Last point brings me to your last question. Yes, piracy is an option if you are willing to go there. Most books are over-priced\u2026ohh just leave it. They must be free, why pay when you paid for kindle, right? So, to be honest, I use piracy (shh\u2026don\u2019t tell anyone). After some practise, you can basically find any book on internet (torrent). So if you are willing to go for it, hail piracy. And one final question, I want to answer. Do I like kindle? Yes, but hell no as compared to physical books. I bought kindle, because it proved cost-effective for me. I read much and if I bought all those books, it would probably have cost me double then my kindle in a year. So I preferred kindle. But, Books. Ohh\u2026yeah. I love books, more then kindle. Why? Only one word\u2026SMELL. And yes it triumphs all the advantages of kindle. Someday, when I would be earning, I would buy books and only books. Just because of smell and also because to read. ",

            "answer_text": "I am qualified to answer this question as I own a Kindle(Paperwhite, 6\" High Resolution Display (300 ppi) with Built-in Light, Wi-Fi) for the past 2 years, and it\u2019s the best investment I ever made. :) The advantages are way too many: I don\u2019t have to worry about space in my bag, as it\u2019s very light and sleek.Once charged, it can be used for 3 weeks if you read approximately 1 hour a day.You can change the font size as well as font style to suit your need. So no more straining your eyes while reading small print book.You can read your Kindle in the dark, the brightness won\u2019t affect your eyes as it is adjustable.You have a built in dictionary, and it\u2019s too easy to use, all you need to do is long press the word you want to check the meaning for.It has a Vocabulary builder feature that logs the words you have searched so far, you can use it to see if you remember it\u2019s meaningYou can store thousands of books in it, it\u2019s like a portable library.And yes, piracy is possible, you can download free books online and convert it to mobi format(there are free online converters available, which can convert pdf to mobi); then connect your Kindle to your laptop and copy the mobi format book onto your Kindle. I am not a huge fan of piracy, so if you are concerned about overpriced books, Amazon has a Kindle Unlimited subscription, which is just 99 per month and you have access to thousands of books which you can either download for free or at a very low price.And last but not least, it gives you the satisfaction of actually reading a book since the resolution is so paper like and crisp.If you are an ardent book lover, I would suggest you to just go for it, it\u2019s worth every penny!!!
