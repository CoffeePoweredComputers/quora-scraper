            "answer_text": "Hey dudes, You know I really like school. I mean, education and all, it\u2019s the only way to get anywhere in this world and believe you me I know it! But anyway, dudes, listen, sorry to have to say this, but I\u2019ve gotta leave early. And by early, I mean like I probably won\u2019t even bother coming in, because as Abe Lincoln was fond of saying, and job not finished is a job that shouldn\u2019t be started, or something like that. So, anyhoo, to get to the point, I think I might have a STD. Yeah, that\u2019s right, I know I\u2019m young, and inexperienced, and actually, probably the inexperience was the prob, if you get my drift. So I need to go in to the clinic and get the old whazoo checked out. Hopefully, I\u2019ll get the all clear, and will be right back in action, mixing it up with this gender and that in the old schoolroom just ASAP. But meantime, I really do need to get this looked at, comprende? ",

If you are a child, your parents should write this. Whoever is writing, keep it short and simple and avoid flowery phrases. Dear Mr Smith, I should be grateful if you would allow my daughter Emma Smith, in Form 4, to leave school early tomorrow afternoon (Thursday 18th), to attend a family funeral / to visit a medical specialist. She will have to leave at 3.15. Yours sincerely, [Parent\u2019s name] ",
