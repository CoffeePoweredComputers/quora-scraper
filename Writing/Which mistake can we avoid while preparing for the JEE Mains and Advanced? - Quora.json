But one thing which is like one of the biggest blunders done by various aspirants is, people keep running after different test series and modules and dont focus on previous year IIT JEE Questions, which is the most imp thing to be done!) Whatever you do in the 2\u20133 years of preparation for JEE\u2026 But mastering Previous Year Questions for PCM is MUST !! one must master each and every question of it.. (You can use Arihant 40 years for that).. After doing this, you can do anything you want.. But only after that :) Best Wishes :) ",
