            "answer_text": "I have always been a writer and my earliest passion was to grow up and become a paid writer. My parents were immigrants and wanted me to go into a profession, such as law or medicine. The idea of their son pursuing a career as a writer made no sense to them. Journalism sounded like an actual profession. I was able to make sense of it as a career both for myself and for my parents. I came of age at a time when the profession was exalted and admired owing in large part to two factors: One was the Watergate story, uncovered by two young and dynamic journalists. They  changed the political fabric of the nation (and the world, ultimately). Their experiences were mythologized in a massively popular film called \"All the President's Men.\" The movie featured  two of the most famous movie stars in the world at that time, Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, both of whom played heroic roles as young, dashing and dogged journalists. To understand the impact of that movie, you'd have to imagine that the current movie about the press, \"Spotlight,\" had the box office attendance and critical adulation held by \"The Force Awakens.\" Which of course it doesn't. In any case, that movie inspired many young people at the time to pursue careers in journalism.  The second factor that influenced me was the groundbreaking movement known as the \"new journalism,\" whereby literary writers notably Tom Wolfe, Norman Mailer and Gay Talese. These were creative writers who functioned as both storytellers and reporters. Their guiding light, in turn, was Clay Felker, a legendary newspaper and magazine editor who, in my view, has not been equaled  in the current era. That writing and style of journalism inspired me as well.  Today, of course, journalism doesn't have the reputation, structure or even economic viability which it had in that previous era.  As to my own career, the glamour and excitement that inspired me of course inspired many other young people to pursue careers in journalism. There were only so many slots on the mastheads of the country's flagship newspapers. The career paths of most graduates at the time were varied, ranging from public relations to small community newspapers to in-house newsletters.  ",

            "answer_text": "EDIT: I was answering \u201cWhy did you become a journalist?\u201d \u2014 which seems to have been merged into someone asking why they should become a journalist. Because I got closed out of shop class in high school. No, really. I had thoughts of engineering or architecture (I was of the opinion in those days I was good at math) and was looking to take advanced metal shop to complement the drafting classes I\u2019d already taken. But the class filled up and I didn\u2019t make my choice in time. I was faced with the prospect of yet another damn study hall in my schedule. The principal, a former newspaperman, said to me: \u201cMiss M. (the English teacher) is restarting the school paper, this time as part of a journalism class. Whaddaya say?\u201d Anything seemed better than a study hall. The process of gathering and reporting stories, writing quickly instead of agonizing over the multiple weeks of a class \u201cresearch paper,\u201d was absorbing and fascinating. And then I got a cartoon published and I never looked back. The work remained fascinating through 25 years. I got to visit, several times, the world\u2019s largest space environment chamber (you saw it in the opening of the \u201cAvengers\u201d movie) when NASA was using it to test the landing system for Mars Pathfinder. I got to examine, up close and personal, the workings of a Great Lakes freighter in transit on the Welland Canal. Less uplifting but still fascinating were the machinations of civil lawsuits in a county with a surfeit of underemployed personal-injury lawyers. This was in the days when people still liked, for the most part, and trusted the local paper, and we repaid that trust. The situation deteriorated, both internally and externally, by the time I left.
