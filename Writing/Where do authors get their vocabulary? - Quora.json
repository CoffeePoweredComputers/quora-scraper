            "answer_text": "A great deal of a writer\u2019s vocabulary comes from reading literature, research, world and local news, but some of the vocabulary comes from other media. Many writers are hooked on things like NatGeo because it transports them and feeds their imaginations. Writers are also professional eavesdroppers, and language surrounds them. Bus rides, airports, food courts, the locker room at the Y, and public parks are full of slang, dialects, modern usages that you won\u2019t find in Plato. Some of us actually read good dictionaries to push against out stodgy brains that become lazy if unstimulated. We are just language sponges. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many times when I will have to research local dialect when writing for a story set in a foreign country or region.  If I were to write in a northeastern US dialect for a character in Moscow or Hanoi, the reader would call me on it immediately. I usually have some experience from travel or speaking with friends in foreign lands which will help me in developing an accented voice.  Another good source is local newspapers, which are usually available online. ",
