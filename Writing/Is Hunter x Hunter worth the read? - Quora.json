            "answer_text": "Yep, absolutely. It\u2019s almost perfect, it has it all. Characters:- Every character is unique, different, likable, and well-written. Each has its own needs and desires and the story explores that. Characters aren\u2019t all good or all bad but have shades of grey in them, they are hypocritical, dark, light-hearted and sometimes make bad decisions. Characters have flaws that are shown in a meaningful way, they are not perfect and the story tells you that and doesn\u2019t shy away from it. World-Building:- HxH has great worldbuilding, absolutely phenomenal. Every arc has a unique place that is different and distinct. Each place has it\u2019s own identity, the world keeps getting bigger and bigger and in a meaningful way and it doesn\u2019t feel forced like someone is expositing to you for no reason other than to tell the reader, it doesn\u2019t feel like that at all. Power System:- As it\u2019s a shonen manga it has its own energy called Nen that resides in every being but HxH has easily the most complex and detailed one. There are no asspull power-ups that come out of nowhere, characters learn more and more about Nen as they keep going and they develop their powers and use it creatively. Every character has their own powers that are varied and unique and powerful but not so much that it feels overpowered or unbeatable. Characters don\u2019t get asspull power-ups but rather learn how to use their powers in a creative manner which takes a long time. The most important thing in the battle is the intelligence of the character, not its power, their power may seem weak on paper but they use it efficiently by using their minds. Intelligence>>>Power. All in all, HxH is definitely worth reading even if you are not generally a fan of Shonen Anime. This does things differently than other anime, has a deep, complex story with great world-building, characters, and power systems. Togashi has created a masterpiece. ",
