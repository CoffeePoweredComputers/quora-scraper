            "answer_text": "Now why would anyone need an article spinning tool like Spin Rewriter 10? Well, anyone who is familiar with creating websites and filling it with unique and interesting content knows this is the most costly and time consuming process any website owner under takes. To write a solid and fact filled article can take even the most educated and well rounded individual between 45 minutes and 1 hour 30 minutes to produce depending on the subject and length of article being created. This task to some people is really, really difficult especially when the search engines have greater emphasis in ranking websites with lots of useful and relevant content. Many people will outsource this task to well educated content writers and can be a pitfall when it comes to getting that quality content written for your website. This is especially true in the 'you get what you pay for' nature of the business when it comes to choosing an adequate content writer that is not only cheap but someone that also produces high quality articles which are relevant to the subject. For many years people used article spinners to mass produce unique content from one source article without really thinking about the quality and the human-friendly flow when it came to a real human having to read the content they landed on when visiting the website. Much more emphasis was put on producing content that was purely made to fool the search engines and rank the website accordingly. The website ranking game has completely changed in the search engine arena and a websites authority and relevant content is much more important. Producing factual and good quality articles can earn votes from people sharing the content across the many social, website and blog networks around the ever expanding internet landscape. These votes alone produce favour with the search engines and can shoot a website up the rankings rather quickly. A tool like Spin Rewriter 10.0 with its complex algorithm that can spin a source article at word, sentence and paragraph level to produce near perfect unique articles, can be a very powerful and invaluable weapon for any website owner looking to inflate the content of their niche sites. Being able to take a well written article and spin it into a similar yet unique content can be useful when wanting to place articles at other online resources with backlinks to the original source website. Creating backlinks to a main website from same niche articles is a fantastic way to gain relevant backlinks and therefore increase search engine rankings and website authority. Subscribing to an article spinner like Spin Rewriter 10.0 certainly isn't the cheapest option around, but compared to having to pay around $5 to $10 an article. The article spinner route is certainly much less expensive especially if you want around 50 to 100 pages of content for your website. The cost can run into the thousands and the less than $100 per year cost of Spin Rewriter 10.0 begins to seem extremely reasonable. Even if you are a seasoned article writer yourself. The time and effort in having to produce such unique and relevant content can be extremely time consuming and particularly exhausting. With the algorithm used in Spin Rewriter 10.0 you can produce lots of different versions of the same article that is not only unique but is also readable buy humans and is still of high quality as the original.

            "answer_text": "From my personal experience (and I tried and mastered virtually EVERY spinner on the market in the past 3 years or so), Spin Chief is the current best article spinner around. It has an enormous (and growing), tables of synonyms, but unlike other spinners, it gets much deeper than this; It practically scans the complete article - meaning, it doesn't just checking up words, but it analyzes the text to understand its exact meaning! So it means that Spin Chief understands what you are trying to say, and can re-write your articles intelligently.  By using the latest cutting edge Statistical Replacement Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Part-Of-Speech analysis and Emulated Natural Language methods, it can not only generate hundreds of new articles in minutes for you, but also in one click it can rewrite articles to a very high level of human readability and uniqueness. Spin Chief 5 can understand articles and rewrite paragraphs and sentences automatically, and afterwards it can spin again in word mode to generate nested spun articles if you need them.  Before this particular tool, I was required to manually choose synonyms, as most other spinner software are not smart enough to pick up correct synonyms every time. This one is much better than any free article spinner. They use synonyms but in a random way, they do not really know the meaning of a particular synonyms, they just use one from a list. And it is possible and probably that this particular word\u2019s most adequate synonym is another one or there is no synonym at all. But this is not the case with this Spinner. It helps you to create unique articles on any subject with a couple of clicks something that is really a solution that you should seriously consider. If you\u2019re constantly looking for new content for your sites, using an article rewriting tool, it\u2019s a great way to produce unique content in no time without wasting your money and your time.
