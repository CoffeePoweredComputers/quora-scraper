            "answer_text": "As a sender, you should be following best practices. Doing so should ensure that your messages land in the inbox folder. Best practices includes: Properly setting up authentication. Authentication includes SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance). Getting signed up on feedback loops and getting whitelisted. Working with your service provider that sent your email. Researching your reputation and taking any and all remediation actions when necessary. Additionally, make sure your image to text ratio is 70/30, include an address book statement in your messages, brand your messages, and include a text or html unsubscribe link. Make sure to keep user engagement high and target those recipients with relevant content and do not send to users that are not interested. Keep complaints below .3% and remove those who complain immediately. Keep your bounce rates below 7% and remove hard bounces right away. If you are using your top-level organizational domain to send messages, I highly advise you to move toward a new domain or subdomain to send your marketing messages. Your top-level domain can easily be tarnished by a dirty list, bad email, etc. If the reputation gets to be too low, that can cause messages to land in the spam folder or bounce completely. This is not only for the marketing messages, but also for those 1\u20131 transactional messages. Ideally you should not hit any spam traps. Remember, just one spam trap can lower your reputation, and if enough are hit, it can turn into a snowball effect. Once you\u2019re thrown over the threshold with the spam traps, you may be in jeopardy of landing on a blacklist. A blacklist can cause your messages to land in the spam folder or bounce. My company, Inbox Pros works with clients of all shapes and sizes to help them reach that optimal inbox deliverability. Whether it is content, technical issues, or anything else that is tripping you up, we are here to help! I also teach an email deliverability course about best practices. I dive into all sorts of concepts that may be beneficial for you and your company to take! ",

The choice of an email platform is crucial, and mailchimp is the best (and free to some extent) in my opinion. What triggers sending an email to junk folder Moreover, email subject, content (text, images, links) greatly influence inbox performance of an email (whether it goes to inbox, or to junk).  For example, emails that contain online money making content are destined for junk folder. Words such as 'Hurry' , 'Last Chance', 'Save Now\" is no good at all. I hope you'd find insight from this best practices content  - How to Avoid Spam Filters | MailChimp ",
