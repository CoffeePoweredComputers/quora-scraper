            "answer_text": "Firstly watch this vedio:  Secondly read few pages randomly from a Chetan Bhagat novel. Thirdly, answer the question: What similarity did you find in the video and the content of CB novel. Look at the guys in Dhinchak Pooja\u2019s video. They enjoy being in the video as much as CB\u2019s fans enjoy reading his novels. Masses will enjoy stuff like that! Logically speaking, a novel must have its elements intact- just telling a story in simple words or difficult for that case isn't enough. There are no literary devices, and no art of literature in Chetan Bhagat\u2019s novels. His thinking is on the surface, and not suitable for literature. This discourages literature students and those who appreciate literature and art. In fact, his novels are regressive to the progress of literature! Conclusively, Chetan Bhagat is Dhinchak Pooja of literature. He does to novels what she does to singing. No wonder masses follow both of them. ",

            "answer_text": "Chetan Bhagat novels revolves around the trending social issue or psychology. I have read almost all of his novels and personally i don\u2019t get attached to the plot so much. He tries to choose a plot which in turn is a heated issue prevailing in the Indian society. This is the real reason why his novels get controversial. Talking about the main content of the books, they do are entertaining but not onto the extent which would make me read them once again. At last i would say that he is great author with a huge understanding of the society along with a power to express them through catchy plots. ",

Jokes apart, I really like his literature and read almost all novels of Chetan Bhagat. ",
