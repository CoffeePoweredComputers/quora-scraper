This is an excerpt from 2018\u2019s State of the Sanderson that you can find on Sanderson\u2019s website: State of the Sanderson 2018 | Brandon Sanderson  \u201cMovie/Television Updates So, let\u2019s talk about movies. People tend to get really excited about news of my books being adapted\u2014and rightly so. I\u2019d be very excited to someday see one of my properties turn into a film, and I think it\u2019s inevitable that some day, we\u2019ll see it happen. However, the process of a book becoming a film or television show is a long one, involving the input of a lot of people. And fans tend to get very excited when something is being developed, but often don\u2019t realize that the stages of development can often take a long time. I thought it might be helpful here to go over what some of those steps are, so you can get a better idea of how far along my various properties are. Understand that this is a rough guide, and individual properties might follow a different route. This is also kind of an outsider\u2019s take on it all, as I don\u2019t consider myself an expert in Hollywood. Those who know more about the ins and outs of the business would probably consider this a gross over-simplification. Step One: Producers Option a StoryIn Hollywood terms an \u201coption\u201d is kind of like a rental agreement. The most common way a story starts on its path to an adaptation is with an option. (Sometimes, there\u2019s even a step before this called a Shopping Agreement.) Basically, someone (usually a producer, but sometimes a studio) comes in and offers to pay an author every year to \u201coption\u201d their work, meaning the producer/studio gets exclusive rights to make a film on that work. They don\u2019t buy the rights completely, however. Usually, they set a buyout price, then pay 5/10% of that price every year or so to keep the option locked up. This gives them time to put all the other pieces together for a film without needing to commit to paying the full buyout price until they\u2019re certain the film is going to happen. My agent once told me that about 1 out of 30 of the properties he saw get optioned eventually got made into a film or show. An option is absolutely an important step, but a lot of times fans see an option agreement in place and start expecting a film any day\u2014when really, this is just the first exploratory step in the process. Sometimes, producers even option rights they never intend on making into films. (I once had a producer brag to me that he\u2014in order to make sure nobody in town was trying to sell something similar to his property\u2014had bought up all rights to similar books for cheap, with the intention of sitting on them for five years to make sure he didn\u2019t have any competition. I was not impressed, to say the least.) Step Two: ScreenplayUsually, after the option agreement is signed, a screenplay is commissioned for a film. For a television show, it will either be a screenplay for a pilot, or some kind of series bible or \u201ctreatment,\u201d a kind of outline that talks about the process the group would use in adapting the property. This screenplay, treatment, or bible is what the producers will take around town to try to get studios, directors, and actors interested in a property. A book being successful is interesting to Hollywood, but what they rightly want to see is if that book can be made into a workable screenplay. Often, this process takes years, as a screenplay/teleplay will be commissioned\u2014then go through several rewrites. Sometimes, the producers will decide to hire a second or even third screenwriter to do a pass on the script, if they decide it needs another take or specific revisions. Step Three: Studio InterestWith screenplay in hand, the producers will approach the studios or larger production companies. (Or sometimes content distributors, like Netflix.) The goal here is to get interest from parties with deep pockets and the power to actually make a film. This step can occasionally be skipped if a studio was involved from the beginning. (This has happened with several of my properties.) Sometimes, the studio might be interested\u2014but send the producers back to step three to do more revisions before offering any kind of official deal or promise of distribution. Sometimes, the producers will need to secure promises from multiple parties\u2014like, for instance, they might get a smaller studio in the US interested, then have to get a foreign partner interested to provide funding for overseas distribution promises. Step Four: Attaching TalentWith a screenplay in hand and the backing of a studio or similar group, the producers can now try to get a director or actor on board with the film. This crucial step will have a big influence on how/if the film will get made. Obviously, if you get a major director interested, that makes the studios sit up and take notice. Likewise if a major actor attaches to the project. For television, this often involves getting an established show runner attached. (In my experience, with television, sometimes this sort of thing happens in Step Two instead\u2014with the showrunner being involved in the pitch documents. In that case, Step Three is the big one: getting someone big in the business to fund a pilot.) Step Five: Actual Green LightFinally, if all the pieces come together, you get what is called a green light. The film is scheduled for shooting, the studio commits a large chunk of money to the project, and people start getting hired. This is when the option actually gets exercised, and the author gets the payment for the contract they likely signed years and years ago. Once in a while, a group of producers will decide that the property they hold is big enough that (once their option period runs out) they decide to pay the buyout price to get more time to try to get the film made. Sometimes, instead, they\u2019ll just agree with the author to extend the option period for another payment. Step Six: Film Gets MadeI\u2019ve never gotten here, but I hear it\u2019s a lovely experience. So, with that in mind, I can tell you where each of my properties are. Unfortunately, I won\u2019t be able to name a lot of names. For instance, if a director is interested but hasn\u2019t signed on officially, it\u2019s not my place to announce them as being involved. Likewise, if some producers have offered to option something, but we don\u2019t have signed paperwork, it\u2019s generally best if I stay quiet about the details so that they can do publicity on the deal in the way they would like. Anyway, here\u2019s where we stand for each of my properties. SnapshotIt might be odd to see this one at the top of the list, but I think right now the best chance we have at a film would be one based on my story Snapshot. MGM announced their option of the rights almost two years ago, which is great\u2014because it meant that we already had studio backing, cutting out one of the steps in the process. The producers were impressive in their enthusiasm, and they jumped right into commissioning a screenplay with a very talented writer. I\u2019ve read the screenplay, and consider it the best I\u2019ve ever read based on one of my books. It helps that Snapshot itself is a shorter work, more easily adapted to a film. The Snapshot screenplay is an improvement on my story in virtually every way, something that I discovered with both joy and a little bit of shame. (Really, the screenwriter did some things with the story I probably should have figured out myself.) With this great screenplay, I hope there will be a lot more good news to share really soon. The CosmereDMG Entertainment optioned the rights to the Cosmere, and they have been wonderful to work with. They commissioned screenplays for The Emperor\u2019s Soul, Mistborn, and The Way of Kings. They\u2019re currently in Step Three above, trying to get studio interest for the properties. Mostly, they\u2019ve been pitching Mistborn as a film series and The Way of Kingsas a television series. Likely, the success of things like the new Lord of the Rings show and the Kingkiller Chronicle will influence how this goes in the future. SteelheartThe Reckoners series was optioned some years ago now by 21 Laps, Shawn Levy\u2019s company, using backing from Fox. We were happy when they renewed their option this past summer, as we weren\u2019t certain what the status of this would be in light of the Fox\u2013Disney merger. It seems they\u2019re planning to take the Reckoners with them through the process, which is good news. This was an exciting deal, as Mr. Levy has done some great work\u2014including the film Real Steel, which was an excellent adaptation of the original story. (And, of course, he was heavily involved with Stranger Things on Netflix.) Beyond that, it came with the implicit promise of support from Fox, meaning that we could skip the \u201cfinding a studio\u201d step. That said, this is still in the screenplay stage. Stephen Leeds/LegionThe Stephen Leeds stories have recently been optioned for a television series by a new production company. This is the property\u2019s third time being picked up for an option, so I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll make it work this time. I don\u2019t believe the company has been announced officially yet, so we\u2019ll hold off on mentioning them for now. But we\u2019re probably in the middle of Step Two for this one. Dark OneDark One, based on an outline and worldbuilding guide from me, is being shopped (in a Step Three kind of way) by FremantleMedia and Random House Studios, with an impressive showrunner attached. There has been movement since that announcement in June, but I can\u2019t say anything publicly yet. Bonus Mention: The Wheel of TimeAs The Wheel of Time does not belong to me, I like to be careful about what I do and say with it. I don\u2019t want to overstep my bounds. But for those who haven\u2019t been paying attention, this series has progressed into a full-blown green light at Amazon Studios\u2014with actual episodes being written and filming soon starting. I don\u2019t know what role, if any, I\u2019ll have in this. Like I said, I like to be respectful of Team Jordan. It\u2019s not my place to try to muscle in and pretend I\u2019m in charge. At the same time, I do think I could offer something to the production, and the showrunner (who is quite sharp) has reached out to me multiple times for conversations about the adaptation. I\u2019m impressed with everything I see, and hope to at the very least be able to pop over to the set when filming happens and grab some photos for you all. For most of my own properties, I\u2019d say to not hold your breath. I think they\u2019ll happen eventually, but you shouldn\u2019t start to get hyped up until Step Five happens for something. Well, we\u2019re past Step Five with the Wheel of Time, and you can officially begin to feel hyped. It\u2019s actually happening, and it looks great so far.\u201d ",
