            "answer_text": "Being in the Digital Marketing niche, needs you to be updated with all the new tools and tricks in the market. I have tried several article spinner, rewriter, and article generator tools in the past to check what is in them that makes people to buy their subscription. Honestly, I didn\u2019t find any of them better! But as new tools come out or some old ones become popular, I give them a shot. So I tried Article Forge recently to write a 500 words article. I had to put a Heading and some sub-headings to generate the article.  And here is what I got: 486 words long article got generated in less than 2 minutes.The article wasn\u2019t as bad as I had expected. It was readable though extra vocabulary and sentences were used.They claim to write 100% unique content so I checked it in the plagiarism tool. It was 100% unique! On analyzing, I found that it writes longer sentences and changes active into passive or passive into active sentences to make them 100% unique.Here\u2019s my suggestion: Use It If you have some product page or a topic that you are just trying to push for SEO, you can generate an article from article forge on each of those products and then customize the article by adding your own sentences. This way, you\u2019ll be able to write some content for the products, you were lacking ideas on. Don\u2019t Use It If you want to do better SEO and are just trying to replace your existing content writer! People like you and I can not relate to an article created by such tools. When a human writes for another human, people relate and then engage with the content. But engagement will go down and the bounce rate will increase a lot if you are just using article forge to create content. If you have any questions or need any help, feel free to comment below :) ",

            "answer_text": " Tools like Article Forge can never replace the writing skills of a decent article creator no matter how intelligent the AI of the software algorithm is. Since Article Forge is supposed to be an automatic article writer then quality and uniqueness is something that this tool needs to take seriously. I have personally used Article Forge to create content for various topics and I would say the articles produced are on par with a novice article creator. I have witnessed that some topics produced much better quality articles than others. If you want some high quality science or technology article that goes into real depth then I would avoid this tool and get yourself a decent content writer. But if you want a generic article on a particular topic related to your niche, which helps to provide your visitors to topical and relevant content. Then Article Forge can produce interesting articles and is a much cheaper and time saving option to either writing articles yourself or outsourcing out to a content writer. Most automated or rewriting tools on the market tend to create articles that look robotic when reading them. They tend to choose the wrong synonyms to go in the sentences and therefore look like someone with low literacy wrote the article. It simply does not make sense and is completely out of context on most occasions. Article Forge however does do a good job of producing articles that actually make some sense when you read them back. And the articles that made sense were of a good enough quality that your visitors would read and find them interesting. But don\u2019t expect a three thousand word pillar article using Article Forge. The best articles created by the tool are between 500 and 600 words long. You will need to do some decent keyword research since this how Article Forge determines the topic to automatically create the article on. You need to enter one main keyword and a set of sub keywords into the tool. So for example if you wanted an article about \u2018dog collars\u2019 then your main keyword would be \u2018dog\u2019 and your sub keyword would be \u2018collars\u2019. When it comes to time and the cost of producing articles for your website. The time taken to produce content yourself or the cost of outsourcing content creation really does come into play. Writing content for your website yourself can take lots of time especially if you are needing to produce regular content nearly every day. Also getting someone who is a decent article writer can become very costly. Article Forge can produce most articles in under 2 minutes which is a massive time saver and you could create thousands of articles in the same time it takes for you or someone else to write the content. The tool does cost a whopping $54 a month subscription fee but you have to remember you can produce thousands of articles in that month and the articles created would be much cheaper than outsourcing the content creation to a human writer. Here\u2019s a video review on the Advantages and Disadvantages of Article Forge which may help you decide if this service is for you. ",
