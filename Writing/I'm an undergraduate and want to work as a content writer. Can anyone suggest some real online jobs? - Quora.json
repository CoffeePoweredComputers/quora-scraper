I would personally suggest : WorknhireFreelancerThese two platforms in addition to providing you with projects that you desire, will also help you to connect with various other freelancers. Having been freelancing a year I suggest that you start taking up projects only those for which you are given citation. Writing only for money will make your works go unnoticed. Hence writing cited contents will help you apply for full time jobs or secure highly paid freelancing projects. All the best\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "You can try Upwork and WorknHire. Upwork will have better job opportunities and higher pay, but the jobs are tougher to bag. WorknHire is decent enough for beginners. Pay isn\u2019t too great but you have an opportunity to improve your skills and gain some experience. But the best thing would be to join a content writing firm and work there for a year or so. You\u2019ll be able to get extensive training and guidance from skilled writers and editors. ",
