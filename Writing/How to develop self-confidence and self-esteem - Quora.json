            "answer_text": "You only live once. And life is short. Much shorter than you could even imagined. Before you know it, your life will soon be flashing in front of your eyes. The only way to develop self-confidence and self-esteem, is to be comfortable in your own skin. When you are, you will not care about people\u2019s affection, how they think about you, how you appear in front of them. Because you will only care about how you feel and you are willing to do everything to feel good in your own skin. Here\u2019s an excerpt from my post, \u201cBe true to yourself: What it\u2019s like if you don\u2019t care about impression\u201d. What it\u2019s like when you decide to peel off your masks Let me tell you my story. My whole life, I had been letting people tell me around, doing different things, pursuing different titles for my career. I played it safe. I played the role of a dedicated and hard-working person. I was \u201cnice\u201d. \u200bUntil one day I woke up, and I felt sick in my stomach. I couldn\u2019t understand why at first, because it was so strange. I felt the urge to go beyond myself, to explore new areas, to try new things. But I didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. I just knew that I didn\u2019t like who I was, even if every people told me otherwise. I wanted to break free, wanted to peel off all the masks I\u2019ve been putting on. \u200bFor the first time in my life, I wanted to be honest with myself and others and speak from my heart. And that\u2019s exactly what I did. No, it doesn\u2019t mean I became reckless and ignore my duties. I just chose to be honest with myself and started telling others how I truly felt. And I stopped worrying about how other people think about me. I chose myself first. I become more self-aware of my feelings and emotions Since I started considering my emotions and prioritizing myself, I become more aware of it. I realized I have blindly done many things to please others, while silently killing my soul. I refused to go for a walk in the park with my husband to stay at home and do chores instead. I refused to discuss with my boss about my opinion in the fear that he might not like it. I couldn\u2019t say no to anyone because I was afraid they would hate me. No matter how much I told myself that I was supposed to do those things, I still had the bitter taste in my mouth. I become more protected toward my inner self I thought I knew how to take care of myself, because I take care of people. But since I discovered how I really felt, I knew I hadn\u2019t looked after myself. I became more protected about myself. I only have one soul, if I don\u2019t protect her, who will? \u200bI stop doing things that give me a headache and sick in my stomach. I stop saying \u201cyes\u201d all the time. I speak from my heart. And I start to pursue my dreams. I become more focused and determined \u200bI used to be a zombie. Kinda. I used to mindlessly do things on an autopilot. I woke up on Monday, got to work, went home and felt like crap all week until weekends, where I felt a little bit more alive, and had Monday blue again. \u200bI lost my goal. I lost my emotions and I lost my sparks. Now that I can see things clearer, I know what really matters to me. And I become more focused and determined to follow my own path. I become happier This is undeniable. I care about how I feel, I choose to do things that make me feel good, and I choose to feel good no matter how the situation is. \u200bI realize I can be a happy person if I just stop making myself miserable and be a victim of life. The surprise outcome After you just stop giving a crap about how people think or feel about you, you think they would hate you? Because I was afraid the same thing. I wanted to blend in because of that. Maybe the fear of being an outcast and looking like a pathetic loner was the reason I was so concerned about my impression on other people. Here\u2019s the irony. They\u2019ll like you even more than when you are a people-person. People want to hear my opinion Because they know I will be honest. Even though sometimes they will not like what they hear, but they know they need that. And they seek for my opinions. They respect me more and take my words into consideration. \u200bSome people consider me as their role model and ask for my advice You know the admiration you have for someone being so cool and fearless? I am that someone now. People want me to involve in their groups and their conversations. They listen to me speaking and tell jokes. \u200bSome people even consider me as their role model, they come to me for advice and my response is to listen to their hearts. Being true to yourself is the nicest thing you could do to your soul Let me tell you a secret. Your soul is your best friend. Who has been with you through all ups and downs no matter what? Who has been there for you every time you need? Who has been there for you since day one? Yourself. Your inner self. Your soul. No one else. Not all the people you want to impress. Not even your loved ones. Just you. And there is only one thing she wants. You. So stop being someone else. Give her what she wants. Give her yourself. Your true self. Once you totally surrender to your soul, you will soon realize everything has been in the right place the whole time. And you are the one that keeps trying to mess it up. When you are yourself, there is no hiding, no suffering, and no regret. So what are you waiting for? Peel off your masks and find yourself again. Now. ",

            "answer_text": " There\u2019s a man I\u2019ve allowed to sabotage my self-confidence and self-esteem. He\u2019s made it a priority to point out everything I fear and every flaw I have. He\u2019s convinced me to do things I didn\u2019t want to do. And, I love him. There\u2019d been times when he would have been pleased leaving me, as a cold, naked, and helpless child to die an embarrassing death. He tears me down at every opportunity with the most hurtful criticisms. The onslaught of insults delivered in the most demeaning voice tones he can muster have trembled the foundation of my being. Still, I love him. I\u2019ve had my dark passenger all of my life. He eats, sleeps, dreams, and lives with me. He is me. As a child I was intensely introverted and shy. As a result, many of my social skills developed around gaining acceptance. I craved validation and believed it could only come from external sources \u2013 other people. This lead me to rely solely on others to define what I liked and who I was. It was how I had determined my self-confidence and, as a result, my lack of self-esteem. I had become increasingly confounded to the point where I didn\u2019t know if I genuinely liked something or whether I thought I liked something because it was the right thing to like. If you think that\u2019s confusing, you\u2019re correct. My dark passenger can be the inner critic in me that doesn\u2019t ask for permission. He\u2019s all reaction and judgement. The terrible things that my dark passenger has whispered in my ear have been the major causes to missed opportunities. \u201cYou\u2019re an impostor.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not good enough.\u201d \u201cNobody is going to care about your opinion.\u201d \u201cYou look stupid.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u201d \u201cNobody loves you.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but think, \u201cHow could I ever develop self-confidence and self-esteem if I don\u2019t believe in myself?\u201d The fear of failure had overwhelmed me and had frozen me in my tracks; but not anymore. Challenging The dark passenger The irony about having a dark passenger is his intention is to help me. He is exceptionally good at preparing me for any threat \u2013 real or imaginary. He is always ready to protect me by telling me to prepare to fight like a wild animal, run like there\u2019s a fire or freeze as if there\u2019s a saber-toothed tiger hiding behind a bush. Over time I\u2019ve come to realize that my body will react to threats (real or imaginary) my dark passenger believes are present. I understand that some of this automatic thinking is being put together with lower structures of my brain; the reptilian brain. Cognitive distortions are thoughts or beliefs that are made superficially or without proof. This type of thinking is often inaccurate and can reinforce destructive coping mechanisms. We mustn\u2019t believe everything we think! An effective way to stop these potentially damaging thought patterns is to interrupt the thinking with a challenge. For example, if my performance at work or home falls short, I can challenge my thinking by recalling a time when I was successful with the same or similar task. \u201cRemembering is mental time travel.\u201d ~ Endel Tulving Some examples of distorted thinking that we must challenge (Patelis-Siotis, Wheeler 2004): 1. All or nothing Thinking: Seeing things in black and white categories. If my performance falls short of perfect, I see myself as a total failure. Dark passenger: \u201cYour presentation was rushed. You\u2019ll never be a good public speaker.\u201d My challenge: \u201cThis presentation might have been rushed but the last two I gave were great.\u201d 2. Emotional reasoning: Assuming that my negative emotions reflect the way things are. i.e. \u201cI feel it, therefore, it must be true.\u201d Dark passenger: \u201cHe didn\u2019t laugh at your joke. He thinks you're a dolt.\u201d My challenge: \u201cMaybe, the joke wasn\u2019t funny. That\u2019s ok. I\u2019ve told funny jokes before. I\u2019m still charming.\u201d 3. Mental filter: Picking out a single negative detail and dwelling on it exclusively, so that the vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that discolours the entire beaker of water. Dark passenger: \u201cYou wore the wrong color socks. Now, everyone knows you\u2019re a fool.\u201d My challenge: \u201cEverybody has days when their clothes don\u2019t perfectly match. That doesn\u2019t make them, or me, a fool.\u201d 4. Magnification or minimization: Exaggerating the importance of things (e.g. a goof up), or inappropriately shrinking things until they appear tiny (e.g. our own desirable qualities). Dark passenger: \u201cYou screwed up by using the wrong verb tense during the interview. Now, the job will certainly go to someone smarter.\u201d My challenge: \u201cI don\u2019t know if she noticed that I had used the wrong verb tense. No big deal. I nailed everything else!\u201d 5. Jumping to conclusions: Making a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support your conclusion. Dark passenger: \u201cShe\u2019s not going to like you because she thinks you're a creep.\u201d My challenge: \u201cI\u2019m just nervous about approaching her. She has no reason to think I\u2019m a creep.\u201d Perspective shifting and choosing our reality The ability to consider something from a different point of view is an essential skill to developing self-confidence and self-esteem. This is typically referred to as cognitive reframing. By changing our belief about an event/experience, we can drastically affect our body\u2019s chemistry. We can go from feeling the effects of stress and nervousness (shaking hands, increased blood pressure, and/or nausea due to increased levels of cortisol and adrenaline) to feeling resolved and centered (relaxed breathing, contentment, and acceptance of the situation as a result of increased levels of dopamine and endorphins). Removing shame and guilt from an event/experience is a crucial step when attempting to fix distorted thinking. We can choose to perceive the things that help us reframe how we see ourselves in the world. It\u2019s this selective process that allows for perspective shifting. Know that we can influence the world around us. We have power and say over how we choose to interpret our reality. Once I realized that I could challenge the way I experience the world, everything changed. I started to look at myself objectively. This helped me to become mindful of possible situational factors, like cognitive distortions, that were once invisible to me. Self compassion is the bridge between self confidence and self esteem Our mental well being is strongly related to self compassion. Negative self-talk and self-criticism hinders our attempts to align our actions with our core values. Our motivation goes from promotion thinking (growth and advancement) to prevention thinking (safety and security). (Higgins: Regulatory Focus Theory) The result from negative self-talk puts us in a precarious and difficult position. We become the attacker and the attacked. This is not an effective strategy to building self-confidence or self-esteem. We are hardwired to respond to, and seek out, warmth, affection, and soothing vocalizations. Fortunately, we can provide all three of these for ourselves. During moments of criticisms or judgments stop and look for proof of the opposite. For example: Inner critic/judgement: \u201cNobody laughed at your joke. You\u2019re not charming. You look stupid.\u201d Compassionate challenge: \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I told the same joke the other day to my friend and she laughed. I am clever and charming.\u201d A compassionate challenge to our self-criticism and judgement could mean the difference between feeling like you can take on a challenge confidently or crumbling under the weight of the fear of failure. Self-compassion and positive self-talk will help increase the levels of oxytocin, dopamine and endorphins. Cognitive reframing will help reduce the levels of cortisol and adrenaline. When our motivation is no longer about safety and security (prevention focus), we can shift our intentions to promotion type behaviors (growth and advancement). This can often be achieved by acknowledging the intense emotion we feel and allowing the emotion to exist. All the while, observing the feelings we experience like watching passing clouds in the sky. And, as the clouds pass, we reclaim our presence of mind. We are more likely to be affable and ambitious with a mindset that is expansive and curious. By practicing self-compassion, we become more forgiving of our shortfalls. This is key because we learn to see ourselves as worthy of praise and empathy. The awareness of our own self-worth will then be present in all of our choices from deciding a career path to developing caring relationships. 3 Easy ways to build self-confidence and self-esteem Practice Behaving Confidently = Feeling Confident We are constantly going between automatic and conscious thinking and behaviors. Due to the incessant input of sensory data, our brain filters certain information. If we are prevention focused, we will tend to accept judgments which support that particular frame of mind. Likewise, with promotion focus. Try this: Schedule practice for behaving like the person you intend on becoming. Repeat this exercise with different people (an acquaintance, a friend, an authority figure, a lover, an enemy, etc.) until it\u2019s a habit. Try this: Build someone else\u2019s confidence. Let someone impress you today and witness the benefits this has for that person and for yourself. Extending compassion to others, as well as ourselves, will infuse meaning into our interactions which helps build self-esteem mutually. Persist \u201cI don't count my sit-ups; I only start counting when it starts hurting because they\u2019re the only ones that count.\u201d ~Muhammad Ali Change is uncomfortable. It takes courage to put ourselves in vulnerable situations. We must be gentle with ourselves as we hustle through the tougher moments. It\u2019s ok to take it one step at a time or to redo a step. Forgive the shortfalls, accept the flaws. Having an awareness of potential negative self-talk will empower our resilience and help us to manage awkward and intense feelings. Re-Affirm It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul. ~ WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY Personal assets inventory The following exercise helps me to consider the values that motivate my choices. One of my favorite affirmation exercises is to review my \u2018personal assets inventory\u2019 of awesome qualities. If you\u2019ve never created a list of favorable qualities, this is how I do it. I come up with 10 (or more!) things I\u2019m good at. This could be anything from washing dishes to going for walks. I write these things down. Then, I call a close friend and ask him/her what they most appreciate about me - this might feel weird at first, but persist! As a courtesy, I tell them what I value and appreciate about them. Which, is my favorite part of the exercise. If we focus on what we want versus what we don\u2019t want, it puts our thinking in line with our core values. We will be more likely to find and praise the positive behaviors we want to reinforce without shame or guilt. Stack the wins During times of doubt, the personal assets inventory helps remind me of the good that I, and others, see in me. I stack these wins and the result is healthy self-esteem. Confidence indicators Confidence is the most important element to presence; our presence is the foundation to our charisma. Others will perceive our capacity to influence the world and how empathetic we are, largely, by how we present ourselves. Here are a few confidence indicators: 1. Appearance and demeanor: Our attitude and how we carry ourselves will send signals, via our body language, as to how we feel about others, the situational factors, and ourselves. Besides maintaining good posture, be mindful of your hands. There are more connections between our brain and our hands than any other part of our body. The use of our hands make a significant impact on how we\u2019re perceived. Try this: When seeking cooperation use palm up gestures. When demonstrating authority use palm down gestures. The ability to read the body language of other people will help to elevate our empathy and communication skills. 2. Facial expression: As good as we are at masking how we feel, micro-expressions of authentic emotions will leak. There is a possibility, if we are experiencing negative self-talk, it could show on our face. If it happens, there\u2019s a risk the person we\u2019re talking with will notice and might believe themselves to be the cause of our grimace or contempt. Try this: Schedule a body/face scan once a day. Bringing our awareness to our body, by performing a head to toe body scan, will help bring mindfulness to the moment. 3. Vocal pitch: During the effects of stress, our larynx tightens and our pitch rises in tone. An effective way of knowing if we\u2019re experiencing stress is to listen to the tone of our own voice. Other symptoms or signs of stress might be: increased blood pressure, faster speaking rate and nervous fidgeting. Try this: When you notice the symptoms or signs that signal that you are stressed or nervous during an event/experience take a deep breath, slow down your actions and speech and lower the tone of your voice. You will feel like you\u2019re gaining back your control and you won\u2019t appear erratic or unstable to others. This is an excellent free ebook you can download now: The 3 Power Secrets To Reading People. Befriending my dark passenger Challenging cognitive distortions, over time, becomes easier. Perspective shifting, reality checks, and body scans can become part of our daily routines. Whenever self-confidence is lacking and self-esteem is at risk, cross the compassion bridge. I am now close friends with my dark passenger. As primitive as he can be, I understand all he wants to do is protect me in the only way he\u2019s been programmed. Sometimes he hurts me. Still, I love him. ",
