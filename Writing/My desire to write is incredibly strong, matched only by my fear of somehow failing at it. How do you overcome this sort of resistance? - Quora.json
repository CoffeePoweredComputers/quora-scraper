            "answer_text": "What do you mean by failing. As I see it there are two possibilities. Please correct me if it is something else. First. Fear that you will not produce anything that is any good. Solution. Write every day. Write even if you produce rubbish. I have produced what I thought was rubbish because I had a target for that. I filed it away in my own internal slush pile. One day I had nothing to take to my writers group so I took something from my slush pile. They liked it. If that doesn\u2019t convince you to right every day read On Writing (King). Second. Fear that people will not like your writing enough for you to make money out of it. Solution. You do not want to be a writer. You want to be rich. Or a celebrity. Or both. Writers do not write because it will make them rich. Very few writers become rich. Writers write because they have something inside themselves they need to get out. A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must write, if he is to be ultimately at peace with himself(Maslow) ",

            "answer_text": "There is no special trick about writing and succeeding at it. The best thing, I would say is to first learn something well so you can always make a living. As for the scientific fields, any of them requires a long schooling and an intense application. If you're made for it nothing could be better. In the long run you will have to come to your own conclusion. The arts, which probably offer man more satisfaction, are uncertain. It is difficult to make a living. If I had my own life to lead over I presume I would still be a writer but I am sure I would give my first attention to learning how to do things directly with my hands. Nothing gives quite the satisfaction that doing things brings. The thing of course, is to make yourself alive. Most people remain all of their lives in a stupor. The point of being a writer is that you may live. Above all, try to remain humble. Smartness kills everything. ",

If you do it, you\u2019ll be humiliated and everyone will laugh at you. While everyone is laughing, you won\u2019t be paying attention and will absentmindedly walk into heavy traffic on a highway and break your hand and not be able to write anymore. You\u2019ll get an award for the World\u2019s worst writer and be exiled to Elba where even Josephine won\u2019t cry for you.\u2026. For God\u2019s sake, and for the sake of humanity, PLEASE, throw away all your pens, paper, computer and don\u2019t ever write again.\u2026. And what do you mean by \u201csomehow fail.\u201d You\u2019re just not that good.\u2026. However, if you\u2019re willing to sell your soul to the Devil, you can succeed easily without really trying. Just start a few wars, and write about it. Guaranteed success \u2014 so don\u2019t worry about it so much. The Borg are here too: \u201cResistance is futile.\u201d ",

If you have found your rhythm, do not break the flow. You should wait at least until the next day to edit your writing. Look at it this way, do we filter our thoughts? No. But we have all been in a situation where we wished we could take back something we spoke. Spoken words cannot be retrieved. Now let\u2019s see how this compares to writing. Think of writing as thinking. Our thoughts are raw and potent, with no filter. Similarly, when it comes to writing, just write. Once you have finished writing, you can choose to show it to others. If you don\u2019t feel like it, you can stash it and move on to the next piece. No matter what, just begin by taking that first step. Set incremental goals. The first sentence, first paragraph, first page, and so on. I wish you all the best. ",

Just know that there are successful writers who started off as bad writers but got better, and you can too. I\u2019ve never done a cartwheel, but I\u2019ve seen that other people can, so with practice, I know I could eventually do it too. You can become a successful writer by failing at it a hundred times and succeeding on the hundred and first time. ",
