            "answer_text": "Easy peesy. Here are opinions stated using \u201cI\u201d: \u201cI think that taxes are too high.\u201d\u201cI feel that people should read more books.\u201d\u201cI believe chimpanzees might be capable of driving cars.\u201dHere are the same versions without \u201cI\u201d: \u201cTaxes are too high.\u201d\u201cPeople should read more books.\u201d\u201cChimpanzees might be capable of driving cars.\u201dYou don\u2019t need to add \u201cI think\u201d or \u201cI feel\u201d or \u201cI believe\u201d to assert your opinions. You can chop out that wordy bit and simply assert your opinion. The reader already knows you think it, feel it, or believe it, because you wrote it! So, it\u2019s redundant to add \u201cI think/I feel/I believe.\u201d All that addition would do is make the sentence wordy and make you sound less confident. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, one way you can do this is to write it in a neutral way by distancing yourself as a writer from it. For example, instead of: \u201cI disagree that the young these days are too obsessed with fashion.\u201d You can say: \u201cThe young these days are not too obsessed with fashion.\u201d Oftentimes, when you do this, you would need to use passive sentences. This would mean that your word count would slightly increase but in return, you create a more unbiased feel to your writings. Your reader would feel that you are a somewhat objective writer, not clouded by your own biased or unfounded assumptions. ",
