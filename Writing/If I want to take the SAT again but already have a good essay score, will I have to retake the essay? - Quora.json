            "answer_text": "Well!!This is difficult to answer. ....This is because it depends on the university. Every university has different criteria. So, even if anyone tells you something will not be 100% correct. What you can do is, visit the official website of your desired universities and check their admission policies and criteria. If they accept super-score then go-ahead or if they ask for all of your SAT scores then do that. Your admission to the US university depends on their criteria. In general, students have to re-take the SAT as the College Board doesn\u2019t allow a student to improve the sectional scores separately. Look for the university criteria and then proceed accordingly. I hope you got the answer. Note: I am associated with Achievers\u2019 Point. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on the college. Some colleges let you super-score (or cherry-pick) your essay score, along with the other sections (a better math score in one test but a better reading/writing score on another). Some colleges do not. Some other colleges make you submit every single score you took for the SAT, including for the SAT essay, so you can\u2019t super-score any score. Some don\u2019t require or don\u2019t let you submit your essay score. Some let you super-score only your SAT multiple choice scores, and not your essay scores\u2026 Point is, if you see a college you\u2019re interested in, just check their website and they\u2019ll probably be clear on what you can and can\u2019t do with your SAT score when applying there.
