            "answer_text": "My first reaction to your question is why do you want to sabotage your chances? If you knew your SOP was terrible you should have sought help or just taken the time to make sure it was ok.   I hope you are simply being too hard on yourself; of not, then here is what might happen. If you have applied to highly selective programs then your SOP will likely be an easy reason to deny your admission. Schools that receive far more applicants than they have spaces look for reasons not to take students and you may have given them an easy one.  It might be possible, however, that the rest of your credentials are so strong that you will be admitted to some schools. But if your GRE/GMAT scores are not great and your SOP is terrible and you still get into a school, then I would ask you to think twice about whether it is worth your money to study in a program that accepts weak students.   If you are in a STEM field, it may be you can still find a job afterward, but this might still be a stretch depending on your performance in the program. It is a sad fact now that a number of schools are admitting some very weak students (at least as far as English goes) from outside the US in order to fill the seats of certain departments. In other words, the schools need money from students who can pay.    My last questions: do you really want to be in a school that will accept students who communicate poorly? What does this say about the students, the school and the program? On the other hand, such programs might give a chance to those who can then prove themselves once they are enrolled. But submitting a poor SOP does not predict , from my experience,  that you are quite ready for graduate work in a demanding program of study. Sorry if this is too harsh, but I want you to think about the best options should you be accepted to programs. If you are admitted, then you should ask lots of questions about placement and employment before you enroll. ",
