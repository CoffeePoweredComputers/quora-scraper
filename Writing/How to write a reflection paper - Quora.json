            "answer_text": "The reflection paper is one of my favorite types of papers. It allows you to express your thoughts, feelings and reasoning. So, I suggest you to relax, jot down a few ideas about the topic and then write your first draft, let it lay down for a few hours and come back again with the critical view. Definitely, you can write such papers only when you have ideas, so take your time to think and evaluate your views. ",
