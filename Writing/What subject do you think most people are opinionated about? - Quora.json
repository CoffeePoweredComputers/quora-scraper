            "answer_text": "Politics. People make assumptions and form opinions and then tightly wrap their emotions around that opinion and call it \u201cfact.\u201d When emotions are high (which comes from the limbic system of the brain, which includes the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus) that keeps them from using their prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that has concrete thoughts and the ability to be rational. When emotions are attached to opinions (as they usually are in politics and religion) it\u2019s pretty much impossible to have a reasonable conversation. ",

            "answer_text": "What am I most opinionated about? The right to abortion, and the rule of law. I've given both of these a lot of thought and research for many years; I studied Constitutional law in college, although I am not a lawyer. No one is above the law, and society cannot deprive women of bodily autonomy without violating the principles of freedom of religion and equal protection. ",
