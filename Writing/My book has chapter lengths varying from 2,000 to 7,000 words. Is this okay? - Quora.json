I have never ever once counted how many words i have done in a single chapter. it has never even occurred to me to do a word count on a single chapter. you aren't writing an essay where the word count matters. Worrying about this kind of stuff is a waste of time and energy. when i first started writing novels, my first draft of my first novel was a thousand pages long. some chapters had twenty to fifty pages in them. i cut four hundred pages in that first edit, whole chapters. i cut the chapters down to a manageable size. i began to stream line the whole novel. your first challenge is to write and finish the first draft. until then stop wasting your time and energy worrying about stuff like this.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what your book is about or what makes your chapters so variable, but if was my book I would try to reduce the larger chapters to something like 5,000 words. This is only because shorter chapters have a allusion for readers of faster paced writing. Also your longest chapters become a temptation for readers to put the book down. They may never pick it up again, and so not recommend your work to others. The modern idea is to have shorter chapters than has usually been the case; readers feel like they are making good progress in their reading. ",
