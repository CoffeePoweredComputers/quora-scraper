            "answer_text": "Hi, Daniel... Thank you for the request... That said, I'm not sure of the intent of the question.  Which pen writes the best? Of the current fountain pens in my rotation, by manufacturer and in no particular order:ViscontiConklinBexleyOf all the pens I own, again in by manufacturer and in no particular order and without regard to whether the pen is modern, classic or vintage:PelikanViscontiBexleySheafferParkerLamyEsterbrookNamiki VPWatermanThe inquiry about multi-color pens, with one exception I can think of (and really can't afford) takes us out of the fountain pen world and into the roller-ball and ball point world. I really don't use these.Back in the day, Bic had a four color ball-point; clunky thing, blue and white. I'd use those occasionally.Maybe 10 years ago, before touchscreens became the standard, Cross had a model called The Matrix (this was before the movie trilogy). I've got several of these in with the fountain pen module and the blue/red ball-point. The fountain pen is great...good writer. The ball-points..I think I made sure they worked and they seemed like pretty much run of  the mill ball-points.Hope this helps, however, if you can give a bit more detail as to your goal with the question, perhaps I can give a better answer...
