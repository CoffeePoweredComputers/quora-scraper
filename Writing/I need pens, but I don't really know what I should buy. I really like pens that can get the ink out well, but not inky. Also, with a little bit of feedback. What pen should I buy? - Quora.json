What pen should I buy? Obsession with writing instruments is a common trait with writers and artists. Pens are delicious!! Unfortunately, \u201cgoodness and beauty\u201d in pens is also a highly personal experience, so your mileage may vary. [Bracketed comments are from my artist-daughter who doesn\u2019t curse as much as I do, but knows which pens work best for sketching and drawing!] I am quite fond of several pens: The Classic Papermate Flair Pen An oldie but a goodie. I\u2019m a little miffed they got rid of the ribs down the sides, but that is just nostalgia, not actually anything that matters. The Flair Pen is the best \u201cI need to get this shit down as fast as I can\u201d pen. Many pens just start whining and leaving blank streaks, but a fresh flair will go at the page with zeal! Flair pens come in many colors, which is great when you are mixing doodles in with your writing. Diagrams and squiggles and nicely filled in dark circles are Flairs specialty. The down side: A Flair that has been left with its top off for very long is a sad and disappointing beast. It will tease you with just enough ink that you will have settled your butt into the chair, only to wheeze and cough and sputter and fade. Sigh. Never put a dying flair back in the cup! Immediately wish it well and toss it in the garbage. They almost never recover from a decap-itation. <groan!> The Pilot G-2 07 - 7mm Gel Pen Relatively inexpensive if you shop for sales. Many colors. Nice smooth lines, with very little \u201chitching\u201d or \u201ccatching\u201d on paper fibers. While they will occasionally tip-glob if you make a lot of long lines, a quick twist-swipe on a scrap piece of paper generally clears this up for the rest of the writing or drawing session. The barrel is nice and smooth, the rubber grip satisfying and the click is decent and I don\u2019t seem to get poked by the point at random when I carry them in my pocket. I think I\u2019ve used up the in in maybe one or two, but in general I lose them before they run out of ink. Downside? I\u2019m trying. I just like these pens. You might not find the point not smooth enough. There are probably smoother writing pens, but I either hate the way they feel in my hand, they leak in my pocket or \u201cFor no apparent reason I hate the fuck out of them.\u201d Sorry, it\u2019s a writer thing. [If you\u2019re looking for a gradient for any reason, these are not the pens for you. They come out in blobs, much like any gel pen, especially in cursive writing with many loops or drawings with the same case. ] Sharpie Even a writer sometimes needs a permanent pen. The ones with a fat end and skinny end are just useful as hell to have in your backpack. Also, sometimes you need to just \u201cmadly doodle your frustration out on a page\u201d so that you can express the utter angsty feeling that \u201cTrue Artists\u201d get. <cough> (If you think you are true artiste \u2026 good luck, with that!) Downside: Bleeding. Put the tip down. Wait. Page full of ink. \u2018nuf said. [Uni-Ball Signo Needle UM-151* - (Entire review by my young lady) These pens are amazing for both writing and drawing. There\u2019s a large range of colors to choose from, which is good for editing papers. As for drawing, there are even white pens for that opaque cover-up that everyone loves! They are gel pens, but they dry right away\u2014 this means no smudging over your hand or arm. The ink is opaque and works on a majority of papers, and I have never had a problem with dryness, blank streaks, or hitching on paper. They work on smooth and rough surfaces, from plastic materials to going over acrylic paint. The ability to draw is quite good as well. Even if they are generally gel pens, the \u2018gloppiness\u2019 that some other brands suffer from doesn\u2019t come with the Uni Ball. As for the thickness, they come in many varieties. I personally prefer a thin line so I can write smaller. The needle variety is the best for that. Depending on your preference, you\u2019ll easily be able to find other Uni Ball Signo pens. Color won\u2019t fade over time, which is a large benefit for those who enjoy journaling or writing in notebooks. Some colors like red dull over time in other pens, but these gel pens keep their vibrant color. Downside? So far, I haven\u2019t had any! I have no issues with these pens. They work very well for writing and drawing. They are an amazing version of pen! ] ASIDE AND WARNING \u2026 the pen reviewed below can ruin a relationship: Pilot Precise V7 Don\u2019t get me wrong. I really like these pens, in fact I loved them, especially for editing pages of someone else\u2019s writing. I used them for literally years. Until my wife banned them from the house. If you never, ever, ever, ever leave them cap-facing-down they are a brilliant pen. If you ever leave it with the cap and tip down \u2026 not every time, but roughly one in ten times it will fucking leak. Red seems to leak worse, of course. And then, you will leave one in a pants pocket and your partner, roommate, lover or whoever will put it in the wash. The look on my wife\u2019s face was enough to make me understand that I was really, truly \u201cnever ever allowed to bring one of those pens into the house again.\u201d I will actually immediately throw a Pilot Precise pen in the garbage if I pull one out of my pocket at home. Final tip: After she pushed me out of my chair, sat down and started writing her own review, my wonderful young lady found the following website. Cool guides to all kinds of pens, pencils and inks. I earn no money from saying this and I have no idea if they are a good company, but really interesting reviews including things a pen-obsessive like myself never considered! JetPens - Guides ",

            "answer_text": "Two things, do not buy either cheap or pricey. Any pen in between will likely do the job. Your best bet is to buy singles of a few to try out. This gives you a cross section. You may consign a few to your junk drawer but with some true experience you know what suits. You need not spend a lot. There are many \u2018free' pens out there at insurance, license, bank, or other places. I personally like gel writers. Their color and flow are better than average. When pens lay around often uncapped, you learn which pens hold up. I have had fancy, pricey pens like art work that were truely awful too. So price is not really a true indicator. Some feel right in your hand. This is the best tell because you probably will grab it first for choice but your pen is mostly all your notion of best. ",
