(where the essay is only about the relative, not about the student)The \u201ctell us when you challenged an idea\u201d prompt on Common App leads many students to a \u201cthe time I stopped listening to my religious leaders\u201d or \u201cthe first time I stood up to my parents\u201d storyDescribing your bedroom as a metaphor for who you are/what is important to you (which leads to a lot of telling rather than showing, ironically)A narrative version of your resume or activities listAnything in five-paragraph persuasive essay formatMany other writers have mentioned that these topics can be effective if handled correctly. For example, the famous Costco essay from a couple years ago is basically a \u201cdescribe your bedroom\u201d essay with an interesting twist. Focusing your writing on something extremely specific and personal can elevate one of these cliche topics into a more effective essay, but it\u2019s best to find a fresher way to introduce yourself to the admissions committee.

            "answer_text": "I always tell my students to avoid the following cliche essay topics: Death of a grandparent or someone else in your family, grandparents are just the most common. (tragedy is hard to quantify, and rarely allows for an uplifting ending)Overcoming an injury. (unless this inspired you to publish a children\u2019s book about Physical Therapy or something else inspiring, this topic is just too common)Winning the big game. (imagine reading \u201cI escaped a concentration camp and started a non-profit to help other survivors!\u201d and then, \u201cI won a tennis game\u201d \u2026 your essay will most likely fall short)Learning you were more creative than you thought during English class. (again, this essay will fall short when compared to more weighty essays)Why you chose that school or that major. (if the school cares about this, they will ask for a Why Major or Why Us essay. This is the time to share how creative you are, and tell a story about a time that built character)",
