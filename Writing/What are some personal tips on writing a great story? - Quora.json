            "answer_text": "Deeper POV and New Writer Mistakes  from Write Better Right Now, Chapter 18, by Jody Lebel  When you write in deep POV (point of view) you will never have to say s/he felt, s/he thought or s/he knew \u2026 realized \u2026 speculated \u2026 wondered \u2026 etc. These phrases create narrative distance. They are 'telling' sentences. The reader is at arm's length, not in your character's head where they belong. If we are deep into our character's psyche we can proceed directly to whatever it was s/he was thinking. In deep POV we get straight to the point exactly like the person would, creating 'showing' sentences. Here are some examples. Before: He wondered if Kim would show up at the picnic. After: Would Kim show up drunk at the picnic like last year and spoil it again? Before: Two men approached the house. I hoped it wasn't the cops again. After: A pair of strangers walked briskly up the walk towards the front door. Not the cops again.  Before: He thought the dog needed a bath.  After: What a smell. He eyed the pristine bathroom then studied the muddy animal. What that dog needed was a good bath.   Another way to write with a deeper POV is to remove the was/were and rephrase with a hook. Start with a basic sentence: The night was dark. Pretty boring. Your reader is yawning.  Now add action or danger, overpowering emotion, a surprising situation, warning or foreshadowing, a unique character or something totally unexpected to make a more interesting sentence, a sentence that grabs the reader. * The only thing that stopped me from walking in the dark night was the throaty growl coming from the nearby woods. * When she awoke she was no longer alone. The red glow of a cigarette pierced the dark night. * As the night grew dark Sister Carmelita adjusted her veil, then lifted her habit and strapped on a Ruger .38 to her thigh.  Your readers aren't falling asleep any longer.  New Writer Mistakes 1) The use of exclamation points. Never, never use one. It is the sign of a beginner writer and editors spot it immediately. Using an exclamation point is lazy. It is telling not showing.  2) Words ending in 'ing'. Go through your ms (manuscript) and eliminate as many of these words as possible. She was singing. They were swimming. All telling. 3) Same with words ending in 'ly'. She said quietly. He walked quickly. Change it up. Show us. Better: She said, her voice so soft he had to lean in to hear. 4) Limit the use of 'was' and 'were'. They are shameful telling verbs. He was mad. Better: He slammed his fist on the table so hard the glasses rattled. Both sentences let us know he's mad; which sentence is more interesting? 5) Limit the use of 'very' and 'just'. It was very cold. He just wanted to get in the warm cabin. Better: The cold air left frost on his mustache and cracked his lips. The smell of the wood fire at the cabin spurred him on through the snow. 6) Be suspicious of the word 'it'. It rained. It was unpleasant. You can almost always find a better way. Use a deeper POV for example. Better: Although I had buried snips of my hair in an old mason jar out in the backyard like my grandma told me, rain still showed up on my wedding day.  7) He and She. Try to eliminate as many as you can. He sang. Better: Charlie sang. Best: Not knowing if it would get a laugh or a boo, Charlie lifted his face into the spotlight and began to sing.  8) Clich\u00e9d work. Don't ever write it was \u2018as quiet as a mouse\u2019, or \u2018a tomb\u2019, or \u2018so quiet you could hear a pin drop\u2019. We've all read that too many times. Be unique. It was as quiet as a nun's prayer. So much more interesting to read. 9) Watch those misplaced antecedents. When she spoke to Mrs. Smith she smiled. Who is smiling here?  10) Changing POVs in the middle of a scene.  The way the girl's long hair shone in the sunlight got John's immediate attention. Fascinated, he moved closer with the intent to feel the softness without her being aware. She wondered if he was going to get the nerve.   Whose head are we in? John's. So the last sentence has to be changed. He can't know what she might be wondering.  ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you think is a good story, it's a bestseller? Because too often betsellers are terrible stories but are really entertaining, but that doesn't make them good literature. I would say there are no formulas but they are good tips. Write but edit, a lot, the cleaner the story, the better. For example, if you say, \"he had long legs. He could reach anything. He was very tall\". That is saying the same thing three times. It's an exaggerated example, sometimes it's a lot more subtle but keep in mind not repeating the same fact again. Once you told the reader, give them credit, they will remember he was tall. That doesn't mean you cannot add some nice stories or scenes that don't add to the main story, sometimes it's good to give that to the reader so he can have, how to say it, a \"rest\" in the story. If the story is too hard, sometimes it's good to give something else to think to the reader, not to stress him so much. It's good to mix the structure. Sometimes do summaries, sometimes do more detailed scenes, depending on the importance they have. There is nothing more boring than to read scenes that are slow and don't add nothing to the story. A slow story is ok, but it has to add something. Also, try to do nice descriptions mixing the things you see, what are the people in the scene doing, the atmosphere, anything that can make the reader feel they are there. But sometimes you don't need to do this, especially if you have done it before. If you have described a house for example, next time you are in that house, do not describe it again unless it's necessary.  Start with something that takes the attention of the reader. Have you read \"Chronicle of a Death Foretold\"  by Garcia M\u00e1rquez? It starts with the death of the main character and the reader then wants to know why that happened. It doesn't have to be something that strong, but give some insight from the main story but do not tell much, just enough to get the attention of the reader. And keep doing that in the story, open doors that will keep them interested and close some, if you want, close all, but some ideas could be left unresolved, that's ok.Do not give him everything to the writer, make him feel intelligent, give them just enough information so they can infer the rest. That is really hard, to know how much to give and how much to hold, you have to read and practice a lot, but that's what makes someone a master. Read books like \"As I lay dying\" by Faulkner, \"The turn of the screw\" by Henry James, \"The Great Gatsby\", by Scott Fitzgerald, among others. These are great examples of giving just enough to tell a story. Use first tense ONLY in the action and most important parts, do not overuse it, unless it's needed in the story. Also, see what tense is the better. It depends in what you want to say. And how close it is from the characters. For example, if you use first tense, you have to know that you will see the world only from the eyes of the one speaking and will not know a lot of things. Or if you use a third person can be like a person looking right next to the characters or someone really far, or like if it was a camera with no feelings, or someone who is telling us the story he or she heard, the possibilities are almost endless but that marks the tone of the story, choose careful and change it anytime if you see it doesn't work for what you are looking for. That's all I can think of right now. ",
