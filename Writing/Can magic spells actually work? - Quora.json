            "answer_text": "In a classically scientific sense, the answer is no. When magick spells results have been tested in the laboratory it is routinely limited to \u2018seeing\u2019 the designs on an unseen card-face. Invariably the results with Witches are a few percentage point better than simply guessing. That said, I would like you to consider, if you will, a very personal scenario from my life story as \u2018my evidence\u2019 that magick spells do indeed work nowadays for those with the innate abilities and the proper training and degrees. to wit: Storm and Rowan When I was 15 1/2, in 1967, I went to my first High School dance and it was not working for me! So I was walking across the dance floor to leave and suddenly, sitting on a bench was a gorgeous Goddess of a girl. Without a thought I walked up and asked her to dance. She looked up and said said \u2018Sure!\u2019 Her name was Janene. The look in her gorgeous Scandinavian and Scottish blue eyes was magickal! I took her hand, and led her to the dance floor, and I said to myself \u2018Oh My God, I have just met my wife!\u2019 Well, we became an item and we dated, danced, went to nice restaurants and enjoyed the Berkeley-San Francisco area together for the next year and some. In that time our two abusive and controlling mothers had developed a huge hate for one-another and they forced us apart in a very draconian and coordinated fashion. We were each told fictional lies about the other and forbidden to see each other. In time she went her way and I mine. We each married and divorced. After my 2nd divorce, I lived in Seattle and had found Wicca or perhaps Wicca had found me! I had read several of the works of the wonderful Raymond Buckland, so I had a solid foundation for \u2018The Wiccan Way\u2019. Then, one day, I laid hands on Sally Morningstar\u2019s amazing and life altering book, \u2018The Wiccan Way!\u2019 Suddenly, I had a clear vision of what it all meant, and my life was forever changed. I learned about the heart, soul and ethics of Wicca. I came to embrace the Wheel of The Year and The Seasons of the Witch. Following Sally Morningstar\u2019s \u2018The Wiccan Way\u2019 with format from Raymond Buckland\u2019s \u2018The Tree - The Complete Book of Saxon Witchcraft\u2019 I wrote my Wiccan Dedication Ritual. Then under a full Autumn\u2019s Moon, along the shore of the Skykomish River, north of Seattle, I dedicated myself and my life to my Goddess, My God and to Wicca! As a hereditary Witch with ties to Scotland, Wales and France and with a talent for Storm Magick, I took the name \u2019Storm Wynd\u2019 At the end of my Ritual, I somehow had the audacity to ask the Goddess for a visit with with my long lost Janene of days long past. The next morning I brewed my Starbucks coffee and loaded my things into the car for the drive home. I had gone perhaps a quarter mile, when there was the intense smell of the Autumn forest, like incense! The air in the car was charged as during an electrical storm. Suddenly the Goddess was there with me! She was like an apparition and her eyes periodically changed from one racial type to another. I was emotionally blown away and began talking to her, babbling one might say. However, I managed to again ask about Janene. In a few minutes she was gone and I was left crying and very much alone! The next morning, I arrived at work and was given a request to perform a Quality Audit at a company in Fountain, Colorado near Colorado Springs. A week later I arrived at my Hotel in Colorado Springs and unpacked, then went to dinner. Back at the Hotel television was a waste. So, having an unusual French name, I looked in the telephone book for the family name, but no luck. Then for reasons I can\u2019t identify, I flipped to her name. Suddenly before my eyes was her brother\u2019s name and number. I called, and he remembered me and we reminisced a little and I asked about his sister. He replied, \u2018Well, you might not want to hook up with her because, she\u2019s a Witch'. I replied, \u2018Really, so am I\u2019! He gave me her number in Texas!!! When I got back to Seattle, I held a ritual to thank the Goddess for this opportunity to at least connect. I shopped for groceries at the Pike Place Market and walked across the street to the Pike Place Wine Shop for a bottle of Shira and drove home to my condo in Kent which overlooked the Green River. I made dinner and had a nice glass of wine and finally, not being able to delay the inevitable any longer, I dialed the numbers into the telephone. Suddenly, I am talking to HER, and her Wiccan name is Rowan Stormdancer! WOW! We talked, cried and laughed for four hours and I invited her to Seattle. A week later I waited impatiently for her plane at Seatac. My long, long wait was over and she was in my arms. We were soon Handfasted in Colorado Springs for our engagement and later again in Texas where we jumped the broom for our wedding. I am 66 and retired and we have a townhouse condo in Colorado Springs and it\u2019s a great life to be a Wiccan Witch! It turns out that both of our families fought against the British at Culloden and the families were ultimately exiled! If you look closely at the attached picture of us, taken at my step-daughter\u2019s wedding, you will see Rowan\u2019s aura around her head and spilling around her shoulders! Blessed Be!

            "answer_text": "Kind of a funny story. Lol. Oh, but we got a good laugh out of it\u2026 See, my son (who is 18) was living with his dad and going to high school in Texas. So, my daughter and I went to his graduation late spring (May). A few months later (August), now that school ended and he graduated he wanted to move back home. Of course! thumbs up. Soooo, I haven\u2019t seen him in a few months. I go to the airport to pick him up and the first thing he says is how much longer my hair is and how he\u2019s trying to grow his out\u2026blah blah blah. \u201cSo mom,\u201d he says, \u201chow do you get your hair to grow so quickly?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I take care of it\u2026 deep condition weekly, take biotin\u2026\u201d And he was like, \u201coh okay\u2026 I can to do that.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s fine but, you know\u2026 I actually also did a magic spell on my hair\u2026seriously kid, no lie.\u201d He looked at me and just laughed and said, \u201cYea whatever, mom.\u201d I said, \u201cNo no\u2026cross my heart. Every night before bed, I\u2019d grab a piece of my hair in my hand and I would say these words: Stretch it, twist it, make it grow\u2026 Like a river, let it flow\u2026 Three times fast shall this hair grow\u2026 This is my will, so mote it be\u2026\u201d He laughed some more. I did too. But, then he looked at me all serious and was like, \u201cUh, really?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, just do that three times a night before bed and your hair will grow super fast! You\u2019ll see.\u201d Inside I was just dying, cause man\u2026what the hell? is he that gullible I was thinking? Poor kid. Uh, he\u2019s definitely been living with his dad. So obvious\u2026.ha ha. He needs to move back home and we need to straighten him out. Anyways, fast forward, I was about to go to bed that night when my son comes running in my room and says, \u201cMom, mom\u2026tell me that spell again\u2026so I can get my hair to grow\u2026\u201d I told him the words, and he grabbed a piece of his hair and three times said that little chant. I was trying so hard not to roll my eyes and laugh. I thought, I am just going to go with it. And damn, he was actually doing it and believing it. ha ha. God, I am so mean. Fast forward again to next morning\u2026my son comes running in my room, \u201cMom, mom\u2026did it grow? Is it longer?\u201d, he asked as he is checking his hair out in on my dresser mirror. \u201cReally? \u201c, I say, \u201c It\u2019s going to take longer than one night\u2026\u201d \u201cOh, how long?\u201d, he questioned. \u201cGive it a week\u2026\u201d, I state. Soooo, yea, every damn night he would religiously hold on to his hair and chant: Stretch it, twist it, make it grow\u2026 Like a river, let it flow\u2026 Three times fast shall this hair grow\u2026 This is my will, so mote it be\u2026\u201d Sheesh & OMG. (face palm) Finally, after about 8 days, I am sitting at the kitchen table talking to my daughter when my son comes storming down the stairs\u2026 \u201cMom, mom\u2026 this is just not working. My hair is not any longer at all. Look at it, do you think so?\u201d I just stared at him like completely dumbfounded. My daughter was like, \u201cWhat? What the hell are you talking about? What is going on?\u201d I looked at her and shook my head. Smiled. He says, \u201cMom told me that her hair grows so fast cause she did that magic spell\u2026\u201d She looks at me questioningly\u2026 I said, \u201cYou know, that one\u2026.Stretch it, twist it, make it grow\u2026Like a river, let it flow\u2026Three times fast shall this hair grow\u2026This is my will, so mote it be\u2026\u201d She rolls her eyes at me, \u201cNo\u2026 you did not?\u201d she says, \u201cand brother you are such an idiot\u2026\u201d, getting up from the table\u2026pointing at me, \u201d\u2026her hair hasn\u2019t grown that quickly, she has frigging extensions\u2026 omg you seriously have been doing this spell? for a week? Good god.\u201d She looked at me like is this a joke\u2026 I said, \u201cNope.\u201d We just laughed and laughed. sighs. Yes, my hair magically went from 16 inches to 22 inches in two months\u2026I wish\u2026 Well we thought it was super funny. Poor kid though and damn he fell for another one just a few days later in regards to money. He says, \u201cMom mom, I need money.\u201d I said, \u201cwell, do some magic\u2026\u201d and laughed. I was sure he\u2019d laugh and be like, yea not falling for that one again. But noooooo. He says, \u201c OK what do I have to do? What\u2019s the chant? the spell?\u201d Eye twitches. What the\u2026? God, I am bitch. But, its so fun. I said, \u201cokay\u2026\u201d, all excited\u2026 \u201cWe have to light a green candle for this one\u2026\u201d He was like, \u201cWhere is there a green candle?\u201d I said, \u201clook over there in that drawer\u2026\u201d And wallah, he finds a box with all different sorts of colored candles\u2026 (hehe cause yea, I am not a witch\u2026gah\u2026*gives wave of my hand* I don\u2019t know about this stuff\u2026 I just keep a box of spell candles on hand\u2026cause you never know\u2026coughs) I tell him to grab a green candle and a rune stone. \u201cA what?\u201d, he says\u2026 \u201cA rune stone\u2026\u201d I repeat, pointing to a bowl on the table. I was just messing with him. God. As he\u2019s searching for a lighter for the candle, I quickly look up \u201cSimple Money Spell\u201d on Pinterest. sighs and laughs. Back to the previous eve\u2026 my daughter had some friends over, so my son and I were upstairs in the loft watching a movie\u2026 kind of staying out of their way. Well, I guess when he was sitting on the couch, a bunch of quarters fell out of his pocket. When I saw them there the next morning I picked them up but, my hands were full as I was carrying laundry basket, too. I go into my room\u2026 laundry basket in my arms and a handful of quarters clenched in my fist. I plop the laundry basket on the bed, to fold and sort, and kind of just place the quarters on the bed next to the basket thinking I will bring those downstairs later. And well, yea, I forgot about the quarters. I make the bed, not realizing I just threw the comforter over a small pile of quarters. So, back to that night\u2026I am sitting on my bed and I tell him to write how much money he wants on the side of the green candle\u2026 then I tell him to light the candle and say this chant\u2026 Money money come to me\u2026 In abundance three times three\u2026 May I be enriched in the best of ways\u2026 harming none, on its way\u2026 This I accept, so mote it be\u2026 Bring me money three times three\u2026\u201d then I tell him to run the rune stone through the flame three times and place rune in your wallet. Thumbs up! all set. He reaches into his pocket for his wallet, and puts the rune stone in there. He says to me, \u201chow long does it take?\u201d I said, \u201c I don\u2019t know\u2026 you have to do it for three nights straight\u2026\u201d He says, \u201cOkay, cool\u2026\u201d and I suddenly remember the quarters under the blanket. evil laugh. He\u2019s about to walk out of the room, I say, \u201chey, I hear spirit\u2026\u201d He says, \u201cwhat?

As you mention Spells, I willpresume you are asking about the Magick Spells of The Witch. Yes indeed, the Magick of the Witch is real. Rather than talk to ideas, ideals, impressions, opinions and opposing or supporting theologies, let\u2019s get down to brass tacks and speak in a detailed fashion about a specific Witch\u2019s Magickal Spell which indeed worked\u2026 The Witch in this true story example is me, and the Spell I cast was my first and it changed my life forever!

So, having an unusual French name, I looked in the telephone book for the family name, but no luck. Then for reasons I can\u2019t identify, I flipped to her name. Suddenly before my eyes was her brother\u2019s name and number. I called, and he remembered me and we reminisced a little and I asked about his sister. He replied, \u2018Well, you might not want to hook up with her because, she\u2019s a Witch'. I replied, \u2018Really, so am I\u2019! He gave me her number in Texas!!! When I got back to Seattle, I held a ritual to thank the Goddess for this opportunity to at least connect. I shopped for groceries at the Pike Place Market and walked across the street to the Pike Place Wine Shop for a bottle of Shira and drove home to my condo in Kent which overlooked the Green River. I made dinner and had a nice glass of wine and finally, not being able to delay the inevitable any longer, I dialed the numbers into the telephone. Suddenly, I am talking to HER, and her Wiccan name is Rowan Stormdancer! WOW! We talked, cried and laughed for four hours and I invited her to Seattle. A week later I waited impatiently for her plane at Seatac. My long, long wait was over and she was in my arms. We were soon Handfasted in Colorado Springs for our engagement and later again in Texas where we jumped the broom for our wedding. I am 66 and retired and we have a townhouse condo in Colorado Springs and it\u2019s a great life to be a Wiccan Witch! It turns out that both of our families fought against the British at Culloden and the families were ultimately exiled! If you look closely at the attached picture of us, taken at my step-daughter\u2019s wedding, you will see Rowan\u2019s aura around her head and spilling around her shoulders! Blessed Be!

            "answer_text": "Yes. No. Maybe so. Spellwork is very unpredictable. Can it work? \u2026 sure. Does it always work, every single time? \u2026 nope. Is there any way to guarantee that it will work in any particular instance? \u2026 again, nope. At its most basic, magic is simply manifesting a desired goal or change through force of will. This is something that most people do, without realizing it, on a daily basis. We formulate a goal and we make it happen. In terms of spellwork, it\u2019s simply a matter of doing it in a slightly different way. Like anything else in life, there are many variables that impact whether or not a spell manifests the way that we want it to. A few points to consider: First and foremost, magic cannot defy the laws of nature/physics. So things like sprouting wings, or transforming into some other being, are not something that are possible through spells.Focus and clarity when working the spell \u2013 left unguided, magic will work in its own way and in its own time. So a vague, \u201cmoney to me on the wind\u201d (for example) could mean that you find a lost $5 bill in your pocket, rather than an actual sum of money that helps your financial situation improve. So be clear and concise when forming the intent of the spell, especially if you need specific help with something.Magic is not like what we see on TV or in the movies \u2013 there is no snap your fingers and POOF. Manifesting a spell takes work, and in general, doing something mundanely is infinitely easier than doing it magically. So (again using a money spell as an example) if you are expecting to recite a few words and suddenly have money rain down on your head \u2013 while it\u2019s not completely impossible, it would be very unlikely unless you first play the lotto, or (even better) take some other concrete steps towards improving your financial situation, such as applying for loan/grant, looking for a job, or some other sort of fundraising.So it definitely has the potential to work, but as mentioned previously, nothing is ever guaranteed. But the way I see it, can\u2019t hurt to try. ",

            "answer_text": "I've thought a lot about what is classified as magic and what is classified as science. Magic is essentially what 'science' has rejected. What science is, is commonly misunderstood. It is essentially a practice of doubt, as there is no faith whatsoever. Scientists read what people have written and constantly run tests to either prove or disprove each other. If one day the entire internet suddenly vanished, every research paper ever written burned up, and every scientist forgot what had been proven and what hadn't or essentially we had to prove everything all over again, magic and science would be one and the same. It's only when the research actually starts up again does the magic get picked from the proven. You would actually be surprised how much of what we understand about magic can attributed to psychology and confirmation bias. Someone could tell you that due to your astrological sign, your tarot cars readings, your residual tea leaves, or the lines on your palm that something very lucky will come your way. Shortly after you trip down the stairs you find a penny. It worked! Super lucky penny! Proven! Or they could tell you miss fortune is coming your way. You trip down the stairs before finding a penny. It worked! Owie stairs! Proven! This is my interpretation of this. Of course if you've heard this explanation before a thousand times and still believe this, then say hello to the backfire effect, \u201c\u2026a cognitive bias that causes people who encounter evidence which challenges their beliefs to reject that evidence, and to strengthen their support of their original stance.\u201d (The Backfire Effect: Why Facts Don\u2019t Always Change Minds). This means that facts against a viewpoint can cause people to shrug them off and solidify their own confidence in the viewpoint, which, as you may have noticed, goes hand in hand with the Dunning-Kreuger Effect. For a personal anecdote, I met someone who claimed to be a Wiccen (I only heard it pronounced\u2026). He believed it wholeheartedly, carried around a wand, spell books, and he told me all about how it works. I was interested because I am a enthusiast of magic within fiction and wanted to hear what his interpretation of magic was, and I wanted to figure out where the evidence that convinced him was. Who knows, if something has you convinced that you can do magic it must be pretty solid. The way he described it, you had to meditate for many years, understand the intricacies of each spell and you could perform it with a lot of practice, and you had to believe it really really strongly. He tried to show me but, to my disappointment his explanation to why I couldn't see it was because I wasn't believing hard enough. So it definitely might've been an emperor with no clothes deal. He also claimed it was a family thing and it wasn't just him. So me, being curious, asked his sister about it. She litterally waved it off with a \u201cpfft.\u201d I didn't really know how to interpret that aside from her making it clear that she believed it was hooey. Enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "There is a misconception that somehow we impose our will on God or the universe or other people via simply asking for it, a la prayer. That\u2019s not how it works, and that\u2019s not, in my experience, what happens. How many red lights have I pointed my finger at and said, \u201cChange\u201d with no change occurring? How many times have I hoped for a different outcome in my relationships at work, only to find that no, people are indeed, still the same, despite my silent pleadings? How often have I wanted something so badly that I was desperate for any solution, only to have God tell me no! And why? Because prayer works to align yourself with divine will. It\u2019s like Jesus said in Gethsemane: \u201cNot my will, but thine, be done.\u201d Our job in prayer is to humble ourselves to the point that we accept that will as our own, thereby changing our carnal desires to be in line with God\u2019s righteous ones. Only then do we gain peace and comfort, knowing that God\u2019s got it handled and is eager to bless us in the ways we now see that we need, rather than our selfish wants from before. It\u2019s true that most of us do not approach God in the humble, teachable way that I\u2019m describing. Nearly every pleading for the pain or violence to stop lacks this subtlety and patience. And there have been times, in my extremity, when I have cried out for physical salvation and, in His good grace, God has seen fit to answer with aid, immediately. But even then, I find that I had resigned myself to His will, even in that moment of desperation. So I pray and learn to time the stop lights so that when I point at them next time, they do change\u2014not because I have exerted power over them, but because they no longer exert power over me. I\u2019ve learned to be patient with my fellow man and understand that we are all traveling life\u2019s journey at our own pace. I\u2019ve learned to accept \u201cNo\u201d as an answer, even when the reason is not immediately apparent. All this learning has made me a better, calmer, more peaceful man, full of hope, and confident in my God. That\u2019s how prayer works for me. ",

            "answer_text": "Magic is not a \"magic pill\" that will instantly solve all your problems, and attract all your desires instantly. That being said... Magic does work, and it can change your life. Here's how... First understand that Magic is a way to \"engage\" the power of your mind, spirit, soul, and subconscious. When you do it correctly, not only does it invoke the power of positive thinking in your mind... but it creates a subconscious drive to achieve what you want. Yes...there are mystical forces at work in the universe that can help the spell get the result you want... but even more powerful is what happens inside of you. To do this...to cast a successful spell requires just 5 things. That's it. 5. If you \"get these right\" there's no end to what you can accomplish with Magic. Thing #1: Emotional Attachment It is important to allow yourself to feel full emotion for the desire you're trying to attract. The more emotion you feel and build into the spell, the better your results. Do whatever you have to do in order to evoke your strongest emotions. Thing #2: Belief You must believe in Magic with all your heart... even more you must believe that the spell you are going to cast will help you achieve the results you desire. Thing #3: Focus You must remain focused on only the single desire at hand. I never recommend trying to cast a spell to satisfy more than 1 desire at a time. You must focus on 1 thing, and 1 thing only during your spell. Thing #4: Mundane Effort Once you cast a spell, don't sit around \"waiting\" for it to bring results. You must start taking real action on your own that will bring you closer to the goal or desire. If you cast a love spell, for example, get out of the house...make an effort to smile and engage people. Give the spell a chance to work! Thing #5: Let It Go Don't obsess on \"when\" the spell will bring results... or how quickly things will start to change. It's best for you to simply forget about the spell, and move on with your life in a positive way. If you continue to think, think, think, you'll hold back some of the energy from the spell. Follow these 5 Magic Keys every time you cast a spell and I know you'll find success. :) ",

Well that right there is magic. If you believe in \u2018Karma\u2019, karma is magic. Look at your body. Your heart beats without you even noticing, look at the trees, they're so alive, you see them grow\u2026. Everything around you is magic. If you want something to happen and that happens.. that's magic. Let me be more scientific. You must be aware that everything is made of energy. You must've noticed that you feel good around some people and not so good around others. That's because of their positive and negative energies. If a person is sad and depressed, you'll just know that by standing near them because somehow you'll feel sad around them too.. same goes with happy and jolly people. Just like every physical being is made of energy.. so is our thoughts. Where do you think our thoughts go once they come to our mind? They start making little changes in our universe. Mostly people do magic without even knowing that they are making things happen. That's why everyone's always asked to have a positive mind and healthy body. Now is people can create magic without even knowing, imagine what they can do if they consciously, wilfully make something happen. Spells are intentions put into words and set out in the universe to make the wishes come alive. It's like a prayer but with forces. Spells can be good or bad.. depending about the person casting the spell. So precisely, spells are just a kind of energy manipulation, energy that every living being holds and any person can make spells and caste them in they know how to work with their energies. In the end, Yes.. spells work. They're as real as anything else in the world. And evidence, look around. . You'll find then yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they do. Actually people use magic spells for their own selfish goals and not to help others. But I will tell you one real life incident where a tantrik used white magic spell to save a child. I heard this years back from an acquaintance of mine. A worried mother once visited the chamber of a renowned tantrik. Her only son was waning day by day for no specific illness. No doctor had been able to diagnose any disease, yet the boy was getting thinner and weaker with each passing day. The mother was extremely worried that if nothing was done promptly to cure the child then he would die soon. The tantrik wanted to see a photograph of the child. When he looked at the photo he turned pale. He said that a death spell had been cast on the boy and that he was going to die the following new moon day, which was the very next day. The mother cried bitterly and requested the tantrik to save her only child. The tantrik took pity on her and promised to save her boy. He asked her to light a diya near the head of the boy the following night. The diya was to remain lighted throughout the night and should not go out at any cost for a single second. If she managed to do that, then her child would be saved. Next evening, the parents of the ailing boy lit a big diya near his head and patiently sat beside him. The diya had enough oil and a big, fat wick to last through the night. It was the month of January and all the doors and windows were tightly closed. These was no passage for any air to enter the room. Apart from the diya, a big candle was also kept burning nearby. Just when the clock struck twelve, a very strange thing happened. The diya suddenly went out. The alert mother immediately lit it again with the help of the burning candle. The night passed quietly without any further incident. The boy started recovering from the next day. He completely recovered within a few days. The following week, the thankful mother again visited the tantrik to express her gratitude towards him. What the tantrik said in reply shocked her. He said that one of her husband's closest relatives had come to him earlier. It was according to her wish that he himself had cast the death spell on the boy. That was why he knew exactly when the boy was going to die. But after seeing the aggrieved mother, he felt repentant (he himself had a boy of the same age) and decided to save the boy with the help of white magic. Hence he told the mother how she could save the boy. He also gave a kavach for the boy to wear which would save him from future black magic spells. The mother was shocked, at the same time thankful that destiny had sent her to the same tantrik who had cast the death spell and also knew it's remedy. ",

            "answer_text": "For SPELL-read personal psychology. The human mind, once put to determined work, using all the resources learned in a long stretch of experience, is pretty much unlimited! As far as any of us know, the mind is housed, or connected to our physical brain. Once a determination is made to gain something currently beyond reach; and if the Adept is fully aware of the deeper meaning of the Commitments of God (COG): Ask and it SHALL be given\u2026\u2026.; the the matter and process simply becomes a pressure upon one of the 3 COGs. (Ask; Seek; Knock on that door). A determined action towards gaining something not yet in hand, is likened to a powerful prayer in action. So what is being sought? Perhaps a targeted female returning your advances with a smile, and the subsequent opening of arms? Why the (spell)? Clean yourself up. Dress well. Behave like a believable male. Practice vocal advances. Just be yourself-present a genuine picture of self. Be ever truthful. Be reliable. Be honest. Relax! The lass has every right to tell you to take a hike! But she might not. SO-why the consideration toward a spell toward your goal? Is there no other reasonable route toward solution? A spell-possibly because you lack the confidence to tread the road toward goal, in the same manner others tread! Or a spell-because no book or human authority has the answer! A spell is part of determined action toward gaining something usually beyond easy reach. Most of life\u2019s targets can be gained with suitable work and preparation, if such targets are REALISTIC! MAGIC-the meaning of Magic is MASTERY! Magic in its higher sense concerns those matters yet to be attained or gained by one who has spent years, perhaps decades seeking answers; or the power to fully comprehend the upper levels of a subject/discipline, where such echelons are not adequately described in the Peer acknowledged textbooks. Again: MAGIC can mean-just beyond! Once, in time of wooden galleons, the ship made of iron, driven by steam instead of sails, was yet magic! Once, the evil spirits, or deadly currents of air were blamed for dangerous infection. The powers of magnification that identified lethal microbes constituted MAGIC. Magic is just over the hill! Caution! He or she who uncovers a factor sought by many, had better keep mouth shut. Post discovery should be followed by a determination of silence. The rest want the answer/s-You now have it. Seek to learn all the ramifications and possibilities attendant to the solution. Theft of intellectual property is rampant-all around us; everpresent; in an age of few morals. So your discovery transpires in a paper, by a thief who knows the system. That creature, as far as the greater world of science is concerned, is the Author! So, as a pained few have discovered, it will be an uphill grind to convince (whoever might listen) that you; who have put all the work in; are the Scholar deserving credit. Use of magic in real life: 1952\u20131995 witnesses an interest in numbers transform into a hobby; onward into a life cause, onward into an obsession; then, thankfully, back down to sanity and balance. A multi faceted instrument of 144 whole numbers stored within a large generator matrix has been designed and perfected. A second entity, 32 times the mass of the first (but only of 1/32 programming density, has been perfected and thoroughly checked. Two entities, designed side by side, and intimately connected by system and law, answers to my term: CO-DESIGN. The end result is an \u2018egg\u2019 of two perfectly balanced matrices each storing 192 whole number components. Each matrix is identical to the other. Each is capable of being driven apart by +/+ and -/- like polar fascia. Each wall is founded by 32 \u2018master components\u2019. These, together, constitute a \u2018straight edge\u2019. At this point of finality, whereby the entire operation is complete, the quest arises: how do I apply the equations on the blackboard? What I see I understand. Nevertheless, what I am looking at is theory. Only theory! A mass of white chalk on black. Eventually, I arrive at a possible solution, with, I freely admit, the help of a truly fascinating lady, whose insight was immediately and acutely tailored to my particular needs. Miracles are real!! Essential oils were the stock in trade of this wonderful lady. She proposed, that the constituent chemicals of certain oils, each with a density factor; a well defined molecular mass, and carrying an empirical atomic composition formula of Hydrogen, Carbon and Oxygen, might lead the way toward well founded application of my chalk scribbles! Each of these constituent chemicals carry a well proven healing effect upon the human system. Maybe I could determine what effects might be required within a formula; program that formula in tandem with my laws of mass matriculation; and put that formula to work. The chief target effects would likely constitute pain relief, anti inflammation and possibly kill dangerous microbes. Who would put that formula to work? The proposal would not go away! There was a foundation here, requiring more research; but light, maybe faint, had appeared. Got to work. Already early retired due to successful working life. Put myself through college to gain required Diplomas relevant to the proposed use of formula, alongside hacking away at the programming of the number compound/oil chemistry. Loved it all! So 1996-2000. All in place. Formula gained. Dips gained. Taken a small room in a business start up complex. Treated a man (the property supervisor) with desperate pain from dental abcess. He came into work on the wednesday, in order to operate computers, to take his mind off agony that the antibiotics were not even coming close to treating. His face was badly swollen. He looked awful. Wed 12 midday; jar of formula, based in gel, dispensed. Met him 8 am thur morning. He was whistling, face largely back to normal. Pain gone. Achieved in 20 hours\u2014against normal course of 3\u20136 days taken by antibiotics. GIVE OVER! But it was true. What happened to the microbes causing swelling; causing pressure upon nerves? What happened to the vessels that must have radically dilated in order to carry fluids away into the system and subsequently rid? What happened to the disastrous pain? NO ANSWERS! Later, called to the Chief Executive of the Board that manages the organisation of start up premises. He is an ex miner (coal). Working life has witnessed regular physical contortion in order to hack coal away from the face. No such thing as standing upright and free swing hammers and shovels. The eventual toll of this horrid ordeal is long term agony around and behind the shoulder blades (scapulae). Gel is rubbed into the skin above the pained area, just like previous creams and gels + injections. These have achieved temporary success only. Three treatments. Complete success. All the pain gone. Free movement of both shoulder girdles. Something carried in the gel travelled right through solid bone, and had a complete healing effect upon damaged tissues, normally beyond reach of topical (surface) medication. WHAT TRAVELLED THROUGH THE BONE, and survived intact, as if the bone itself had been lifted away to access the underlaying damage? The answers are not in any textbook written and peer passed by the scientific community. TIME FOR MAGIC. Time for quoting the COGS. Ask and it SHALL be given. I am promised by the Author of the Holy Scripture. Seek and ye SHALL find, I am equally assured. Press the questions. Write out the questions. Compose rhymes and poetry, including all salient points; learn them. Ask-Ask-Ask. Keep the pressure on. Now into deep magic, in an area not covered by approved profession print. Get out the chemistry charts covering the sub constituents in question. Work work work, pray hard-quoting the COGS. Questions transform into demands. Teach me. Tell me. Help me. I need to know what is going on. This is almost certainly physics at work. What are the laws at work? The answer, multi faceted came. I had to work. I had to wait. I had to believe. Magic brought to me what was not yet in print. Magic, in its best guise, concerns work to gain that which is not yet widely known. Between the time of outset of magical quest, and the eventual resolution, a newspaper article in the US proposed the notion that microscopic wavelength radiation could be generated by a certain blend of natural essences; and one of the benefits was the destruction of dangerous microbes. The response from an agency representing very large Pharmaceutical manufacturers was extremely vigorous; almost explosive; in rebuttal of the idea of natural essences emitting low level antibiotic radiation. The tone and tenor of the response was completely inordinate to the situation\u2014leading to the suspicion that a commercial nerve had been hit. Big Time !!! Suddenly a clue. A light now shone. So. I now know the basis and physical course, and the effects of: BIO MAGNA RADIATION. Magic eventually took its course for one who believes; one who is determined. Subsequently I saw BMR in action, right the way through to eventual and complete retirement. And I am happy. ",

            "answer_text": "That's the thing. We can't prove they work. Not at all. We can provide anecdotal evidence, we can find random, beneficial coincidences and tell ourselves this is our God/Goddess/Gods/Goddesses at work, but we can't prove anything. I follow ancient Egyptian religion. I am very happy and very devout. But I'm also a realist. Still, to get to your question... For my religious belief system only, I simply speak from my heart to my chosen patron God, Lord Wesir (Osiris), whatever I'm feeling. I don't only pray to him when I need stuff. Do you like having friends who only call you when they need something? I can't imagine a god would appreciate that, either. I tell him all the time how happy he makes me feel, how thinking of his travels across the sky in his great Sun boat during the day, and on his Moon boat through the underworld during the night, are beautiful, and how proud I am to be a spiritual child of his. Early in my choice to believe and worship him, I made a kind of pact with him. I asked him, instead of giving me a big lottery now and then lots of little calamities ever after, skip the lottery and allow me to live a basically good life. Yes, it would mean fewer ups, but it also meant fewer downs. To me, it feels worth it. As such, no doubt using confirmation bias, the placebo effect, and other self-tricking psychological assumptions, I find small good things in my life every day. Think of it like lots of tiny clouds with silver linings instead of one big cloud with a big gold lining. You could argue that as long as I don't show blind faith to my religion, as long as I admit I could be wrong and I'm imagining all of this, how can I say I'm devout? That I'm a good follower of my religious choice? Easy. I can look you (and Lord Wesir) straight in the face and tell you that even with all the evidence pointing to religion not being real, whether as a hallucination or as a false set of beliefs we tell ourselves to try to make sense of a senseless world, even as atheism gains popularity and all the Cool Kids are doing it, I still choose to worship as I do and I don't let anyone persuade me otherwise. I've got stories that to me, look like clear proof of my god's existence and love for me, but to you would look like adorable coincidence that I've taken out into insanity. What matters most is that I don't use my religious choices as an excuse to infringe upon or harm others. In short, as long as I'm not bugging you about or with my religion, I'm not really harming anyone in my beliefs. Is Richard Dawkins an amazing guy and speaker? Yeah! Is the Amazing Randi actually pretty amazing? Yeah! But I'm not up in their faces trying to push my views, nor am I setting up a booth at psychic fares, trying to defraud people of their money or belongings, so I don't care what those gentlemen would think of me if they ever eventually heard of me. I know this might've seemed long and rambling but I felt a thorough dip into the background of my beliefs was necessary so as to let you understand where my basic answer listed above, comes from. If your hope is to learn what prayers or magic spells will give you results you want without effort, you won't find that, unless the results you want are a peaceful, easy feeling. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Positive Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer in a Coronary Care Unit Population Cardiac patients from the San Francisco General Medical Center were randomly divided (using a computer-generated list) into two groups. The names of the patients in the \"test\" group were given to a group of Christians, who prayed for them while they were in the hospital. The intercessory prayer team members were chosen on the following basis: Born again Christians on the basis of John 3:25Led an active Christian life on the basis ofdaily devotional prayerfellowship in a local Christian churchMethodThe \"placebo\" group received no prayer. Neither the \"test\" nor the \"placebo\" group of patients knew if they were receiving prayer. Likewise, the hospital staff, doctors, or nurses were \"blinded\" since they did not know which patient belonged to which group. ResultsStatistics were acquired from the prayer and placebo groups both before and after prayer, until the patients were discharged from the hospital. There were no statistical differences between the placebo and the prayer groups beforeprayer was initiated. The results demonstrated that patients who were prayed for suffered \"less congestive heart failure, required less diuretic and antibiotic therapy, had fewer episodes of pneumonia, had fewer cardiac arrests, and were less frequently intubated and ventilated.\" Statistics demonstrated the the prayer group had a statistically significantly lower severity score based upon the hospital course after entry (p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis of all the parameters measured demonstrated that the outcomes of the two groups were even more statistically significant (p < 0.0001). In science, the standard level of significance is when a \"p value\" is less than 0.05. A value of 0.01 means that the likelihood the result is because of chance is one in 100. A p value of 0.0001 indicates that in only one study out of 10,000 is the result likely to be due to chance. Table from the study is reproduced below. The remarkable thing which one notices is that nearly every parameter measured is affected by prayer, although individually many categories do not reach the level of statistical significance due to sample size. However, multivariate analysis, which compares all parameters together produces a level of significance seldom reached in any scientific study (p < 0.0001). The author points out that the method used in this study does not produce the maximum effect of prayer, since the study could not control for the effect of outside prayer (i.e., it is likely many of the placebo group were prayed for by persons outside of the study). It is likely that a study which used only atheists (who had no Christian family or friends) would produce an even more dramatic result. However, since atheists make up only 1-2% of the population, it would be difficult to obtain a large enough sample size.    More on that research here:Hodge, D.R. 2007.

            "answer_text": "Magic has been the dominant model for how the universe works for hundreds of thousands of years. It is only recently in the West that we have thrown magic aside. There are still cultures now where magic and scientific materialism operate perfectly well side by side. Plenty will argue that our ancestors were just misinformed or somehow inferior. This is pure ego. Prehistoric and Ancient humans were just as intelligent as we are and used the resources at hand to solve their problems and answer important questions. Magic was used side by side with what was called natural philosophy. If you doubt the abilities of the ancients, just take a look at the Pyramids, Gobekli Tepe, Stonehenge, and other structures left behind that without dispute show advanced learning in engineering and astronomy. We still haven\u2019t figured out how the Romans made their concrete that we cannot match to this day. So before you discount magic, learn something about its history. Unfortunately, what you are probably looking for is a quick fix to your problems. Modern pop culture would have you believe that all there is to magic is wiggling your fingers and saying the right words. Sorry chum, it don\u2019t work like that. It requires practice and training to produce even minimal results. If everyone could do magic, don\u2019t you think they would be doing it? ",

            "answer_text": "(the other answers are from people who don\u2019t believe in magick so i\u2019m going to give an answer from the point of view of someone taking it seriously and studying it, you know like a crazy person would, because it\u2019s clearly not worth doing. It\u2019s difficult to understand, probably because I\u2019m too sane; Studying magick will fix that though) You can\u2019t buy spells, it\u2019s a con. magick is a system of creating connections between mental states using symbols (words, gestures or objects). Imagine , for the sake of argument, that psychotherapy works*; you couldn\u2019t cure your neuroses by asking someone else to go to therapy instead of you, and buying spells make less sense than that. It is a thing your brain has to do, it has to make connections between concepts (including big ones like God) that then change your outlook from that, you can\u2019t have someone else do that because then the associations will be theirs and not yours, and you can\u2019t affect someone else\u2019s actions/perceptions for the same reason. magick is psychology, i.e. according to (some of) the people who actually do it it is \u201cthe art of changing consciousness at will\u201d-Dion Fortune and \u201cmagick is science\u201d-Aleister Crowley (they are the same thing , it means that if something is scientifically wrong then it is also magically wrong) (older definitions (1570s/1530s) of magick say it uses the laws of nature to \u201canticipate effects which to the vulgar shall seem to be a miracle\u201d thus it is science or as they called it then \u2018natural philosophy\u2019. (where a modern scientist says \u2018it\u2019s not magic\u2019, in exactly the same way the old magicians said \u2018it\u2019s not a miracle\u2019 and they definitely mean \u2018real magic\u2019 because stage magic wasn\u2019t called that till 1801, and the book i\u2019m quoting from is about summoning spirits from 1570-ish) *yeah it\u2019s weird that i dismiss psychotherapy but believe in magick, but in my defence i don\u2019t really do either (that is, i don\u2019t dismiss psychotherapy, or believe in magick ;-) ) P.S. \u2018magical thinking\u2019 is an error (that i am slightly disappointed that i\u2019m not able to make) which involves mistaking a coincidence for a cause and effect relationship. I can imagine that it might boost to things like creativity and therefore be potentially useful but mostly I think the error should be avoided if possible. ",

            "answer_text": "In order for a spell to work you must believe in the spell. An honest practitioner of magic will tell you this. There are 3 principals at work. First is the Placebo effect. A person's state of mind and mental attitude is critical in how they live and especially how they heal. If a person believes that they can heal and recover they have a better chance of doing so. This was the origin of magic. In addition to knowlwedge of medicinal herbs and first aid the healers in ancient times put on a good show. A chant, ritual or prayer to go along with the potions could help a patient to get better. The second is Self Fulfilling Prophecy. If a person believes that they are cursed they will live as if they are cursed. They will avoid risks, they will attribute set backs and failures to the curse, they will not take responsibility for the consequences of their own actions and will not learn from their mistakes. They believe that they are destined to fail so they will not try to succeed. If a person believes that they are blessed that will live as if they are blessed. They will take chances that could lead to better opportunities. If they have set back they will try again. They believe that they will succeed and keep trying until they do The third is attribution. In normal every day Life you are going to have successes and failures, good times and bad times, good luck and bad luck. Things happen. If a person believes that they are cursed they (and the person who laid the curse or paid for it to be laid) will attribute every bit of misfortune to the curse. Bad weather today, must be the curse. You lotto numbers didn't get picked, must be the curse. The person will focus on the bad things that happen, disregarding any good fortune as normal or an anomaly. Conversely good fortune will be attributed to a blessing. Every good thing that happens is because of being blessed. Good weather, must be the blessing. Winning lotto numbers, had to be because of the blessing. Again bad luck is ignored. Placebo effect, self fulfilling prophecy and attribution is the science behind \u201cmagic\u201d spells. ",

            "answer_text": "I will answer by responding to the following given in the lengthily response by Steve Clarkson: Thing #1: Emotional Attachment It is important to allow yourself to feel full emotion for the desire you're trying to attract. The more emotion you feel and build into the spell, the better your results. Do whatever you have to do in order to evoke your strongest emotions. The Bible\u2019s answer is to seek first the Kingdom of God and all things will be added unto you. No magic or foolish trusting in the god of this world which is what you will be doing to put you trust in magic, which in fact does not exist apart from the god of this world. Thing #2: Belief You must believe in Magic with all your heart... even more you must believe that the spell you are going to cast will help you achieve the results you desire. I repeat number one. putting your belief in the god of this world, is at the expense of a relationship with your Creator God, the Father. Thing #3: Focus You must remain focused on only the single desire at hand. I never recommend trying to cast a spell to satisfy more than 1 desire at a time. You must focus on 1 thing, and 1 thing only during your spell. This recommendation takes your focus on the Kingdom Of God away altogether and puts your focus only on the biggest loser in the universe, the god of this world. Thing #4: Mundane Effort Once you cast a spell, don't sit around \"waiting\" for it to bring results. You must start taking real action on your own that will bring you closer to the goal or desire. If you cast a love spell, for example, get out of the house...make an effort to smile and engage people. Give the spell a chance to work! Again, take all your focus off of the Father god, our creator and saviour, and placing it entirely on Satan the god of this world, the creator of lies, and sin. Thing #5: Let It Go Don't obsess on \"when\" the spell will bring results... or how quickly things will start to change. It's best for you to simply forget about the spell, and move on with your life in a positive way. If you continue to think, think, think, you'll hold back some of the energy from the spell. This recommendation proves the foolishness of the entire topic. look back at first FOUR RECOMENDATIONS AND COMPARE NOW TO THIS ONE! FROM \u201cFOCUS ENTIRELY #3 TO THIS ONE? How can you both focus only on the desire and yet do #5???? Follow these 5 Magic Keys every time you cast a spell and I know you'll find success. :) Still want to stake your future on this nonsense? Or accept the offer of free salvation from your Creator God and the one who paid a huge price, greater than ever was or will be demanded for your soul, and be attached to the one who will give you a life worth living.

            "answer_text": "Yes. How they work, why, and what they can be used for is the more interesting question for a practicing occultist. I belong to the chaos magic tradition of neo-Paganism, which is apparently a term used by a couple of different groups, but in this case means, \u201cusing any and every source available, as long as what it\u2019s describing works.\u201d Theory, ritual, symbolism - we devour it, analyze it, experiment with it. Magic involves applied psychology. It is an exercise of the subconscious mind, picking up and making use of abilities we can\u2019t openly access. It\u2019s a side effect of humans being some of the most complicated creatures ever to exist, with minds that cannot be fully explained or satiated by logic. Magic is comfortable both existing and not existing, being defined as it is by the spaces between things. A house can be haunted, and a ritual to cleanse it effective, even if there is no such thing as ghosts or hauntings. All of this can make perfect sense while remaining fundamentally irrational. Being able to accept and juggle this sort of uncertainty - believing two impossible things at once, in opposition, over breakfast - is necessary to understand the use of magic in the first place. ",

            "answer_text": "The question sounds too odd.   I have no idea what made you combine prayers and spells in same question and in same way.  May be you do not have a fair idea of what a prayer and /or what a spell is. What is a prayer?  If you look into a dictionary you will see definitions like:>> a solemn request for help or expression of thanks addressed to God or another deity.>> a religious service, especially a regular one, at which people gather in order to pray together. But prayer is a lot more than this:  prayer is being with God;  spending time in his presence; listening to God; thanks giving for his blessings; and of course asking for help in need. Is the prayers answered? When you pray God He answer the prayers.  But the answers may not be very evident to all for various persons.  When you are thirsty and ask somebody for a glass of water you will understand the prayer is answered when and only when you get a 'glass of water'.  Nothing else will convince you that the request is answered.  But God has many ways of answering your prayers.  He can quench your thirst without water, and there are many other ways God can answer you.   Realising involvement of God in your life is a great experience you can ever enjoy in your life.  That is when you realize God in your life.   Then my answer to the question 'does prayers work?', yes, prayer works. Then, what is a spell? A spell, charm or hex is a set of words, spoken or unspoken, which are considered by its user to invoke some magical effect. Historical attestations exist for the use of some variety of incantations in many cultures around the world. Binding a person with a spell by the use of spoken word formulas is known as an incantation, and involves the use of evocation. I do not believe in a spell.  When God is on my side what else I should fear of? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they can you just have to know the proper way to cast them. Know the origin of magic and its energies so one may understand from where you cast it from. The origin lies within the manna pools, or as modern terminology and historical reference titles it the templar lay line theory in which they're temples and architecture is built upon. Scientific understanding of it is as follows. The center of the earths core emits a gravitational wave. This wave is transferred into sound waves as it travels through the mantle crust due to its interaction with solid matter. This sound wave can be detected at 7.85mhz. This sound wave converges with other sound waves as it nears the surface into a stream of sound wave energy that wraps around the earth intersecting like veins of the planet and breaches the surface in certain areas. These breach points are called manna pools and are the raw source of mystical energy. Within us is an embedded piece of this energy and is fused into our life force for we are born and saturated with this energy at birth because it emanates all around us in different levels of intensity. Through that innate connection within us we cast our spells drawing from that energy that surfaces in the manna pools like a loud speaker amplifies our voice, energizing our spell and molding it with our will and imagination so that it takes form. This has always been coveted and sacred knowledge only allowed to be known by the few.

            "answer_text": "I believe they do work. Over the years it started to make sense now that we are discovering certain science topics such as, quantum physics. Many believe in law of attraction and if you understand how it works on the quantum level, you\u2019ll see how a spell can manifest something as well. If you believe in the water experiment, when you give an intention to water and it will change its molecular structure, then you can understand how the objects you use in a spell.. even words and thoughts\u2026 can manipulate the world around you on the quantum level. You may not see it, but your intentions really can create a reality that you want. It sounds weird because we are so used to wanting proof we can see and hold.. I believe\u2026this is how prayer works too. Ancient cultures understood frequencies and vibrations. The Sanskrit language was created by the vibrations each word had\u2026 the word love has a harmonious vibration\u2026 the v resonates off your tongue\u2026 The word.. Hate.. has a sharp vibration that stops .. this is why we need to be aware of the words we say to one another\u2026 words have power as well. This is my theory on how a spell works.. it uses the words you say over and over to help carry the \u201cintention\u201d that you are creating to where it needs to be\u2026 and if you are really into science \u2026 You\u2019ll know that quantum entanglement may be the reason spells can be done from far away and still work anywhere. If these particles are connected and in two separate locations you are manipulating one as the other reacts. Is this too deep? Lol This is my theory anyway\u2026 researching quantum physics, law of attraction, ancient cultures and languages, and understanding the power of words. ",

            "answer_text": "That would depend on what you mean by magic spell, certainly a clever person can arrange things in the world such that someone suffers for their misdeeds. If you are asking can you passively wish for something to happen and expect it to; the answer is no. Any spell that involves symbolic gestures like dipping a crows feather into in black wax and beseeching the four winds is primitive \u201cmagic\u201d and simply does not hold up to any rigorous reality testing. It resembles \u201cmagic\u201d the way alchemy resembles chemistry. Vengeance is a dark path and the wisdom of the ages advises against it. That said, what would a true vengeance spell look like? My definition of magic requires that a spell must produce an effect disproportionate to the work involved; a vengeance spell would therefore be some subtle action one could take that would harm the target in a dramatic way. A vengeance spell would require an in-depth understanding of the target\u2019s world and relationships. The spell-caster would then look for some subtle way of undermining that world - a small lie the caster \u201clet\u2019s slip\u201d in the right ear or a planted piece of evidence are good examples of spells that could have catastrophic effects in someone\u2019s life - they are magic because of the effect does not have a constrained relationship to the work involved (like in physics). Finally, I would like state that this type of spell is black magic and I don\u2019t recommend dabbling in it. Human magic is best used to create and only in the most extreme circumstances, to destroy. In most cases, it is far better to leave the destruction to nature. Focus your creative spark on bettering yourself and let your gain be your vengeance. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of magic. If you believe that magic is an external super natural power that can be directed by a few gifted people, then I would say no. If you believe magic is the ability to consciously move personal energy to effect change in your life, then I would say yes. The trick lies in the understanding that your brain is an incredibly powerful reality generating device. When your brain holds a belief it tends to process experiences in your life accordingly. That is why, as mentioned in another answer, when you believe in Voodoo and are cursed/healed by Voodoo, you will be effected by the curse/ healing, but if you do not believe you won't be. This is very powerful knowledge. Understanding this allows you to reprogram yourself so you are not negatively influenced by superstitions, while giving you the ability to positively influence yourself through conscious change of the beliefs you carry. There are many different ways to make these changes within yourself. The fastest is self directed creative visualization. ",

A majority of the people in modern times do not believe it and the rest that do think of it as some magical switch which can be turned on to solve all their issues. Unfortunately, both of them get it wrong, because spells help to change the situation not using some magic but by gradually transforming the cosmic energy around an entity. As intellectual beings it is our duty to reason things logically before reaching at conclusions. Just because a person does not understand something does not mean it does not exist. There is a treasure trove of ancient literature which prove beyond doubt that it is possible to control energy around a person or an entity which can significantly alter their future. This same principle is leveraged to increase a person\u2019s magnetism towards wealth (wealth spells), influencing the emotional feelings of another person (love spells) and protecting a person against negative energy (protection spells). It is true that some people have exploited people who believe in them but people also exploit stock market but you still invest in it. ",

Do you shatter a glass by placing the hammer next to the glass? Do you shatter the glass by hitting the glass with the hammer and then breaking the molecular structure so that it shatters? Or do you hit the glass with hammer and let nature\u2019s laws shatter it apart? The latter is the correct way to observe magick. Simply doing a magick spell is like placing the hammer next the glass. You are the hammer and you need to move your conscious and unconscious thoughts, emotions, beliefs, actions and choices in a specific manner in order to shatter your reality and manifest the reality you desire. Magick is therefore the method used to change your conscious and unconscious actions, choices, beliefs, emotions and thoughts so that you interact with the laws of the universe in the correct manner to bring your desire into reality. So you don\u2019t need energy, charging, repeating mantras and anything but yourself to bring your desires into reality. Therefore, magick is really just creative self hypnosis. Understand that summoning demons, angels, genies, gods, goddesses, using energy, crystals among other things are not real. They represent the parts of you that you want to change. Hope this helps broaden your understanding. ",

Most academic studies of magic generally agree on the definition of magic to be \u201cThe ability to effect reality, by force of will.\u201d Or \u201cMagic is the Science of Forbidden or Unexplained Forces.\u201d If we can agree on the former, then in my opinion, and study, \u201cNo.\u201d There is really no proof that the human mind can truly effect things around it by sheer force of will. However, I find this definition to be more akin to \u201cPsychic Abilities\u201d If we go with the latter, well, that really could mean anything - a lot of science is and has always been\u2026and will always be, Unknown - we learn as we can. And Forbidden in a useless adjective in such a discussion. Other definitions, like Druidism and Wicca, regard Magic in much the same way as Christians, Jews, Islams, etc. believe in prayer. Whereas a Christian for example may pray to Jesus for something to happen. A Wiccan might \u201ccast a spell\u201d to have something happen. Same thing, different names and rituals. As a scientist and agnostic, I\u2019ve seen very little that can\u2019t be explained using Occam\u2019s Razor. ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of reasons why people may believe in spells. Some may have been brought up understanding the power of magic, and others may have had some great experiences with it. Others might believe because they wish it to be true, or because they tend to be optimistic and adventurous. Yes, spells do work - but not every spell, and not all the time. It requires the right caster, the right spell and the right situation. Some spells demand you use dozens of hard-to-find ingredients, complicated chants or recitations, or strange physical positions, and all of these can trip you up. Other spells need to be performed only on a specific day, at a certain time, during a specific moon phase or season. If you find your spell doesn\u2019t succeed, make sure it was followed precisely to the letter. If someone can\u2019t work a particular spell, it doesn\u2019t necessary mean the spell is bad, only that the caster failed. How well it works depends on the caster\u2019s strength, focus and experience, among other things. ",

            "answer_text": "If they dont exist, or if existing spells dont work, what was I dooing for my entire life?Have I been hallucinating for 26 years and counting? Is any magic spell I have actually seen working just a combination of a hallucination and some wierd coincedences? Every single time, despite the odds? Have I wasted my entire life?What authority does anyone have to tell me that what I experience, see, hear and do for just about every day of my life just does not exist?Yet this is exactly what I experience other people dooing. Yes, there is no scientific, empirical proof to it. Simply because that is not possible. Let me explain: By definition, science examines stuff that follows the law of causality, meaning that anything that doesnt follow it is either a mesurement error, a coincedence (something that just so happens to appear to be related but actually isnt), or placebo (meaning that it only works because one believes that it works). The Placebo effect is confirmed, but there is no solid explanation on how it works. No paranormal phenomenon can ever be confirmed paranormal by science because of this definition.Either you find a causal connection, which means that it is natural, or you dont, and then you just have two unrelated events, and still no magic. And there is no statistics on how often the desired outcome actually occurs, even if its a week, a month or a year later. (and as far as I know, it would be just about impossible to legally gather that data)So no, there is no proof for magic, and as long as no one dedicates himself with a huge amout of money and goes beyond what the law allowes, there wont ever be. And that will most probably not even be considered proof because all it would offer is how frequent certain coincedences are. ",

And they\u2019re real in the sense that some people believe they have been helped, harmed, or otherwise affected by a magic spell of known or unknown origin. But, magic spells are not currently understood to be \u201creal\u201d in the sense that they actually work. I could try to explain this with science, but it might not be effective. After all, if you don\u2019t know much about either magic or science, they might share a lot of similarities: they\u2019re both a small collection of principles that purport to explain a large collection of phenomena, and they do so in arcane or inscrutable ways. To a novice in both subjects, it\u2019s not necessarily clear how to decide that one is better than the other without some serious study.

Nothing goes \u201cpoof,\u201d and it\u2019s not like \u201cThe Craft\u201d or anything like that. I have used spells successfully to get money I needed or to manifest vacations I wanted, business opportunities, etc. They worked quite well. It\u2019s a skill, not a repeatable thing that can be scientifically proven, though Quantum Theory explains how manifestation can occur. To Read: \u201cPsychic Self-Defense,\u201d by Kerr Cuhulain He goes into some good detail about how spell craft can be scientifically deconstructed. ",

I also have my BA in psychology and furthering my education with it. I think psychology and magick go together perfectly. If I perform a spell, I believe it works, therefore it works. In my view, its truly and example of mind over matter. We can accomplish amazing feats as humans, things outside of the realm of science. An example of this is hysterical strength. This is when a serious life and death situation can cause humans to accomplish feats outside of the realm of what\u2019s humanly possible. The example everybody thinks of is a mother lifting a car off of her children to save them. Events such as this don\u2019t habe any scientific reason for them to be feasible, yet they are. C I apply this same thinking to magick. Our minds are powerful, and we can will things into existence. I see it as a mind over matter phenomenon. It exists because I want it to and believe it to exist. Channeling my energy in a ritual helps produce the result in foing for because I believe it will. ",

It also depends on whether or not I am casting magick for myself or another person. In general, magick performed for someone else is less likely to be effective because success depends on having a personal emotional connection to the outcome you are trying to achieve. I have cast spells on occasion for people close to me, but they only work if I personally give a shit about the outcome- for example, protecting a dear friend from abuse, or helping my child overcome an illness, etc. I suggest staying away from people who claim to be spellcasters for hire, especially on the internet performing for strangers. They are mostly charlatans. I will, however, teach you how to cast spells for yourself that will work. ",

So, the conumdrum is this: spells of some kind work for some people who are going to be highly motivated to keep that quiet and/or misdirect the world OR no they don\u2019t and the ones that claim otherwise have a collection of reasons for making this claim that don\u2019t include their spells working. If I said I did magic spells and they worked, the chances are very high that I\u2019ve got other issues (other kinds of spells perhaps) going on and the least of my troubles is actual working magic powers :P.

            "answer_text": "Very important and interesting question. I'll reformat the question: will the prayers work if their format was changed? Muslims believe that the answer is no. I'll not provide the proofs, but will give you the chain of proofs that results in that answer: God exists God is perfectA perfect being would only do perfect thingsThe way Quran and Hadith tells us to do prayers is perfectIf they were changed in the slightest, they would no longer be perfectIf they were not perfect, they might have less effect (at the best) or no effect at all. Most scholars tend to believe its the latter. If you shoot an arrow imperfectly, it will just not hit the target. They might give you some score for it, but it hasn't hit its target and you haven't done what you wanted to.Keep in mind that Muslims also believe that cause and effects are real in this world, i.e when you do something, God does not choose to give you a reward, but the reward is the actual result of the action. It is not something God decides to give you. Heaven and hell are not decisions of God on individuals, but the actual results of their actions. So prayer also works in that way, a proper (correct) prayer, will make a result, that is corresponding with what God has told us, but an invalid prayer will most likely not have that effect. ",

Go back 200 years, and take all the telecommunications and information infrastructure with you, and make a video call  on your cell phone to someone you brought with you.  Congratulations, everyone around you thinks you've managed to cast a magic summoning spell to summon an image of a person to communicate with you. Magic in the fantasy sense you're thinking of has never been real.  It has always been trickery mixed with science unknown to the majority, but understood by the \"magicians.\"  Explosive powder, mix of acids to dissolve gold and deposit gold films on lead, electrostatic effects, etc. So whenever you say \"Hey Siri,\" that's the start of magic words to a spell that summons information.

By their definition anything that works isn't really magic, because magic doesn't work.  If you do a spell for rain and it rains did your spell work?  Obviously it did. Would it have rained without your spell.  Maybe.  I can't make it rain at my will.  But I can't always get my computer to work either, that doesn't prove that pushing the buttons on my computer has no effect.  Science really doesn't have all the answers, even if some people think it does. ",

Because such things as \"spells\", curses and the like, works by growing in the imagination of the reciever, and in worst case induce anxiety attacks, insomnia and thus bad health. I.e. curses can act very strongly on people who believe in their effectiveness! While others, like me, who consider curses, spells, etc. as harmless superstition, laugh a little and shrug. Why do people believe in curses? ",

            "answer_text": "I start with the statement that I'm an atheist, but at the same time add that I don't give you an atheist Pavlov reaction to this type of question. I believe that spells and prayer DO work, but the explanation is psychological instead of supernatural. It is similar to the famous placebo effect. This means that prayers and spells are only effective in situations where the target of the prayer or spell is aware of it and if the subject matter is sensitive to psychological influences.Praying that your dog may come back to life is useless. Casting a spell on Justin Bieber is pointless. Praying for a red bike for your next birthday can help (if your grandmother knows what you were praying for). Praying to relieve your pain can help. Casting a spell on your superstitious neighbor can cause her serious problems (if she knows about the spell) Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't, .....the mind works in mysterious ways. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Magical spells have no effect. If they did, people who practice witchcraft would clean up in casinos, lotteries, etc. But that doesn't happen. In a casino, you can practice all the magic you want, as long as you don't disturb the other patrons. But if they catch you counting cards, you will be thrown out, and banned from returning. Why? Because counting cards shifts the odds just slightly in your favor. Thus it is forbidden to count cards in casinos. There is no equivalent casino rule against magic spells, because there is exactly zero instances of magic spells being used successfully to beat the odds. ",

But this can happen only with the willing cooperation of the people involved and their belief in such things. Wishes can become real with the physical action of an individual working in the concrete world to bring about what it is they wish for. Otherwise, objectively spells and wishes have no bearing on concrete reality. ",

Black magic is called that not because it is quote \u201cinherently evil\u201d it is because you are taking magic and using it for a malevolent purpose. Magic is magic, power is power. How you use it defines you. However, if that is your path, and (I must strongly advise against using such tactics), Black Magic thrives off of pain and suffering. \u201cAs within, so without\u201d, the law of sympathy. Meaning if you use it to cause harm, be ready. Not because of the law of three, but because it will change you. What you do changes you, what defines you is what you do with your gift. ",

The majority of the population are ignorant to this fact so that is why they pass it off as hogwash. Real spellwork is really manipulating energy. Everything in the universe is energy and our thoughts also have imprints on reality. Spellwork is about making a quantum shift to trigger a series of events to manifest a desired outcome. Regarding whether or not a spell will work depends on many factors, but it generally flows with what is already taking place. ",
