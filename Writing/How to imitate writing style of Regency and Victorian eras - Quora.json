            "answer_text": "First thing first, don\u2019t imitate. By all means, find a style that fits into the period you\u2019re interested in, but if you try to copy or imitate another author, it\u2019ll show and detract from the impact of all your hard work. That said: The best thing to do is to constantly read books from the period you want to emulate. I\u2019m currently trying to write a book set in the Victorian era and, if I find myself slipping into modern parlance or ways of thinking, I bury myself in Dickens, Gaskell, Eliot, Austen, the Brontes (who I\u2019m not even that fond of, lol), etc. And I don\u2019t just stop with popular authors, either. You can find plenty of old books and even magazines online (I have dozens of Victorian-era etiquette guides bookmarked, for instance). Magazines are nice because they can be a bit more colloquial and down-to-earth than many of the still-popular novels from the era. If it\u2019s your thing, you can even find some pretty low-brow surviving books and magazines (heck, I recently found a pdf of every edition of The Pearl ever published; I\u2019m not even Catholic and I felt like going to confession after reading all that). After a week or two of reading almost nothing written after the 1880s, you\u2019ll have a hard time NOT writing like a Victorian/Regency author. Language was very different back then, not just the words used but the way they were put together. In that way, it\u2019s almost like trying to write in a foreign language. And, when learning a foreign language, immersion is definitely the best way to go. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do you want to imitate someone? If you want to write in victorian era language read the most you can from that era (the less an author is known the better) and read authentic information (diaries, letters and so on). Find the common phrases, beliefs, expressions and so on. Develop your own style and simply incorporate those details into it. Usually, victorian style was quite sentimental, flowery and full of symbolisms.Regency style was even more sentimental (men cried much more often even than women), full of details about fashion (both male and female), ",
