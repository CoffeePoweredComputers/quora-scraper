            "answer_text": "I\u2019m always going to prefer a good story first, after all that is the whole point of a movie. Of course, I would love some good scares since it is a horror movie but a well done story can be forgiven weak scares. A terrible or nonexistent story, even with stellar effects and excellent scares, still poses a problem. If it\u2019s really good, sequels will probably follow, is it even possible to have sequels without a story? And once there are fans, fans require lore! What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s the backstory and where are we going with this? A few days ago, I was talking about this very thing with Jeepers Creepers[1].  Great monster, great effects and we have the  rules for the monster and the sequel is just as good and can be watched right after the first because it\u2019s like one long movie but 3 movies in and a 4th on the horizon. Some story needs to be forthcoming otherwise, the franchise will lose the fan base, they will cease to care. And the lack of a story made the missteps in the 3rd movie, unforgivable. That\u2019s also an issue of no story, in the absense of story, shortcomings are glaring. And where fans would normally make excuses for them, had there been decent lore, but because there isn\u2019t, there\u2019s just nothing to defend. The movie makers have only given us a monster, effects and kills, effectively painting themselves in a corner. Now the quality better only get better otherwise, it\u2019ll be playing to an empty room. Footnotes[1] Macabre...ish Horror Review: Jeepers Creepers",

            "answer_text": "The answer is going to be a combination of the two. It\u2019s not enough for a horror film to be \u201cscary.\u201d That\u2019s because a jump scare is among the easiest to pull off: the camera is a little off-kilter, and then\u2014BOOM!\u2014someone comes out of nowhere (which surprises the protagonist, and us). There\u2019s a clever edit, and a stern strain of violins, and the scare is achieved. Bravo. But such scares are cheap. To have a good, quality scare, the scare must come about organically, from the story itself. And then it must make leaps of unpredictability that surprise the viewer, clobbering him into submission. As I am writing this, I am thinking about \u201cLet the Right One In,\u201d one of the last truly impressive horror movies since the turn of the century. The final moments of that film, (don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t spoil anything here), are as creative and as terrifying as can be. The final moments happen organically, as a result of a powerful story where you grow to care for the two young leads. Had the movie begun on such a note, the impact would not nearly have been so strong. ",

            "answer_text": "The storyline, whether it\u2019s realistic or outrageous, I like when horror movies are psychological when you don\u2019t actually see the blood, guts, and gore. For example, Rosemarys baby, The Blair Witch project, The innocents, Jacobs ladder, the changeling etc. I find them to be the best my favorite genre of horror supernatural, occult, psychological, And always classic horror. Never got scared from Freddy, Jason or Michael. Slasher films don\u2019t do it for me. But everyone\u2019s different Try faces of Death ",
