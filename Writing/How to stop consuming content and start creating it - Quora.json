I\u2019m not trying motivational crap\u2026.I\u2019m begging you to just do it! For me when I was 5 years old I remember grabbing a partial eaten donut out of the dumpster and that\u2019s my why! I\u2019m afraid my family will ever experience that! The first thing in the morning and the last thing every night I see that one moment in time. No matter how much have\u2026the why keeps me on fire to do more! Now, it doesn\u2019t matter if you want a new house or a better cup of coffee, when your why becomes the most important thing\u2026 \u2026then the second important thing. I was blogging one day and a reader who happened to be working in the Middle East message me of being in extreme danger\u2026I used contacts that were barely internet friends to go and get him. A why. I wrote something checking my email and a person told me that they were going to end it all and my message made them stop. We got together now that person is doing better than I am online! A why. If you have kids that you want to give the world to\u2026.that\u2019s your why! A vacation you never had\u2026.a deserved why. Just to not be worried about bills is why enough\u2026 I wish you the best! ",
