            "answer_text": "Well Chennai did not destroy. The people who live in Chennai did. The reason could be many. Water bodies were plenty. Chennai was surrounded by a lake district called chengalpattu district. Which had a well networked water bodies in thousands finally draining in the sea. Earlier, The people needed so many for their farming activities. Once it was restricted to only drinking water requirements due to industrialization of the district,the water demand from individual lake has reduced. Sometimes no demand. Filling out the water body and hand over for constructing factories, government buildings became very popular. This gave scope to free land around the structure, strategically placed. These were never opposed. People were okay with it. Even today encroachment is not a political issue. But clearing encroachment is a potential election issue. Though done for a larger interest. Hence it makes political sense not to oppose encroachment. Majority of the public believes that it is the responsibility of the government to treat my discharge. This includes a simple single house to a factory that discharge millions of gallon of water. So sewage is drained by almost all into the street, water bodies etc. This endangers their survival. But we were okay with it. Earlier in chengalpattu district water will flow into a water body, sewage to the plants or to the farms nearby. Since the quantum of sewage was not large and did not have chemicals, it did not spoil the farms. Now quantum of sewage is high. Per square feet costs of land encourage people to opt for destruction. Many earned crores in lieu of conversion. So called honest tax payers were happy to buy apartments around Chennai in erstwhile chengalpattu district because they are happy with the documents of normalization of the property. Until recently nobody bothered about water conservation because it not for me to do but it is the government's responsibility to provide protected water. When you can blame the nature and make big money, water drought is a good opportunity for a big business. In democracy the majority opinion matters. Irrespective of political affiliation, educational background, economic background not many were keen to protect water bodies. Hence it became easy to target those who oppose conversion of water bodies. Since these actions have polical backing with majority not opposing this condition will prevail. This is just an evolution of the people's attitude towards water bodies. We get what we intend and deserve. ",

            "answer_text": "Does Chennai cares?http://No.Nobody wants to spoil the natural resources unless it is profitable for the concerned person.Common people don't have any vested interest in destroying the natural resources.They stand to gain nothing.Middle class people want a place to live in Chennai and want to own a house.Thats not a crime or is it? Now the Government has duty to protect the environment and water bodies.There are any number of laws and regulations for that.Butwho cares? And most important ly there's the real estate lobby and flat builders.Many If not most of them non Tamils.They have a vested interest in destroying the water bodies.ponds lakes you name it you have it.This has been going on for decades before some flats collapsed and multi story shops get fire killing dozens of people.Then suddenly the judiciary wakes up and says no more flats on the water bodies.Supreme Court repeatedly rejects any stay for high raise flats to be dismantled. The most Ironical thing is that High court building of the Madurai branch stands exactly on the spot of what was once a Lake, ",
