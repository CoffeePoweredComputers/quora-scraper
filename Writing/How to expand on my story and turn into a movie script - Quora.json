            "answer_text": "How to write scripts is tough and complex. Entire books have been devoted to writing. If you are serious about it then studying it would be an excellent first step. In a nutshell you need to introduce your character's through situation and dialog. So questions like why is her sister taking the others part? A twin? Why does she care. Who is the muderer and why did they do it? Who is sister one? Why do we as audience care? When in doubt answer the W5\u2019s (Who, What, When, Where, Why -and how) Once the characters are fleshed out you can start jamming around with the plot. What happens and in what order. It is quite often more interesting to not have everything totally sequential. You could start with the ending then show how it all happens. Or start in the middle, back up to the beginning or be all over the map. Plot twists. You need to keep the audience guessing. So the woman decides to take the others place. Comes up with a plan. Starts the plan, but something (or things) goes wrong. She fixes that problem but there is now an even bigger one. Problem, workaround, the workaround introduces two problems. The workarounds don't work. A lot of writers will come with an idea then write the ending first so they know where the story is going. A lot of writers will write each plot point on index cards and arrange them on the wall,. This allows the plot to be played with and troubleshooted. So for instance you may really like the idea of the investigator woman going into the bank earlier, but when you look at the story structure she would have not known the bank account number yet. So you either have to not make that change or write in something in to logically allow that to happen. There is a whole lot of back and forth. You will write tons of plot ideas and dialog that will by necessity thrown away. Writing is a sloppy business with a lot of waste. Do not get attached to anything you write. Keep your mind always open to \u201cWhat if?\u201d Or \u201cHow about instead of\u2026\u201d Another good writing technique is to build in some red herrings. Things that are there to deliberately mislead the audience while your main hidden story moves forward. Magicians would call it a distraction. Congratulations you have already got further with your movie idea than most movie ideas get. Keep at it. Create memorable characters and generate a plot that is non predictable interesting and varied. ",
