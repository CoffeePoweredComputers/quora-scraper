            "answer_text": "Why do we need to write a thesis paper? The short answer is that you don\u2019t. A Master\u2019s can be awarded without a thesis in some disciplines. In these instances some additional coursework and maybe a capstone project of some sort may be substituted. In those fields and in most cases you would write a thesis if you were planning to move on to doctoral studies, if you didn\u2019t want to do the extra coursework, or if you are a bit of a traditionalist. This does not explain the people who did the extra coursework and still wrote a thesis or those students who did not write a thesis and were later accepted into a doctoral program, but it covers most cases where there may be a non-thesis option. In comparison to a dissertation, which is always original research, a thesis is intended to demonstrate your mastery of the content and methods appropriate to the field in which the degree is being awarded. It can be original research that will be later revised and expanded upon in a dissertation, but it does not have to be. The average thesis is commonly between 40 and 80 pages, which makes it significantly longer than journal publication-length work, but it is significantly shorter than the average dissertation (data mined from University of Minnesota, 2007\u20132015).
