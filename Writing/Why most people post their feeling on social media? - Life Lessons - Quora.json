            "answer_text": "Why most people post their feeling on social media? People think that most of us only post our feelings because we want attention,no,a simple post about one\u2019s feelings may look normal but,they could also mean something more to the person writing the post.These are the possible reasons on why people post their feelings on social media. 1.)They need help on certain situations. Some people post on Social media because they think they need the people\u2019s sympathy,not for attention though,they usually ask for advice,forgiveness or anything that could help them go through a bad day.They\u2019re much more comfortable sharing they\u2019re feelings through social media rather than talking to someone personally. 2.)It Comforts them. Just imagine a Diary,but instead of writing it on a book,they instead post it on social media.Some People like posting their feelings to release the tension put on them.One example is when people have deppression,they don\u2019t care about the amount of likes they get,they just want to release the anger/sadness/pressure that was put on them either from Stress,Low Self-esteem,Anxiety and just pressures from every day life. 3.)Insecurity They sometimes just need a few likes to just lift their spirits up,every positive comment and every like they have makes them happy,these people are usually the ones who care about people\u2019s opinions the most,it makes them happy.These usually happen to people that just need reassurance that life is going to be fine. 4.)They want people pursuade people with their own opinion. Sometimes,people do this.They post about an occuring problem and tell their followers how they feel about it,they will want people to rethink about a certain situation and maybe,change the perspective of their viewers,it could be either beneficial or,it could just end in war.People who do this are usually writers or journalists. 5.)Attention Not surprising since many people do this so,do i have to explain? We should always rethink people\u2019s thoughts,as some could lead to bad decisions,hate or even suicide,also if you\u2019re going to comment on someone else\u2019s post,try and not to write any hate towards that person,and if you do not agree with them,simply ignore or just dislike it.We should be spreading positivity,not toxicity.Social media was made so people can express and share their daily lives. So don\u2019t spread hate. I don\u2019t think i stated my answer properly so,people who can add more suggestions and edits will be very welcome. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. NSFW. There are plenty of reasons why people put their bullshit/ feelings on display for everyone to see or hear on social media. Some might need help. ( Most of them do because they are fucked up in the head. ) Some are just getting things off their chest. And some might genuinely want others advice on a subject. But the brutal honest truth is most people post their crap for one reason usually 9/10 times. Which is this: Attention. Case in point. Look at Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith.  Red Table Talk: Jada Pinkett Smith Confirms She Had a Romantic Relationship With August Alsina Now is it really our business what the fuck they do in their bedroom? Or if they have a open marriage? Or how they were separated? No. That is THEIR business and THEIR concerns. My opinion on this? Not only do I feel Will was probably doing some wild shit himself, but this was a ploy in my opinion to get Jada back in the limelight. We all know Will is a huge star. And more than likely always will be. Jada really hasn\u2019t had star status since the Matrix sequels in the early 2000\u2019s. I mean she is known but NOWHERE near on the level as Will Smith. So to get back in the limelight, she went the Kim Kardashian route and decided to air out how she was fucking a guy around her kids age in August Alsina. Pretty fucking pathetic in my opinion. I mean she got what she wanted. To be in the news and the limelight again. But was it worth exposing shit that should have stayed private? And how about your kids and how they feel? I know I would be not only embarrassed but it would be humiliating as all hell to hear everyone from shows I watch like Corey Holcombs \u201c 5150 \u201c show to online chat boards talking about my parents sex lives to the world. Guess it shows you. Fame is a drug. Pac said it best. \u201c The one thing we all adore. \u201c \u201c Something worth dying for. \u201c \u201c Nothing but pain. \u201c \u201c Stuck in this game. \u201c \u201c Searching for fortune and FAME. \u201c Real shit\u2026 So in closing, it\u2019s mostly for attention why people post how they feel on social media. And personally, people like that you should stay the fuck away from. They usually are toxic and will always try to gather sympathy from you so you can feel sorry for them instead of just looking into the mirror and owning up to their problems and figuring out ways to change their behavior. That shit gets fucking old after a while. I mean well\u2026 but\u2026 I\u2019m colder on some things the older I get in life. Especially when it comes to bullshit like that. You can\u2019t always deflect your problems and look for people to feel bad for you. The only way to get past it is to take a hard look at yourself so you can grow and move forward with your life. Only way you get stronger in the long run. And a FYI to everyone involved: Don\u2019t believe everything you see or hear. Especially when it comes to Hollyweird. Because a lot of those cats in that game are NOT what they appear to be. I\u2019ve come to realize even people I admire ( no names. Gotta keep my fucking mouth shut on some things. And as raw as I am, that should tell you something. ) and ones you all do as well put up great illusions of themselves. I have found out that some of them are queer as hell, some are pedophiles, sex offenders, worship the devil and\u2026 I\u2019ll stop there. I want to be able to still afford a 99 cent hamburger. Won\u2019t be able to do that if I tell TOO much. But I\u2019m sure you all get the point. So like I said before and I will end it on this: It\u2019s all for attention. And I would highly suggest to ignore them. Unless they are someone close to you. And even then you might have to cut them off. Toxic people will bring you down. And do not let that happen. Because it\u2019s like the old saying \u201c Misery loves company. \u201c Sometimes you gotta be cold as a motherfucker and just cut your losses. And don\u2019t ever look back. Let them be. And just keep moving forward. Trust me. You can\u2019t save everyone. And you can\u2019t put a price on peace of mind. Keep that in mind\u2026 Thanks for reading. Take care. Peace. Bonus: Tupac \u201c Fame \u201c  ",

            "answer_text": "For variety of reasons . Mainly, emotional security. In some cases, people seek empathy and care from virtual acquittances since they ve failed to receive it from their family and friends who might have reacted with ignorance or mockery . In Other cases, as they fail to gain the appreciation and love they deserve , people tend to expose a little bit too much of their private life, inner conflicts or achievements in search of outer attention . Also , it actually depends on one 's amount of insecurity and openness . The more insecure you might feel , the more likely you are to seek others recognition and confirmation . But keep in mind : even if all the humanity has gathered to love you , you will never feel better if YOU don't love yourself . ",
