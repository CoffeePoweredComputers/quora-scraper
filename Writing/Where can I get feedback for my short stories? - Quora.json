            "answer_text": "There are many sites (like LitReactor, and ones mentioned in other answers) that have paid membership to writing workshops and communities. These sites provide expert critique on your work, and charge you for it. But if you're starting up, harsh critique from a stranger can be very demoralising. It can make you question both - your capabilities and his expertise. Not to forget, it'll cost you money. An alternative way is to make good friends in the space, as I've described in the answer here: Aniket Thakkar's answer to Are there any feedback loops to track your progress as a writer? I don't mean that you should pretend to be friends with them just so you can use them. As is with any other craft, I believe surrounding yourself with people better than you at something or people that you admire, goes a long way in helping you get better at that thing. I've never met a writer, whom I've asked for help/advise for getting feedback on my writing, and have been let down. I became friends with the people I loved reading, and then asked them how to get better. As to where to find such awesome folks? Well, Quora ain't a bad place to do that either. Follow the writers you like, comment on their posts, so that they know you really like their work, then PM them for help. It's totally worth trying. For other places, I highly recommend the people who manage, and all those who participate by posting on Lascaux Flash and The Lascaux Review | A Literary Journal  Disclaimer: I've just joined the Lascaux team a couple of weeks back, to help them in any way I can. But we don't make any money out of the sites, and I don't get paid anything to help out. I'm just trying to give back, what I've received from the community. The folks who post there, have their personal blogs, which you can follow to build relationships.  That way you'll be able to get feedback from a person you know and admire and you'd be more inclined to follow their advice. At least, that's the path that works for me.  Hope this helps. Happy writing! ",
