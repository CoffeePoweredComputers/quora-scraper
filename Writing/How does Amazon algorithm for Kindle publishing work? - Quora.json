            "answer_text": "No one knows. There are educated guesses, but Amazon keeps the details to itself so no one can \u2018game\u2019 the system. Sadly, a few people do manage to hit on successful formulas on occasion. They then charge a small fortune to teach others how and soon Amazon has to change the algorithm because the the one that\u2019s been gamed no longer works. Every time they do that, they break something else, usually the earnings of hard-working authors who aren\u2019t trying to game the system. Write a book with a compelling story or a non-fiction book that solves a problem people will pay money to solve. Have it professionally edited or at least proofread. Get a cover artist to put an appropriate cover on it for the genre, and publish it. Advertise it if you want. If your book is worthy and people can find it, you\u2019ll make a little money or a lot of money. If not, you won\u2019t. Forget the algorithm. Everyone with a theory will take your hard-earned money to teach you how it works, and a week or a month or six months later, it won\u2019t. Just write a good book. ",
