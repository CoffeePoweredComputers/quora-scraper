            "answer_text": "Some of these wrote before their big \u201chit,\u201d a few published before their breakthrough (but nothing that got real attention), and some didn't get started until their wrote their first one, and it was a big one. Because \u201clate in life\u201d meI used the Big 5\u20130 as my starting age. Ages given are the ages at which they gained notoriety. Laura Ingalls Wilder, 64, when her first in the series Little House on the Prairie was published. Had freelanced previously.Bram Stoker, 51, wrote Dracula. Had novels before this, but here was the page turner for him.Anne Sewell, 57, when Black Beauty was published and a real success. She died the next year.Frank McCourt, 66, Angela\u2019s Ashes. Not previously published, as far as I know. Was a teacher.Millard Kaufman, 90, was successful in other areas of the arts, including as the co-creator of one my childhood favorites, Mr. Magoo. But Bowl of Cherries published until he was 90. He died two years later.Raymond Chandler, 51, The Big Sleep, who made mysteries and \u201cgumshoes\u201d one of my favorite studies in college.Ther are more, but you can find them on the Internet. Many others post-30 and post-40 (Toni Morrison, George Eliot, J.K. Rowling\u2026). Then there are the Prolifics, like James Michener, who was like the Energizer Bunny (TM) into old age. The poets, like Stanley Kunitz, who won a Pulitzer at 54 and died at 100. And I didn't even get into other cultures. So, regardless of statistics, it\u2019s never too late to start or to start anew. Or too early. I understand there is a young lady of FOUR who is a published author. Thank you for the A2A! ",

From the introduction of my copy: \u201c Henri-Pierre Roch\u00e9 was approaching seventy-four when he wrote Jules et Jim, his first novel. A recollection of his youth and of his amours, Jules et Jim is written in a style reminiscent of Debussy and Ravel\u2026\u201d More on this novel: Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: Jules et Jim The secret lives of Jules and Jim  Mary Wesley, author of The Camomile Lawn. From wiki: \u201cShe wrote three children's books, Speaking Terms and The Sixth Seal (both 1969) and Haphazard House (1983), before publishing adult fiction. Since her first adult novel was published only in 1983, when she was 71, she may be regarded as a late bloomer. The publication of Jumping the Queue in 1983 was the beginning of an intensely creative period of Wesley's life. From 1982 to 1991, she wrote and delivered seven novels\u2026\u201d The Camomile Lawn on Goodreads ",
