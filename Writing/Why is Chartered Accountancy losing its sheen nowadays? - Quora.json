            "answer_text": "Disclaimer : Sorry in advance ,my answer is going to be really harsh and contain bitter truth . Below points are my personal views and in no way you may agree or disagree with same . Coming to question ,CA course has lost its sheen long way back . I will support this facts below : a) Just open LinkedIn and you see numerous posts asking for jobs posted by Fresher CA's or in some cases CA which qualified one or two attempts ago . Personally LinkedIn is a platform for networking and jobs but what irritate me is ,regular posts made by most of them and some time I find my inbox flooded with repeated messages from some of them . b) I have lot of colleagues who qualified recently or two three attempts ago and they have started practice .Most of them have opened practice out of sheet compulsion , as they initially wanted to join Job after qualification ,but fails to get as passing percentage have gone up significantly. Come on ,practice is no joke ,it requires dedication ,hardwork, dream and in no way it is your back up option ,if you have no long term plan . c) CA institute has taken few or insignificant steps to promote and reach to student or members at ground level . All I see is politics surrounding ICAI at every level . Recent outrage between ICAI and students is a recent example . That's the reason number of admission in CA course has taken a downfall in last three years . d) GST audit work being allocated to ICWA members . Personally I have no bias against any ICWA members , they are competent to conduct audits . But imagine from a point of view of CA student ,why to go for tough exam like CA ,when you can do same work when you qualify CWA exams .Plus CWA consider job experience for articleship ,which is a plus point . e) Duration of 5 years is too long in today's scenario . Further it may increase depending upon number of attempts . Plus no international taxation or audit exposure is available at time of articleship .Some CA not treating their articles or interns we'll add to the woes. Conclusion : Above are my personal views , don't take it to heart and I appolozise in advance for any person taking it in other ways . I am a proud practicing Chartered accountant and believe that if ICAI takes some steps in right direction ,then our course may get it's lost sheer. ",

            "answer_text": "It is loosing its sheen because there are politics going on at ICAI level and no body is intrested in improving course or listening to the problems and suggestion of students & member They are not updating course with time they still kept 3 yrs. Long articleship in todays digital world where any thing can be learned and searched on internet many 4\u20136 weeks courses are available in market which provide placements to students they are very far behind from reality of todays world it is very pathetic unorganised and poisonous for many students career and mental health Most of the students entering into this course about 90% are stuck at certain level or not able to pass because they have policy of passing just 10-15% students that too after multiple attempts Articleship is nothing but a smart system designed to supply cheap labour to practising members students have to compulsorily undergo training with practising members only no other option on the contrary 80% of passing students move towards industries for job but they do not have industrial exposure so get rejected at interviews and mba are given preference only 20% students will move to set up there own practise. In this articleship many students are harrased and tortured many videos available on youtube Stipend they are offering for unlimited working without any leave and mental torture and pressure is about rs. 67/ day which is less than daily wage labour that too for 3 long years which is also not paid by many After going through this rigouros articleship if you do not pass final it will be a wastage of time as this articleship is not counted as experience by any corporate or firm. Instead such uncertaininty & articleship torture student has to manage his ca final coaching & studies along with articleship The syllabus of final exam is huge that too with 8 subjects students get only 3-4 months leave to prepare for same They also have to manage 4-4 hours coaching morning & evening along with articleship of 8-10 hours then they have to take time for self study and revision also. There is no assistance or mentorship from institute at any place weather you have any problem At articleship or any other subject They do not reply on mails & do not receive your calls also You will be left on the mercy of your principle for 3 long years weather he is competent or not you can not complain everything will need his signature. They can behave the way they want Further there no college system, no sports, no curriculam activity, no presentation, no industrial visit, no alummuni network nothing is there Because of this many ca students are not seem happy or enjoying the course they are studying.they are less confident and have poor communication skills There life is monotonious This struggle does not end even after so many attempts few 10-15% who are able to clear exam many are unemployed Many are working for 20-25 k per month it is worth for only those who have established practises or are successful in getting rank or placement at campus Other courses provide more value with more certainity and less hardwork In end 85\u201390% student after spending 5\u20136\u20137\u20138\u20139 yrs will be left with tag of failure who has given all fees and did all trainings and invested their most precious career making time Those 10\u201315% who manage to pass out of these only 2% will have a good life otherwise others will have to struggle to get a job plus salary provided is also around 15\u201325 k ",
