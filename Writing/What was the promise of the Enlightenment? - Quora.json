            "answer_text": "Root cause of all human problems is the ego. This ego is not a tangible entity like the physical body but it is a set of long standing habit patterns in memory. It is very well understandable if a human being protected his physical body from all possible external physical dangers. However what is the meaning of spending enormous amount of energy in protecting a phantom non-entity, the ego, from imaginary assault? If I called you an idiot, it does not touch your physical body in any which way but your reaction would most probably be intense anger and the attendant physical discomfort, like hard breathing, chest congestion etc. etc. What is the point in ruining your health over some sound vibrations? This is our problem. We are slaves of a phantom master, our ego. Enlightenment is the clear seeing that there is no \u201cme\u201d as an autonomous entity with free will or volition but the real \u201cI\u201d is a spiritual LIGHT that is invisible, non-material, indestructible, causeless, self-luminous, self-evident, nameless, formless, dimensionless, non-local and non-temporal and it is this LIGHT that illuminates all of our perceptions. This real \u201cI\u201d is impersonal and universal and so does not belong to anybody but is most intimate and dear to all. This simple knowledge will ensure that you do not spend enormous amount of energy in protecting a phantom ego and hence live in peace, happiness and in harmony with everybody else and nature. This is the simple promise of enlightenment. ",

            "answer_text": "First if you are born and if you are exist means that you are real and that live is not some kind of illusion - the buddha never told this. What the buddha told is that our negative attitude against ourself and our environment is based on wrong views for enlightenment means freedom from wrong views, nothing more and nothing less. ",
