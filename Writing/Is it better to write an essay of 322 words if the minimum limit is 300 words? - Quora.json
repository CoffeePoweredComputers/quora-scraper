            "answer_text": "Since you\u2019ve met your minimum and there\u2019s no set maximum, you should be fine. However, you ask if it\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d to write 322 words and I\u2019m uncertain as to whether you\u2019re asking if it\u2019s better to keep closer to the minimum or go beyond. In this situation (where you\u2019ve met the minimum and there\u2019s no maximum stated) I\u2019d worry less about word count and more about word value. Have you answered the topic appropriately? Have you given answers that illuminate the topic rather than adding unnecessary fluff and padding to increase word total? If you\u2019ve given succinct, relevant answers in your 322 words, I\u2019d say it\u2019s fine to stop there. If you haven\u2019t, then rewrite what you do have or add information as necessary. ",

            "answer_text": "In about 300 is fine or maybe very good if 325 words is well stated and supported. We all tend to over speak or over write. Having a suggested or preferred word total reminds us we can\u2019t just go on and on. We must focus-say what we mean as well as we can without distracting clutter and useless filler. Use word count as you would page count-it is a quantity reference, restriction or guidance not absolute. Be forwarned: over 300 words is just that-over 300 words; therefore, being over can only be excused if justified by quality. Somethings cannot be omitted, whilst others can, and others must. ",
