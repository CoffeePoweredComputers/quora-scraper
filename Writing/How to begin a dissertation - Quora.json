            "answer_text": "If you are expected to select a topic more or less independently, you will undoubtedly engage in a period of thinking about and considering various topics. Here are some tips to keep in mind during the \"Thinking About It\" Stage:  If selecting a topic, be inclusive with your thinking. Brainstorm your ideas with your research supervisor, who will assist you in identifying \u201chot topics\u201d or \u201cburning issues\u201d in your field. Read some of the latest studies about those topics. Don't eliminate ideas too quickly. Build on your ideas and see how many different research projects you can identify. Give yourself the luxury of being expansive in your thinking at this stage \u2014 you may not be able to do this later on. Try and be creative. Write down your ideas. This will allow you to revisit an idea later on. Or, you can modify and change an idea. If you don't record your ideas, they tend to be in a continual state of change, and you will probably have the feeling that you're not going anywhere. It is a great feeling to be able to sit down and scan the many ideas you have been thinking about, if they're written down.Bounce your ideas and topics off other people. Get feedback on your thinking and suggestions for additional reading.Don\u2019t spin your wheels ruminating about the \u201cperfect\u201d topic. Some students stall out because they can\u2019t decide where to begin. If you find you are stalling out, meet with your research supervisor to regain momentum.Become thoroughly familiar with the scope of research specialization among faculty in your graduate program before deciding in consultation with your research supervisor upon members for your research supervisory committee. If you decide on a specific research topic and discover your interests aren't shared by your supervisor or other members in your graduate program, consider whether it would be useful to consult with faculty in another program.It is a good idea to take into consideration your career goals when developing your research topic. The wise graduate student examines the range of possible topics with an idea of the type of professional direction he or she would like to follow after graduation. By doing so, you have a much better chance of selecting a topic that is not only of interest to you, but also advances your career plan. Be strategic in developing your research. Consider these points when finding and developing a research topic (from Robert Smith, Graduate Research: A Guide for Students in the Sciences, 1984: ISI Press): Can it be enthusiastically pursued?Will it sustain your interest?Is the problem solvable?Is it worth doing?Will it lead to other research problems?Is it manageable in size?What is the potential for making an original contribution to the literature?Will the research prepare you in an area of demand or promise for the future?Be realistic about the time that yo u're willing to commit to your research project. If the project you'd like to do is going to demand more time than you\u2019re willing or able to commit, then you have a problem. There are strict timelines for completing a degree at UBC. Keep these in mind when you select a project. It's never too early to create a timeline for the project. Try using the 6 stages below. Put a start and a finish time for each step. Post your timeline in a conspicuous place (above your computer monitor?) so that it reminds you how you're doing. Periodically update your timeline with new dates as needed. Stage 1 \u2014 Thinking About ItStage 2 \u2014 Preparing the ProposalStage 3 \u2014 Conducting the ResearchStage 4 \u2014 Writing the Thesis/DissertationStage 5 \u2014 Sharing the Document with OthersStage 6 \u2014 Revising the Thesis/DissertationIt can be helpful at this early stage to conduct a small preliminary (pilot) research study or scholarly paper. Preliminary work of this sort allows you to test out some of your ideas and can help you gain confidence in what you'd like to do. This pilot work will also give you a chance to get closer to your research and test whether you really are interested in the topic. And, you can do it before you have committed yourself to doing something you may not like. Take your time and try it first. ",
