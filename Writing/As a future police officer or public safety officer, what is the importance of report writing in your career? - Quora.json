            "answer_text": "It is the most important thing you do, if it didn\u2019t happen on paper, it didn\u2019t happen. You want to make Supreme Court review? How many officers do you think have testified in front of the Supreme Court? I don\u2019t know of any. What does make it however is court record, and your report is part of that record. Your report has the potential of either making a future police officer\u2019s job easier or harder, depending on the decision of your case if it makes it that far. You should write a good report. And then of course it is also your memory of what happened because you won\u2019t testify to any of this in court until 6 months later, and you may forget a crucial bit of information unless it is recorded in your report. It pays to be a good writer. ",

            "answer_text": "When a police officer arrests someone, they temporarily deprive them of their constitutional freedoms in the USA. This means, per the 4th amendment, an officers actions must be reasonable in order to be lawful. Therefore, being able to write a consistent, factual, detailed, accurate report is of the utmost importance. You need to document what you did and why you did it. Your report will be your only resource for testifying about facts in a trial a year or two later. The more detail you put in a report, the better. Sloppy reports result in lost cases and great reports result in plea deals or convictions. The ability to write good reports will make your career much easier. ",

These reports are how you communicate with prosecutors, defense, courts, other Departments and agencies and the media and public will use this information. The more informative, concise and accurate the more value they have. These reports are what your testimony and even more important, your reputation and credibility are judged on. So, kind of important. ",
