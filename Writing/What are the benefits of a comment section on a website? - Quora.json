Digitally savvy users that are interacting with your content are now doing so from mobile devices more than half of the time. And mobile users love the sense of participation. If you can engage your user on a personal level and not only welcome comments/reviews but encourage them, it will do three things. it shows you have nothing to hide and are welcoming the healthy scrutiny of your users - you want to know their opinions and how you can improve your business to better serve their needs.give you some actual points of reference in terms of measuring engagement. This is a tough metric to really nail down - but the best indicators of high engagement are heatmaps, read time, shares, and comments.bring your user into the conversation. Like I said, we love participation. The more you can associate their memory of your brand with action more than just an idea the stronger their association with your brand will be.Basically, having a comment section is almost always worth it unless you don\u2019t have the time to maintain it properly or - worse - you do have the time and lose your professionalism in a comment war with one displeased user.
