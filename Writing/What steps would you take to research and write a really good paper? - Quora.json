            "answer_text": "Read, read, read a lot. Research requires a lot of reading. Reading will also allow you to self-teach yourself and recognize good writing. Note taking can help while reading (a few years ago, I started making notes on readability, not just content). Try to mimic the writing styles you liked the most - or at least test them out. You\u2019ll start to notice certain writing techniques that improve readability (e.g. a common style that you\u2019ll likely pass by is to have every paragraph have an intro and closing sentence). After that, a lot of practice. Putting together an outline (whether it\u2019s explicit or implicit) is essential. It\u2019s much easier and important to put together a cohesive skeleton of thoughts than all the details. Build the frame, and build in subheadings within each heading, and subheadings within those. As I mentioned, this can be implicit (not written down), but I don\u2019t know any good research writing that is free form (you can often tell in reading a paper that the author never put together an outline). Don\u2019t let conventions hinder your writing, but use them if they help. If you\u2019re doing scientific writing, ignore the standard conventions (Intro -> M+M -> Results -> Discussion) unless they help your personal writing style. I no longer write a separate Results and Discussion, and even the M+M blends with the R+D (this separation just doesn\u2019t work in modern Biological research), and I use subheadings extensively (e.g. including \u201cConclusion\u201d). Have an abstract. I was taught this tip by a Philosophy professor (where they don\u2019t typically have scientific abstracts). The abstract is so important, because it primes your reader for what to expect (you\u2019re not trying to tell a story - despite some people who give that advice - you\u2019re trying to emphasize some key points. So you don\u2019t need to surprise your reader), and you can also make a roadmap. (If you doubt me - ever read that paper - or see a presentation - where you have no clue what it\u2019s talking about until you\u2019re 90% of the way in? But it turned out to otherwise be a good paper or presentation? An abstract would have solved that problem.) Did I mention, practice? That includes editing, either by yourself or by as many editors as you can find. Readability and highlighting your key points are key. You want to be concise, but it\u2019s ok to repeat the same key point over and over. Keep reading and editing until it\u2019s easy to read and easy to understand. You\u2019ll pick up on tricks that make better writing the more you do this, and eventually it\u2019ll come more naturally. If you need to, take a writing class. Writing stylistically and creatively is an art and a talent. But writing well (especially in research) is a skill. Don\u2019t underestimate yourself - you can learn how to do it. (Another lesson from my Philosophy professor.) I hope that helps. Notice how few concrete stylistic elements or techniques I mentioned (besides having an outline and an abstract). Most of the skill is developed on your own. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m an academic writer. I write a lot of papers. I do a lot of research. The steps i take on my research; first of all, i make sure, i have the topic of the paper. I select the most challenging part of the paper and literally do a preliminary search to get enough information. If my materials are books, i look for the challenging part through the books. If my sources are websites, i just type the part/ the topic on my computer and go through different website to get the idea of what i\u2019m about to write. After i get enough ideas, i go ahead and write. It is as simple as that. ",
