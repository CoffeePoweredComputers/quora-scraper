            "answer_text": "It depends, of cause but I can show five examples to get some ideas. For example, Marcus T\u00falio Lyuji Murzani Tanaka has registered his name when he got Japanese citizenship as \u7530\u4e2d\u30de\u30eb\u30af\u30b9\u95d8\u8389\u738b. Marukusu is in katakana and Tulio is in Kanji which can be read like \u201cTOURIOU\u201d. \u95d8 means to fight and \u738b means a king. Since he was a succor player, a fighting king sounds very suitable for him. Tanaka was his original family name because he is half Japanese and half Italian born in Brazil. Martti Turunen was born in Finland and got Japanese passport in 1979 and became a member of the House of Councillors in 2002. His Japanese name, which was used in election was \u5f26\u5ff5 \u4e38\u5448 (Tsurunen Marutei) as he registered. So it seems he chose to keep his original family name to register. Jesse James Wailani Kuhaulua was born in Hawai\u2019i and became a sumo wrestler. His sumo name (shikona) was Takamiyama Daigorou but registered name is \u6e21\u8fba\u5927\u4e94\u90ce (Daigorou Watanabe). Watanabe was a family name of his wife. He was also popular in TV commercials and variety programs because of his character. His nickname was Jessy. Agnes Meiling Chan was born in Hong Kong and her Chinese name was \u9673 \u7f8e\u9f62 (Chan Meiling). Her husband, Mr. Kaneko is Japanese and her registered Japanese name is \u91d1\u5b50 \u9673 \u7f8e\u9f62 (Chan Meirin Kaneko). She preserved original sounds as long as possible. She was a famous singer in Japan. Some Korean people may use Japanese name. It is called \u901a\u540d (Tsumei) to avoid discrimination. Foe example a famous political scientist Kang Sang-jung\u2019s Japanese name was \u6c38\u91ce \u9244\u7537 (Tetsuo Nagano). He was born in Kumamoto Japan and his parents are from Korea which was ruled by Japan at the moment. Now he publishing his books with his Korean name to show his identity. Some \u201cconversion error\u201d occurs because we don\u2019t have L and it would be converted to R. Also every syllable ends with a vowel except N. So John Smith would be JON SUMISU. In addition, how to read Kanji is different between China Mainland (Mandarin), Hong Kong (Cantonese), Korean and Japanese. Some simply convert to Kanji or Katakana but some is named Japanese name. I think Jessy chose traditional name because Sumo is considered a traditional sports but it is kind of exceptional. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have said, you don\u2019t usually take a Japanese name unless you get naturalised, i.e., become a full Japanese citizen. Hidezumi Inoue\u2019s answer gives some good examples of how people adopt \u201cJapanese\u201d names on assuming Japanese nationality. (Incidentally, if you become a Japanese citizen you have to give up your original nationality, as Japan doesn\u2019t recognise dual or multiple nationality, but for some countries, such as Australia, your original nationality remains your birthright and you can reclaim it again on returning permanently to your country. Check with your country\u2019s immigration department.) The usual thing for foreigners to do, as others have also said, is to convert your name to katakana. Ask a Japanese friend to help you, then get some other Japanese friends to check it, because there are sometimes multiple ways to transcribe the same foreign name. Another less common method is ateji - using Chinese characters to represent the sounds of your name. Again, ask a trusted friend to help you and get second and third opinions. Since I was learning kendo, I was given the ateji \u6b66\u932c\u7537 \u201cmartial arts - refining - man\u201d, although I used the katakana \u30d6\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30f3 in everyday life. If you are going to live in Japan for any length of time beyond the tourist visa, you should pick one version of the katakana or ateji and stick to it. Although not many people do, you are actually supposed to register your \u201cofficial\u201d katakana or ateji name (and your signature). I found this out when I went to register a hanko (a personal seal usually used by Japanese people instead of a signature). Enquire at your local ward, town or city office. ",
