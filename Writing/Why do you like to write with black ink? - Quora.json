            "answer_text": "I use black ink as my all-around go-to color. It contrasts well for almost every purpose against white index cards, yellow legal pads or most everything else. Clarity is very important because I write down lots of details and I also test fountain pen nibs that I grind. I might not use a pen nearly as much as I have in the past, but I do so for at least a couple of hours on a workday. ",
