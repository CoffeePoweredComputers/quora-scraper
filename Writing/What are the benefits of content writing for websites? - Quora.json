            "answer_text": "The benefits of content writing for websites are the same as the benefits of having a website. Can\u2019t really separate the two, as a website is essentially pieces of content - written, graphics, images, vids - put together to form an online presence. Written content is your best shot at communicating to your audience what you are all about. As others mentioned in their answers, written content holds also tangible benefits such as link building, SEO and driving traffic to your website - all these important. But at its core content, like speaking, is meant for communication. So the benefit is allowing your audience to get to know you. ",
