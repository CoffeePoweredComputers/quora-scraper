            "answer_text": "How long has it taken me to write such a paper? Well, it has depended on the subject, and the eventual content. Back when the earth\u2019s surface was barely cold (in the mid-1970s), I wrote a series of articles roughly entitled \u2018Why The Soviet Union can\u2019t feed itself\u2019. The original, 4,000-word piece took a number of days, because doing research at that time was a time-consuming task, to put it mildly. Subsequent articles ranging from 750\u20132000 words, with little new material added, could be churned out in a matter of a few hours to the better part of a day. Now, were I to undertake an article of the former length (or even your suggested four-page version, how ever many words that works out to!), I could probably get the job done in half a day, including research time. But that\u2019s a guesstimate, and that\u2019s my experience \u2014 after 50+ years as a professional writer/journalist. How long would you require? Only you can guess. ",

            "answer_text": "You are not clear whether you mean 4 printed pages (which amounts to about 12 double-spaced typed pages) or 4 double-spaced manuscript pages, which translates to about 1.5 printed pages. In either case, the answer is a lot longer than other manuscripts. Both describe journals that print short \u201cletters\u201d. It is quite difficult to write such a short article because you still must have all of the elements of a paper (introduction, methods, results, and discussion), but they are very abbreviated. You often must put much of your data and some descriptions in an appendix. The article itself is really a brief summary. In such a short article, the length pressure is severe. You cannot waste any words. So every sentence and - really - every word must be there for a reason. It either directly adds to your narrative or it must be deleted. Most people don\u2019t have much experience with this type of writing, which is very telegraphic and hard to do right. ",
