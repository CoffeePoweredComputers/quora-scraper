            "answer_text": "The simple answer is none of them. Royalty means a genetic or marital tie to the King and/or Queen of England. We never see a princess or brother to the crown in Austen\u2019s novels. She had no experience of what was an extremely heady life style during her life so she would have had a hard time reproducing it with any authenticity. Your question offers up several categories of the Middle Class during the Regency period. There were several kind of landed gentry: the Middle and Upper classes, and the classes that had titles. The landed gentry, were often without titles. In Pride and Prejudice, this would include Darcy and, eventually, Bingley, as well as Mr Bennet. They all had working estates that were agricultural as well as ornamental. Lady Catherine de Bourgh also has a working estate. We do not find mentions of her even joining the ton for the London season. In Sense and Sensibility, Mr. Dashwood inherits a working estate that generate enough money for him to try to join the London ton. In saving the money for the prestige items this required, however (dowries for daughters, education for sons), he tosses out his step-mother and step-sisters, who find a quiet cottage in Devonshire that is attached to the property of Sir John and Lady Middleton. They also have a working estate but have accumulated the means to take Marianne and Eleanor to London for part of the season. But their visitors, who may be knights and marquises, are not at the top of society. The girls could only hope that, by luck, they might meat eligible men at large society dances. This is moot in any case: Elenor is in love with a soon-to-be parson, and Marianne is head over heals with Mr. Willoughby, who is a pennyless gentleman waiting for his aunt to tell what to do. Mr. Brandon, also in live with Marianne and her eventual husband also possesses a prosperous but working property. And so it goes. Sir Elliot in Pursuasion, is obsessed with the book of Piers and grovels to anyone of higher station than himself, most notably Lady Dalrymple, a viscountess. We never hear that Lady Dalrymple consorts with the London ton. Sir Elliot\u2019s middle daughter, Mary, has married into the prosperous farming family, the Musgroves. The other main characters, Captain Wentworth and Admiral Croft, have made their futures at sea. The times in which Austen wrote were such that one had to be very rich and/or well-connected to associate with the Prince Regent, who was profligate in matters of money, women, and building schemes. Fortunes were lost in an evening of cards; Mad Mary Lamb had an open affair with Sir Byron. Morals were loose at the top of the social ladder and Austen was a pastor\u2019s daughter. Her London was a stop-over with a play or a visit to her publisher. Unless you see titles beyond \u201cSir,\u201d you need to be very suspicious of how much money they had, how much interest in associating with the Prince Regent, Mary Fitzherbert (his hated wife), the Pitts or a number of prominent dukes and duchesses. Sir Thomas Bertram\u2019s money was derived from plantations in Antugua that he must personally see to. Emma Wooshouse is well-off but has no title, no inclination to leave Hartfield and its environs, and ends up marrying the very prosperous farmer, Mr. Knightley. Her fake suitor, Frank Churchill is also untitled, relatively penniless and dances to the whims of his aunt. This is not an in-depth look and I\u2019ve left out Northanger Abbey because the same principals apply. The middle class Austen wrote of, even with \u00a310,000 a year, at least oversaw their agricultural interests and derived their imcomes from them. But as for royalty, it was much too scandalous, carnal, expensive, tenuous and fraught with warring politics for Jane Austen. If you want to look at that world, read Sarah Holloway\u2019s biographies or Antonia Fraser\u2019s Marie Antionette. ",

            "answer_text": "Possibly. Gentry by the late 18th century were usually well establish families of nobility. After centuries of Anglo-Norman nobility in Britain, the connections to British royalty could be traced through any number of ancestors marrying cousin X of Edward II or daughter Y of Henry I\u2019s sister. So whilst some connections may be tenuous there was more likely than not a royal connection, particularly within the higher levels of the nobility. ",
