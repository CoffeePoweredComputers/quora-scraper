            "answer_text": "You need to argue that 30 caliber magazine clips existing is the problem? That's a tall order, but knowing the other side of the argument is always good. I do not support magazine size limits, but I understand why some people do. For the most part, ignorance about guns and ignorance about the causes of crime results in suggestions like this, which invariably end up limiting the ability for law abiding people to defend themselves, and have no effect on people who don't follow the law. However, in some very rare cases, magazine limits and similar laws have allowed for prosecution of criminals when we otherwise couldn't - but this is offset by the unnecessary prosecution of people who weren't harming anyone, and these laws are typically applied quite unfairly. So, I will not provide counter-arguments here, but I can address the specific concerns because I'm enough of an expert on guns and I know how they work, and I know what might be effective. Please understand, I do not support any of these things, I am merely providing the rationale behind it. 1. Criminals on a shooting rampage can kill more people more quickly if they use larger magazines and don't have to reload. You can't argue against this fact, and you wouldn't in your paper. 2. The number of people killed in mass shootings is the problem. If mass shooters couldn't kill so many people so fast, it would be better - fewer people would be dead. 3. Here is a photo of two ten-caliber magazine clips. They can not be modified to hold more rounds. Requiring all magazines to be made this way would make it nearly impossible to construct higher capacity magazines. It would be so hard, only criminals would go to the trouble.  4. To eliminate the ability to change magazines quickly, it is a simple modification to the gun - just replace the magazine release with a \"bullet button\" style release. A law requiring this kind of mag release would make reloading much slower - giving an opportunity to safely attack an active shooter.  Those last two points go together, so make sure you address that in your paper. Bullet buttons are worthless with 100-round magazine clips, and magazine limits are worthless without bullet buttons. Are you sure that your paper was rejected because you failed to make those points? They are pretty simple points. Maybe your paper was rejected due to poor organization or because you included counter-arguments. Include only the strong arguments for your point. Act as if counter-arguments don't exist, except in the case of point 3 and 4 - that's an obvious hole in the plan that you do need to close. Do not approach this with the attitude that \"ugh, I have to argue the losing side\" because that will come through in your writing. You need to try to win. Believe that you can. ",

            "answer_text": "Based on your clarifying statements in the comments to the question, I would suggest going right to the source for arguments.  The Violence Policy Center has all the standard arguments that can be made for magazine restrictions.  That they are specious, shallow and impractical given the existing inventory of billions (I'm willing to bet it's in the billions) of magazines currently renders any idea of making them disappear impractical, but reality has never stopped those folks before, nor are they shy about exploiting, for example,\"the public's confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus  semi-automatic assault weapons,\" (Weapons and Accessories in America). so for your purposes, the best sources are the advocates.  The VPC site has lots of links to other radically anti-gun sites, e.g. Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence which has a summary of state laws. You can also Google \"assault clip\" which was a term of art created by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence a few years ago.  The term quickly faded from currency because the gun people had so much fun with it.  Laws that seek to control human behavior by restricting access to inanimate objects or substances are doomed to failure.  Humans are intelligent and adaptable.  If they have a goal in mind, they are unlikely to be deterred from accomplishing that goal by obstacles.  If the goal is to break the most fundamental laws of God and man, a layer of paperwork or a prohibition on some tool is just another obstacle. ",
