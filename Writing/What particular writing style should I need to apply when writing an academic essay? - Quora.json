            "answer_text": "Your professor will tell you what style you should write in. For example, when I was studying for my BS in Psychology, my professors told me to write in APA style, which is used in a number of academic disciplines, including psychology. When I began work on my MA in Women\u2019s Studies, I was told to write in MLA style, which is used in a number of academic disciplines including some women\u2019s studies programs. Sometimes a course you\u2019re taking as an elective will be in a style different from your own department\u2019s style and then, for that one course, you have to write in the style your professor\u2019s discipline uses. It\u2019s complex, but your professor always knows which style is appropriate in his discipline and for the material you\u2019re studying. ",

            "answer_text": "Whatever your instructor requires, and than can vary. In grad school, I wrote an essay in a very flashy style for a course in Modernism and Orientalism. I got praise \u201cyour words have wings\u201d and told I should publish it. The next semester I took a course in twentieth century European criticism. I wrote my first paper the same way. I got a D and was told to leave the style for fiction. I adjusted my style to the dry as a bone academic style that professor liked and got an A in the class. Both. I.e. KNOW your instructor. Ask. ",
