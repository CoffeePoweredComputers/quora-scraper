            "answer_text": " Here are some 7 elements that an epic story-teller has mastered. #1 Hook them with an epic introduction I learned how to tell epic stories from a Rabbi at a ju-jitsu class that went horribly wrong\u2026 That\u2019s not true, but it illustrates the point. A great introduction presents a cliffhanger, explaining the situation without giving away the conclusion. Without this, you\u2019ll struggle to win anyone\u2019s attention, let alone keep it. #2 Vary your vocal tonality Firstly, demonstrate enthusiasm and speak loud enough so that everyone can hear. That\u2019s your bread and butter. From there, vary the tone, speed and volume of your voice. Masters of vocal tonality can make any story sound interesting. #3 Add emotion A great story is more than a timeline of events. How did the characters feel? Explain in detail. Even better, ask the listener to imagine how the characters felt. #4 Paint a picture When necessary, detail any of the five senses the characters experienced during the story. This helps the listener feel as if they were actually there. #5 Include humour I have taken stand-up comedy lessons. They teach you the basic anatomy of a joke - and it\u2019s actually pretty easy to recreate once you understand it. At its core, it\u2019s nothing more than a story with a surprise at the end. This surprise could be: the opposite of the expected outcome;a play on words;sarcasm;an exaggeration;an understatement;an absurdity.Those are the main ones\u2026 #6 A killer punchline Then the Rabbi said: \u201cNo Joe, this is jew jitsu!\u201d Just as with any joke, end your story with the surprise twist. The best punchlines are the ones you don\u2019t see coming. (Maybe that one was a bit obvious...) #7 Be as brief as necessary As a rule, the story should only be as long as the punchline is epic. The best way to ruin a story is with unnecessary details. Don\u2019t be Grandpa Simpson. If you\u2019re too anxious to speak up in group situations and start telling epic stories, check out my FREE e-book How To Conquer Social Anxiety. It explains why this fear exists and is packed with ideas to overcome it. ",

            "answer_text": " Be tangible. Here\u2019s the difference: \u201cI crawled to the shoreline.\u201d vs. \u201cI dragged my knees through the blistering hot sand until my fingertips clipped the shoreline.\u201d Which one is easier to imagine? Number two. It\u2019s hard to describe a situation with emotional details that evoke your senses without having gone through similar situations yourself. That\u2019s why we\u2019re far better at telling our own stories than others. And everyone has a story. You can even turn a simple part of your routine into a beautiful story. Maybe it\u2019s grocery shopping or something memorable your Mom said to you. Material is everywhere. How do you pull out the little emotional moments from this material? You examine every tiny physical and emotional change, then write about these changes using metaphors, similes, and emotional adjectives. Example: \u201cThe guys loved her smile.\u201d vs. \u201cHer charcoal dark eyelashes fluttered as her dimples pulled forward a smile into a half moon that made each man in the room feel as weightless as an astronaut.\u201d Sure you can focus on other aspects of storytelling such as the hero\u2019s journey, suspense, and the climax. However, those pieces are irrelevant if your story isn\u2019t tangible. To help you expand your knowledge base of similes, metaphors, and emotional adjectives, I suggest reading many fiction books, chasing life experiences, and spending a significant amount of time Googling \u201csimiles or metaphors to X\u201d and \u201csynonyms of X.\u201d That\u2019s what I did. There\u2019s no shortcut. It takes time, but everyone owes, at least, to themselves to tell their own story. ",
