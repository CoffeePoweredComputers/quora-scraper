            "answer_text": "If your aim is closure, go ahead and write the letter. It is a lovely gesture and I'm sure she will appreciate it. She may also be confused about your motive for writing to her, so make sure that you are clear on that your self. I have said that for closure this is an ok idea. But this is a very bad idea if you are expecting something in return for your nice letter. It will not erase the problems you once had which broke you up. It will also not make any dis agreements go away. All it will do is give you the opportunity to be heard. It is always possible that she will suspect that this is a attempt to get back together. You alone can judge whether that will be good or bad. In any case write the letter, and leave it open on the kitchen table for a day before you mail it, reading it every now and then. As long as you don't expect the letter is going to effect some massive change in the climate, go ahead and if it still sounds good after a day, mail it.Good day. ",

I'm certain that she'll appreciate it and it will probably result in her responding with sentiments which will also be heartwarming for you. ",

Its best to end the relationship in a civil way and then not to contact each other for at least six months, if ever. Otherwise, it could cause you to go from loving each other to being complete strangers. ",
