            "answer_text": "As far as writing goes this should also be applicable to native English speakers, but make sure you get as much practice and experience possible. You want to indulge in a variety of methods to build versatility and breadth of writing. Therefore, here are several things you can, and should do: Writing Read a lot of \u201cdiverse\u201d English texts. This includes, but is not limited to\u2026FictionPoetryProseLegal papers (such as court cases)Scientific JournalsCasual blogsAuto-biographies of prominent individualsEssentially, read as much as you can, but for betterment, I recommend looking at published works, therefore you can be confident in the quality of English used, at least to a degree. Here are some reading material I highly recommend: Poems by William YeatsThe Plague by Albert CamusBlack Boy by Richard WrightBrown v. Board of Education, an American Supreme Court case and highly interestingFurthermore, you need to practice your writing as much as possible, and have it at the scrutiny and judgement of those you believe to be better in English than yourself, so that you can receive sound feedback. Write anything you want, poetry, prose, fiction, write about your day, write about a book, anything as long as you\u2019re getting practice. However, there are several things you should emphasize in your writing, and should attempt to practice: Reading comprehension. This requires you to read a text, analyze it, and right a formulated thesis or piece about the text with viable evidenceBreadth of writing capability, meaning you can write in both formal and informal mannersGain an understanding of phrases, idioms, and the like, and be able to use them yourself, or at least understand the usageAn understanding of metaphors, simile, allegory, hyperbole, satire, etc.Speaking This is probably more straightforward, but here are my recommendations: Watch a variety of English media, to understand casual speech, but also get a grasp for comedy, or speaking patternsGet a native English speaker and talk with themThis is by far the best thing I can recommend, get a buddy, or a stranger off of some site or something, and speak with them. Learning language by immersion is the best way to learn. You\u2019ll pick up on the accent, mannerisms, annunciations, and etc.",

            "answer_text": "Speaking and writing go hand in hand. Here are 8 tips for you: Listen to English songs, movies, TV shows, News etc. Any word or phrase you come across, check it out in the dictionary or write it down. Use it whenever you can!Search for synonyms and antonyms. Eg. For the simple word 'Pretty' you can use so many other words that mean the same thing but have much significant effect than otherwise. Charming, alluring, ecstatic, gorgeous, glamorous etc are some of them. Any girl would turn into a heap of mush if she just read a comment on her social media saying \u201cWow, now that's a snazzy dress!\u201d .Talk to people and make small conversations. Restaurants, Shops, Street, neighbours, friends etc. It will help you build confidence.Search for idioms! And never hold yourself back from using them. Don't care if people look at you weirdly. Check this out! If You\u2019ve Never Used These English Idioms, You\u2019re Probably Not a Native English SpeakerTry out new hobbies! You're at an advantage if you're a reader. Books will help you as naturally as you read. Write essays, stories, rants, poems etc of different genres. Who said you have to be Shakespeare?? Write any lame rap lyric ( if you like rap songs?) Want to complain about how angry you are at something or about that dream you had last night? Write down about it and be creative! Write as if you're trying to impress a teacher!Share it on Wattpad - Stories You'll Love which is a very great platform where you can post anything and ask readers directly for critiques, suggestions and feedbacks. (Note: It's just for improvement and isn't meant to get views or popularity). I myself have found improvement in my English.Use app! I use this app called Memrise. It covers a wide range of topics that vary from idioms, to TOEFL words, to learning French. And it is pretty fun for pass time.To be honest, work more on your writing skills. You will be able to link things together and thereby help you to remember and retain better. The better you are at it, the better the output will be. So you will find yourself getting better at speaking too!All the best! <3 ",
