            "answer_text": "A hero! He freed the Filipinos from colonization not only once but twice. Unlike most Philippine heroes, he is not a soldier/warrior, he used his wit and brain to echo the sentiments of Filipinos in his novel Noli me tangere and El Filibusterismo, which eventually led to his execution which started the revolution against Spain. Spain was already losing when they sold their territories to USA.During American colonization, Americans were unsure if Filipinos can govern the country on our own. U.S. Representative Henry A. Cooper, lobbying for management of Philippine affairs, recited the Mi Ultimo Adios before the United States Congress. Realising the nobility of the piece's author, his fellow congressmen enacted the Philippine Bill of 1902 enabling self-government (later known as the Philippine Organic Act of 1902).Even after Rizals death he continued to inspire other people from other nations. Mi ultimo adios, was translated into Bahasa Indonesia by Rosihan Anwar and was recited by Indonesian soldiers before going into battle during their struggle for independence.Mi \u00faltimo adi\u00f3s was broadcasted over radio in Jakarta on Saturday, 30 December 1944\u2013Rizal\u2019s 48th death anniversary. That same day, the paper Asia Raja devoted almost half of its back page to a feature and poem on Rizal written by Anwar, accompanied by Anwar\u2019s translation.Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, has recognized Rizal as the \u201cgreatest Malayan,\u201d calling Rizal an \u201cAsian Renaissance Man.\u201dHe is a genius! Rizal was a polymath, skilled in both science and the arts. He painted, sketched, and made sculptures and woodcarving. He was a prolific poet, essayist, and novelist. He was also a polyglot, conversant in twenty-two languages.There are many things about Jose Rizal more than worthy of being a Philippine National Hero.

            "answer_text": "Original question: How do you see Jose Rizal? Answer: I interpret the question as a how-to question. It doesn't ask an opinion of how Rizal is perceived but \u201chow do you see\u201d, so the appropriate answer is thus: If you want to see him, Invent a time machine and go back in time.Go to a wax museum that has him on display. Not quite the real thing but it should be close enough.Watch a movie depicting his life.",
