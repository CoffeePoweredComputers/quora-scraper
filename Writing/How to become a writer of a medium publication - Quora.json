            "answer_text": "Publishing in India is a very chancy affair. There are regular publishers who most of the time take the risk of publishing your book at no cost to you and how they select a book is pure mumbo jumbo because whoever does has never written a book and prides himself as a wizard who knows what people read and there are self publishers who publish almost anything with a price which can vary wildly. Regular publishers are few, perhaps 10/15 and they totally publish 500/600 books a year so to be in that list is chancy, difficult and uncertain. But i know that they would be willing to publish your book under a different imprint (different trade marks owned by the same publisher) who would be publishing another 250/300 books yeah and demand upto say cost of 250 books or so. Even here you have to be lucky. The self publishers at the last count were 2000 or more and by paying there fees they will publish your book even if it is reasonably good. Most of them are rip offs, meaning they do not give you your royalties inspite of agreement or cheat you loudly proclaiming of giving highest royalties. 80 % are untrustworthy. Have you heard of Amazon Kindle? It is the book business of Amazon the world's biggest on line store. It is relatively simple to publish your book. Go to their site and register with Kindle and publish your book freely. There are a few more such sites. I suggest you try that. If you are confident write to a literary agent and their are 15/20 of them but slippery and don't even reply. Good luck, should you need more information and if I could reply I would be most happy to do so. ",
