            "answer_text": "Yes. In North America, publishers who mostly work with in the medium of prose or comics continue to have a verity of limitations and concerns when it comes to profiting off another medium. They are not the same thing. A publisher less familiar with a Sequential Art product may have a number of factors which deter them from accepting that sort of project.  It is not just bias. Though despite changing the terminology to \"graphic novel\" in order to make them more comfortable, there is still substantial misunderstanding of the difference between a the medium of Comics and more problematic presumptions of Comics as a genre. The Comics Industries own struggles with this in North America has hindered other publishers ability to accept the medium and work with it. The modern era adds additional challenges and solutions with digital formats. However, the Comics Industry infrastructure issues makes digital an opportunity for positive change and growth, while for prose it maybe less appealing. Though both have been typical in reacting to this change. From either plugging their nose and jumping in to being dragged in, kicking and screaming. The modern era has changed and increased opportunities for accessibility for both creative and audiences, it has challenged the economics of publishing. Anyone can write a book or make a comic and publish it in paper or digitally. This does not mean the distribution and retail systems are working or that the publisher is obsolete. Comics are playing catch up, having never had an era of stable non-exploitative publishing, distribution and/or retailing. Prose eras, while not perfect, have been able to grow an industry in the billions of dollars. While in North America, comics have not broken that billion dollar annual income (or we assume so, based on the limited transparency of industry data).  A \"struggling\" publisher, with limited experience working with Comics will assume not much upside from taking on that sort of project. However, they live in an era where externally and internally Comics Culture is influenced and undertaking significant change that has made it a MAJOR growth opportunity. If they do the work they once did as pioneers of the communication arts and utilize their hard earned infrastructure and experience, they could benefit from and help preserve the comics mediums more then a century old American traditions reflecting and influencing America and the world. Some Notes:  Hiring in editorial people familiar with the unique storytelling in comics. Distributing through multiple parties and not only to the limited space Marvel and DC have created to control the market place. Use their influence to encourage retail to not place comics in one section of a retail space, but with prose in like minded genres. Realize that color is not the only format comics come in. Do what most small and independent comics creators and publishers have known and done all along, publish in black and white. It looks great. Also realize colored versions are no more expensive when publishing digitally...and this is where the market is expanding for Comics readers...the distribution is less broken, not more broken for comics digitally. Push the medium to support artist and new perspectives, while providing supportive, informed editorial will result in better comics and bigger profits. Publishers understand these skills very well of course. You can pay a single person, a Cartoonist, to make a comic...or you can pay multiple people; writer, penciler, inker, letterer, colorist, ect... but there is no reason you have to pay them an unsustainable wage for yourselves or them, as long as you do your homework.",

            "answer_text": "Hey, I can answer this from a publisher's perspective: yes, absolutely they're tougher to sell. The issue is that they cost a lot more to produce. Not only do you have to pay out far more money to the creators - you're not just dealing with an author, but also with any number of artists and letterers - but you have to print four-colour insides the whole way through, instead of just black.  They're also harder to sell. The market for graphic novels is not nearly so big as the market for straight prose. So you're paying out more money, and getting less back.  In order to make the economics of graphic novel publishing work, you need to be a specialist publisher. If you are a general trade fiction publisher, you probably don't have day-to-day contact or even a contract with with Diamond, who are basically the only distributor of graphic novels who can sell graphic novels into the places where graphic novels are sold. It's not worth going to all the trouble to set up the infrastructure to sell these books effectively if it's only one or two titles a year. You might be able to make it work by being a very high-end imprint like Jonathan Cape, run by a greatly respected editor who truly loves and understands the medium, but still contained within and supported by a generalist trade publisher; but there's probably only room for one Jonathan Cape.  The fact is, graphic novels are mainly going to sell to publishers who publish little else. I've published a couple of graphic novels, but I'm not sure exactly how the economics are supposed to work when you're a specialist. Since most publishers aren't specialists, that makes it statistically unlikely.  What this means is that you need to target your efforts at the right agents and the right publishers - the people who rep and publish graphic novels. That's how you maximise your chances. ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking as a lifelong read of funny papers and \"Graphic Novel\", the most pretentious and wanky term for long form self-contained comic stories (usually in a prestige format, but hey they are on the web too...  Nowhere Girl - Comics )I'd say the imaginary battle is that Graphic Novels cots more to buy, and usually require some intelligence on the part of the reader to enjoy, so that eliminates a large portion of the market there, not for kids, older folks don't know what the hell a graphic novel is, and people are unlikely to buy a graphic novel who are not ALREADY readers of comics, except for that 1% that gets reviewed in everything like Watchmen, Dark Knight etc. But how many Watchmen or Dark Knights are there?  Oh, only those two books.  So after your non-comics reader read them, then what?  They forget comics and go back to novels and serialised TV. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope, they're not at all tougher to sell.  There is no 'issue' about whether they cost a lot more to produce or not. Graphic novels aren't books.  Just like you wouldn't take your Cessna down to your local Ford dealer for service, you wouldn't take your graphic novel to a book publisher to sell. Graphic novels are published by publishing companies that understand the medium and specialize in that type of product.  They're neither tougher nor easier to sell ... as long as you market to the RIGHT publisher. ",
