If xlrd library is not installed, you can download from here. import xlrd\u00a0Step 2 : In this step, we will open an Excel file \u201cData.xlsx\u201d in the current directory. ExcelFileName= 'Data.xlsx'\u00a0workbook = xlrd.open_workbook(ExcelFileName)\u00a0worksheet = workbook.sheet_by_name(\"Sheet1\") # We need to read the data \u00a0#from the Excel sheet named \"Sheet1\"\u00a0Step 3 : In the current example, we know that the data is saved in Column A and Column B. However, if we have to read multiple rows and columns and donot exactly how many rows and columns, we need to first obtain the number of rows and columns num_rows = worksheet.nrows #Number of Rows\u00a0num_cols = worksheet.ncols #Number of Columns\u00a0Step 4 : The last step is to parse through each row and each column and read the data in the current cell. result_data =[]\u00a0 for curr_row in range(0, num_rows, 1):\u00a0 row_data = []\u00a0 for curr_col in range(0, num_cols, 1):\u00a0 data = worksheet.cell_value(curr_row, curr_col) # Read the data in the current cell\u00a0 #print(data)\u00a0 row_data.append(data)\u00a0 result_data.append(row_data)\u00a0Credits : Stack Overflow - Where Developers Learn, Share, & Build Careers Creating Excel files with Python and XlsxWriter ",
