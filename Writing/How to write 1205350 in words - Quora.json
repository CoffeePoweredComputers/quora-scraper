            "answer_text": "One million, two hundred five thousand, three hundred fifty. Let\u2019s break 1205350 by separating every three digits with a comma, starting from the right. That would be 1,205,350. The values from the left to right are Millions, Thousands, Ones. Inside each section (between commas), the three digits are Hundreds, Tens, Ones, respectively from left to right. As we broke 1205350 into 1,205,350, we see that we have 1 million, 205 thousands, and 350 ones. One million, 205 thousand, 350. 205 has 2 hundreds, 0 (no) tens, and 5 ones, so two hundred five. 350 has 3 hundreds, 5 tens, and 0 (no) ones, so three hundred fifty. You answer is now One million, two hundred five thousand, three hundred fifty. ",
