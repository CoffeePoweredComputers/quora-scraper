            "answer_text": "Your email program, or your recipients\u2019 email apps, may be limited in the range of formatting supported, including the fonts on their system(s). (Some fonts can be embedded in the document and be installed, temporarily or permanently, on the receiving system[s]; look up \u201cfont embedding\u201d for more.) Emailing documents as attachments retains all the formatting, at least until the document is opened on the other end, at which point the opening application renders the formatting it supports and ignores the rest. WordPad reads and edits Word docs, but is quite limited in the range of formatting that it supports. As mentioned, the Word Viewer is still available; it\u2019s basically Word with the formatting capabilities removed, but reads most-if-not-all formatting. ",

            "answer_text": "Email the Word document as an attachment. The easiest way is to locate the Word document maybe by using File Explorer. Right click on the file and select Send to and then select Mail recipient. This will create an email with the Word document attached. Further comments: I like the word FREE. I usually look for and find a free solution. In this case you and the recipient do not need to buy software. Windows includes a program called Wordpad that an read Word documents. Microsoft offers a free Word viewer program which you can download. LibreOffice Writer, a free application will read Word documents and keep the formatting and will save them in Word format. I am sure there are more but this is enough. ",
