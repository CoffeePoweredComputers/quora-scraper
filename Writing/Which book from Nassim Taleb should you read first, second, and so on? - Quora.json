            "answer_text": "Having read the entire \u201cincerto\u201d all as they were published, I recommend reading them in the order they were written. The primary reason for this is because many of Nassim's ideas build and evolve from previous conclusions, and you can watch him develop and evolve his philosophy over time. You need to be with him on book one to see where's he's coming from in book two, and so on. I have a few friends who just read books from whatever is hot at the time, so they start with Antifragile, and find themselves lost and a bit jarred by Nassim's style, because they didn't adapt to it over time as it evolved. Nassim's style is not a coincidence, it is a direct application of his philosophy, and you need to grow along with him in ideas and style. Also, be sure to include \u201cBed of Procrustes\" in the list. I see a few on this thread forgot it. ",
