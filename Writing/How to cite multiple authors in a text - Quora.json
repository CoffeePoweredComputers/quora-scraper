In most standards I\u2019m aware of, after you hit four authors you use the abbreviation et. al., which means \u201cand others\u201d. So you can cite \u201cSmith\u201d, \u201cSmith and Jones\u201d, \u201cSmith, Jones, and Bloggs\u201d or \u201cSmith et. al.\u201d, where the latter case can simply be Smith, Jones, Bloggs, and Robertson, or Smith with 15 other authors.
