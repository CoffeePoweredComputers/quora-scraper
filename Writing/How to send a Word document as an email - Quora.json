            "answer_text": "12 useful answers below. Depending on your system, e-mail client and all, the most universal method is to start writing an e-mail. then select \u201cAdd attachment\u201d or something to that effect, find the doc using Finder/This computer/File Explorer/ Nautilus or whatever file finding window your e-mail client opens and click Open. You can also drag-and-drop the attachment from the Finder \u2026 onto the e-mail draft. This used to work since times out of mind and works safely till these days with any conceivable OS (not sure about Temple OS). However, and this is a big HOWEVER, be aware that by e-mailing a Word document you are at the mercy of whatever version of Word and normal.dot your recipient has installed on their comp. If you don\u2019t want any issues of the type mentioned below and MUST use Word .docx format, share the document via OneDrive (basic version is free). I\u2019d suggest both you and the recipient use Word on-line to open the document. Otherwise use some other format - pdf (but it is not easily editable) or an app that uses properly implemented ISO standard OOXML format (muktware.io) - say Libre Office .odt. This way, anyone with a comp can see your work the way it was meant to be seen. Documents created with older versions of Word may not be properly readable on newer versions of Office, or the recipient may not be able to open them at all - Word 2016 can't open older .DOC filesYour recipient may not have installed the fonts you use.Your recipient may use different coding of accented characters - you can eliminate part of the risk by using Unicode fonts (Arial or Times New Roman are safe bets).Symbol encoding may be different - usual Word trick is replacing <, >, \u2264, \u2265 characters with something totally crazy (this is at least detectable) and the Greek \u201cmu\u201d - \u00b5 for \u201cmicro\u201d - with small Latin \u201cm\u201d, for \u201cmilli\u201d, a thousandfold difference, but quite easy to be overlooked.The Developer section of Word mutates quite fast, so anything like clickable check boxes, drop down menus in tables, and the like (not speaking about macros and VBA code) created in W 2016 may not work properly in W 2013 or W 2019 editions and vice versa.More reading on possible problems here 10 reasons you should use LibreOffice and not Microsoft WordIn a nutshell, you\u2019d better not SEND Word docs by e-mail, unless you are pretty sure the recipient uses the same version of Word and the same normal.dot.

            "answer_text": "The other four answers at the time I write this are correct. I would like to clarify something however. We have gotten pretty used to HTML emails. But they do not have to be HyperText Markup Language. They could be text only. Text has no formatting. The reason to use Word (rather than notepad) is the formatting. The message could be the same, but Hello in Comic Sans font can\u2019t be done in a text message. You may have your email client set up so it shows formatting. Bold, Italic, colored, etc. That doesn\u2019t mean that you recipient(s) have HTML email turned on. They won\u2019t see the pretty formatting you spent so much time on in Word. Gmail seems to turn, e.g., hyperlinks sent as text into active links for me. Not necessarily true for everyone. Just one example. To send a formatted email so it looks something like the Word document you created, it must be sent as HTML. And the received and viewed as HTML. The reason for the creation of Portable Document Format (PDF) was so that a document would appear the same on any device on which it was read. Word documents do not have that property. (You can save a document created in Word as a PDF.) The body of a text type email won\u2019t be a PDF. It may not look the same in terms of formatting. Formatting being font, font size, line spacing, paragraph spacing, tables, columns, style, color, images, etc. If you wish what you send by email to look to the recipient exactly as you created it, send it as an attached PDF file. If you don\u2019t care about the formatting and just used Word to create something, do as the other answers say: copy all and paste. But proof it to see that nothing was changed. Adding to answers of question: \u201cHow do you send a Word document in the body of an email?\u201d ",
