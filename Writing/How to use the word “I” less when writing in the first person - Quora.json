            "answer_text": "How do I use the word \u201cI\u201d less when writing in the first person? Welcome to one of the gotchas of 1st person narratives. Rhythm and repetition\u2026 ah how they can torment! You can hide the pronouns by avoiding passive constructions, but you can also move the pronoun into the middle of the line, by leading a sentence with an action. Scan through this excerpt \u2026 there are \u2018I\u2019s in here\u2026 but they are generally sneaked in\u2026 so that you get an irregular rhythm. PRO TIP \u2026 read your work ALOUD\u2026 and when I mean aloud\u2026 get in a closed room (to avoid embarrassment) with the script in hand and a red pen in the other\u2026 belt it out. When it sounds good to your ear\u2026 it will sound marvelous to the reader. I used to be a vampire. The dark castle on the lightning struck hill\u2014short sold. The horde of cackling minions with questionable sanity\u2014laid off. The custom coffin with pry-proof lid and goth deco interior\u2014now a museum piece. Yes, the props of my blood-sucking centuries are gone. All I have left are my fangs and my title. My name is Gabriella Sarn Ariok, and I was once known as the Dragon Queen. It\u2019s a great day. The sun is out, the mountain flowers are in bloom, and the breeze is mellow and warm. I just had a marvelous dip in the hot-spring and a refreshing stroll down from the estate. I\u2019m feeling perky wearing my three-piece crop-top djinni-style ensemble, the one that got me painted for the cover of Vilf Illustrated. Things have been going my way, I am three kinds of cheerful and it would take a lot to ruin my mood. The town of Meadowshire is a cozy mountain community of a thousand or so that lives in the shadow of the Felspar freehold. Many are the times I\u2019ve enjoyed walking down its cobbled streets, haggling with the shop-keeps, sampling the local cuisine or sharing a tune or two with the local bard. The avenue lined with sturdy stone dwellings is bustling with activity, the good-wives are out shopping and gossiping, the crafters and vendors busy about their business. The mouth-watering smell of fresh baked bread and sweets is heavy in the air. Basket in hand, I step up onto the wooden walk out of the path of a dairy wagon as it rattles by. \u201cLady Gee,\u201d the driver tips his hat in passing. I smile and nod to him in acknowledgement. \u201cLady Gee,\u201d a sweeping lady says to me with a bow. I incline my head to her. Hope this helps.  ",
