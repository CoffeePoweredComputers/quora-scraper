            "answer_text": "I understand, i really do. All i wanted from life was to have children, a family, a happy family, which, of course, meant finding a healthy partner with whom to have this family. My first memories when my sister was born when i was 3\u20131/2 was that i wanted to be a mama. Most of my teen years were focused on my desire and how to achieve that. I completely understand. Many of the books i read when i was your age tended to glorify the idea of teenage mothers. Even the ones that were more realistic had a sense of romance behind them. That said, i\u2019m going to be a bit harsher with you than others: You aren\u2019t ready to have a baby. Why do i say this? Because your focus is on what you want. \u201c . . . I really want a child. I\u2019ve wanted a baby since I was a baby. I get I\u2019m young and I haven\u2019t even followed my dreams. I really want to be a mother . . . \u201d You acknowledge you haven\u2019t followed your dreams and you need to focus on school. What you haven\u2019t stated is how you, as an almost 16 year old, would be able to provide for that baby. Being ready to be a mother means that you think about the child you are bringing into the world, and how you will be able to care for that child. You have not said one word indicating why you feel you are qualified to be a mother. The books that romanticize teen mothers rarely show the reality: Being a mama is hard, hard work. Taking care of a baby 24/7 is exhausting. It is stressful It is expensive. And, if you are doing it on your own with little support, it can be very overwhelming. While many teenagers do this and make it through, most wish they had delayed it a bit longer and had a better chance to navigate the world. A baby is not just a living doll. A baby grows up. Being a mama is much more than being a babysitter or even a nanny. It is more than playing with the baby during the day. It is much, much more than just having a lot of love in your heart. From the very beginning children have their own personalities and as they grow, their own desires and ideas can be at odds with the ideas the parents have. Are you prepared for a child who is rebellious? Are you prepared for a toddler who asks \u201cWhy?\u201d a hundred and twenty times an hour? Or one who says \u201cNo!\u201d and stubbornly sits and refuses to move just as often? Are you prepared to make medical decisions? What if your child has major medical issues? Are you depending on the Gov\u2019t or some Medicaid program to fund the medical care? In the US at least, this isn\u2019t the best form of insurance and limits your choices. Where will you live? How will you support you and your child and what kind of job can you get? What will it pay? When you are working who will care for your child? Do you know the costs of an apartment, transportation, utilities, food, clothing, and childcare? How will you find a job that will cover these expenses? Many of the most difficult stories here of children who had difficult or abusive childhoods are of children who were raised by young parents who were unprepared for the reality of raising children. The stresses are difficult on people who are a decade or more older than you and more experienced and prepared. Do you know how you will respond to those stresses? Do you have the maturity to handle them? I really wish you well. I hope in time you can follow your dreams. But i hope you are able to wait until those dreams have some substance behind them and you won\u2019t be having children so young that it ruins the lives of you, your child, maybe more. Best wishes.
