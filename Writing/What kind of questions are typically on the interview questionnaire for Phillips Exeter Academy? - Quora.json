            "answer_text": "I can't speak about alumni interviews but at least when I had my interview with an admissions officer in a hotel in Denver it was much more of a conversation then an interview. I do not think that they are looking for you to answer a bunch of independent questions but rather create a natural dialogue between the interviewer and the interviewee. Expect to do most of the talking. It is to my personal belief that Exeter admission's is less about the qualifications of the applicant and more about what the applicant would bring to Exeter. No one at Exeter talks about their SSAT score, but they talk about their passions. You will likely be asked the typical questions of why a boarding school is a good fit?, could you handle the work?, what do you do in instances of failure?, and perhaps the most important one; why Exeter? I believe it important to explain why Exeter in particular should admit you as a person, not your list of clubs, or essays, or other sections of the written application, but rather what makes the whole person a good fit with Exeter.
