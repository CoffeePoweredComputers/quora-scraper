            "answer_text": "It is important that each word is legible, not necessarily neat. Don\u2019t use fancy writing in exams because it is harder for examiners to read. You need a clean, plain style for exams.Practice writing for readability rather than even letters because your hand will tire after writing solidly for a couple of hours.The examiners are used to reading untidy writing but if they cannot make out the words, they do not know if they should award points so your mark will go down. If they are sure of the words they read and it makes your answer correct you will get the marks.When I did uni exams, I spread my writing out and wrote on every second line. This allowed me to cross out words or phrases and re-write or add to my answer. It means you use more answer booklets but you can also leave a page at the end of a topic if you think you may remember something else to add, if you have five minutes at the end.Another trick is to make sure your last topic is your worst one. Since you may not have much to say anyway, it won\u2019t matter too much if your writing is bad by then.By the way in most exams you do not have to answer the questions in the same order that they appear on the question paper. As long as you clearly mark the number of the question, on each page if necessary, the examiner will know. Also, determine whether you start out at top performance level or if you warm up after the first or second answer you attempt. I found I needed to warm up on a couple of answers and was really firing on my third and fourth questions, which I kept for my best topics. Then I lost steam, so did my worst topic last and sometimes could only manage a few paragraphs and some dot points before time ran out. ",

Are you still writing, are you mid-sentence when the instructor calls \u2018 time\u2019? If you most often are, then you do need to hurry your writing. Use lined paper certainly - if not provided, ask to bring it. Experiment with different writing instruments. It's highly indivualized as to which one serves best. Roller point fine tipped markers help some people to have better handwriting. A pen and pencil called a Ph.D pen has a very thick barrel that can help handwriting for some. A regular pencil is often the least helpful but certainly try putting a gripper on your pencil to see what imoact that has if any on your rushed writing. ",
