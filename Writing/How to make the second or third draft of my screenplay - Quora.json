            "answer_text": "A2A. Look back at your notes from the screenwriting books and scripts you read. Think about what makes a script good. Compare your script to the professional scripts, in terms of format, structure, dialogue, pacing, description, action, etc. Re-read the chapters on revisions in the books you read. Read a book like Making a Good Script Great and apply what it suggests. Rewrite again and again and again until your script is as good as you think you can make it. Get feedback Do NOT get feedback on your first draft. Get feedback on your BEST draft. So where do you get feedback? You could try Zoetrope.com for free (swapped) peer feedback or pay a screenwriting consultant (like me, ScriptGal, or Screenplay Mechanic, or check Sites, Services, Software, & Supplies) or put your script on The Black List.Some screenwriting contests, like the Nicholl and Austin, also offer feedback \u2013 but you may have to wait quite a few months to get it.You could take a screenwriting class \u2013 in person or online \u2013 and get feedback from your teacher and classmates.You could form or join a screenwriting feedback co-up and swap notes with fellow writers.Whatever you do, don\u2019t be a douche about the feedback you get. Accept it with THANKS and graciously, even if you think the reader is an idiot for failing to recognize your genius. And before you ask anyone for free feedback, read this \u2013 and don\u2019t be that guy. Rewrite again and again and again Again, in between rewrites and while you\u2019re waiting for feedback, put your first script aside and work on more scripts. You could experiment with different formats (feature, TV, short, webisode, etc.), genres, and styles. Discover where your strengths and interests lie. Get more feedback; revise; repeat Repeat as needed until people who know what they\u2019re talking about (not your buddies, not your mom) say it\u2019s good, and/or you start placing in contests like the Nicholl and Austin and/or getting 8s and up on The Black List. Keep in mind that it may take years, and many drafts of many scripts, before you get to this point\u2026 if you ever do. (Most people don\u2019t.)

            "answer_text": "With today\u2019s electronica, it isn\u2019t as you need to start with a new stack of paper for the second and other drafts. But\u2026 Three ways: 1) Print your first draft, prop it by the computer, and retype the whole thing, editing as you go along. 2) Just keep revising, over and over, to reduce extra words and description and scenes until everything left is absolutely necessary. 3) Pick an edit to do to the entire script, and go through and do just that - and only that. \u201cOK, this pass, I\u2019m going to unneeded words in dialogue. Then, this pass I\u2019m going to reduce the descriptions to their bare minimum. This pass, I\u2019m going to break up long blocks of dialogue by having the other character say something in between.\u201d And so on Keep revising until you can\u2019t find anything else to add or delete. Then bring some friends over, give them drinks and snacks, and have them read the script aloud. You sit in a corner with a pad of paper and make notes. They\u2019ll go into the NEXT draft. Repeat as needed. Good luck. ",
