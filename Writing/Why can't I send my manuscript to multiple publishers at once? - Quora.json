            "answer_text": "Here is how it works: You send the manuscipt to one market at a time, and you sit on your heels and wait and get irritated, and if you are smart go write something else in the meantime, and if you are lucky, eventually make a sale with more work waiting in the queue. At is well. OR, you send it to multiple markets, and if get lucky enough to find one of them interested, you then you have to contact the others to beg off, and if one of those has gotten around to investing a considerable about of time--work time for which he or she is paid and must earn a return--he or she is going to be more than irritated. He or she, very possibly, is going to be pissed, and is going to remember you next time, may even tell his or her buddies about you over lunch or coffee or whatever. It's a small world. Or maby he or she isn't quite that pissed, but next time you send in something luckwarm, something right on the border, and he or she remembers that last time you didn't follow the rules. Maybe you were very nice about it. Maybe you apologized very sincerely. But if made an offer, he or she is going to be spending a lot of time with you and your work, and if you can't be trusted to follow a basic standard practice in the industry.... You get the idea. In this business, you need to be professional, you need to be on time, and you need to be brilliant. You can fudge a bit on any one if the others are perfect, but you have very little control over the brilliance part. ",

Then you find out, that she/he is dating twenty other guys/girls at the same time. For her/him, it\u2019s a good decision, because this might improve her chances of finding the right other. You, on the other hand, first thought she/he is only interested in you. If you find out what she/he is doing, you probably would stop dating her/him immediately. Same with business.It\u2019s all about relationships. How to:Send it to the first publisher. Call them after two weeks, if you got no answer. After one month, send it to another publisher. Repeat. OR go another route and self-publish your book. All the Best, Daniel Wieser ",
