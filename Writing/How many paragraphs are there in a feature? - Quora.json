A \u2018feature\u2019 doesn\u2019t have a set number of paragraphs, and the length of each isn\u2019t fixed either. That\u2019s because the professional rule of thumb is 20\u201325 words a sentence, and 2\u20134 sentences per paragraph. That means the paragraph length is anywhere from 40 words to 100 words. A \u2018feature\u2019 is a longer piece of writing \u2014 longer than the usual run of stories for that publication. Most usually for most professional magazine writers, the rule of thumb for a feature is between 1,200 to 2,000 words in order to be regarded as a \u2018feature.\u2019 But it could be as short as 750 words \u2014 anything shorter isn\u2019t really a \u2018feature\u2019 in most people\u2019s eyes.
