            "answer_text": "Its not just about how much you are putting down on the paper, its also about what you are writing. When it comes to literature, you should always try to offer a good, structured answer including all the necessary details, remember your answer will be examined on the basis of the quality you produce rather than the quantity. For a well structured answer you should first write a introduction followed by a discussion/elaboration and lastly conclude your answer by justifying your argument. Hope that helps. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Usually if something is worth 8 marks, it requires 8 points. E.g. Why are you a good person {4} Answer: I\u2019m smart, kind, funny, and charitable. Sorry for the bad example haha but I think you get my point. However, this also depends on which curriculum you\u2019re taking and what kind of exam you\u2019re completing. Ask your english teacher for the grade outline or look up old mark schemes! ",
