            "answer_text": "Q: What advice do the top screenwriters here have for new screenwriters? A: Yikes. I'm certainly not one of the top screenwriters here, but here's an answer, anyway. ...Hurry up and write ten screenplays.  By about the 10th one, you'll (probably? possibly?) have nailed all of the aspects of screenwriting... These things take time - and practice - and learning by trial and error, and (if needed...) error-correction. (See: Cybernetics! ie Systems Theory. - Or not, if that sounds boring.) To widen the context: My PhD research, is on: Why do 98% of screenplays get rejected, and, why do only 30% of movies that are made, break-even? e.g.: see: StoryAlity #115 \u2013 The \u201cLess-Than-One-Percent\u201d Problem \u2013 in the Domain of Movies My ongoing PhD research-blog is a summary of the answer to, that question. ie Research blog: An Index of Posts on this Blog (New to the site? Start Here!) Here's 2 x salient (i.e., salt-water flavoured) posts, if, I had to pick just 2 x advices: Advice the First: StoryAlity #8: More On \u201cThe Ten-Year Rule\u201d in Creativity Advice the Second: StoryAlity #6 \u2013 What is (big-C) Creativity \u2013 and How Does It Work? ie - I've been very lucky - and had some movies made (and, won some awards, etc) but I sure wish someone had've given me all the information in my PhD research when I was just starting out, as a screenwriter, 20 years ago. Especially the stuff on the scientific study of creativity! And, actually, on consilience. Mind you, some of that knowledge didn't exist, 20 years ago... I guess, that's the cool thing about new knowledge. (It's so shiny; all freshly-minted, and, stuff.) Another 2 pieces of advice: Advice the Third: Learn from the top-20 RoI screenwriters.  Advice the Fourth: Learn also (what not to do) from the bottom-20 RoI screenwriters...(!) - Ouch.  eg For detail, see the PhD research blog... i.e. StoryAlity. Another piece of advice -- check out this book: Scientific Studies of Cinematic Creativity and Aesthetics eBook: Dr. Dean Keith Simonton: Amazon.com.au: Kindle Store And also - especially, this one: The Screenplay Business: Managing Creativity and Script Development in the Film Industry: Peter Bloore: 9780415613330: Amazon.com: Books It's not a screenwriting manual, (Bloore 2013) but - is actually much more useful. (It shows: How it all works. Including, the latest scientific creativity research! Yay!)  And, here's some screenplay manuals: in fact, lots and lots of them...  StoryAlity #28 \u2013 Screenwriting Manuals since 1911 And - those are all the advices that I know, pretty much. PS - Also - don't ever listen when people say \"Nobody knows anything\" (Goldman 1983) as, if that's true, then neither do they, which means, everyone knows something. Some people even know lots of things... Knowledge is good. (Knowledge is: Power.) Also, Power is Power (...who knew?), and most screenwriters are somewhere below krill in the movie-industry food-chain, but - on the very bright side - there are many things you can do, to fix that. Like, say, read Bloore (2013). (That was a PhD research study, too! And: It's great.) ",
