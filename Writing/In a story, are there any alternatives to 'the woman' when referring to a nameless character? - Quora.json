            "answer_text": "Question: in a story, are there any alternatives to \u2018the woman\u2019 when referring to a nameless character. Answer: There are many possible alternatives. If you are describing her in a scene then \u2018the woman\u2019 in the background could be: a curvaceous figurea feminine forma mother with her childa member of the fair sexa mature lady in high heelsa buxom adolescentetc. etc. Clearly none of these descriptions can relate to a male. If you are reading a police report about \u2018an unidentified woman\u2019 observed to be present at the crime scene then it could read: an unidentified femalea female witnessan adult femaleetc. You may also describe her by clothing, occupation, appearance etc. For example: a mothera daughtera fashionable young ladya whore / prostitute/ tart/ lady of the night/ cyprian lady/ escort/ call girlan actressa nursea nuna waitressan equestriennea grandmothera seamstressa princessthe madametc. Again, none of these can be male. You can also describe attire and appearance or actions the shrill voiced wardenthe pigtailed observerthe observer in her sodden blousethe bejewelled damselthe authoritative damethe attentive blondethe long legged skirted escapeeand so it goes on. Any noun or adjective that almost always applies to a female can be used. Thus an adult dressed in an expensive fur with hair in a becoming chignon isn\u2019t going to be male. Above are twenty nine ways to refer to an unidentified woman without using the word \u2018woman\u2019. Was this really a question worth asking? Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "that mostly depends on your protagonist\u2019s perception of the woman! what do they notice first? her occupation perhaps? then you can use \u2018the doctor\u2019 or \u2018the businesswoman\u2019 or whatever her job is. does the woman evoke a strong feeling from the protagonist? then you can choose words with stronger connotations like \u2018the angel\u2019 or even \u2018the whore\u2019 if your story is from omniscient 3rd person pov, consider what you want to reveal and hide from your readers first before choosing the nickname. that\u2019s all I have for now ",
