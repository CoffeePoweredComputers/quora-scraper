            "answer_text": "No! Virtually every independent consumer advocate advises against an extended service contract (ESC) on a vehicle. These are not warranties. Only the manufacturer issues a warrant and only at the time of sale. One reason the consensus is to not buy an ESC is the small print. The small print is designed to limit payouts. One example is if a covered part fails do to the failure of a non covered part, the ESC does not pay. Try fighting that determination. An even more important reason the consensus is to not buy an ESC is the manner in which these ESCs are priced. The provider of the ESC employs experts who determine the expected payout for each vehicle. For example, this may be $700. The provider of the ESC will sell the contract to the dealer. The provider will add its profit. For example, this may be $1,200. The dealer will attempt to sell an ESC to every buyer. Sales of ESC provide the dealer huge profit. Many articles suggest the dealer will double or more the amount it paid the ESC provider. For example, the dealer may try to sell the ESC to the car buyer for $2,400 or more. So, in the end the car buyer will pay twice as much as the expected payout or even more. In the example, the buyer will have paid $2,400 for an ESC the experts expect will payout only $700. An ESC is a bet, a bad bet. As with all bets the odds are stacked in the house\u2019s favor. A better approach is to take the money which would have been spent on an ESC and put it aside. An ESC will likely add $50 or so to a monthly payment. Don\u2019t buy the ESC. Instead set aside $50 a month in a savings account. Most vehicles are covered by the original warranty for 36 months, some to 48 months. Putting aside $50 a month results in $1,800 being available for repairs after 36 months, $2,400 after 48 months. Over a full 60 month period, you will have $3,000 available. This money would be available to cover any repairs after the original warranty expires. Remember a 60 month ESC is only effective for 24 months if the original warranty was for 36 months or only 12 months if the original warranty was for 48 months. The benefit of not buying an ESC but putting aside $50 a month is you have the money available for any repairs. Even better if there are no repairs (today\u2019s vehicles are that good) you have the money rather than the dealer. Understand those smiling F&I managers are nothing but sales people. Their job is to sell as many products as they can to increase profit. These people are trained and armed with a plethora of word tracks and props designed to instill fear into the minds of car buyers. Be smart, just say no. Do not destroy your good deal but falling victim to the fear monger in the F&I office. ",

            "answer_text": "Please check the following\u2026 Vikas Saxena's answer to What are some money saving tips? Do not buy extended warranty! I\u2019m not sure whether people would approve of my answer for this question but believe me, this is one area where people have spent billions of dollars. An average person buys a lot of gadgets, appliances and automobiles in his life. The moment you happen to buy one, the salesman comes after your life to request you to buy an extended warranty. This extended warranty comes with additional premium a part of which goes to the manufacturer (of that item) and another to the insurance company. Just recall, how many times has it so happened that your purchased item has failed during that extended warranty period\u2026.! Almost never! On top of that (to your utmost frustration) the item fails just after the extended warranty period, doesn\u2019t it? A large percentage of people falls for it and repents later why they bought one. I\u2019m going to save you a lot of money by sharing this with you. Why I suggest not buying an extended warranty is because the failure pattern of most of these Electronic/Electrical/Mechanical items like gadgets, appliances, automobiles follows a Statistical distribution which is called the Weibull Distribution. You please do not need to get into the details of this theory. Let us try to take advantage of this. Please have a look at the distribution image below. Please do not worry, the image looks a bit formidable but I\u2019ll make it simple for you to understand. \ufffd\ufffd  When you purchase an item, its failure follows the graph as shown above. The highest Probability for the item failing is for a short period after the unit comes into use, this is depicted by the Zone A in the image. This happens because there are parts that may not have been thoroughly tested and some manufacturing defects. Then all those defective parts fail and get replaced and the item possibly functions without faults for years. This smooth running period is depicted by the Zone B in the image. Then the item reaches its lifetime end, and again probability of failure becomes much higher since most parts wear out and start failing one by one. This happens in the Zone C. Now come to the secret of the extended warranty sellers. Manufacturers offer you initial warranty till the end of Zone A which is normally called the Manufacturer\u2019s Warranty that usually comes with most of the standard items. They try to sell you the extended warranty only up to the end of Zone B (and the start of Zone C), that\u2019s it, not even a day beyond that! Why\u2026? Because they know the failure pattern of their product and they also know that giving warranty for the Zone C definitely will cost them dearly as the item is most likely to fail in that period. BUT, they are happily selling the warranty up to Zone B since they know that it is the most efficient working time for their product so they are safe and most of their warranty offers will expire without a claim. Great\u2026isn\u2019t it? Yes, exceptions never make an example and hence some items may fail during zone B also but that\u2019s highly unlikely. If you happen to be one of the victims, please don\u2019t start trusting ext. warranty again. Do I need to say now, don\u2019t please buy extended warranty and save a lot of money? Thanks for reading! ",

This can be true if we are using our a \u2018Lab report\u2019 but Usage of a car differs from individual to individual also the weather conditions and driving patterns are also different. If you are sure that nothing going to happen to your car(which may include a complete engine overhaul, you can calculate the amount:{) you may skip buying a warranty. And it's all about chances. To save ourselves from these chances we take insurance. To safeguard our businesses we take multiple insurance. Then Why not extended warranty to safeguard ourselves against any unforeseen defects in the vehicle. Hope it helps. ",
