You simply write, \u201cHey, Bro! I hear that you\u2019re struggling at your boarding school, and it\u2019s affecting your performance. How can I help? Do you want to hang out next weekend? We\u2019ll grab dinner and a movie and maybe talk about what\u2019s happening, anything that\u2019s bothering you, whatever resources you need to be successful, and whatever else I can help with long-distance. I love you!\u201d ",

They should be inquiring whether there are some support services he can get to improve his outcome. Have they asked you to write him? If you must write him, I would say something like \"I'm really sorry to hear that you're having trouble in school. Is there some way that I can help?\" ",
