            "answer_text": "When did I Write my first Poem? My introduction to the World of the Poet came somewhat late in my Life as I am now in my Twilight Years. Strangely, I never really had the inclination to Write any Poems while still quite Young! I do remember while during my Secondary School (here in the U.K.) years we were taught Poems which were by some of the famous WW1 Poets such as Rupert Brooke. There was even the Lyrics to a Beatle\u2019s Song ELEANOR RIGBY, which we read as a Poem. Beyond this, my Mind is now somewhat vague in this respect. Most of my years at School weren\u2019t concerned with Literature apart from English Language Classes with the occasional Play thrown in for extra measure. My interest was more to do with Ancient and Lost Civilisations. The thirst for Learning about the Past and not so much Poetry. My formative years from the point of view of finding my feet in a very Cruel World were passed in Questioning my Beliefs and where I fitted into the bigger Picture! My focus of interest was in the World of Paganism and Witchcraft. This was in fact how I came to Write my very first Poems. One Book in particular has been my main influence. Thanks in the main to the Pagan Witch, Author and Entrepreneur ERICA JONG. I was Mesmerised by her Writings and was very fond of her Poetry. She had this way with Words which would draw you in. Many of her Poems caught my Imagination, while others went above and beyond this! I could truly Identify with her Words and the true Meanings behind them. Strange as it may seem otherwise, I did not see as what I then began to Write as Poetry! In my Mind these were my Personal Thoughts as a Pagan whom was trying to find her place or position within this other Realm. Hence when I now look back upon this Period in my Life, I think of these early Writings as my PAGAN MUSINGS. I was to only Write 12 Poems during this time, and then absolutely nothing for 29 years! I wasn\u2019t to take up my Pen \ud83d\udd8a once more until the Spring Bank Holiday of 2015. The way in which this all happened was very Strange for sure. Prior to this moment I hadn\u2019t the slightest inkling of what was to occur. Even the Word POETRY, couldn\u2019t be further from my Mind. It\u2019s truly amazing if not weirdly Strange how FATE can sometimes change our Perception in a way which can truly change our Lives! Such a moment caused my Life to change, and overnight I became this Poet. What were the circumstances leading to this? This really all began with a Tune which was playing in my Mind. However unlike previous times when you know you should have Written down the Words before you had forgotten them, I actually did Write them down on this occasion. Before me were a form of Lyrics which complimented the Tune I was hearing in my Mind. Then it quite suddenly occurred to me that these same Words actually read as a Poem. Omg, are you serious? Within hours of this occurring I suddenly had new Verses for more Poem ideas milling around inside my brain and reached for the nearest Scraps of whatever I found to Write down those same Words before they became Lost to me. That same Year, 2015 I had Penned 20 new and original Poems, and the remainder as they say is History. I truly believe that my MUSE was and still is my Inspiration.  \u00a7 WitchyWomanWriter \u00a7 \ud83d\udd33\u26aa\ufe0f\ud83d\udd33 4th September 2020. ",

            "answer_text": "So it goes back in my School Days, when I was in VII Standard. There was this \u201cEnglish Poem writing contest\u201d, so I decided not to go to School. Back then, I was not fluent in English and then writing Poems,absurd. I collected all the guts in this world, to ask my parents, if I could take a day off, because I cant write a poem, that too in English. They told me to atleast give it a try to which I denied, and a debate was started, which backfired, and turned into me sitting in a room, fighting with pen and paper and ideas. So I started writing(I was a great Nature Enthusiast), its bit childish, and am not very proud of it, but it was my first poem so, here it goes;- Everybody is surprised by Parent\u2019s thrift, but have we ever surprised by God\u2019sgift. The moon or the night or sky or the light, God\u2019s amazing, he forged world so bright. Summers or the winters are natures challengers We spoiling them with use of AC\u2019s and heaters. Fishes and birds and the others beasts protecting greedy not for them feasts. We were his best Experiment, not destroying his own environment. P.S. Well I did not won any award, because my Principal was not able to gulp down the fact that I wrote this.But my English teacher was happy and thus I was on cloud Nine, and my mother was like \u201cdekha beta mene kaha tha na, kosish karne walo ki haar nahi hoti\u201d (I told you no, if you will try, you will win). Now I have collection of around 29 poems(both in English and in Hindi). ",
