            "answer_text": "Fore and foremost, you need to know that IELTS writing is scored on the basis of four things which are grammar, lexical resources, content and coherence and Cohesion.  You must have observed that when we get opportunity to write about any familiar topic then we never run out of content and at the same time we write it in better way too. Hence, the first thing is developing content. Try to extract at least 5 minutes for developing an skeleton of whatever you are going to write in writing task 2. Secondly, the first paragraph should be paraphrasing and introduction of the style you are going to adapt for writing about the given topic. For example, you can talk about the exploring of the both ideas and finding out conclusion on the basis of the argument that you are going to provide in the essay. Divide the body part into three sub parts, which are body problem, body solution and the conclusion you draw out of the argument you have provided in the body itself. The last part will be conclusion in your own words which inculcate your own point of view and analysis of whole article. Use coherence and Cohesion such as firstly,secondly, thus, moreover, however, to conclude with etc. in every paragraph. There should be continuity of the idea and for maintaining this continuity you need to provide hint of upcoming paragraph in the conclusion part of current paragraph. There are several apps which will help you to enhance your grammatical skills and at the same time you can approach any tutor or instructor for enhancement of this. You can start working on subject verb agreement and sentence completion which will really be helpful for you in getting 7 in general training IELTS. For for the enhancement of your lexical resource you can approach any GRE book and get vocabulary from there. Even you can read few articles related to few important topics such as Technology, society, ancient and modern etc. and Jot down the difficult words for using it in your own article. For writing task 1, remember CAR- which is complain, application and request ( strictly formal ) and rest could be informal and semi formal. Go through the celebration part of all these three types of letter and write at least 30 lettres in order to score more than 7. Getting a 7 in IELTS writing is not a difficult job you just need to work on all these things I mentioned above and I am quite sure that you can achieve whatever you have desired in IELTS writing but remember, don't overwrite. Note-I work at Achievers Point. ",

            "answer_text": "Writing for IELTS is art and science both. The examiner evaluates you on four parameters each parameter having same scoring. Task Achievement - How well you addressed the topic? did you go out of topic? How relevant you were? could you justify what you wrote?Vocabulary _ - At times people take good vocabulary as ability to use difficult words. Its not so. Good vocabulary is using right word at right place and having variety of expressions. Using a very unique word comes with its own risk. risk of using it wrong way. that the biggest mistake over-jealous teachers do to IELTS students.Grammar _ Impeccable grammar is key to scoring good.Cohesion And Coherence - How well does you answer flow? id it bumpy? are you jumping from one unrelated aspect to another? If so you are going to score poorly.Focus on above four aspects and keep it simple. Complex ideas are difficult to express and can prompt you to commit mistakes. Two proverbs fit well here. well begun is half done _ what ever you start well will leave good impression on examiner. So work hard on opening.All is well that ends well - Examiner will focus more towards you conclusion and it plays a vital role.",
