            "answer_text": "I'd be very careful about everything I disclose to anyone let alone a committe of strangers your hoping will grant you an opportunity to attend their institution. Nobody is supposed to discriminate against an applicant based on past struggles or trials but the reality is we're all human and as such most of us are inclined to err on the side of caution. They may question whether college life is going to be too challenging for you and how you might cope with those challenges. \u201cAre they setting you up for failure?\u201d \u201cIs a smaller school better suited for you?\u201d \u201cWhtat are the chances someone so young has truly overcome her issues and will be successful during such a stressful time in their young life?\u201d All well intentioned but asking these questions are a distinct possibility. They may be thinking its better for you to attend somewhere else. Because adults always know whats best for others, especially teenagers. *(sarcasm here) These are risks you would be taking if you choose to disclose the struggles you've overcome and how it has shaped the plans for your life, but if you're willing to take those risks I think you could do a lot with what you've been through. Writing from such a personal experience can prove very cathartic and as long as you stay to a structured outline, keep it your own, ( how it directly affected, shaped, changed etc. Your life, not a general run through of how it affected friends and family, you can make yourself stand out as an exceptional candidate. Make sure you show that you've gained an understanding of your illness and how you have laid out a plan to prevent a relapse. Relay to them how you've been able to take something negative and turn it into a strength rather than a weakness. And most importantly, edit edit edit. Dont wait until the last minute and be prepared to have a trusted friend or family memeber proofread your work. Have an open mind and be willing to listen to constructive criticism. If he or she has a question about something chances are your intended readers will also, so be willing to make changes. This can be difficult when writing about something so personal, but if you feel you're willing to accept the risk I say go for it. You seem to be a brave young woman and overcoming something so difficult only proves that. Your only job is to get that across to the admissions panel using your words\u2026Im sure you have it in you. Good Luck!!! ",

How can I write about overcoming my mental illness in my college application essays and how my struggles inspire me to study psychology and help others like me? People think that overcoming an illness is viewed as a virtue by others. Here\u2019s the thing. You beat cancer, and people think it is great. You overcome an eating disorder, they can see the results. There are only two kinds of people in the world in regards to mental illness. Those that have dealt with it themselves or through a family member and those that think what they see on TVs and movies are indicative of real mental illness. You don\u2019t want to take a chance on either of these people with your future. It is better that they don\u2019t know. It isn\u2019t right. It isn\u2019t fair. It would be better if we lived in a world where we didn\u2019t have to keep these problems to ourselves. People that are normal want normal. People that have mental illness want normal too. There are many good people out there that will accept you for who you are. You don\u2019t want to find out the hard way that the person reading your college application wasn\u2019t one of them. ",
