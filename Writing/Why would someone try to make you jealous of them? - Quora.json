            "answer_text": "There are many ways of looking at this.. So maybe we must begin by saying that to be jealous (or envious) is to b fanatically want what another has, and of something they received by way of grace (UNDESERVED favor in THEIR eyes) so that it is seen as only being theirs by way of unfair advantage, and may lead to some hurt-based, or offence-based reactions in those who can't ever aspire to that kind of privilege\u2026 (the advantaged just having it may be regarded as offensive, THEY the poor SEEING it as being rammed down their throats) . AND it may result in covetousness. Covetousness again is almost purely based on the lust for money, and desires what another has, purely because the other person has it and they don't. It may also result in feelings of entitlement (\u201cI demand\u201d)or as my Pastor once said \u201cgive me, gjve me,.. because my name is Jimmy\u201d. As I said, one of the most bitter experiences in life is to have to sit on the sidelines, as another person contunues to prosper, and the waters of good fortune just NEVER move your way\u2026 and what it is very true is that whilst often the situation DOES include that they did also have a part to play, there just also are situations where fortune turned a blind eye to your needs. So then, BOTH situations of being jealous, and making another jealous have in common \u201cda\u2019 money\u201d\u2026 which is seen to be the bringer of privelege and social status through financial prosperity\u2026 AnD often rejection, isolation, and discrimination is attributed to having or not having da\u2019money. (the incorrectly perceived roots of social isolation) and is the result of interpretation based in the flesh\u2026and all of these areas like jealousy, envy and lust are evils of the flesh. (lust of the eyes, all included) Although the wrong in this is fairly obvious, we must grant a bit of grace to the \u201charmed by discrimation persons\u201d, it not always being their fault entirely) The unbelievably blessed person may have a huge sense of pride in what he has, but the unvmbelieaably disadvantaged person see as his point of shame. But BOTH of them have a problem.. The one seeing their Riches as their security and giving them a feeling of stability, (a bit higher than the others) pride!! \u201c and the other guy.. No security at all. (shamed) Thus the social dominance that comes with Riches seems obvious to the one not even on the scale, and the one higher on the scale sees it as vital to keeping his place, EVEN IF it is by way of making the other person jealous and envious. As a person on the side of advantage I have often been put in an awfully uncomfortable spot of having to deliberately downplay my privelege.. there being absolutely only resentment.. And I have often debated the wisdom of inviting the poor into my environment because. The LAST thing I EVER want to do is to hurt ANY person in that way,, but then neither do I want to hurt them by NOT inviting them BUT FOR SURE I NEVER WANT TO MAKE THEM JEALOUS.. But OTHERS do \u2026 and so then I took my courage in my hands, (which was considerable) and made the poor welcome.. Then having to apologize and explain away my privelege\u2026 BUT I CAN'T.. And have had all manner of spiteful and snide remarks passed, indirectly getting at my privelege with little jibes I had no answer to really. (so there is a powercut.. And I explain perfectly honestly, that it is so, and the answer comes. \u201cahhh.. I SEE!!! The RICH have no electricity,, but the poor have no water! \u201c. I mean REALLY!!! WAS THAT REALLY NECESSARY??? What IS true is that it is one of the GRRATEST tests.. Included in the money thing. If you can watch another man being blessed \u2026 whilst the rich and privileged will be be CONTINUALLY tested and tried on THE LOVE OF MONEY and their relationship to it and their greatest test, being their attitude to the neediness of the needy.

            "answer_text": "Jealousy and envy comes from fear, immaturity and insecurity. They usually want what you have and have no clue how to get it. Since it is someone going after you, you need to get the heck away from them now.  I don't care if she is family. Take the focus off her and get busy working on yourself.  It is time for great improvement on your part.You are spending too much time thinking about her.  She has you by the short hairs and pulling them out in clumps, figuratively. What are you doing to work on self?  Probably nothing.  Take a class on self improvement. Stop talking to her NOW.  Every word you say, she will use against you.  Don't even mention her name for 6 months and longer. You are feeding into this. ",
