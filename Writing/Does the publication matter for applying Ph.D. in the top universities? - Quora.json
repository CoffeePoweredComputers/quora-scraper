            "answer_text": "Does the publication matter for applying Ph.D. in the top universities? For the sciences, the answer is definitely YES. The department or mentor would want to evaluate and predict the possibility of success of the applicant in finishing the research PhD degree on the one hand and being a successful scientist in the future on the other hand. The primary byproduct of research is publication that could lead to eventual application. If the applicant can demonstrate a track record of some level or propensity of research that would lead to publications, that would be one indicator of potential success. There are other indicators such as classroom performance, grades, course papers, extracurricular activities, and, to me, letters of recommendation from those who are in a position to judge. Hence, when I review Ph.D. applications in Experimental Psychology and in Public Health, I pay specific attention to a variety of indicators noted above. The long answer to your question is when there is no or very little productivity in the research arena, I would be very skeptical in admitting a student to a Ph.D. program. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you mean having publications before you apply? No. That is not expected of PhD students. Nor are publications expected along the way, at least not in many of the social sciences and humanities. Publications are required for tenure. That\u2019s something to think about after you receive your PhD. However, if you publish along the way while pursuing a PhD it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt you. I actually intended to publish an excerpt from my dissertation research, but when I showed it to my advisor he liked it so much he asked me to expand on it. Then he kept asking me to expand on it. In a few months it was two hundred pages \u2014 one third of my final dissertation. As I left academia, I never bothered to publish it. No matter, the degree is based on your dissertation and the defense. No publications required. ",

Nobody expected incoming candidates to arrive with an impressive publication record. Later, some top universities asked you to attach your published work to your application but it wasn\u2019t very common. Digital Age has changed all that. Even your Social Media profile might be taken into consideration by your prospective department including your Quora posts! ",
