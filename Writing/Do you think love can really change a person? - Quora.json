            "answer_text": "Through college I dated a girl off and on. Sometimes we thought we loved each other. Way too often we fought and hurt each other. All the time we were just plain crazy. She left for college so we dated others. She came back and we hooked up again. We clashed and broke up so we dated others. We made up and got back together. Rinse and repeat for five years. We thought this was love. I think it was insanity. Frankly I look back and my entire college experience was a string of broken relationships and hearts. By the time I graduated I felt lonely, frustrated and figured this is love. Then I met a girl unlike the rest. She at first didn\u2019t even know I existed. When she finally did she had no interest in a relationship. Tough starting place. But my wit, charm and handsomeness finally broke through. Ok, ok, really just my persistence and that she happened not to be dating anyone at the time. We dated a little, then I went away to grad school. Yet, somehow I didn\u2019t care about dating anyone else and amazingly neither did she. I\u2019d come home and it was bliss. I\u2019d leave and she was all I could think about. I felt a love for her and from her that simply I\u2019d never experienced before. Someone who I never wanted to be without and who seemed to feel the same. Recently we celebrated our 45th wedding anniversary with some friends at our home. After they left, we\u2019d cleaned the dishes and I\u2019d taken a load of empty wine bottles to the trash. Whew, did we drink all that? As I turned off the lights in the dining room I turned to her and said, \u201cYou know, after 45 years, I\u2019m still glad you\u2019re the one I brought home from the dance.\u201d She smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you did too.\u201d Real love changes everything. There is no greater gift. ",

            "answer_text": "Instead of giving a logical answer, I would like to narrate my own small example. So I believe everyone changes with time. Just think about it, the \u2018you\u2019 from 5 years ago won\u2019t recognize the \u2018you\u2019 now. What love does is assign priorities to certain changes such that they are accelerated and hence we notice them. I was quite reserved and didn\u2019t like to talk to many people. I hated the romantic stuff too. I prided myself on being extremely logical and rational. I was strict in terms of forgiving people for their mistakes Over the course of time I was learning to talk to people, understanding more of human nature etc\u2026 But these changes were so slow that even I didn\u2019t realize them for very long. Then love enters my life. I become addicted to that person. I\u2019m spending hours talking to her. Then I spent hours talking to my friends how great she was and how she made me happy. I could see my own desire to just talk and talk. This was an instance of inherent accelerated change. Then there was the fact that she asked me to dress a little more to the occasion (I suck at personal grooming). Good advice, so I followed it. This was an instance of forced accelerated change. The third type was passive accelerated change. More feelings, also increased my empathy in general. I became more forgiving and accepting. So yes, Love changes you, but then so does many things like passion, career, even hunger for that matter. (P.s - I have quoted only positive changes, but change happens in both direction\u2026.always) ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the intensity and the enduring nature of what you call \u2018love\u2019. It certainly can change someone partly and temporarily. But, in order for it to change someone completely and permanently, \u2018love\u2019 has to be very strong and long lasting. Besides, just as medicine which depends on the individual body chemistry of the patient to have the desired result without any adverse side effects, it also depends on the nature of the predisposition and psychological make up of the individual person undergoing the emotions of love. If that person is of a very sensitive and compassionate nature, love can bring about changes that may become permanent and if not, it will not. P S - I happen to read one answer suggesting one must be willing to lose one\u2019s happiness for the other in love. I do not agree. That may probably apply in the case of unconditional motherly love and maybe in some romantic stories of the popular Mills & Boon books. But, in real life, and in the case of adult love, the boy sacrificing his happiness for the girl and the girl in turn sacrificing her happiness for the boy can only end up in both being unhappy defeating the very purpose of being in love - to be happy. So, please beware of such Utopian and impractical ideas about love. ",

And love changing a person. I dnt know really but i know one that . and that's for sure, persons does not change . the change we observe in a person is not like that the person is changed....... it's just that the person is adapting to the situation he/she is in and the adaptation to the situation is the change we feel in him/her ......... But in reality they dnt change......... The mind is no easily changed and it cannot be.......... even if it can be it will take avery long time.. And love changing people.......... Hmmmmmmmmm ..... not soo possible ....until there is some loosers who change them self for their girlfriend or boyfriend .. it's nothing it is just temporary changee even if they changeee...................

But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. 1 Corinthians 13:10-13 10 But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 12 For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known. 13 And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. ",

And more over he hated black colour while she was young. One of her cousin is black and if he touches her, my mom would go take bath each time as she hated black so much. Guess my dad is black in colour. But now no one would believe if my mom hated black coz she is so loving and attached to dad. there is not a single day mom has failed pamparing my dad. Similarly my dad was a narrow minded person but now he has changed a lot. Mom\u2019s love changed him that now he is a very fair minded person.  Arent they lovely... On the contrary, a friend of mine i loved her in the sense i trusted her so much but now she now in focusing on her life and is out of contact. She changed me not to trust anyone anymore. my parents are an example for a positive change that true love can bring and mine was an example for a negative change. Therefore love is powerful that it brings a change but it depends in our hands to make it a positive or a negative one. Waiting for my positive change..... Wishing you the same.

It can bring us to some very dark places in our life, but it can also lead us onto an even better path. When I\u2019ve fallen in love, it\u2019s always been this overwhelming feeling of bliss and freedom. The feeling of freedom is in the person I am and in my potential in life. I feel like I can do anything and like I want to work harder at my goals and dreams, not just for myself, but now for my significant other. Love is truly a battlefield which can significantly change one\u2019s life, perceptions, attitudes and values. Bottom line is when love does change you, because it can and it will, choose the right path and realize that the good path is the right kind of love. Embrace it at full speed ahead and always remember who you are on the way there. Never let love define you, instead let it shine through you. And here is a fun line at last \u201cLove is the seventh sense which destroys all other senses and makes people believe in nonsense.\u201d ",

Due to so many physical and emotional things happen when you fall in REAL love, it can really be a messy or beautiful thing. The factor that dictates that is, is the person really IN LOVE big diff between loving someone and being IN love the levels of sacrifice and dedication are diff. Is the person already broken, wounded from the past, codependent a narcissist and the individuals agenda for themself and their partner and their vision and want for the future of that relationship. People change because endorphins and seritonin are flooding their bodies and then sometimes red flags are ignored or what ever and then here comes pain and pain turns almost most into a diff person based on how they deal with pain and the level of that pain. Love can also make people better, when we finally find someone we love and come out of our own needs and wants it grows us ",

Here are some truths: Conscious love reflects back and forth,Emotional love can be dangerous with temporarily insanity of jealousy,Physical love depends on type and polarity,Please show me where love has tempered the world into peace, the love of God has taken more lives than any political metaphor. The feeling of love is powerful because of the chemicals that are released into the brain. This is how evolution helps in the reproduction process. One harsh fact: You dont know how much you truly love someone until they\u2019re gone. I am accepting that love might be a change for people But on the other hand it is harmful too. There are both side of a thing either it is love or hate. So keep it in positive way and do better with the property you have, if you have someone\u2019s love keep it, nurture it, support it and keep it real otherwise it can change your life in negative way too.

If the idea of the relationship from the very beginning is to change a person and someone tries to force the change on that person, chances are high the change will not be the desired one. Rather, the person would get frustrated and less responsive over time. Noone likes to hear they are inadequate and needs to change. If, on the other hand, the person is encouraged and loved for everything that he or she is, the person may change positively, slowly. The word of caution here is that change in a person is very slow. And it would happen at his/her own time & rate, not the ones that the other person wants. If the other person waits for the change, chances are high, he/she would get frustrated and start forcing it on the other. That won\u2019t be good for anyone concerned. One more thing here is, a person\u2019s behaviour is not the same for every other person he comes across. It keeps changing according to the dynamics of the relationship he has with another. So trying to have that proper dynamics is a good idea. Best wishes! :) ",

            "answer_text": "I love filter coffee. I really do. The best part about living in the Southern part of India is that the coffee is excellent. The favourite part of my morning is the five minutes after I\u2019ve reached an empty office, gotten myself a nice hot mug of straang filter kaapi, and put my earphones on. Kathy\u2019s Song floats in the air, and for five minutes, the world acquires an additional dash of meaning. I read something like this,  I won\u2019t presume to translate this, because I can\u2019t, really. and Gulzar seems to gently peel off a different layer to this world that never existed before. For five minutes, anything is possible. I'm wittier, even charming - I might even write something that gives meaning to a few moments of someone's life someday, or produce some work that leaves a tiny bite mark on the world. For five minutes. Then, slowly, I return to room temperature, to a world full of Excel shortcuts I cannot gracefully pull off, one where Yuzvendra Chahal is a serious Test prospect in England, one where I have to do that pesky little thing - writing - instead of just becoming a writer. It\u2019s a world of tedium and of cursors that blink ruthlessly at me, a world full of words like \u2018tedium\u2019, and with way too demanding a requirement for action and engagement instead of simple, relentless, endless, imaginative dreaming. Coffee doesn\u2019t change me. Contrary to what I might think, it doesn\u2019t make me a good writer. It makes me want to be one, but those are sadly two very different things. When the caffeine wears off, and it always does, what matters is how willing I am to work, at writing and at everything else, and that part is far less sexy than the magical part with the coffee mug in my hand. The changing, whether fortunately or unfortunately, is entirely up to me. It's a scenic bend in the road. It\u2019s not the destination. It feels good. It\u2019s not enough. Coffee is love. ",

            "answer_text": "In our effort to find that \u201csomeone\u201d, there are always lessons to be learned. Sometimes we marry because we don\u2019t know better and other times we know better yet still marry. There is a line that is fine and sometimes very sharp. Without a good foundation with regards to the Self\u2026we need lessons to hone who we are. We must be able to understand ourselves first and then the other person. For instance, as a young man I always thought that having a girlfriend was necessary\u2026that I would find one and that they would really like me. That didn\u2019t happen. I dated and started to learn more about them then myself. I was a pleaser and after a while\u2026pleasing did not work. After I got married, for I was in love with this woman but I also knew she did not love me but being a hopeful man\u2026I thought she would learn to love me. Fast forward\u2026I learned that when a person accepts being second best in any relationship\u2026you remain second best. Time, energy, and experience taught what schools could not. I learned that I have the control of me and not someone else. I learned to be strong in ways that helped me, helped me understand, and helped me connect with someone who was good for me and I for them. So love..is about respect. Love is offering help because help is offered in return. Love is allowing the other person to be who they are\u2026warts and all, for the reflection is you in them and them in you. Love is strongest when freedom is allowed, allowed from both together. So the answer is Yes\u2026love can really change a person\u2026but it is not the love of the other person..it is the love of Self. To grant unconditional love to help heal the hurts we obtain ourselves and to move forward into loving someone else. Love changes but is strong as well. Love of self is a foundation other can stand upon\u2026with you\u2026not \u201con\u201d you. Thus my wife\u2026is not mine to control, not mine to boss around or not have her own opinion. As the First Nations express it: \u201cShe is my \u201cWalk-Beside\u201d. And we walk beside each other willingly and wholly and that should read Holy. Just Sayin. ",

Love can change a person a lot, usually it makes you stop doing bad stuff just because that person hates it, or it can make you do something you never thought you would do, or you can become something different because that person changed you. I saw on a TV show this guy, who didn\u2019t respect anyone and he was annoying and everyone wanted him to go away, but he met this girl, nice girl, and he fell in love with her. A few episodes later, he left her without telling her. But then, when he came back, he was completely changed and he thanked her for being there when no one else was. He went from being this horrible human everyone hated, to being this nice person who everyone liked. Love is really strong. ",

It\u2019s love that reminds me of my good fortune, my potential, my free will and my power. It reminds me to consider others rather than just myself. Love forces me to carefully regard the outlines of me and treat them with respect; to clearly identify all the places where I end and another person begins. I love you so much but we are most certainly not one. Love crystalizes my boundaries, and has always been the laser light force - the supernova - behind defining again and again exactly who I am. Love widens my interests, teaches me how to return to battle day after day to fight to build and never to destroy. Love makes me feel alive more than anything. It\u2019s you. It\u2019s me. It\u2019s the whole entire world coming into sharper focus. Look. Look how beautiful it all looks when you are here with me. ",

            "answer_text": "First,disappointment and betrayal are unavoidable in life.Simple acts of loving kindness can transform us emotionally to a better person. Second, life becomes interesting. Selfishness is boring. When we seek the happiness, security, and well-being of another in creative love the world becomes full and engaging. Third, loving others gives us a reason to develop our gifts. Students learn more when they have to tutor younger peers, or when they learn in groups and are responsible for teaching one another. Fourth, we make deeper friendships. Our friends are no longer the people we just hang out with, but they are the ones with whom we find exhilarating common cause and commitment. Finally we have serious friends. Fifth, loving others is a source of hope because as active agents we use our strengths to make a difference in the life of another, and we can therefore have greater confidence in shaping the future. Sixth, loving others is a source of joy. Happiness is to joy as optimism is to hope. Seventh, loving others, so long as one also cares for the self and its limits both physical and psychological, is associated with self-reported physical health. Lastly it compells oneself to take all the risks in the earth to make your love believe that he/she is are the best. ",

            "answer_text": "If the question is about the early stages of \"romantic love\" - usually just termed \"love\",(though there are many other kinds of love), it causes a psychotic state in which one obsesses about the object of one's affection as a result of dopamine/ phenylethyamine/ norepinephrine driven high and lowering of all ability for rational thought due to resultant lowered serotonin levels to focus on being able to bond rather than judge! Other kinds of love (and more latter developed stages of couple love) - don't really \"change\" the individual, though it may have an impact on their evolution as an individual while strengthening who they are by fulfilling the love and belonging (social needs) of an individual that is so essential to be able to achieve self esteem and thereafter possibly self actualization and transcendence.

He got afraid, decided to pull out for trivial reasons, feared getting a disease I have had since childhood, said our life preferences didn't match, maybe decided my character and virtues weren't helpful for his life and career (or whatever the reasons were), and tried to give me a smooth answer in order not to upset me (it worked the opposite). But he gave me the certainty that love can change me, a faith I now have, even if it would never happen again during my life. Even if he actually didn't believe in it himself, or only saw it too shortly and uncertainly, it doesn't matter, for he lit a light in me and now I know it. Do you think rain can make a plant grow? It will work and the rain doesn't have to know what it's doing. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, if you Love Krishna / God then there can be change The basic principle of the living condition is that we have a general propensity to love someone. No one can live without loving someone else. This propensity is present in every living being. Even an animal like a tiger has this loving propensity at least in a dormant stage, and it is certainly present in the human beings. The missing point, however, is where to repose our love so that everyone can become happy. People become frustrated looking for the perfect object of love. We may love our brother and sister, our mother and father, our wife or husband, our friends, our community, our nation, the international community, or even all human beings, yet still our love will remain imperfect. That is because it is not all-inclusive. For example, every country considers the human beings residing there to be nationals, but not the animals. But \"national\" means anyone who takes birth in that country. In Sanskrit the word is praj\u00e4, \"those who take birth.\" So it is the duty of the leader of a country to protect all praj\u00e4 residing there. Not that only human beings should be protected, while the animals\u2014the cows, pigs, chickens, and so on\u2014are slaughtered. They are also praj\u00e4. When one becomes Krishna conscious, however, he loves every living being because of its connection with Krishna Ref:Quest for Enlightenment -source BBT ",

I have hurt my parents and friends due to this nature.  But fortunately or unfortunately, love turned me into new person. My bf is more adamant than me, consoling or convincing him will be a difficult task for me to hold our relationship.  We used to fight for silly things, as we both are not ready for compramising. After some point of time,I realised that If both are adamant, our love will not last. So I took a decision to change my nature to him. I began to compramise even though,  he only committed the mistake. That made a huge change in my life. Gradually that became my nature and now am feeling happy that I'll not hurt anyone through my adamant nature.Thanks for the LOVE that changed me!!!!!! So please everyone have a true love in life to expect the unexpected change in you !!! :) Happy love days <3 ",

I want her to be happy. With me or with someone else that she loves. It is not about possessing her. And so on. Love matures with time. Love nurtures. Love isn\u2019t just that physical attraction.

Because of love, at the meant to be time in the essence of that which you have always been, will be the joining of that someone who completes you. You will find your breath and thoughts are not your own, but shared as it is in this love you cannot live without. So yes, it is in the eyes of the one who loves you as forever unconditionally.

People change when they believe a change will make them happier or more secure. Sometimes, being a better person in order to keep a partner content is enough- but they aren't changing for YOU. They are changing for themselves. Nothing you say, nothing you do and nothing you wish for is going to motivate another person to make long-term change if they do not internalize the need for it. Love someone where they are, not where you want them to be. If you aren't compatible, then make the hard choice to move on. Its a decision that shows respect for the other person\u2019s autonomy, and it preserves your own dignity. ",

To hope with all your heart, and to pray for someone other than your own self. It gives you an illusion of perfection, complete and flawless; an illusion so beautiful, you want to be capable of it. It helps you get rid of bad habits, though itself forms the most dangerous of all addictions. It teaches you where to draw lines between self esteem and unconditionality. It teaches you to walk away stronger, even with your heart trembling and craving to go back. And most importantly, it helps you grow into someone who has a capability of giving, appreciating and finding magic in a dark, dull, realistic, ordinary life. One love is all we need! ",

I could go out and enjoy life like almost everyone I know are enjoying, But for now all that enjoyment wont let me become capable of giving everything back to my parents for all that they had done for me. Bad experience, well see all those depressed people around you ? Some had lost their friends, some had lost their partners because things didn't turn out as they expected. ",
