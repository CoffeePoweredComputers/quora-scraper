            "answer_text": "Write about people with conflicting goals, both big and small. In the overall story and in individual scenes. Don't mistake banter for genuine conflict. Think about stakes. What happens if your character fails? Make it feel like life and death to your characters, even when it isn't. Learn how to bury exposition within conflict. This is one of the main ways that readers recognize professionalism. Make sure you have a story to tell and not just an inciting incident. Know your ending and major turning points. They may change but provide targets for you to aim at. We judge characters by the values expressed in the choices they make, not because of what we are told about them. Make sure your scenes are events that benefit or thwart your main character's pursuit of their goal. If a scene doesn't do this, lose it no matter how cool you think your dialogue or setting is. The audience is waiting to see what happens next, not what a yoga class is really like. Good luck and get to work! ",

            "answer_text": "Write it about someone you know, personally. A character has to have a lot of depth to them, needs to be something real due to their experience, and you've already been watching that for years. Find a story they have, and interview them about it. They'll probably see it as just another part of life, nothing special, but you can make it special. If you really want to know how to setup your screenplay, I'd also really suggest you read the book, \"Save the Cat\". After you read that, you'll never see a movie the same way ever again. ",
