            "answer_text": "Script length goes not by number of words in dialogue but NUMBER OF PAGES \u2014 1 page per film minute is the rule. For example, a 90 minute movie is supposed have a script 90 pages long. A full-feature (i.e., 2-hour movie) would be based on a 120-page long script. Now, if you write a lot of dialog (TELLING what\u2019s going on through the mouths of characters), then there would be LESS covered in that one page measured by of number-of-words. But if you are writing a lot of descriptions (thus SHOWING instead of just TELLING), then the total length of the movie might be longer. However all that would not be your concern as a script writer. Once you deliver the script, the rest (including the length of the overall finished movie) is up to the Director and Editor, and sometimes they are one and the same person. ",

            "answer_text": "Not sure I understand the question, but here are two pieces of advice. If you are writing a lot of dialogue to explain something in a film, you\u2019re doing it wrong. A character should not talk about something, their actions should SHOW what\u2019s going on. For example: Do not have a thief explain how he\u2019ll rob a bank. SHOW the thief doing an imaginary robbery with a little bit of witty dialogue to remind the viewer this is imaginary.Not a hard and fast rule, but if one character talks for more than say, 10 lines, break it up. Try to write five lines at most, then have the other character respond, then back. Snip-snap back and forth. Watch Cary Grant\u2019s \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d or read any 87th Precinct book. But unless you\u2019re brilliant, if two people are talking talking talking and doing nothing else, your audience will reach for the remote.",
