            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think most fans do. Wanting to know as much as possible about a favourite character isn\u2019t the same as treating them as a real person. If you like a character, it is natural to wonder about human things. What songs would the character like, what food. Do they find so and so attractive? After all, a well fleshed out and acted (or written) character should feel \u201creal\u201d in the sense that you could believe that such a person existed. That isn\u2019t the same as actually thinking they do. A bigger problem is when fanatic fans mistake the actor for the character. This is much more common. ",

            "answer_text": "Partly because it\u2019s fun. We are well aware that our fictional friends are, in fact, fictional. But trying to identify with them, and act as if we know them like real people is an enjoyable thing. It\u2019s usually a part of the tradition of fandom to behave as if we really do know this or that character. And partly because we actually do know our fictional friends better than people we know in real life. There is no effort to knowing them\u2014we are shown exactly what they think and how they feel by the author. With real people there is work involved. No matter how long we know our friends and how close we are with our family, we can\u2019t read their minds. And there is a goodly amount of wishful thinking as well. If it\u2019s a character we truly like, it is nice to imagine that person as real. ",
