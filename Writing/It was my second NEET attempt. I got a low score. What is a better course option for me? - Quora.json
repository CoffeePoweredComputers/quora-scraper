            "answer_text": "I remember being in the same career crunch after my first attempt\u2026.when my family wasnt allowing me to take a drop\u2026 I tried on a number of courses then,some of which i regreted leaving when i eventually made it to Lady Hardinge. In my experience,you should seriously apply to Delhi University. Apply in as many courses as u can depending on the subject combination.I would seriously suggest English and Economics.They have good scope.English is definitely very different from the science subjects,but it offers u a lot of variety in terms of the career options later.Writing,directing,teaching,law\u2026in addition to the typical civil services or MBA everyone can go for later. Plus its easier given the fact that English is largely a compulsory subject in schools and the mostly widely taught subject in colleges. U even have time to polish on any of your extra curriculars and be a part time professional at it.This is something that Science related careers make basically impossible to do. An additional advantage of pursuing a BA is that u have an electoral subject option wherein u can take economics or political science or any subject that interests u while while adding to your resume.This way you can even do a masters or make a career in a subject like maths or economics,where u even use ur logical bent of mind. My father even told me of people from an English background working in public health. Both these courses have relatively higher cut offs,but the course should be most important than the college u get. So ull get some college if u score around 90% in CBSE. So try BA English hons. I understand that u might feel ur hard work in physics chemistry and biology wasted while changing streams. But i think our past loss or failure should not dictate the future. The point right now is to find a course that interests and engages u while offering some viable career options later. Whether knowledge already acquired will be useful or not is a secondary issue. So keep ur mind open abt stream change. Specialising in biology is not a very good career option if u want to stay in India. Making a new start in a different and interesting field might be\u2026. So best of luck for the future. Keep urself open to the new.You never know what time might show you\u2026 ",
