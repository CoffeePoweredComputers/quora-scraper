            "answer_text": "Heya, thanks for the A2A. So I have to be honest, I have yet to finish a first draft during NaNo, my stories tend to be a bit longer than 50 000 words. (This year I\u2019m at 25246 on one story, and in chapter 5). I write too many words and don\u2019t get to the point, I know, I\u2019m working on it). I do, however, aim to write every day of the month and get to at least 1667 words if not more. This year my daily average is 2100ish. When I was healthy and doing NaNo, and working and all of that I would write every single day without fail, I would not miss one. Now I\u2019m sick, I am kinder to myself. I do allow myself days off when I am too tired to write, or I am spending my day in and out of doctors appointments, or I am too tired, or I just need a break to recharge. To do this I have to write more than the 1667 words when I can, so I that I have a buffer when I do need to take a break. Whereas when I first started I tended to just get to the 1667 point before stopping. The other thing I have noticed is that writing every day - or near every day, sets you up really well to keep writing a lot and often for a few months. Especially with my new system. Whereas before I took a week or two off before going back to it. So there is advantages and disadvantages to both sides of the coin. Thanks for asking, hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "On days where I work, I aim to get 1,700 words done. If I get more awesome! On days I have off from work I aim for around 5,000. That way if I do have a day where I don\u2019t get as much done it\u2019s not a killer on my count. One year it was awesome, October 31st fell on a Friday. I got home from doing Halloween stuff and at Midnight set to work, I think it was 4am before I went to bed and I got up around 10 and started again. I think that was the same year that I also saw 2am twice one weekend because of Daylight Savings. I\u2019ve also in previous years near the end of the month I\u2019ve taken a day off of work solely to write. Even though I hit the 50k word count I rarely consider my work done. It always seems like my ending is another 10k words away or just crap and needs to be reworked. ",
