            "answer_text": "Usually you need to spend time or money on it, as long before the release as you can, if possible (though I forget this myself most of the time!). The way the Amazon eBook chart algorithms work, you need a sustained period of a few days sales above the level needed to chart in the categories your book is in. Depending on what categories the book is in, the amount of sales needed and the boost it will give your sales varies. The approach you will see most often (demonstrated by Pat Flynn recently), is to start mentioning and promoting your book months before its release. At this stage you are interested in gathering e-mail addresses, usually on the promise of giving people notice of the fact the book will be released at a low price for a while to subscribers. This is where an existing audience from a blog or podcast comes in useful - you can get these people signed up. In effect you are gathering up over months people who you can e-mail over the first few days of your book's availability on Kindle, to produce the chart position, which will then in turn produce more sales. That said there are hundreds of ways to gather this audience, but trying to do it in a few days after your book release IS HARD. Easier (though not trivial) to sell to an audience built up over a longer period - this is why so many people write in series - the earlier books provide an audience for the later books.  ",

            "answer_text": "There is no better way to generate buzz for your self-published book than an email list. This is especially true if you're using a crowdfunding campaign as a financing mechanism as I did with my book Content Warfare. The very first thing (from a marketing perspective) every author should do when they decide to self-publish a book is create an \"Insiders\" list (or whatever you want to call it). This is a list of people who are giving you permission to send marketing messaging about your book. In exchange you give them early access, beta reader status, add their names to the book, let them help with cover design, or an number of other behind the scenes extras non-subscribers won't get. Why? Your \"Insider\" list subscribers will become invested in the success of the book because they will have played a role in its creation. This means they'll jump at the opportunity to buy your book once it's ready. And as anyone who's self-published a book knows, early momentum is huge. That doesn't mean your book won't be success if the launch doesn't go well, but early success is a great source of energy. I explain in greater detail how I did it here: How I Raised Over $10,000 in 21 Days to Self-Publish My First Book  Always start with the email list. ",
