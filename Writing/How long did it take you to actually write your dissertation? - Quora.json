            "answer_text": "In my case, the real difficulty was trying to figure out what to write. Ironically, it wasn\u2019t my graduate advisor who helped me work this out, but a professor from India, who happened to be visiting our campus briefly. We sat down and chatted for maybe 10 minutes and worked everything out. Thanks to Prof. Atluri Murali, of Government Central University at Hyderabad, I quickly formulated a plan, got it approved by my advisor, obtained the materials I needed, and set to work. Start to finish, this took me about 1 year. However, I had to work at least 8 hours a day, often about 4 hours of research / planning followed by 4 hours of writing and revising. I worked so diligently that even the Starbucks employees who cleaned up around me bought me a commemorative cup! The dissertation was approved, and a few years later it was, after some revision, published. So, it took me about a year to organize my research and write my dissertation, but years of preparatory work went into that, including a year of archival work in India, and a summer of archival work in London.

            "answer_text": "Average thesis or dissertation is about 20,000 words, which is about 40 pages. So you could do that in a week. But of course, most people spend about a year on their masters thesis and several years on their PhD dissertations. That's because how long it takes to write is pretty much dominated by how long it takes to research. The writing part is easy - first you need something to write about. And 40 pages is really the minimum length for a masters thesis - it's really too short for a PhD dissertation. For me: Undergrad thesis = 100 pages = 9 months to work on, 2 months to write Masters thesis = 55 pages = 4 months to work on, 1 month to write ",
