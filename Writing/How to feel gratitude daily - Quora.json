            "answer_text": "Best advice on feeling gratitude daily came from my cousin Dr. Bruce Presnick, who along with his partner Dr. Laura Presnick, founded and operate the Presnick Holistic Health and Wellness Center in East Bay SFO. Bruce suggested, during a trip to Napa in 2007, that through focused effort and habit creation, I start to build gratitude daily like a muscle. Bruce said that, as with any \u201cmuscle strengthening\u201d, increasing gratitude meant consistent effort to focus and relive the almost infinite number of times we've experienced positive feelings of gratitude. We can now enjoy those feelings again by doing so, simultaneously strengthening our ability to feel more grateful in general, through meditation and visualization - (sidebar note: two of our most powerful undersppreciated sns underutilized skills) Even setting out the intention to make gratitude a bigger part of one\u2019s life starts to create ripples out in awareness of things we can be grateful about. The benefits of gratitude far exceeded my original expectations. One cannot be fearful insecure worried or self doubting while in a state of gratitude. In other words, the Stoics may have been right, gratitude may be our human species\u2019 one killer app. ",

            "answer_text": "By counting your blessings. A step that I\u2019ve learned from the movie \u201c The Secret\u201d is to hold an item that you constantly carry with you, for example a key chain or some kind of totem or any item that you have access to frequently, whenever you grab that item you have to be thankful for something that you have in your life, for example I wake up in the morning and i\u2019m holding my wallet I\u2019d be thankful for waking up, the ability to see the morning sun, the ability to actually move around, all these amazing and great blessings in our life that we keep taking for granted. After repeating the above routine you will be able to actually start appreciating things in your life more, you\u2019ll start knowing what things in your life matter and what is their emotional value to yourself and you start cherishing them rather than keeping on repeating \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you have until it\u2019s gone\u201d, NOPE\u2026 I will cherish everything that I have at the moment and appreciate its existence in my life and know how to protect it and never let it lose its glare.
