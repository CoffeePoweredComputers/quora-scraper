            "answer_text": "In Christianity, you certainly wouldn't go to heaven without Jesus. The point of the crucifixion is that only God is good, we need saving, and we cannot earn our salvation. Even 1 sin isn't good enough. We need to be perfect. Yet everyone has sinned, right? God is holy and just, so He must punish evil. Yet He is merciful, and wishes humanity to live forever with Him. To reconcile this, He became a man 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ. He lived the perfect life we should have lived, and was tortured and executed, willingly, to take our punishment for us. This fulfilled the requirements of justice. He then rose again bodily, conquering death and sin. He then ascended to heaven. To receive this salvation though, we must accept it. That is, we must accept the gospel that Jesus was born God in the flesh, of a virgin, lived, died and and rose again on the third day. We must repent, trust and believe in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour and we are imputed His righteousness. God then sees us as sinless as Him. He forgives us. This is called grace, or unmerited favour. We don't deserve forgiveness- none of us does- but He gives us this salvation as a free gift out of love. False religion tell us we can work and be good enough for heaven. So if you want heaven, repent and believe the gospel; trust in Jesus as your saviour. He is the only way. Heaven will be everything good about earth, with nothing bad, in the presence of God forever. That's it. Not pray five times a day, not give to charity, not fasting. Good works comes as a result of salvation. God is the cause of salvation. Believe in Jesus, because today is the day of salvation. You don't know if you will die in your sleep tonight. God bless ",

            "answer_text": "That decision is up to YOU.God is offering EVERYONE the Free Gift of eternal life (heaven).Here is a short video that explains that Free Gift:  Here is more information:Here is a wonderful answer from Bible Questions Answered: \u201cQuestion: \"How can I be saved?\" Answer: This simple, yet profound, question is the most important question that can be asked. \"How can I be saved?\" deals with where we will spend eternity after our lives in this world are over. There is no more important issue than our eternal destiny. Thankfully, the Bible is abundantly clear on how a person can be saved. The Philippian jailer asked Paul and Silas, \u201cSirs, what must I do to be saved?\u201d (Acts 16:30). Paul and Silas responded, \u201cBelieve in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved\u201d (Acts 16:31). How can I be saved? Why do I need to be saved? We are all infected with sin (Romans 3:23). We are born with sin (Psalm 51:5), and we all personally choose to sin (Ecclesiastes 7:20; 1 John 1:8). Sin is what makes us unsaved. Sin is what separates us from God. Sin is what has us on the path to eternal destruction. How can I be saved? Saved from what? Because of our sin, we all deserve death (Romans 6:23). While the physical consequence of sin is physical death, that is not the only kind of death that results from sin. All sin is ultimately committed against an eternal and infinite God (Psalm 51:4). Because of that, the just penalty for our sin is also eternal and infinite. What we need to be saved from is eternal destruction (Matthew 25:46; Revelation 20:15). How can I be saved? How did God provide salvation? Because the just penalty for sin is infinite and eternal, only God could pay the penalty, because only He is infinite and eternal. But God, in His divine nature, could not die. So God became a human being in the person of Jesus Christ. God took on human flesh, lived among us, and taught us. When the people rejected Him and His message, and sought to kill Him, He willingly sacrificed Himself for us, allowing Himself to be crucified (John 10:15). Because Jesus Christ was human, He could die; and because Jesus Christ was God, His death had an eternal and infinite value. Jesus\u2019 death on the cross was the perfect and complete payment for our sin (1 John 2:2). He took the consequences we deserved. Jesus\u2019 resurrection from the dead demonstrated that His death was indeed the perfectly sufficient sacrifice for sin. How can I be saved? What do I need to do? \u201cBelieve in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved\u201d (Acts 16:31). God has already done all of the work. All you must do is receive, in faith, the salvation God offers (Ephesians 2:8-9). Fully trust in Jesus alone as the payment for your sins. Believe in Him, and you will not perish (John 3:16). God is offering you salvation as a gift. All you have to do is accept it. Jesus is the way of salvation (John 14:6).\u201d ",
