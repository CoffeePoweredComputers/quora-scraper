            "answer_text": " Practising creative writing can help in the following ways: 1. You get better at thinking up alternatives. When you write fiction or your perspective on a topic, your mind is running free. It learns to come up with ideas, thoughts and suggestions, some of which may even be 'whacky' or out-of-the-box. You\u2019re basically creating something new \u2013 either a story out of thin air or a new point of view. With a little practice, you get better at coming up with alternative perspectives and approaches to a situation, which can be a great help at work. 2. You get better at taking ownership. When you\u2019re writing a creative piece, you\u2019re the narrator and the protagonist in your story. You\u2019re the proverbial knight in shining armour, or, at the very least, the creator of the knight in shining armour! At work, this translates into taking initiative. You\u2019re better at approaching problems, tackling them head-on and coming up with possible solutions. 3. You can create a well-structured narrative. Creative writing is a very helpful exercise in arranging and organising your thoughts. It develops communication skills. Writing requires an engaging introduction, well-constructed and coherent paragraphs, and a strong conclusion that ties everything together. This improves your clarity of thought, attention to detail, ability to observe, notice patterns and connect the dots. 4. Your mind is constantly full of ideas. Creativity breeds creativity. The more you feed your imagination, the better you get at ideating, visualizing and creating. Brainstorming sessions at work will never be the same again. Your mind will be full of ideas, thinking faster and sharper, proposing breakthrough ideas and original thoughts. In conclusion, I believe that practising creative writing regularly will help you become a better problem solver, a self-starter, a critical, creative and original thinker, all of which are, in my opinion, extremely valuable skills.

            "answer_text": "There is a semantic problem here. On the one hand, you ask about 'being a writer.' A writer, semantically, is just what we call someone who writes, or strictly speaking, someone who is writing. 'creative' is nonsense adjective. It's formed from the verb 'to create' - which means to make things, and is usually used to imply that there's something unknown, mysterious or unknowable about how the creative process takes place. So the adjective creative would mean 'resembling an act of creation' 'or resembling someone who creates.' My question is, exactly how would you do that? So perhaps creative means (or is being used to mean) possessing that unknown, mysterious or unknowable quality we associate with acts of creation? My main concern here is that the answer is going to depend more on how people understand the expression 'be creative' than on what they know about the process of writing (of any kind of writing). I know very well that answers on Quora can have unexpected effects. They can go viral. Or attract a storm of criticism. Or pass completely unnoticed. But all we (by which I mean myself and other answerers) have done is try to write as clear, complete and helpful an answer as we can. I think that the variability in the response shows that in writing our Quora answers, there is an unknown, mysterious or unknowable factor. I would hope that the more experience and practice you have, the more skill you acquire in the art of written expression, and therefore, you develop a keener sense of the reaction you intend. To me, this sounds a lot like creativity. Which sounds like in order to write, you have to perform, to some degree, an act of creation. So my answer is yes (I think). I think the original question, however, begs another question: are there any people who are not creative? ",
