            "answer_text": "Top writers do not get paid for writing on Quora. They consider writing as their passion, and they don't write for money. Quora is not a freelancing website, it's a platform created to share knowledge among people. But they may have indirect benefit by writing on Quora, like Balaji Viswanathan (\u0baa\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bbf \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bcd)(Top writer and most followed writer on Quora) had said in one of his interviews with Unacademy that he had got opportunity to meet famous scientist Richard Muller through Quora and also those who are working in his company Invento were also hired through Quora. Here's the link of that video: An Interaction with Balaji Viswanathan (Most followed Writer on Quora.com in World) Not only he, but there are many people who are benefited from Quora and have gained knowledge which has helped them in their lives and whose value is much more than the money. If Quora would have been a paid site, then it wouldn't have had such a huge number of people using it. Since it's a free knowledge sharing platform many people have started writing answers on Quora.
