I only got 3 of them at the moment, but hope you\u2019ll read them and like them :D I have a bookmarked list at: Archive of Our Own Just use the filters on the right and enter in at \u201cOther tags to include\u201d just Jeon Jungkook/Kim Taehyung | V There you\u2019ll get a cRAP ton of Taekook fanfictions I\u2019ve liked. Mind you, most of them do have smut. So I\u2019m sorry if you want your innocence preserved TwT #1 Keep your pencil on my skin: This one was the best one I had read. It hit me right in the feels and it was so beautiful I cried. It does have smut in the last chapter so skip it if you feel uncomfortable. Link: https://archiveofourown.org/works/13970322 #2 Eclipse It\u2019s a supernatural AU! :D Eclipse has really good plot and the story flows very nicely. It also has multiple smut chapters. So again, skip those if you don\u2019t like it. Link: https://archiveofourown.org/works/13170726/chapters/30124269 #3 Serve & Protect Police AU! Storyline was great and Jungkook is an angsty baby in this one. Also. Whispers \u201cSmut.\u201d Hope you look these up and enjoy. If not you can also look at someone else\u2019s answer TwT ",
