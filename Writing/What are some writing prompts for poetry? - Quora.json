            "answer_text": "Hi Henri. Great question. I will take a different tack from the other answers you\u2019ve received. In my experience (writing for 45 years now (gasp!) and having taken part in and started many writer\u2019s groups, and having seen many people come and go as writers) the most essential writing prompt comes from within. It is not simply the desire to be \u201ca writer\u201d but the compulsion to write, a compulsion that, however stressful and troubling it can be, is also, at bottom one of the greatest pleasures one experiences. When I first started writing I didn\u2019t feel that compulsion. Mostly what I felt was the desire to be a writer, to be seen as a writer, to imagine myself a writer, and to fantasize obtaining all the glory and charisma I would experience as a writer. None of that is bad, but over time it is unlikely to remain compelling. In my case, all those fantasies about myself were enriched by these essentials that have kept me writing even tho I\u2019ve failed to obtain any fame and wealth: 1. the profound pleasure and wonder that my writing generates in me; 2. the clear sense that my writing is growing me, that it is enriching me, that it is elevating me; and 3. the certainty, in spite of my lack of fame, that what I\u2019m writing is exceptional and important. So I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a writer just starting out on the path. What I did when I was fairly new to writing was to read lots of poetry. I formed strong opinions about what I read. Some poetry I loved, and some I hated, but most of it was just plain drivel. When I would sit down to write I would read my most favorite poetry (Blake, Shelley, Milton, the biblical Prophets), and it usually didn\u2019t take many stanzas before suddenly ideas were popping into my head, and I\u2019d lay down my book and pick up my pen and get to work. I let other great writers stir my imagination, and that was sufficient to bring on my own genuine, inner urge to write, and to prompt me with exciting ideas to write about. Good luck, partner. It\u2019s a great adventure!! I\u2019ve done lots of things in my life, but there\u2019s NOTHING like writing! ",

            "answer_text": "Barnes and Noble\u2019s, if you have one near you, usually has some good books of writing prompts. Otherwise, there are probably some online. If you can\u2019t find any, you could always ask teachers/peers/friends/family. Beside that, here are some ideas: Write a poem about space in couplets or staggered couplets (staggered couplets as in: roses are red, violets are blue, I\u2019m feeling dead, how about you?)Write a diamante poem comparing two different things in your house, like your mom and dad, two pets, your siblings, your siblings and you, etc.Write two odes: one to a favorite food, one to something in nature.Write an acrostic about something in nature or something in human nature (creativity, love, discrimination, etc.)Write a haiku-lowku triad: a haiku, followed by a lowku, followed by another haiku.Hope I helped.
