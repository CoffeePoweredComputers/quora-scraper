            "answer_text": "The other two answers are great, but not complete. They write dates a few different ways here in Japan. Broadly, we can divide these into Japanese style and Western style. Western Style This is the same as most of the rest of the world uses, the standard Gregorian calendar. Most of the time they will style this using year/month/day format. So, for example, today\u2019s date is 6 Nov 2019, and this would be written 2019/11/6. This might be written with slashes or it might be written with kanji. In that case, our example date would become \uff12\uff10\uff11\uff19\u5e74\uff11\uff11\u6708\uff16\u65e5. Now occasionally you will find other ways of writing it, but that is the usual. Also of note is that documents written for foreigners may use either UK or US style when written out. So, in our example, 6 Nov 2019, or Nov 6, 2019. But when they shorten it to slashes, it will often use US style, so 11/6/2019, not 6/11/2019. Japanese Style This will use the name of the current historic era and will count from the enthronement of the emperor of that era. For example, we got a new emperor this year and his era is named \u4ee4\u548c (Reiwa), so today\u2019s date (6 Nov 2019) would be styled 6 Nov Reiwa 1. This will still follow the year month day format, so it\u2019d generally be styled \u4ee4\u548c\uff11\u5e74\uff11\uff11\u6708\uff16\u65e5 Combination You might often see it combined, so you\u2019d see something like this (\u4ee4\u548c\uff11\u5e74)\uff12\uff10\uff11\uff19\u5e74\uff11\uff11\u6708\uff16\u65e5 Forms also often seem to ask both dates. Whenever I have to fill out a form for my son\u2019s school, for instance, they want both the Japanese year and the Western year for all dates. For many dates you just memorize it. For example, I was born in 1978, which is Sh\u014dwa (\u662d\u548c) 53. I also have the Japanese years for my wife and kids memorized, which pretty much covers all the dates I need for official paperwork. Worth noting, usage of the Japanese system is fading in many businesses. Any government paperwork you do, however, will still use it. ",

            "answer_text": "With ink. In paper that is. -Yeah, but you were asked how. Ah yes, excuse me.  You gotta use the yyyy/mm/dd format. First the year, then the month and finally, the day. But, you don't just write 2020/4/18, or well, you can. You'll write 2020\u5e744\u670818\u65e5\u3002 \u5e74 (\u3068\u3057 / toshi) means year.\u6708 (\u3052\u3064 / getsu) means month.\u65e5 (\u3072 / Hi) means day. Pretty simple stuff, hope I could help. Thanks for dating my answer, Zinedine  Edit: Japan uses two calendar systems, the Gregorian and the traditional or nengo. Nengo is used for official purposes and plenty of people use it as well, it's divided in eras that start when a new emperor takes the throne and ends when he dies or abdicates. You can use Sonohini - Japanese Date Conversion to convert it, but the date format as I stated above remains the same. Thanks Roland Hechtenberg for the observation. ",

So today would be 2019\u5e747\u670818\u65e5. You can see the kanji for year (nen, in case you need for phonetic entry to get the kanji), month (gatsu, same as for moon), and day (nichi, same as for sun) there. However, the year can also be written as 1\u5e74, because this is the Year One of the reign of the Reiwa Emperor. Both international year and reign year are acceptable. Side note: Addresses also go biggest-to-smallest: Nation, prefecture, county, city, ward, neighborhood, block, building, apartment, person\u2019s name\u2014leaving out any that aren\u2019t necessary. (For example, since I live in a major city, I never bother writing my prefecture or county, since to zip code and city name will be plenty for the post office to route mail to my city.) ",

This system just started anew this year with the abdication of the Emperor Heisei and the promotion of Emperor Reiwa to the throne. So the date for Nov 5, 2019 is written as 1/11/5 with the year coming first. Nov 5, 2018 would be written 30/11/5 with the kanji for \u201cHeisei\u201d \u5e73\u6210 preceding the number 30, the last full year of Emperor Heisei\u2019s reign. Hope that helps. ",
