            "answer_text": "Everyone is saying Python. While I agree that Python is fairly simple to learn and doesn\u2019t have a lot of syntax, I don\u2019t think it is the least complicated. I kind of like Gurmeet's answer, which Is C. The C language is simple in terms syntax, and also simple in terms of understanding what it will make the machine do\u2014It\u2019s just really hard to make sure the thing you told the machine to do is the thing it should actually be doing. C is a great language if you never make any mistakes while programming. For me, the answer is Scheme. Scheme is a dialect of lisp that has almost no syntax. It just has parentheses and a few literals for different types. Because it takes almost no time to learn Scheme syntax, it has been one of the most popular languages for beginning in computer science for many years. The teacher doesn\u2019t have to spend much time teaching the language and can spend more time teaching concepts in programming. However, this doesn\u2019t automatically mean Scheme is easy. If you\u2019re writing complex functions (which isn\u2019t really the best approach to Scheme), you can have trouble getting all the parentheses in the right places if you don\u2019t take care to make good use of whitespace. Today, many institutions have moved to teaching Python instead. I don\u2019t think this is because the language is simpler (though it does get rid of most of the parentheses, which helps), but because it is much more practical than Scheme. You can do some interesting things with Scheme through Racket and Guile, and you can use C libraries with Chicken, but there is nothing in the Scheme world to compare with the Python ecosystem. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what factor you are considering complexity. If you are considering it to be the syntax, then Python is the least complicated. And that\u2019s why it is considered a great first programming language to learn. It is interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scale. It also has a wide scope. It can be used for web programming (django, Zope, Google App Engine, and much more). But it also can be used for desktop applications (Blender 3D, or even for games pygame). Python can also be translated into binary code like java. Python is used for developing sites. And Python does not have to maintain a lot of different brackets! It does not have to be compiled to run! It is easy to read! In python, there is an API for everything, from natural language processing to desktop notifications! Many people are saying C. So I would like to show an example - This is a Hello World program in C - #include <stdio.h>\u00a0int main()\u00a0{\u00a0   printf(\"Hello World!\");\u00a0   return 0;\u00a0}\u00a0And this is an Hello World program in Python - print('Hello World')\u00a0What do you think now? \u201cEnjoy the rest of your programming day!\u201d ",
