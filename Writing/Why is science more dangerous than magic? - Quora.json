            "answer_text": "Science is NOT more dangerous than magic. It\u2019s the other way around! Man learned a long time ago that the best way to manipulate people is by controlling their beliefs. If you control what people believe, you can control the people. You can get them to do almost anything. Magic works by manipulating a person\u2019s belief. You make a person believe one thing, while an entire other thing is actually going on. It\u2019s misdirection. It\u2019s deception. The ultimate goal is to deceive. Magic is the realm of secrets designed to keep the public in the dark. To keep people ignorant as to what\u2019s really happening. Science is the pursuit of knowledge and facts in such a way that everyone understands. The ultimate goal of science is to spread knowledge and awareness. To enlighten. Imagine yourself locked in a dark closet. You fumble around in the darkness, not knowing what\u2019s going on or which way to turn. You could easily hurt yourself. Imagine someone else can see in that darkness. They can direct you. But you are at their mercy. Then imagine you are in the same dark closet, but you have a flashlight. Now you can examine the facts of your condition. You can find the door knob and let yourself out. You are enlightened. Enlightenment good. Deception bad. ",

            "answer_text": "Dangerous? Hmmmm\u2026.. well let\u2019s break a few things down first. What do you mean by magic? I\u2019m assuming you are talking about the fictional hocus-pocus stuff witches and wizards do. OK for one, that doesn\u2019t exist. Two. Science is based on facts. Observable things. Like look, the moon orbits the earth in roughly a month. Humans have been observing this since we can see. There is nothing dangerous about knowing how the universe works. Now if you are talking about making weapons, nuclear reactors, medicine, telecommunication technology, Artificial Intelligence, etc\u2026 then that is something else. Science brought you the internet. The same internet that allows you to read these words. That isn\u2019t dangerous. But if someone is looking up poison\u2019s so they can kill their husband, then that is dangerous. A knife can be used to make dinner. Or slaughter a family of 5. Magic, well it just isn\u2019t real. So it can\u2019t be dangerous. The only danger in the past with it, was ignorant villagers that would be so afraid that someone might be doing magic to them, that they will turn and kill their own kid\u2019s. ",
