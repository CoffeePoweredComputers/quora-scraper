Here is my advice on pickup lines taken from an excerpt from my book: THE TRUTH ABOUT OPENING PICKUP LINES Social scientists in several settings and experiments have determined that there are basically 3 types of pickup or opening lines, and which type are most effective with women: 1. Cute/Flippant opening line \u2013 These involve humor and generally should be used when and only you have established welcoming eye contact, because they can also be the worst failures if not. Example: \u201cI don\u2019t usually let cute girls hit on me, but for you I\u2019ll make an exception\u201d 2. Direct opening line \u2013 These consist of directly approaching a woman without any pretense whatsoever. The direct and innocuous opening lines have tested to be much more successful, especially for the inexperienced. For example: \u201cHi, my name is \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. what\u2019s yours?\u201d or \u201cHi \u2013 do you mind if I sit next to you?\u201d 3. Innocuous opening line \u2013 This is when you use something in the environment or you refer to something happening to start a conversation \u2013 for example \u201cHi, would you happen to know what time it is?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s good to eat here?\u201d It\u2019s been demonstrated many times that generally women who are most interested in long term relationships respond best to innocuous and direct opening lines, while women who are interested in short term relationships or one night stands respond better to the cute/flippant opening line. Most men believe that the cute/flippant opening line is the best, but studies show that in most cases as noted above; they are not \u2013 except in those cases where the women are not looking for a long-term relationship. Perhaps that is precisely why many men like the cute/flippant opening line best \u2013 because it saves them time if they are looking just for one nighters. The Cute/Flippant opening line also runs the biggest risk of failure when the content is cheesy or corny, when it\u2019s delivered poorly, you haven\u2019t established preselection and it\u2019s being delivered to the woman who is more interested in a long-term relationship. If you\u2019re going to use this type of opening, you should first establish welcoming eye contact and/or have supreme confidence when delivering it, otherwise it can be a recipe for disaster because it will sound to her deceptive and the person delivering it untrustworthy.
