            "answer_text": "Most of the answers here are simply wrong. People get follow-up emails absolutely wrong. Let\u2019s examine some common follow-up emails and why they fail to deliver: 1. Sending a new email with a new subject line \u2013 \u201cDid you get my message?\u201d This follow-up is by far the worst on the list. By creating a new email thread, you essentially tell me you don\u2019t respect me. Polluting my inbox with more of the same clutter is a sure way to show how little you care about my personal space (albeit virtual), time and inbox hygiene. The judgmental, needy subject line doesn\u2019t help, either. \u201cDid you get my message?\u201d You know very well that I got your email. I simply don\u2019t care about replying to you. You\u2019re not going to guilt me into responding to your email by sending more junk. 2. \u201cI know you must be super busy but did you get a chance to check my email?\u201d \u201cI know you must be super busy\u201d is another way to say \u201cI know what I\u2019m selling here doesn\u2019t have any value to you, and your time is much more precious than my offering but I really, really hope that you\u2019re a nice person and reply to me.\u201d It\u2019s needy as hell. If you genuinely believe what you have to offer is valuable then don\u2019t apologize for taking people\u2019s time. You\u2019re providing an actual return on their time. Also, people are always busy. No need to state the obvious \u2013 you\u2019re wasting precious space. 3. \u201cWas checking my email and noticed I didn\u2019t get a response from you.\u201d This one drives me bananas. I missed the news that you\u2019re my new boss now. Keep this type of authoritarian follow-ups for subordinate, not strangers on the internet. 4. \u201cWondering if my email made it through\u2026\u201d It did. Do not wonder. And if it didn\u2019t, your follow-up is not going to help either. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Some OK follow-ups: 1. Is this relevant to you? This email is slightly better than the previous follow-ups. It doesn\u2019t pretend, guilt or judge people. It also allows the person an easy \u201cyes/no\u201d answer. 2. Bump. This is a follow-up trick I saw for the first time back in 2015 on the Sumo blog. It\u2019s short, quirky and creative, so it works\u2026sometimes. \u2028\u2028Other times, especially with an older audience, expect to get a confused \u201cWhat?\u201d Not everybody understands where Bump comes from. It\u2019s an activity used in message boards when you want to push an outdated thread higher on the board\u2019s listing \u2013 you add a new comment \u201cbump.\u201d \u2014\u2014\u2014 GOOD follow-ups:  I\u2019ve also provided the first email, so you have the context. The follow-up email: Hey David, Integrations reduce churn and increase CLTV: We offer native integrations. A lot more people use native integrations than Zapier.We reuse the work your dev team did to integrate with Zapier. Our solution is literally plug and play.I think this might be valuable to Handwrytten. Let me know if you are interested in increasing CLTV through integrations? I'd be happy to share more info. I\u2019m not apologizing about wasting their timeI\u2019m not being needyI\u2019m not pretending I believe my email went missingInstead: I expand on the value from the first email \u201creduce churn and increase customer lifetime value\u201d.I proceed to provide more benefit-oriented information about our offering.I address the most common objection by explaining how easy it is to integrate our solution.I confirm that I truly believe this is going to be useful for the company and use a Company tag personalization.I finish the email with a clear call to action, that is easy to answer and contains the main value. By asking if people care about the value I provided in the CTA, I pretty much make it impossible to answer No.Another good follow-up email:  It\u2019s bad to send more than one link in your first email, but acceptable to do so in the follow-ups. Once a person receives an email in their inbox, all follow-ups will get in there, too. I've packed this follow-up with information and value for the prospect. I'm actually sharing a relevant content with our prospect that affirms the benefits of our offering without being salesy or needy. We also don\u2019t expect that everybody will read the report, so we summarize the key takeaways in the emails. I've highlighed each point/benefit with numbers. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is some of the logic I follow: If someone doesn\u2019t open your email three times in a row, stop emailing him or her.If someone doesn\u2019t open your email two times in a row, send them a unique email the 3rd time to help increase open rates.Don\u2019t email people too often as this will more likely cause your list to get burnt out.Leverage double opt-ins to help ensure that you are only emailing people who want your emails.If an email bounces back, remove that email address from your list.Leverage marketing automation (the video on this page is a bit salesy, but it should give you a good understanding of what you can do with marketing automation and segmentation). Don\u2019t forget the basics Before I get into the more advanced ways to increase your deliverability, you should make sure you aren\u2019t missing out on the basics. Here are basic things to keep in mind when leveraging email marketing: Avoid red \u2013 red is a loud color and is used a lot by spammers. It could potentially set off spam filters.Misleading subject lines \u2013 from blank subject lines to ones that don\u2019t even match your copy, be careful using them because they are a big part of the spam algorithm email providers employ.Capital letters \u2013 avoid using all capital letters within your email or subject line.Don\u2019t be too excessive with symbols \u2013 avoid using too many question marks, dollar signs and exclamation marks\u2026 especially in a row.Don\u2019t link too much \u2013 from your calls to actions to links within the email, ideally you shouldn\u2019t use more than two or three links.Unsubscribe links \u2013 each of your emails should contain an unsubscribe link. The harder you make it for people to unsubscribe, the more problems you will have.Be thorough \u2013 make sure you include a proper reply to email address and a from address so that people can get in touch with you if they have any issues.",
