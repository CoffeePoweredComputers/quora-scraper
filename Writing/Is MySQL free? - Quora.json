            "answer_text": "Use of MySQL with an Open Source License The following list collects the different situations in which one may freely use MySQL in the sense of GPL: MySQL can be used without cost if an application is locally developed and not used commercially. It is only when the resulting solution is to be sold to customers that the question of licensing comes into play. This rule is expressed on the MySQL home page as follows:Free use for those who never copy, modify or distribute.MySQL can be used freely within a web site. If you also develop a PHP application and install it with your Internet service provider, you do not have to make your PHP code freely available in the sense of GPL.Likewise, an Internet service provider may make MySQL available to its customers without having to pay MySQL license fees. (Since MySQL is running exclusively on the ISP computer, this application is considered internal.)Finally, MySQL license can be used free of charge for all projects that themselves run under the GPL or comparable free license. (If you have developed a new free e-mail client for Linux, say, and wish to store e-mails in a MySQL database, you may do so without further ado.)",
