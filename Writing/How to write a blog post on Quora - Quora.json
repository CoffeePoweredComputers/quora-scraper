When it asks you to give the URL for your blog, it's the subdomain part you want in the final link to your blog (http://yourblog.quora.com). For example, my blog's URL is http://thenakedlistener.quora.com. Name it anything you want, but use no spaces in the URL.  Once you've created your blog on Quora, then you go to your own profile page, click on \"Posts\" in the left-hand panel, and your blog will show up in the bottom panel. Click on the \"Write Post\" button to start a new post. ",

You can find it at Kaleidoscope Down Under First click on your avatar to bring up the menu. Select Blogs. Below your personal data, just right of centre on a blue tab, select Create a New Blog. You will be prompted to supply a name for the blog. You choose. And a URL. I tried half a dozen before I found one that was relatively appropriate which was not already in use. Once you\u2019ve done that just select Write Post (toward the left) and go for your life. You can put in any text you like and pictures are dead easy: just copy and paste. Hope that helps. ",

[Disclaimer: I\u2019m not a lawyer, and haven\u2019t dug down into the details; I assume that what I post here I give freely to Quora and the Internet anyway.] I\u2019m going to test using Quora as part of a Keyword Research and SEO strategy (see Keyword Research Strategy for updates) and I\u2019ll include blogging in that > watch this space!
