If you\u2019d like to publish, you can adhere to a few rules to ensure the document is formatted properly for that purpose. Don\u2019t use the Tab key.Create a Title page and insert a Page Break (Ctrl Enter).Format each chapter heading with the Heading 1 Style.Insert a Page Break at the end of each chapter.At the beginning of you book, usually after the Title page, insert a Table of Contents by clicking Insert and select Table of contents from the drop-down menu.Download the document as a Word fileUpload the Word file to your publishing platform of choice and run through the troubleshooting to remove spelling and formatting errors.Hope that helps!
