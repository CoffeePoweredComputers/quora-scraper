            "answer_text": "I\u2019m in love with you, and I\u2019m not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I\u2019m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we\u2019re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we\u2019ll ever have, and I am in love with you. What else? She is so beautiful. You don't get tired of looking at her. You never worry if she is smarter than you, you know she is. She is funny without ever being mean. I love her. I am so lucky to love her Van Houten. You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world but you do have some say in who hurts you. And I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.  - The fault in our stars This is what love does: It makes you want to rewrite the world. It makes you want to choose the characters, build the scenery, guide the plot. The person you love sits across from you, and you want to do everything in your power to make it possible, endlessly possible. And when it\u2019s just the two of you, alone in a room, you can pretend that this is how it is, this is how it will be. The moment you fall in love feels like it has centuries behind it, generations - all of them rearranging themselves so this precise, remarkable intersection could happen. In your heart, in your bones, no matter how silly you know it is, you feel that everything has been leading to this, all the secret arrows were pointing here, the universe and time itself crafted this long ago, and you are just now realizing it, you are just now arriving at the place you were always meant to be.- Everyday I wanted so badly to lie down next to her on the couch, to wrap my arms around her and sleep. Not fuck, like in those movies. Not even have sex. Just sleep together in the most innocent sense of the phrase. But I lacked the courage and she had a boyfriend and I was gawky and she was gorgeous and I was hopelessly boring and she was endlessly fascinating. So I walked back to my room and collapsed on the bottom bunk, thinking that if people were rain, I was drizzle and she was hurricane.- Looking for Alaska If you stay, I'll do whatever you want. I'll quit the band, go with you to New York. But if you need me to go away, I'll do that, too. I was talking to Liz and she said maybe coming back to your old life would be too painful, that maybe it'd be easier for you to erase us. And that would suck, but I'd do it. I can lose you like that if I don't lose you today. I'll let you go. If you stay.- If I stay ",
