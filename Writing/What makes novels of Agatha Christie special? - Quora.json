            "answer_text": "This is going to be a slightly long answer. In my opinion Christie\u2019s works are special because of these reasons. Ingenious plots - Most of her novels have really complex plots which are very intriguing. In fact, a curious thing I have noted is that - if I narrate the central theme or idea of the story to another person, it will have enough elements to arouse his curiosity that he feels compelled to read the book. She paces the book well - throwing twists at regular intervals so that it keeps you glued. The complex plot is then explained as a simple crime at the end - keeping the logic intact and satisfying the reader\u2019s expectations.Unique Settings - The settings for most of the crimes mentioned in her book are so varied that you really want to know the mechanics of how it happened. Islands, trains, planes, ships, archaeological expeditions, Big Mansions, Parties, Golf clubs, Murder hunts, late night card games - these form the backgrounds for crimes in her novels - Need I say more?Multiple Genres - Although her novels have a central mystery as its plot, the way she presents it each time is so unique. Some are hardcore investigation based, some feature less investigation and orient more towards thriller, some verge more towards adventure featuring amateurs and some even steer slightly towards a little scary thriller kind. And she handles all these different genres so deftly keeping the readers engaged all throughout.Great detectives who are very likeable - Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. They are undoubtedly two of the most popular detectives ever written. What is interesting is that even in some of the lesser known novels of Christie featuring amateur detectives like Tommy & Tuppence or Lady Eileen - there are well written central characters whose spirit for adventure and curiosity makes you root for them. If you dont think so - try reading \u201cWhy didnt they ask Evans?\u201dInvestigation Approach - Oh Boy ! How could I miss this. While most detectives focus on material evidences to trace the killer, Christie uses a different approach - specially Poirot. He finds out the murderer by having conversation with the suspects. His belief is that even the most clever criminal will make a mistake unknowingly while talking and when he does that \u201cPapa Poirot\u201d will be waiting for him. A clever mix of psychology, intuitions and battle of words/mind games with the murderer ultimately defeating him. Often the investigation is modeled on the lines of Rashomon effect(where the same incident is described differently by several people). \u201cFive Little Pigs\u201d - one of her classics is an example.A clever mix of suspects - Christie\u2019s whodunits always have 7\u20138 suspects whose background and details are either explained upfront or revealed as the investigation progresses. The interactions between them feels very real and the buildup to the tragedy is exquisite. Christie also brings in some kind of twists by revealing some characters in the story as potential suspects each with a solid motive to carry out the crime. The result ? You have a list of people all who whom have the reason to do the murder - but you just don\u2019t know who did it. An interesting problem isnt it? Checkout Murder on the Orient Express and Cards on the table where she manages to spring surprises by suddenly making all the characters suspects.Red Herrings - Christie is adept when it comes to confusing her readers and concealing the identity of the murderer. She uses a wide variety of writing methods (for Christie readers - you know what I am referring to :D ), confusing clues, improbable scenarios to take our suspicions off the murderer. The result - the ending reveal comes as an absolute shocker. The plot devices and red herrings Christie has devised are unparalleled !Playing fair with the reader - This is another quality of Christie\u2019s mysteries I truly admire. The murderer is always a person who has already been introduced before. The clues necessary for spotting him have already been presented to us before the final reveal. But alas ! we fail to place them together. I am not saying she has played fair in all her books - but certainly in most of them. Basically each of her mysteries is a challenge to the reader. Another mystery writer who is good at this is Ellery Queen. In Queen mysteries - before the final reveal - the writer poses a challenge saying. You now have all the clues needed to spot the culprit. Can you do that? That\u2019s one hell of a way to grab one\u2019s attention.Logical conclusions -There is a certain order and method with which the detective explains how he arrived at the culprit. He goes step by step starting from the first hint he received, connecting the evidences, eliminating the suspects and in the end zeroing in on the murderer. Very similar to solving a maths problem. And it makes for an interesting read. Couple of examples - The final chapter of ABC murders and Murder of Roger Ackroyd. Its always a delight to read the finale of a Christie book !So, if you have not yet read a Christie book - I suggest you get down right to it ! ",

            "answer_text": "The queen of crime novels largely recognised..her novels prove it so.I read \u201cMURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS \u201d my first ever crime novel.I was gasped by the way every character was thoroughly introduced.Even the diagram of the compartments of the train and who occupied which was so perfectly shown that you just have to refer to the schematic every time to get a clear understanding of what exactly may have happened in that scenario ,which just gives you the thrill which people envisage from a crime novel.And then their is HERCULE POIROT,the sherlock of Agatha Cristie..truly a wit.You don\u2019t recognise his intellect earlier while reading ,but at the end you are just enthralled by his shrewdness and his adroit way of approaching the criminal. My second novel \u201cAND THEN THERE WERE NONE\u201d as widely recognised the best agatha cristie work is absolutely veracious.The poem in the opening just gives you the right stimulation to read the novel in one go. This excitement just continues in all the other novels..I have not read all but surely that would be the case. So you see all in all agatha cristie manages to keep you on the toe..influences you to think everytime a murder is attempted..and manages a conclusion with an awesome deduction. And that is what I think makes her novel special!! ",
