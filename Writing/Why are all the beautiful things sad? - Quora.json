            "answer_text": "They are not sad. Thing is just like anything else, even beautiful things come to an end. So, when they end, we become sad. Just like when a bad thing ends, we become happy. The analogy here is a mouth wide open, when any food comes we eat it. So just like we eat sweet we end up eating bitter also with same enthusiasm. So, next time a bad thing ends , don't be too happy, you will see that you won't get that sad when a beautiful thing ends. You will be learning just how things are. ",
