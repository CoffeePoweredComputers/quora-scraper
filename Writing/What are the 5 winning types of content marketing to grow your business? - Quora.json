Answers on Video Marketing Blog Posts With blog posts, you have the liberty to cater to your niche audience by writing detailed articles on topics that matter to them. Before writing the blog, do good keyword research and try to include as many keywords as possible to rank well in SEO. Also, try to include images or GIFs so that your readers have some visuals instead of just reading text. You can also give out links to other websites and ask them for testimonials in return. This way you both will benefit. Newsletters Your customers have specifically requested to hear from you by subscribing to your newsletter. Don\u2019t bore them with your product updates with every newsletter. Write about topics that will be useful for your customers or their end customers if they are providing services to others. It need not always be about your product, you can talk about the trending topics in your niche market. Best newsletters are those which are filled with humor, everyone loves that. With all serious emails piling in the inbox, a good laugh will definitely make your business stand out in customer's minds. Keep building your email subscriptions. In the current scenario, any social media can shut you down anytime. It is risky to depend only on social media, but the emails you collected will always stay with you irrespective of the platform you are using. Podcasts Podcasts have become very popular these days. Everyone is multitasking, your customers could be driving, cooking, working out, relaxing, etc. All they have to do is plug their earphones or speaker and they can hear from you. This way you can keep communicating with your audience and keep them engaged. The best way to add value in podcasts is by inviting industry experts onto your podcasts. This way your audience will find value in your podcast and you will be seen as an equal to the expert. Case Studies Case Studies are like testimonials, your customers can clearly see how their competitors or businesses in similar space have used your product and benefited. Numbers are very important, simple graphs with the most important KPIs would be perfect for your customers to arrive at the value proposition of your product/service. Don\u2019t make it too long as well, put yourself in your customer's shoes and think of what info you might be looking for and include those, rest all details can be ignored. Give them a clear picture of how they can use your product/service specifically for their business. eBooks eBooks make it easy for your users to read about the topic in detail. The key here is to keep the eBook interesting, don\u2019t make it a boring text dump. Include graphs, quotes, testimonials, stats from reliable sources, and keep your audience engaged till the end. You want them to go through all the points you want to talk about. You can also use eBooks as a lead-gen tool also, you send eBooks only to those who have given their email. ",
