            "answer_text": "INFPs are actually very good at arguments, although their arguments tend to be very emotional. Although INFPs don\u2019t like conflict, arguments (especially online) are an exception. The Fi and Ne aspects of the INFP personality are great for making INFPs think about ideas and theories. The Fi aspect makes us ruminate and think a lot about ideas, and the Ne aspect makes us look at the world and frame it in models and theories based on our ruminations. We are suprisingly good at looking at things from the bigger perspective, and can see the big picture really easily. This lets us argue very, very effectively, and our passionate eloquence with words gives us a huge advantage in any debate, along with our emotionally-laden tirades. INFPs actually enjoy talking and arguing a lot. I think this is because we don\u2019t see it as \u201cconflict\u201d per se but more like a game that we play to win. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the problem with INFPs and argument (ie, debate). Yes, we can be logical, but only to a point. Because, at the heart of who we are, we don\u2019t really care so much about logic and logical arguments. Honestly, we truly just. don\u2019t. care. We only truly care about the underlying human aspect. So, yes, we can engage in the logical argument, but will almost never win. We will either bring in our values or other \u201csoft issues,\u201d which will be our destruction. We cave. Because our values are our values. And we can\u2019t argue those. They just are what they are. If we are forced to argue logically, the best way for us to do so is in writing. In an oral debate or argument, we really struggle. The reason for this is that things don\u2019t come to us in a logical sequence. Our thinking is nonlinear. It\u2019s more like cooking popcorn. Ideas just popping up randomly from all over. We can\u2019t make a logical argument (if it hasn\u2019t been prepared beforehand) on our feet. We can, however, in writing. Because we can pop all our popcorn out on paper, then organize it later. Your question about heated courtroom scenes: I do feel INFPs could do well in these situations. Mainly because they would be prepared and would have already done their analysis of the case and thought about it from every angle well before entering a courtroom. If they believed in their client - and an INFP must believe in their client - and in the validity of their claim, I think an INFP could argue quite passionately and effectively for their client. It\u2019s all in the preparation beforehand. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it depends on two things: Did the INFP have some time to think before engaging in the argument?Is this argument violating any of the INFPs\u2019 values/morals?If you were to surprise an INFP with some random argument and expect them to argue back on the spot, you might get a jumbled response that doesn\u2019t seem logical at all. However, give them a little time to think about it and sort out their thoughts, and you can get an INFP logically arguing like an INTJ. Granted, taking some time to sort out thoughts can help all MBTI personalities think logically, but I think it\u2019ll help an INFP the most because they need this time to distinguish whether their logic is actually logical or if their logic is being manipulated by their emotions.One of the few exceptions to this, in my opinion, is if you wanted to argue about a value an INFP holds highly. I believe this is one of the few exceptions where an INFP can and will argue with you on the spot until either you change your mind or you both agree to disagree (an INFP will not meet you in the middle in this kind of argument). I think this is so because an INFP most likely has thought of ways to defend their values already, and it\u2019s just sitting in their argument vault ready to be pulled out instantly when their values are challenged.
