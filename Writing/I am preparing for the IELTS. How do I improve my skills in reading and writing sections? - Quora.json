            "answer_text": "IELTS assesses the english language proficiency on four aspects: Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. Band scores are used for each language sub-skill that range from 0-9. No minimun score is required to pass the test. Instead, each institute sets a different threshold. The assessment is done in two modules. One comprises of Reading, Writing and Listening. Other is the Speaking assessment. These four parts are divided into time slots.  Reading: 60 minsWriting: 60 minsListening: 30 minsSpeaking: around 15 mins Reading assessment is done on general topics from books, magazines, newspapers etc. A variety of question types is put up on the basis of the text. The answers to the questions are judged upon spelling and grammar. So, go through dictionaries and journals. These will boost up your wording capacity and vocabulary.  Writing assessment is done on two topics: 1) You've to desribe a graph or any diagram in your own words and 2) You've to write up your views on a general problem or any discussed issue. You'll be losing marks if your answer is too short or does not relate to the topic. Now for this, you've to practice. Practice a lot. Regular practice will take you to a point where you will be able to defeat any topic provided and describe whatever you're asked to. Yes, concentrate more on the general topics. The highlighted ones are more prone to come. Listening assessment comprises four sections, with ten questions in each section.  Social situations and educational situations are the topics. The most important part is that each section is heard only once. So, grab the most out of it. Watch some American series or movies (without subtitles :P ) This will surely increase your listening skills plus you'll get some refreshment. Again, spellings and grammar should be taken care of.  Speaking assessment is an in person interview between the test taker and an examiner. First part is the introduction interview. You could be asked about yourself and any other general topic, and this must be impressive. You have to keep them engaged and make them listen to you. Second and Third part are related. Now this is an imporant phase of the test. What you speak, and How you deliver your words gives you the score. Try being fluent. Search for topics, and without any preparation, deliver a speech and record it. Do it daily. You'll soon see the change.  Good luck with your exam :)  ",
