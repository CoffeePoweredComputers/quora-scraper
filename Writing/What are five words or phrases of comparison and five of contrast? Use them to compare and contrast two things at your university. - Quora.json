            "answer_text": "You specify one university but you need two things for a comparison so I will compare two faculties, departments or groups of students. COMPARISONS The Faculty of Arts is older than the Faculty of Medicine. The Faculty of Medicine is more prestigious than the Faculty of Arts. There are not as many students registered in the Faculty of Medicine as there are in the Faculty of Medicine. The number of international students in the Faculty of Medicine is comparable to that in the Faculty of Arts. Just as international students have to pay for their tuition, so do domestic students. CONTRASTS The Faculty of Arts was opened in 1911 , but the Faculty of Medicine not until a decade later. The Faculty of Medicine is a prestigious faculty whereas the Faculty of Science has brought the university into disrepute in recent years. There are almost 50000 students enrolled in the Faculty of Arts. Conversely, only slightly more than 11000 students are registered with the Faculty of Medicine. Both domestic and international students have to pay tuition fees. Admittedly, it is a little higher for international students. Most international students come from China. However, a large number come from India as well. ",
