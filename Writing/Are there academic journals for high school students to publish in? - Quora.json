            "answer_text": "High school students can publish in mainstream journals, but there are several journals specifically for them to publish in. In theory, high school students could publish in any academic journal provided they submit work that meets the criteria of the journal. In practice this is difficult and will almost always be under the mentorship of a senior academic. Being an author of an academic article normally requires intellectual input and involvement in drafting or editing, which is difficult for many undergraduates to achieve, let alone school students. High school students have published in academic journals - you can find the news stories[1][2] - but the fact that a high schooler getting published is newsworthy shows how rare it is. That said, there are a number of websites that are self-styled \u201chigh school journals\u201d. Most academic journals publish original research following peer review by experts and it is not clear whether these journals meet those standards. I found these current and former journals: Curieux Academic Journal, since March 2017International High School Science Journal, a print journal from August 2015 to 2016 (now closed?). See for example: Dec 2015Journal of Emerging Investigators, run by graduate students at Harvard University since 2012Columbia Junior Science Journal, a spin-off of Columbia Undergraduate Science Journal from 2015The National High School Journal of Science, since 2009E=mc2, a maths journal at the University of Chicago since 2005 and supported by the National Science FoundationEureka Science Journal - on Google Play, a journal in an app since 2014 though currently disabled.JOURNYS, a Journal of Youths in Science since 2009, though I couldn't get their website to work (journys.org). Check it out on the Wayback Machine.Eye on Science, a former journal in English and French in Toronto from 2001.[3] See the Wayback MachineEn Kephalos Science Journal, from 2010-2013 (see En Kephalos Science Journal on the Wayback Machine)Also see: Science Articles for Kids and TeensFrontiers for Young Minds, reviewed by young people but written by scientistsFootnotes[1] How I published in a scientific journal at age 12[2] Tennessee High School Students Publish in Top Science Journal[3] Eye on Science: New Journal Reaches Out to High School Students",

            "answer_text": "In actuality, every academic journal can publish high school students (unless it has a very unusual policy). Consider the following publications by high school students. I have included the names of the journals in which they were published.

If you have done advanced work that has furthered the understanding of a given field, then you should definitely submit to a professional academic journal. Realize that you will need to put in a lot of work to accomplish this, but if you are passionate about what you are doing, you can succeed.

I would go over to a near-by college library and read some of the articles to get a feel for how they are written. Then take your ideas to the head of the Philosophy department at that college or another college, preferably with some recommendation from one of your high school teachers. Then with the professor and your high school teacher, work through how you would cast your ideas into a journal article. All the best. ",
