            "answer_text": "I like your question, and I like the answers where people describe what they do, rather than try to solve the problem of how to do a rewrite. I think each writer creates a unique process. In my case - and this is unusual - my stories tend to come out close to final on first draft. That is, most of the time, I can write a story, and the final publishable version is not very different from the first draft. That is rare, so parts of my process might not be useful. But here goes, anyway. I rewrite several times. Each rewrite has a different purpose. If I don't finish a story in one sitting, I rewrite the part I've written before I go on to write more. This both gets me in writing mode and also improves continuity of style at all levels.Once a story is done, I let is sit at least over night, and then up to a week. Then I read it and change it as I read. This simply makes it better.After this, I take several passes, each one for a different purposeConsistency of style and themeIs the reader going to discover things at a pace I'm comfortable with? There's a range of catching on early, but not too early, or late, but not too late.Clarity of each scene.Clarity of each passage of exposition.Clarity of dialog. Is it possible to tell who is speaking each line, not only because I say so, but also because each person has a distinctive voice?Checking satisfaction of the resolution and inevitability. Checking flow between paragraphs.Making each paragraph excellentThen I record a reading of the story. I listen as I tell the story, and make changes. I wait a day or two. I listen to the recording and I make more changes. Excellent stories read well and move in the rhythm of the breath - or have a good reason for not doing so.I read the story a few more times, changing anything that feels like it needs changing.At that point, the story is ready to go to my editor, who will help me see the story in context of its genre and possible places of publication. Sometimes, that leads to rewrites that challenge me. For example, right now, I'm improving my writing by writing six different versions of one paragraph about one minor character to see what works best. When my editor and I agree it is ready, we take it through line editing and proofreading, which she and her team do as a professional service. Then I review all their changes and suggestions. ",

            "answer_text": "Short stories have characters, goals, motivations, and conflicts just like a full length novel. The story should include the protagonist (character),the antagonist (could be a person or a situation to overcome or a goal), something at stake (motivation), and an obstacle (conflict).In addition your story should focus on what changes not what happens, include a hook or unique element, and have emotional appeal.   First I write the short story out in full.  Then I go back and pick apart each sentence.  I make sure my verb tenses are correct, that I'm showing and not telling, and that my point of view is right. I take out any trite writing.  I replace words with better words.  I make sure I use some the five senses if I can.  I try to write deeper, meaning I give a little bit of background information in the sentence, rather than do it through narrative.  I make sure the first sentence and the third sentence and the sentence at the bottom of the page have hooks.  I make sure the dialogue is realistic.  I examine all words that end in -ing or -ly.  They are generally paired with 'was' or 'were'.  Get rid of them.  They are 'telling' not 'showing'.  I take a good look at the word 'it' for the same reason.  It rained is telling. Show us.  I try to eliminate 'he' and 'she' if they are overused.  I limit my use of dialogue tags.  You don't need to say he said and she said every time. And I bring the story to an end by coming full circle.  Meaning I reference something I said in the beginning and show how the character as grown or changed.  Then I go back and read it again out loud.  At this point I may still do some tweaking.  ",
