            "answer_text": "The only time a male character should feel \u201cdifferent\u201d than a female character (or vice versa) is when gender is a theme of the story, or if you are specifically trying to highlight some difference. A character is a character. If you\u2019re doing it right, that means that they are a big pile of characteristics, hopes, goals, fears, struggles, strengths, successes, and failures. Notice that I didn\u2019t say in there the word \u201cgender.\u201d That\u2019s because it usually isn\u2019t a huge detail that matters to how a reader interacts with him/her. Short answer: of course you should! Long answer: yes! Just don\u2019t make any big blunders like anatomy mistakes (if anatomy matters in your story) ",

            "answer_text": "Nature vs. Nurture? I was, er, educated recently by a young lady that whereas boys and girls were trained into gender roles in the past, truth had finally arrived and both sexes thought the same, emoted the same, and should be written the same. The fact that she exhibited a need for consensus so deep that disagreement infuriated her was one of the differences between Mars and Venus. The web is full of argument, but the evidence when strained through a filter and looked at closely says that male and female brains differ structurally in several small but important ways. So, no, even Shakespeare had a hard time writing female characters. Most of he rest of male writers can\u2019t do it at all. Female writers may have better intuition to go on, but even they can\u2019t fake across genders with real success. ",
