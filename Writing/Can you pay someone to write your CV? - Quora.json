            "answer_text": "Yes, there are resume writers like myself, who you can hire to help write your CV. But whether or not you really need a resume writer is the bigger question. There are times when I\u2019ve told people they really don\u2019t need one because I honestly felt it wasn\u2019t necessary. But there are others who can benefit from having a professional helping out. And if you are thinking about paying somebody, make sure you check them out ahead of time! Sadly, there are some bad apples in the bunch who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing and will rip you off. So if you decide to hire somebody, check them out! Reputable ones will have no problem giving you a free review and/or samples of their work. ",
