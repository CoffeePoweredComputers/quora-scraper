You can write anything you\u2019d like, but of course be respectful to them and don\u2019t go acting like a saseang. You could write how they have helped you (love yourself, or anything in life really), why you love them, how you became an ARMY, honestly just anything you want them to know. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll appreciate your letter! I\u2019m still not entirely sure if they read all the fanmail, though, but yours just might be seen :) Hope I answered your question! MXue ",
