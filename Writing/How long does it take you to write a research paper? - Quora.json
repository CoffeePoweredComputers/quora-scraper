            "answer_text": "Parkinson's law states that \"work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\" So how much time do you have? And I assume you mean a review of academic papers. Generally, as a student I allowed about an hour per page, so what is the required length of the paper? And I had a system which makes the task faster. First create a folder to hold all of the files related to the paper. Then open Word, set the format (12pt New Romans, double-space). Also go to References Tab and set the citation style (MLA, APA or another) and save the file in the new folder. Conduct research using databases of published sources, especially academic journals. The library can show you how to access such a database, such as Proquest which usually serves for undergraduate papers. These are subscription services, but the university library has access. Using Google Scholar or Bing yield too many unrelated sources. Search for articles related to your topic; read the summaries to choose ones that look promising. Usually there is a summary or abstract that tells what the article is about. If you decide to use it, then download the PDF of the article to the folder. And open the Word document and enter the data into Reference Tab, Manage Sources, New Source while the information is on the screen. When you have two or three sources per page needed, start writing the paper. First read the introduction of the article, and write a one paragraph summary. Then go to the conclusion and write another paragraph. Now that you know what is important in the article based on the introduction and conclusion, so skim the body of the paper to find details to support the assertions and write a third paragraph between the first two that you wrote. Then go to the next article and do the same thing. At the end of the three paragraphs, use the References Tab, Insert Citations to enter the citation Then go to the next article. When you have enough pages, stop and write an introduction at the beginning of the paper and a conclusion at the end. Finally, go to the end of the last page and insert a page break. Then go to References and click Bibliography. Chose whether you want to call it a bibliography or works cited page. It will include all of the sources that you entered through Manage Sources, so first delete any that were not used (Manage Sources). Print these instructions out and put the printout in a safe place so you can follow these steps for all of your \u201cresearch\u201d or \u201cterm\u201d papers. And you can write notes on the printout to help you next time. Good Luck! ",
