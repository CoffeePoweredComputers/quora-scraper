            "answer_text": "As an author one\u2019s focus is on impacting and influencing. Monetary gain is a result of our impact and influence. If your goal is to be published traditionally I suggest that you keep knocking on doors until one opens for you. You may want second eyes on your query. Is your book well edited? Have you had beta readers? I would welcome feedback and consider revisions based on that feedback. If you feel passionately about what you\u2019ve created and feel it is of entertainment or transformative value to others - polish and persue. Traditional publishing isn\u2019t always an author\u2019s golden ticket. More and more authors are walking through the self-publishing door. There are advantages and disadvantages to both the traditional and self-publishing path. But you have options. I help authors to navigate the nebulous but rewarding self-publishing jungle. If I can help you in any way let me know. ",

            "answer_text": "I have known people who have been rejected by dozens of agents before one said Yes. It helps if you figure out what kind of books an agent handles. If yours is a thriller, don\u2019t send it to an agent who specializes in romance. Etc. There are books that list agents and what they want. In The meantime keep working on your book, making it better. Find a writer\u2019s group and listen to their advice even if you reject it. You can even try using it as a blog. Good luck. ",
