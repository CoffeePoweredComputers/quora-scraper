            "answer_text": "A good compare and contrast essay is just like any other essay. It introduces your topic in an interesting fashion, such as \"In selecting a x\" then listing how you intend to compare it, \"there are these things to consider a, b, c.\" You can also say why you want to do this. You can also make it a persuasive essay by attempting to convince someone, such as \"I'm undecided about this product but in general a, b, c pleases me, but g, h, I seems less valuable, so the you compare one to the other on all those items and say, if you're like me, value quality over low price, as an example, and then conclude. A good introduction doesn't use the explanatory tone I've used above, instead you make it enticing, such as \"I slice into the peach, sticky juice coating my hand and I have to take a bite, but first, I must sniff this bowl of raspberries, knowing I'll set them aside, but maybe not, one fruit leads me to my childhood, the other, to those awful teen years of kissing frogs and freshening my breath with diet treats.\" This sets up a quandary and explains you're comparing two memories. The open question here is which fruit will you eat and which memory will you follow first and why. Do:1. Entice a reader to follow into your fantasy 2. Make what you're comparing specific3. Choose a personally important topic4. Do explain the importance5. Leave open the answer 6. Leave off explanatory verbiage that is mental rather than experiential as much as possible7. Start in the middle of action ",
