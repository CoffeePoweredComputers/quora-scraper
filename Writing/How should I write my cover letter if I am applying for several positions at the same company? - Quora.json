            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re applying for multiple job positions at the same company, chances are the HR people will treat each application individually. In such a case, it\u2019s better to have one cover letter for each job application, but you could \u2018link\u2019 them together in a short way without getting overly complex about it:\u2014 Dear Mr/Mrs/Ms X Application for [job position] I am applying for multiple positions in your Company and this is for the [job position] in [department]. I am seeking only a moderate salary for the chance to work in a highly respected company such as yours in a field I was trained for and experienced in several different types of work. This is the reason that I have put in multiple applications with your Company. My aim for the next [five] years is to remain in this area of work with hands-on involvement plus some degree of higher-level responsibility over time. I shall be glad to show you my work to you and your team at a time and date convenient to you. If there is anything not quite clear in my details, please feel free to contact me by telephone on 12345. Thank you for your kind attention. Yours sincerely A.N. Other You have to explain why you\u2019ve chosen to apply multiple times with the same company, and the second paragraph should serve this. The third paragraph is to show your objectives for the foreseeable future and that you are open to having higher responsibilities without giving up frontline work. ",

            "answer_text": "I would not write a separate cover letter for each of the internships in which you are interested. Instead, in the single cover letter, I would express interest in working for the company and then mention that I would be interested to be consider for any of the following vacancies. I would then list each position - one per line. Close with a convincing/compelling reason why you think you would be a suitable candidate for any of those positions. Remember that the employer will be more interested in what you can contribute to the company than what benefit you may gain from working for them.

            "answer_text": "In today\u2019s world, if you do not land a job at te first hiring manager, you automatically get polled by the hiring manager first before asking for more resumes or posting a new position. In my experience, when a position is posted there is a 50% chance that there is an internal candidate in the mix and they are looking for other possibilities. Most large companies use applicant tracking system (ATS) and they can search by key word. I don\u2019t believe the cover letter is as important on the secondary positions as it was many years ago. Best of luck in your career. ",

Then address the fact that you are applying to multiple positions (not something I would generally suggest but I trust that you have decided this is the correct course of action) and why you might be a fit to any of them.
