            "answer_text": "Here are some things to note about traditional publishers: They want proof you can sell the book before they take you on board. This is why they are leery of new authors.You will make, at most, 70 cents per $30 hardcover book that gets sold when you work with them. (The retailers take 55% of the cost in profit, leaving the publisher $16.50 per book. The book costs the publisher about $9.50 per book to produce, so that leaves them just $7 per book in profit. They pay you $1, but your agent takes 30%. You get 70 cents.) Expect about 15 cents per $10 paperback.The advance you get on your royalties is like an interest-free loan that is given to you based on how many copies of their book they believe you can sell. You will not see another dime from them until you have paid back every penny they gave you. If you fail to pay them back because you fail to sell enough copies of your book, you will likely not be getting another publisher anytime soon.7 out of 10 books picked up by publishers never make more money than they paid out in advances. This, again, is why they are so interested in your ability to prove to them you can sell the book.They have control over the final content of your book - you don\u2019t. Once you sign the contract, you are in a partnership and they can legally push you to pull things out of the book you believe are important or to put things in the book you didn\u2019t want there.They control the rights to your book. The money you are accepting from them is their lease of the rights. You can\u2019t create additional tie-in products or offer tie-in services without getting their approval ahead of time.Going with a traditional publisher gives you a team of people helping you to produce the book- but it\u2019s a team you have zero control over.They will NOT - repeat, NOT - be doing the majority of your marketing for you. What they will do is leverage their contacts to get bookshelf space for you so that you are guaranteed to have your book in the stores and they will push your book out there in terms of their email lists, social media, and even some PR. But they expect you to have a full-fledged marketing plan ready to go and provably actionable prior to accepting you.It will take at least a year AFTER your acceptance letter arrives to see your book in bookstores, depending on how many books they have scheduled for publication already. And getting it accepted can take months or even years.While it used to be considered \u201cvanity publishing\u201d to self-publish your book, independent publishing is becoming increasingly respected by even more traditional authors these days. It is A LOT of work to build up an audience and a following, but that work is worth it if you treat the audience right.Truthfully, I foresee a day when traditional publishers will get a little bit smarter with their money and will skip the query letters altogether and choose to seek out partnerships with successful independent publishers. Why should they pay for people to test the market when people will pay to test the market themselves? Why buy books that may or may not sell when you can back proven sellers? ",

            "answer_text": "Which is better depends upon you, you abilities and skills, want and needs period. What works for another author doesn\u2019t mean its right for you. Regardless of whether you choose to self publish or go through a publisher, you will be responsible for your own marketing. If you are not able to handle the marketing, or know what to do, or understand things like building an author platform, knowing your target audience, how to connect on and offline with your audience and so much more, your book is likely to not sell. Most legitimate non-vanity press publishers require you to show that you are able to sell books (market) before they agree to spend time and money on a book that the author can\u2019t generate sales on so they can get their money back. Any publisher who asks for money to publish your book is a vanity press and you should avoid them, they will not benefit your book. Are you prepared to treat publishing your book like a business, because that\u2019s exactly what it is if you self publish. You are responsible for all aspect of both publishing and marketing. There is a lot to know and understand. Few self published authors truly understand publishing and marketing. Just because a publishing platform makes it easy to upload your book doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s all there is to it. People will not buy you book simply because it available for sale and this doesn\u2019t matter whether you self published or used a publisher. Do your research, learn crucial factors about publishing and marketing. What are your publishing goals? If you don\u2019t know where you expect your publishing to go in terms of sales, how can you create a plan to accomplish those goals. It\u2019s like getting in a car and driving without knowing your destination. Once you know your destination, you can map out a route to get you there. ",
