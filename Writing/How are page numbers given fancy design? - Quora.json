            "answer_text": "If you are doing this for many pages, the most efficient way of doing it would be to create a font file. Not a very easy thing to do. You\u2019d need to create the images in a vector graphics program first, like Illustrator or CorelDraw. Not Photoshop. You can also create it in a font creator program, but the tools available will be limited. So it is best to use a graphics program and then import those images into a font creator. Fortunately, there are only ten numbers you have to work with, so you won\u2019t have to create an entire font. But creating fonts does require a bit of a learning curve in order to get them just right. You don\u2019t want your page numbers looking funky on the page. If you google \u201cfont creator program\u201d you\u2019ll see a number of relatively cheap programs you can use. There are also websites where you can create fonts online like GlyphrStudio or FontStruct. Another method is creating the images in a graphics program, exporting those pages as images, and then merging them with the book in a layout program like InDesign, but that is pretty old school and I can\u2019t see many people using that method anymore.

            "answer_text": "Really difficult to answer specific unless seeing actual one, but my guess is it is done of inDesign using insert current page # marker, and pick pictographic font. Author certainly can commission own pictographic font just covering 1\u20130 number to used that on his/her books, but that is I think rare occasion. Alternatively, if page number is not terribly large, you can certainly manually insert graphics at the bottom of pages. you do not want to do it if it is thousand of pages, but if it is 100 pages or so, it is certainly doable.

            "answer_text": "Assuming you don\u2019t just mean a fancy font for the numbers themselves, these are usually inserted into the layout document as an image, yes. In InDesign, say, you\u2019d add them to a Master page so that they show up in the same place on every page that follows that Master. ",
