            "answer_text": "The issue you are struggling with is abstraction. A circle with two dots and a line in it is a very abstract representation of a human face. A photographic portrait is a very realistic representation of a human face. To learn how to draw caricatures, you have to think about how to abstract things, and how much to abstract them. Cartoons and comics are a visual language about things, rather than realistic depictions of these things. One way to learn is to start drawing faces, heads, eyes, bodies, and things. Draw them as simply as you can. How much can you leave out, and still make it represent what you intend? You must draw a lot! Experiment with different tools. There is no substitute for experience. Look at comics and cartoons that you like. See what the artists do. Imitate all the drawings, taking some elements from here and some from there, changing things, until you develop your own style. Your own style will continue to change. In short, practice, practice, practice! You might also get a copy of Scott McCloud's book \"Understanding Comics.\" And of course there are tons of links online if you search for \"How to draw comics and cartoons.\" ",

            "answer_text": "A cartoonist should be able to draw portraits and know the proportions of a human face. After all, even in a humorous figure, they are distorted according to certain laws. If you simply draw a long nose to a person or spread your eyes wide, the picture will turn out to be strange, ugly and not at all like a prototype. So the cartoon has its own laws. The simplest rule: we make the larger even larger, the smaller - smaller. Facial features should be distorted in accordance with each other. For example, if an artist \u201cpulls out\u201d his nose, making it longer, his eyes should stand closer to each other, and the general shape of the face becomes narrower. And vice versa, when we set our eyes wider, the nose is attracted to them and becomes shorter, and the face turns out to be wide and oval. But the main thing in the caricature, as in any other drawings, is not theory, but, of course, practice. The more drawings you create, the better you get. ",
