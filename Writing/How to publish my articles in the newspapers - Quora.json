            "answer_text": "1. You need to identify the publication that usually carries articles of the type you are planning to write. For example, if you are writing an article on new planets that have been discovered in the recent past, there is no point in sending it to a film magazine or a women's magazine. You need to identify a specialized space magazine or a science magazine that carries articles related to space. 2. Find out if the publication you identified does indeed carry contributory articles from freelancers. Find out to whom the article should be sent. 3. Look at the number of words of the articles that magazine carries. If the usually they carry a 500-word piece, then don't send them a 1000-word piece. Even if copy editors prune the article, the final version may not do justice to what you originally wrote. 4. Send or suggest possible visuals like photographs or graphic elements that can go with the article. 5. Wait for a reasonable time for the publication to carry your article. 6. If you don't get a regret letter, then politely find out why the article is not being carried. Find out if the original needs to altered in any way. If they do suggest alternation, do that. 7. If still you don't find the article in print, then inform the publication that since there's no word from the publication even after many inquiries over a period of time, you are withdrawing the submitted article, as you would like to send it to another publication. 8. It's generally considered unethical to send the same article to more than one publication. ",
