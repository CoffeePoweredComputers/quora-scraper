            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. First, you realize that nearly all manga in Japan are written by the artist and not a dedicated \u201cwriter.\u201d I know that a few have writers, but more than half of the time when it lists a writer, that writer wrote a book or some similar media, and the artist then adapted it. I\u2019ve never seen a written manga script, so I can\u2019t advise you on that. But the way manga artists write a manga script is by drawing it in a form they call \u201cname\u201d (with a similar pronunciation to the English word \u201cname\u201d). In the US, they call them thumbnails since the pictures tend to be small representations of what the pages will look like, but in Japan, each page tends to be on A4 (roughly equivalent to US letter-sized) paper. They are a rough drawing of what the final manga chapter will look like in the magazine, and they can be anything from stick figures to nearly fully-rendered manga pages. The main thing is they do is show what the manga pages will look like and include all dialog so the editor can judge it and make corrections. These are usually done just prior to a meeting with the editor, but some extremely talented manga artists can draw their names during the meeting itself. In other words, for probably 95% of all manga, there is no typewritten script. There are a few writer/artist combinations, but in many of those, the writer and artist work together to hash out the name, so again, there is no written script. If you want to make up a manga script in Japanese, I\u2019d look into how Japanese scripts are laid out for movies and TV shows. If you\u2019re doing it in English, then look up American comic script formats. Hope that helps. ",

Basically, you start of with something called \u2018name\u2019 which are really rough draft storyboards. In it, you decide the layout of panels, the storytelling flow, etc. Sorry, I can\u2019t help much since art hasn\u2019t really been my forte. There are a couple of tutorial sites I found on the web.
