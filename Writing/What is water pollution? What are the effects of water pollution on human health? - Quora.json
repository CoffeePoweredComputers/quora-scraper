            "answer_text": " What is Water Pollution? Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities. Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural environment. Humans have established communities and flourished around sources of clean, drinkable water since the beginning of time. It\u2019s vital to our survival. Do you know that you can survive several days without food but not without water? It\u2019s heartbreaking to know that millions of people worldwide do not have access to this most basic need, and are dying of thirst and water borne diseases. Freshwater sources around the world are threatened by water pollution. Not only are we managing our resources poorly through wastage, we are also thoughtlessly dirtying it. Sources of Pollution The main sources of water pollution are the following: Discharge of untreated Raw Sewage from households and factoriesChemicals dumped from FactoriesAgricultural run-offs that make their way into our rivers and streams and groundwater sourcesUrbanizationThe rising use of synthetic organic substancesOil SpillsAcid Rain caused by the burning of Fossil FuelsHuman littering in rivers, oceans, lakes and other bodies of water. Harmful litter includes plastics, aluminum, glass and Styrofoam.Almost everything that is a byproduct of our civilization is polluting our drinking water. Governments, through various Clean Water Acts and water resource policies have sought to regulate the discharges of pollutants in the water to minimize pollution and contamination. From 1990 to 2006, an additional 1.6 billion people had access to safe drinking water. But we are not acting fast enough and most factories still find a way to dump their toxic wastes in the sea, unseen. Effect of Polluted Water on Humans How does water pollution affect humans? Try drinking untreated water nowadays and your body will immediately react to it. You will get a stomach ache at the least. Water-borne diseases account for the deaths of 3,575,000 people a year! That\u2019s equivalent to a jumbo jet crashing every hour, and the majority of these are children. Infectious diseases can be spread through contaminated water. Some of these water-borne diseases are Typhoid, Cholera, Paratyphoid Fever, Dysentery, Jaundice, Amoebiasis and Malaria. Chemicals in the water also have negative effects on our health. Pesticides \u2013 can damage the nervous system and cause cancer because of the carbonates and organophosphates that they contain. Chlorides can cause reproductive and endocrinal damage. Nitrates \u2013 are especially dangerous to babies that drink formula milk. It restricts the amount of oxygen in the brain and cause the \u201cblue baby\u201d syndrome. Lead \u2013 can accumulate in the body and damage the central nervous system. Arsenic \u2013 causes liver damage, skin cancer and vascular diseases Flourides - in excessive amounts can make your teeth yellow and cause damage to the spinal cord. Petrochemicals \u2013 even with very low exposure, can cause cancer. These are just to name a few. What we can do\u2026 Water pollution is a known threat to humans and we can do our part to help keep our waters clean. Don\u2019t throw litter in the ocean.Don\u2019t dispose of chemicals, paint, in water supplies and drains.If you see anyone throwing litter into any body of water, report it to the authorities.Help increase awareness by educating your children and increasing awareness within your community.There\u2019s a long way to go, but as we mature as a society and as our technologies progress, we can improve our methods of protecting our water supply. Right now, everyone just needs to do their share, from their end. Thank you and keep Upvoting\ud83d\udce4also do follow my space\ud83d\udc49 Environmental Challenges ",
