            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Mae. I\u2019m answering from the USA You\u2019re lucky you asked me your question. In my day, there was no such thing as email, cell phones, messaging, and the like. All we had were snail mail delivered letters. My Mom and Aunt Judy wrote me religiously at least once a week while I served. I also heard from a girl friend or two but not on any regular basis. No matter the time of day, reading those letters were among my favorite times. Once you got past all the emotional stuff, all the I love yous and what not, I just wanted to hear about life back home. How my sister\u2019s violin lessons were coming along. Where and what they did on their Sunday drive. How much fun they had going out to dinner at the Chinese food restaurant. You know, just every day life kind of things. If your question is an actual question for yourself then proceed with caution. There are so many scams out there. If you\u2019ve just met this person online, then verify that they are actually a Soldier. Ask them for their military email address. If the very last three letters are not .mil then they\u2019re likely not true. For example, glambert@army.MIL, NOT glambert@army.mil.anything.else. It MUST end in .MIL. Alternately, ask them to provide you a photo of their military ID. They can black out any personal info from the card. This is what they looked like back in my day  I don\u2019t know if the below are still valid  I believe the below is similar to what is used today  The problem with asking for a photo of their ID card is they are easily forged. You can by a blank one online and put whatever you want in it. I\u2019d be more apt to believe somebody with the .mil email address. A U.S. Soldier will NEVER ASK YOU FOR MONEY (unless they\u2019re worthless scum). They don\u2019t have to pay for their leave, discharge, transfer, or promotion. All of their needs are provided by the military. I sure hope that none of my warnings were necessary. I hope that relating my experiences receiving letters from my home country provides you with a little direction. Be safe and enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "Write about something going on in your community.  Stay positive and avoid anything that sounds political or religious.  Although guys that are overseas appreciate the\"Thanks for your service\" message, they really miss home.  They love to hear whats happening.  They have enough stress as it is.  Whether they are in Okinawa, Japan or Kandahar Provence.  They care that you are thinking about them. Tell them about a movie that just came out, how the Holiday's look in your neighborhood or local high school activities.  Most these guys just graduated from high school and this is there first time away from home.  Thanksgiving is coming I remember my first Thanksgiving away from home.  It wasn't easy.  I covered up my home sickness with a lot of alcohol.  Not very bright idea.  But that's all I had or maybe that's all I wanted. I remember my friends telling me how guys would congregate around the TV in the recreation room on ship and watch the VHS tape a family member sent to one of the Sailors or Marines.  None of them knew who the heck was on the tape but it was a message from home.  That's all that mattered.  Semper FI ",
