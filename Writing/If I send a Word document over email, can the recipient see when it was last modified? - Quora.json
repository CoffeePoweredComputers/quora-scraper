            "answer_text": "MS Word has some pretty sophisticated collaboration features. Among those is the option to track changes, so that you can find out who made the latest changes, and when they were made. Also, Word files contain metadata that says when a file was created or modified. This information might not be accurate when a file is downloaded from an email. Your computer might just show the \u201cmodified\u201d date as the date and time of the download. (I\u2019m using Linux right now, so I can\u2019t check. The file manager I\u2019m using shows when a file was modified and when it was accessed. ",

If you wish to send a clean document (always a good choice) then do a copy/paste into a new document save and send that\u2026. Leave your master document alone\u2026 So basically have 2 copies in your repository the mast document with tracked changes\u2026 and the clean Base version which you implement into your systems for doing mail merges etc and send in confidence to clients\u2026.
