            "answer_text": "I'm not too perfect in all these stuff but as my past experience in writting poems. As I have been writting poems since past year. I came to know various things about writting and framing poems, so that they looks more attractive and even better to read. So, here are some tips from my personal past experience of one year : Always use poetic devices (figures of speech) to make it even beautiful. Poetic devices like simili, metaphor, and the best is pun.Express your all the feelings and mug up your poem with that.Use strong words but not too much. Like use sue instead of ask.Always write slowly, nicely and try to write in your best way so that your handwriting seems good. Believe me that really matters. ;)Do not force yourself to write poem. It automatically comes inside you when you want to write.Take opinion from everyone you could. Because they are your viewers and can plug out your mistakes and tell you to improve in that particular way you need to.Always be happy. Because that will make you frame even good poems \ud83d\ude09Thanks for reading \u2764 Follow for more \ud83d\udc4c Have a nice day\ud83d\udd92\ud83d\udc4d ",
