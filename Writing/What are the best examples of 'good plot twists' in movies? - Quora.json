            "answer_text": "Recently, this one Get Out Get Out is a masterpiece of impossibility made into a wonderful horror movie. It is a first time effort by writer and director Jordan Peele who is a comedy writer known for the TV series Key and Peele and a few other things. How about a great horror thriller with elements of The Stepford Wives, Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner, Oldboy, Psycho, Total Recall, Jeeper\u2019s Creepers + comedy to boot? What about a near perfect 99% from Rotten Tomatoes, with the one dissenter being a blockhead who gave both Moonlight and La La Land negative reviews? I don\u2019t appreciate most horror movies as a rule, and am hard pressed to think of a recent one that I liked (O.K., The Orphanage 2007), but Get Out will have you riveted to your seat the entire run time of 1 hr. and 43 minutes. Not only is this movie all that I have mentioned above, but the entire body of the film is based on a premise of social commentary about a unique form of racism that you will just have to see to believe.  It is going to be incredibly hard to review Get Out without major spoilers, but I will try. After a brief but intriguing set-up scene the movie switches to Chris and Rose. They are an interracial couple who are packing to visit her parents, who have never met Chris. Chris is understandably concerned as Rose has failed to mention to her parents that he is Black. Rose assures Chris that it is no big deal, her parents are both physicians, a neurosurgeon and a shrink, and white liberals that voted for Obama and would vote him a third time if they could. The remainder of the movie is spent at the Armitage Estate and through Chris\u2019s eyes, and things just don\u2019t look quite right. The first subtle clues were the android-like Black servants, Georgina and Walter, the next were the seemingly innocuous comments from Mr. Armitage about the 1938 Olympics. Then things escalated slightly at the dinner table with the micro-aggression and subtle racism from Jeremy Armitage, the intoxicated brother of Rose, and Chris became increasingly uneasy.  I\u2019m not going to spoil the events surrounding Chris\u2019s insomnia and chance meeting with Mrs. Armitage, who suggested that she might be able as a psychiatric to help him quit smoking, but this is where the nightmare slowly begins. The next day, and undisclosed to him, an annual lawn party got underway, and the creepiness of the environment and paranoia level of Chris started to rise. A parade of Black Lincolns containing what was obviously a bunch of rich old White People arrived, and the party quickly became 99% White, save Chris and another young Black Man who looked like he just stepped out of an Amos \u2018N Andy TV show from the 50s. The \u201charmless\u201d and sometimes sexually oriented racial innuendos increase as does Chris\u2019s discomfort, brought to a shocking reveal when Chris photo flashes Andrew. Let the games begin, and there were games. Bingo, anyone? The Bingo sequence was brief, without sound and totally terrifying as the audience slowly gets a clue as to what is actually happening.  In the third act of the movie, all hell breaks loose. The final reveal shoe is dropped, Chris realizes that he needs to GET OUT, and fast. There is an incredibly tense scene when Chris desperately tries to leave and all secrets are apparent now, with the violence beginning and Chris finding himself in the man-cave below, which is really a tomb. This is where the real horror movie begins, and boy howdy, it does not disappoint. This film has so much glorious attention to detail, but I must mention what has to be the greatest use of the metaphor of a \u201cCotton-picking Negro\u201d in the history of cinema. Never before has a stereotype so effectively been put on the turntable of a plot twist. Genius does not even begin to describe this turn of events which gives us hope as the blood flows.  I must discuss the dynamics, the acting, the dialogue, the pacing and the surreal imagery of this wonderful movie. This is one of the tightest movies I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of watching. There was not a wasted moment or scene. The cinematography and imagery were breathtaking and the script and acting were magnificent. Daniel Kaluuya? A tour-de-force. Betty Gabriel as Georgina? OMGoat! She was a sugar-coated zombie of terror and excruciating sadness. Allison Williams as the pretty little rich girl with a penchant for sculptured Black Men? Don\u2019t trust anyone who eats Froot-Loops with the milk on the side. Lady Kaede had nothing on this bitch, and she doesn\u2019t even have a tea cup. I\u2019ve said too much, I know. I cannot go on, however, without giving proper props to the guy that stole every scene he was in and gave the movie the humor that made this endeavor totally unique. LiLRel Howery as Rod Williams the T.S.A. agent made this film what it was. A masterpiece. The humor he imparted was exquisite and his diatribe on the phone about White People was as hilariously over the top as it was deadly accurate. The scene where he described his \u201ctheory\u201d about the abduction of Black Men to the police was worth the price of admission alone.  This is to all the Black Brothers and my many Black friends out there (well, 2, George and Robert, but work with me on this). Dear Black Man: Just leave the White Women like Rose alone. I know, I know, they\u2019re purr-ty and make you feel like a king, and probably have rich daddies too, but leave them to us. We deserve them. You have plenty of other things to worry about, like being randomly assassinated by a police officer who is just having a bad day. Don\u2019t just take my word for this, watch the movie and see for yourself. This movie was just a racial bombshell, but the audience does not feel used because the all-pervasive tone is so well handled by Peele. There is humor, there is satire and there is the mind-blowing metaphor that I mentioned in the 3rd act of the movie. This is not just your typical Get Whitey movie. The specter of racism is in every single scene in this movie, but never has this pachyderm in the room been handled more competently. These White People are villains, some very evil people, and it would take the most dense lug head of a Cracker to walk away from this movie thinking that he has been disrespected because of his race. It\u2019s a movie, and a great one to boot. From the brief opening teaser to the unimaginable and surprise ending, this horror show has it all. ",

            "answer_text": "To take the audience\u2019s pre-conceptions and utterly subvert them with plot and characters. ***spoilers throughout*** BY USING PLOT The Cabin in the Woods - Drew Goddard - 2012  The Cabin in the Woods sets the audience up with the prototypical horror premise ; university teens go on a vacation to a spooky cabin in the woods, discover a cellar full of oddities, one of which they interact with triggering their slaughter by zombie sadists one by one. Even more typical is the make up of the group; the jock, the slut, the nerd, the stoner and the pure virgin. We\u2019ve all seen this movie, haven\u2019t we ! But who the f**k are these guys ?  LIN: Guys. Guys! Stockholm went south. SITTERSON: Seriously? I thought they were looking good. HADLEY: What cracked? LIN: I haven't seen the footage. Word's just going around HADLEY: Well, that's never been a stable scenario. Everyone knows you can't trust\u2026 what do you call people from Stockholm ? SITTERSON: Stockholders. LIN: That means there's just Japan. Japan and us. HADLEY: It's not the first time it's come down to that. SITTERSON: Japan has a perfect record. HADLEY: We're number two. We try harder. LIN: If we fail, then.. HADLEY: That\u2019s why this is in the hands of professionals. SITTERSON: They hired professionals.. What\u2019s happening to us ? LIN: You guys better not be messing around in there. HADLEY: Does this mean you're not in the betting pool this year? Big money. LIN: I'm just saying, it's a key scenario. HADLEY: I hear what you're saying. In '98, it was the chem department's fault, right? Where do you work, again? Wait. It's coming back to me, now. It's gonna be a long weekend if everyone's that puckered up.  This is the BEGINNING of the movie. So what the heck is that all about ? It announces that it is subverting the audience\u2019s preconceptions. The Cabin, it\u2019s horrific slaughter of teenagers, the monsters caged within are all corporate run by an institution preventing the end-of-days by performing this sacrifice to Eldritch Gods at multiple sites across the world. WOW. (#BestHorrorMovieEver)  BY USING CHARACTER Narc - Joe Carnahan - 2002  PLOT - Undercover Detroit narc police officer Nick Tellis (Patric) is put on suspension after a discharge from his firearm wounds a pregnant woman, killing her unborn child. (Yeah.. this film is hardcore !) He is offered reinstatement by investigating the murder of another narc police officer Michael Calvess. Tellis partners up with Henry Oak (Liotta) who was a friend and former partner of Calvess. As soon as we are introduced to Oak, his character is laid out bare as a violent and relentless rule breaker.  Oak: If I need to break every point of procedure, consider them broke. The only thing you need to know about me is that I'm gonna bag the motherfuckers who killed Mike. So we are set up seeing this angry, brutal cop desperately trying to find someone to punish for the death of his friend. We\u2019ve all seen this movie, haven\u2019t we ! What Narc does, asides from delivering some unbelievably nasty grit, is to show what police work is. They hit the streets and interview people in the area. They shake down old contacts and ex-perps. And Tellis keeps hitting the files. Then mid-way through the film during a stakeout we get this ; Oak : I remember one night. I went with the sheriffs on a warrant raid. This dipshit was selling meth out of his apartment. Just a stop-and-pop. Broke down the door, rousted the guy. I was in one of the back rooms looking for junk when I hear something. I turn around and see these... eyes staring at me from a closet. It was a little girl. A little ten year old girl. Naked. Shaking like a leaf; she was scared to death. Her stepfather was pimping her out for rent. I wrapped her in my coat, carried her out to the squad car. I went back... and I beat that motherfucker half to death. Subverting the audience\u2019s preconceptions\u2026 Tellis goes deep into the files, and comes up with Calvess\u2019 wife, and decides to go and interview her alone. Mid way through, Oak comes in steaming, and drags Telliss outside ; Henry Oak: What the fuck are you doing talking to her without me being here? Nick Tellis: I brought her husband's things over. Henry Oak: Yeah, and you questioned her. What for? WHAT FOR? Nick Tellis: What is this, \"mother may I\"? You said we were gonna do some of this on our own, right? Henry Oak: [pointing his finger] Some of this doesn't extend to her! And don't get fucking cute with me! Nick Tellis: Get your hand outta my face... Henry Oak: If you need to know what she said about anything case-related, you refer to the file! Nick Tellis: Yeah, I looked at the files, they're thin! Henry Oak: What you don't fucking do is talk to her without notifying me in advance! That's not the way we do things! Nick Tellis: Why's that? What's the problem with me speaking to her? Henry Oak: Because... the problem is every fucking question you asked her she's already answered! She's been badgered and bothered by cops and cop questions for two fucking months now, and the biggest fucking problem is her husband... is fucking... dead!  Because we have been subverted, we see this as Oak being Oak, protecting his friend\u2019s wife. But Tellis is a smart cop and he ties it all together. But not before Oak has them trying to pin Calvess\u2019 death on some crack heads by planting Michael\u2019s gun in their stash. But Michael\u2019s wife is the little girl that Oak rescued. Oak mentored her, watched her grow and marry Michael, whom he was friends with. But then Michael and his wife both became strung out on drugs forcing Oak to get involved to get Audrey out. Michael was still in the force, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that he was dirty, selling police weapons for drugs. If this comes out as evidence then Audrey and her child lose the police pension. They get nothing. So Michael has to have been murdered. And then we find out that Oak was there when Michael died. Oak must have put him down. The final twist comes as Oak lies bleeding out. He did not shoot Calvess. he was there, trying one last time to find a way out for his friend, but Calvess saw no way out. So he killed himself. And a suicide gets no pension for the family either. It had to be murder. All Oak was concerned about was securing a future for this little girl that he found at ten years old, naked and abused in a closet. So Oak dies, and takes the rap for Calvess murder, evidence being he was planting the murder weapon in the crack head\u2019s stash. And we all thought that he was the bad guy. ",

            "answer_text": "It is all about how things are revealed, and the master, as always is\u2026  Hitchcock. For example, in Blackmail, a woman is lured up to an artist\u2019s studio, and persuaded to pose in a revealing costume. He molests her, so she kills him. In the struggle, a painting is damaged.  The detective who is called on to investigate is\u2026her boyfriend. What an obvious coincidence. It is plot device 101. There is nothing clever about this twist. What is clever is the reveal. The police are in the room, led by the boyfriend. He sees a glove on the floor and holds it up, ready to share this clue with the rest of the team, and then a look flashed across his face - \u201cI know whose glove this is\u2026\u201d and as he pauses, trying to decide what to do, we see an object that catches his eye\u2026  The joke is on you\u2026 There\u2019s a lovely twist in  But I won\u2019t give it away. The twist in Vertigo is very well known, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m likely to spoil anything by discussing it. The screenplay was based on D\u2019entre Les Morts by Boileau-Narcejac. In the original, the reader only discovers at the very end that Judy is not just a woman who looks like Madeleine Elster, she is the woman who was pretending to be Madeleine Elster all along. Hitchcock reveals this earlier, leaving the audience to wonder how Scotty will react when he figures this out. The scene where the information is revealed to the audience is classic Hitchcock. Judy is writing a letter to Scotty explaining the situation. She decides not to send it. But we hear her thoughts, and so learn the truth. The camera moves around the room, and as she is talking, the camera moves so that our view of Judy is temporarily blocked by a lamp. As the lamp obscures then reveals her face, our image of who she is and what we have been seeing changes. We are given a moment to process the information, and to rethink what we\u2019ve been seeing all of this time. This scene does not stick in your memory the first time you see the film, and I can\u2019t easily find images of it online - it isn\u2019t one of the famous scenes. But Hitchcock knows exactly when and how to introduce the audience to the twist, quietly setting us up for the pay-off that comes later. ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite is an older movie, which has been spoiled for almost everyone by the internet. However, if you have never seen it, and know nothing about it, then stop reading immediately and watch it tonight in a darkened room. The Sixth Sense  This movie was so groundbreaking and so perfectly paced for it\u2019s plot twist at the end, that it has become something of a model for plot twists. You see, there is a lot of technical jargon used to describe plot twists, and those things are relevant, but a good plot twist requires several basic factors that are often lacking: The movie has to be a good movie WITHOUT the plot twist. This is essential. The movie needs to have an enveloping story that feels complete. Not cheesy, not tropey, but genuine.In keeping with the above statement, the characters need to stay the same. They should never, ever \u201cmorph\u201d into new characters once the twist is revealed. As a matter of fact, the twist should reveal so much more about the characters that we already know.A plot twist should NEVER be presented with no chance that the audience could figure it out. Surprise endings that are sprung on us is OK, but they aren\u2019t good either. Those are usually used to make a bad movie more interesting - artificially.Clues to the plot twist should be obvious when re-watched, but seemingly innocent when initially shown.The movie should be able to be watched again, giving a whole new experience to the viewers.The Sixth Sense does all of these things in spades.  It starts with a shooting . . .  Then we meet a strange boy . . .  Who sees things . . .  and a doctor who tries to help him . . .  There are clues everywhere . . .  . . . . . but we just don\u2019t see them. A classic! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, let\u2019s see\u2026 A decent plot twist is very hard to come by, nowadays. It is one of the most precious of literary gems and, if executed properly, can make a film all the more engrossing. It will undoubtedly have been brought up many a time, but that doesn\u2019t mean Se7en doesn\u2019t deserve another lauding of its magnificent and memorable narrative shocker. (Warning: major spoilers for the ending of Se7en. If you haven\u2019t seen it, turn away now).  David Fincher\u2019s neo-noir psychological thriller depicts the world in the shittiest extreme. Overworked police force, rampant crime, rubbish-laden alleyways and everlasting grim skies build up the world magnificently as retiring detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is partnered with rookie hothead David Mills (Brad Pitt) to solve the mystery of a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a motif for his murders. The film progresses as you would expect. Detectives find the latest killing, killer remains one twisted step ahead, detectives keep tabs on potential clues and leads, usual stuff. Until a blood-splattered John Doe (Kevin Spacey) - all ten of his fingers bandaged - walks right into the police station and yells \u201cDETECTIVE!\u201d  Remember that blood for later\u2026 John Doe has committed five of the sins at this point. Envy and Wrath remain. He promises to turn himself in to the police if he has Somerset and Mills drive him out to the country to the site of his next two victims. After they arrive at the location, a delivery van soon arrives. Mills holds Doe at gunpoint as Somerset intercepts the driver. The driver tells him he was supposed to deliver a package to them at this location.  Please handle with care. Fragile. Somerset bends down and opens up the box with his pocket knife. He sees stains of blood. Then he looks inside\u2026 He backs away immediately. He worriedly tells the overhead police chopper that \u201cJohn Doe has the upper hand.\u201d He rushes back to Mills, frantically shouting out his name.  Doe then starts taunting Mills, monotonously sinister in his tone, as he admits his admiration of Mills\u2026 and his pretty wife, Tracy. He says that he visited Mills\u2019 wife earlier that morning, wanting to taste the \u201clife of a simple man.\u201d Apparently, it didn\u2019t work out, so he took a little souvenir: \u201cher pretty head.\u201d Remember all that blood on Doe\u2019s shirt earlier that day? What if it was Tracy\u2019s blood, while he was cutting her head off? Cogs start turning in Mills\u2019 head as he grows closer to putting the pieces together.  Mills becomes increasingly erratic and demands that Somerset tells him \u201cwhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d as his rage intensifies. Doe admits to himself - almost to the wind - that he is envious of Mills\u2019 life. Envy is his sin.  Mills bellows at Doe that he is lying, unwilling to let his horrifying imagination become reality: that Tracy\u2019s decapitated head rests several hundred meters away inside of that cardboard box. Somerset urges Mills to put his gun down. Doe - with silent glee - wishes him to become vengeance. To become Wrath. Mills screams out in unbearable emotional pain as Doe applies more verbal pressure, citing the death of Tracy\u2019s unborn child. Even though Mills didn\u2019t know that Tracy was pregnant\u2026  Torment and unfiltered anger crosses Mills\u2019 face, fleeting images of Tracy flashing before him, before he finally pulls the trigger and finishes Doe\u2019s \u2018masterpiece\u2019.  So the elaborate twist in the end that makes this climax so enthralling is the fact that the detectives thought they had finally outsmarted the criminal John Doe. However, it was all part of his plan all along; to die so that the law (and the genre\u2019s tropes) couldn\u2019t win. Few films end with a victory for the villain. Ever fewer end with a villain\u2019s triumph that cannot be undone. Considering the studio wanted to rewrite the ending for fear that it was too bleak, and Pitt and Freeman fought to keep it in, demonstrates the commitment to constructing a memorable addition to cinema. And that background score\u2026 both the booming horns and the oscillating strings still chills the bone to this day, adding weight to the suspense and inviting the imagination to be intoxicated with horror. The scariest thing of all? We never see what\u2019s inside the box at all. We are never shown how the other victims were killed off, either. The graphic nature of this film is what you didn\u2019t see. We didn\u2019t see the execution of Greed, the set design was enough. We didn\u2019t see the execution of Lust, the man\u2019s explanation was enough. We didn\u2019t see what\u2019s inside the box, yet we knew instinctively, and not seeing makes it even worse.  The fact that this is a murder-mystery movie and there\u2019s only one on-screen murder and it\u2019s done by a cop is truly brilliant. Peace and Love. A short life and a merry one. ",

Later, Dylan picks a fight with Thaddeus for not working his best to catch the Horsemen. This guy is 100% serious on the case. There is no possible way that he could\u2026  In the end, Dylan is revealed to be the Fifth Horseman. What\u2026?  Now You See Me constantly quote \u2018The closer you look, the less you see.\u2019 But whether you look close, far, upside down, or lying on the bed, you won\u2019t see this shit coming. The movie built Dylan\u2019s personality and made us care about his journey, then suddenly turned him into a completely new character. The filmmakers destroys the most likeable character in the movie for a twist.  You might say he mentioned his father was a magician twice in the movie. Come on. That\u2019s just lazy writing. I could wrote he said he once peed sitting down, then revealed at the end he has a vagina all along.  Remember the time you rewatched Fight Club for the third time and you still found more clues.  Remember how loud you shouted \u2018fuck you\u2019 at the Mandarin revealing but you couldn\u2019t nitpicked about it\u2019s logic.  Remember how shocking you felt when Danial learnt he was the missing patient of the Shutter Island.  Remember the time you shouted \u2018I knew it all along!\u2019 when Roger turned out to be Keyser Soze.  A good twist makes sense in the second view. A good twist makes sense even though you hate it. A good twist puts us in the same position of the character. A good twist makes you feel smart when you see it coming.  Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources are two films that tell one story, though interestingly they stand well on their own. But you need to watch both to get the full impact of the tale. They were made in 1986 and were directed by Claude Berri, based on a novel by Marcel Pagnol. The foundational aspects of the two films are farming and weather. Sounds incredibly exciting doesn\u2019t it? Yet, from this very basic premise all the facets associated with strong dramatic presentation are there. Love, loss, intrigue, betrayal, revenge and redemption are threads that can be found in the fabric of the story. Spoiler Alert! In Jean de Florette we meet C\u00e9sar Soubeyran, a gentleman living in a small farming community in rural France. He lives with his nephew Ugolin, who\u2019s rather dull-witted, but the only family member C\u00e9sar has left to carry on his legacy. And familial legacy is very important to C\u00e9sar. The old man has his eye on a parcel of land next to his which contains a spring. When a citified lawyer, Jean, shows up, having inherited the coveted land, C\u00e9sar and Ugolin dam up and hide the spring. They then watch as Jean struggles mightily to make good as a farmer. Sadly fate, and the weather, are against him. C\u00e9sar and Ugolin pose as helpful neighbors, but don\u2019t inform him about the one thing that could save him: the spring. Jean literally works himself to death and C\u00e9sar buys the farm at a good price. The pair gleefully remove the dam blocking the spring, unaware that Jean\u2019s daughter, Manon, is observing them. Moving to Manon des Sources, we find C\u00e9sar living large. He\u2019s got the most prosperous farm in the region and his legacy is secure. But a series of events brings all this down. Ugolin falls madly in love with Manon and kills himself when she, understandably, rejects him. C\u00e9sar\u2019s dreams of familial legacy are shattered. Late in the film he\u2019s visited by an old friend who tells him that a long lost love from his youth had a baby by him. He was in the French army and thus never received a letter this lost love sent him informing him he was a father. It turns out Jean, the man C\u00e9sar helped destroy, was his son. This is a devastating twist, a revelation that takes the heart out of the old man. C\u00e9sar dies soon after this revelation and his neighbors are somewhat mystified when the old man\u2019s will bequeaths his farm to Manon. ",

            "answer_text": "A genuinely well-executed plot twist is one of the great delights that movies offer audiences. We all love the rug being pulled out from under us.  Twists come in all shapes and sizes. In essence, they are all similar in their ability to provoke sincere surprise, but often, the most memorable twists adhere to the following mantras: It re-contextualises what has come before.It fits seamlessly into the narrative; it makes sense.It adds thematic depth to the story.It holds up on re-watch.In comparison, inadequately thought out plot twists rely almost wholly on the \u201cOh shit!\u201d moment to carry them through. They have little else to offer. Think of the patently nonsensical twist that comes towards the end of Now You See Me. It goes against three of the four mantras listed above. Previously, I have written about two wonderfully executed but vastly differing twists found in Arrival and Frozen. And I\u2019m certain the likes of The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, The Sixth Sense have already been cited.  Since then, another movie has strolled into town. One that doesn\u2019t so much \u2018have a twist,\u2019 but \u2018is a twist.\u2019 A murder mystery that is a twist on the genre itself; a fable of revenge and redemption caked in blood; a ballad of needles and doughnuts; ladies and gentlemen, I give you Knives Out. Rian Johnson\u2019s subversive take on the classic \u2018whodunit\u2019 is wickedly, deliciously clever; one of the sharpest screenplays in recent memory. The Tale of Three Twists (Here Be Spoilers)  Harlan Thrombey has committed suicide. But someone has hired Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) to investigate his death, and my dear Watsons, the game is afoot. Now, Twist #1 comes early on \u2013 We are shown how Harlan died. Marta (Ana De Armas) accidentally injected him with a lethal dose of morphine. To save Marta, Harlan stages his suicide. This twist not only re-contextualises the story, it altogether shifts the film\u2019s genre. Now it\u2019s a cat-and-mouse game, and we are rooting for Marta to escape Blanc\u2019s discerning eye.  Some shenanigans follow, and we arrive at Twist # 2 \u2013 Ransom (Chris Evans) is the bad guy! He switched the medicine labels to kill his grandfather who had left him out of his princely will. And at this point, the doughnut hole becomes clearer. But wait, there\u2019s another hole. If Ransom switched the labels, and Marta gave Harlan morphine instead of his usual medicine, then that means\u2026..our mystery is not a doughnut hole, but a smaller doughnut with its own hole and our doughnut is not whole at all!  And that is the film\u2019s coup de grace, Twist # 3 \u2013 Marta was a good nurse, and she instinctively gave Harlan the correct medicine. He wouldn\u2019t have died. He didn\u2019t have to die. What this ultimately means is that Knives Out is a movie without a twist. We are presented with one pivotal piece of information at the start \u2013 Harlan Thrombey committed suicide.  And although we sit through a roller coaster of lies, deceit and revelations, that statement is conclusively demonstrated to be authentic. Harlam Thrombey committed suicide. And therein lays the genius of Knives Out.  The doughnut hole was whole the whole time. ",

            "answer_text": "This is the best movie with a plot twist I\u2019ve ever watch: The Man From Earth (2007)  Spoiler alert! This movie tells a story about a guy named John who claimed himself to be a Cro-Magnon human that lived until the present day. From a light evening farewell party turned into a suspense debate amongst his friends about John\u2019s confession. His friends were a professors in a various majors, so does John. That makes everything more interesting as the film rolls.  This movie also run only in one-room set; which is John\u2019s living room. 12 Angry Man style with a modern touch. The story written by Jerome Bixby (the one who wrote Star Trek). The reason why I love this movie was how John\u2019s character build-up the others perception towards him and destroyed it near the end of the movie (and it gets me too!) then he bombarded us with THE PERSONAL FACTS ABOUT THE PSCYHOLOGIST WHO TURNED OUT TO BE HIS SON FROM A MARRIAGE HE DID WAAAAY BACK IN THE PAST. This is the only movie that got me wondering in hours after watching it. My mind got stuck in the movie and John. Well, this movie is the next level stuff. I\u2019ve watched The Usual Suspect, Shutter Island, The Sixth Sense, Fight Club, Predestination, Shawsank Redemption, and many others of plot-twist movies but none gave me chills like The Man From Earth. The funny thing was, I despised this movie at first because the quality of the picture (they\u2019re using the Panasonic AG-DVX100A camera). My former lecturer gave it to me and told me to watch it but said nothing about the plot. Then it turned out to be my personal favourite movie ever.

            "answer_text": "The usual suspect: I would say one of the most surprising plot twists and a very surprise ending. The movie is about a guy who is telling a story (Kevin Spassky) about how people were massacred brutally by Keyser S\u00f6ze to a police officer. He is representing himself as a coward and a disabled man. After he leaves the police station, the officer is talking to his friend about this case while drinking his coffee, but he started to read the papers and other things on the wall, and he realizes they are all the names used by the Kint (Kevin Spassky).  Kint is actually the Keyser Soze. He made up all the stories, and he killed all those people himself.  Psyco (All sequel): It is a masterpiece movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock, about a motel owner who lives with his mother in a big house next to his motel. Norman suffers from multiple personality disorders and sometimes he is Norman and sometimes he is his mother. He actually changes his voice and talks instead of his mother.  He mainly kills the women coming to her motel(the first scene in the first scene, he kills a woman while showering) and pretends it is her mother doing the crime, while in reality, his mother is dead for a while.  The Shutter Island: It is about the U.S. Marshal (Di Caprio) investigates the disappearance of a murderer who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane.   The movie is really suspenseful and twisted, but the most surprising part is the ending where you will realize the criminally insane murdered is actually the U.S marshal himself. ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite is in the film In Bruges. Not just the twist, but the way it is revealed. Ray and Ken are mobsters from London who are sent to lay low in Bruges (a city in Belgium) after Ray accidentally shoots and kills a child in a botched hit. They are told to wait at their hotel until Harry, the mob boss, calls to give them further instructions. It is initially presented as kind of a \u201cbuddy\u201d story. The generational gap between Ray and Ken leads to typical shenanigans: the twenty-something Ray wants to go out and party all the time, while middle-aged Ken wants to see all the historical buildings and go on boat rides. They butt heads over their preferences, and hilarity ensues. The twist comes when Harry (brilliantly played by Ralph Fiennes in his best role ever) calls to give the orders they have been waiting for. But it\u2019s not what Ken expects. Ray\u2019s fuck up is unforgivable, and Ken (who brought Ray into the mob) has to kill him to make things right. The brilliance of the reveal is the subjective way that the viewer is given this information. First of all, the viewer still hasn\u2019t met Harry. We hear his voice over the phone during the call, but we\u2019ve still never seen him. His thick British accent makes him kind of difficult to understand anyway, on top of his voice being slightly muffled by the handset. So it\u2019s already difficult to gauge him. On top of that, he doesn\u2019t outright tell Ken to kill Ray. He simply starts referring to Ray in the past tense, starting with: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a bad kid, was he?\u201d We, the viewers, have to decode that sentence in real time with Ken. Just like Ken, we kind of get it, but are endeared to Ray by this point, and are in denial of what our intuition is telling us. We (Ken) look for a way to ask Harry to clarify, but he still never outright says to kill Ray. He just tells us not to be \u201cthick\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "     Watch these movies if you like \u2018good plot twists\u2019. These are mind blowing. For now I will tell you about these 4 movies. If you like them, ask for more. I know more movies like these. ARRIVALFIGHT CLUBPREDESTINATIONTHE SIXTH SENSEABOUT :- ARRIVAL: This movie has a twisted ending which was never expected. This movie was nominated for oscars. Linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) leads an elite team of investigators when gigantic spaceships touch down in 12 locations around the world. As nations teeter on the verge of global war, Banks and her crew must race against time to find a way to communicate with the extraterrestrial visitors. Hoping to unravel the mystery, she takes a chance that could threaten her life and quite possibly all of mankind. Arrival is a 2016 American science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Eric Heisserer, based on the 1998 short story \"Story of Your Life\" by Ted Chiang. It stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, and Forest Whitaker, and follows linguist Louise Banks, who is enlisted by the U.S. Army to help translate communications from one of several extraterrestrial craft that have appeared across the world. She must find out why they have arrived on Earth before tensions lead into war. The film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on September 1, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 11, 2016, in IMAX by Paramount Pictures. FIGHT CLUB: This movie also has an awesome twisted ending. First half of the movie everyone feels it is boring. But everything changes when second half of the movie starts which was never ever expected. You will thank me afterwards after you watch this movie. Discontented with his capitalistic lifestyle, a white-collared insomniac forms an underground fight club with Tyler, a careless soap salesman. The project soon spirals down into something sinister. Fight Club is a 1999 American film based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. The film was directed by David Fincher, and stars Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter. Norton plays the unnamed protagonist, referred to as the narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a \"fight club\" with soap maker Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, and they are joined by men who also want to fight recreationally. The narrator becomes embroiled in a relationship with Durden and a dissolute woman, Marla Singer, played by Bonham Carter. PREDESTINATION: It is more of a time travel movie. This movie has the best ever twisted ending movie. I loved this movie. Again in this movie I felt first half as nonsense. But the climax made me love this movie. One of the best endings. An agent is tasked to travel back in time to prevent a bomb attack in New York in 1975. Predestination is a 2014 Australian science fiction thriller film written and directed by Michael and Peter Spierig. The film stars Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook and Noah Taylor, and is based on the short story \"\u2014All You Zombies\u2014\" by Robert A. Heinlein. THE SIXTH SENSE: Malcolm Crowe, child psychologist, starts treating a young boy who acts as a medium of communication between Crowe and a slew of unhappy spirits. The Sixth Sense is a 1999 American supernatural horror-thriller film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The film tells the story of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a troubled, isolated boy who is able to see and talk to the dead, and an equally troubled child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) who tries to help him. The film established Shyamalan as a writer and director, and introduced the cinema public to his traits, most notably his affinity for surprise endings. Please do ask if you need more movies like this after you watch these. Please let me know. I assure you that you will love these movies. ",

            "answer_text": "There have been many great plot twist films, but my favorite and the one I think is the best would probably be Seven (or Se7en if you want to be clever). Despite the popularity of this film, I actually still think it\u2019s one of David Fincher\u2019s more underrated movies. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman both gave excellent performances as Detectives, and they were definitely a very unlikely duo considering how different they appeared to be. Freeman\u2019s character was much older and more mature, while Pitt\u2019s character was very young and cocky. I thought Freeman, especially, was the stand out. This had to be one of the darker and more haunting films I\u2019ve seen as well which fit with the rainy and overcast skies that we often see in this movie. It had a great atmosphere and tone. Seven also has one of the greatest \u201csurprise characters\u201d ever with the reveal of who the serial killer was (although the actors name has been tainted to a large extent). I thought this was a very clever film and I love how the story was told using the seven deadly sins as a motif. The final act of the film with the memorable \u201cthe box\u201d scene stuck with me because of how shocking and haunting it was. Great film and the best plot twist movie that I\u2019ve seen. ",

            "answer_text": "I have watched hundreds of films with twist endings but the one that surprised me the most was this Koran masterpiece by Park Chan Wook - Oldboy  I watched this film solely because the plot was interesting - A man goes missing and is kept in captivity for 15 years. He has no idea who kidnapped him and why. He plans his escape but they set him free before he could execute his plans. He is confused about everything. Why did they kidnap him just to set him free after 15 years? He tries to find out. You will never see the ending coming\u2026never. Once you are done with it, you\u2019ll wish you could forget it. I must say that the Koreans make the best Psychological Thrillers, period. If you love Park Chan Wook\u2019s work, then The Handmaiden is another one of his films that will surprise you. It also has amazing cinematography. So if you are interested in that, you can watch it. Another good plot twist that I can think of is in the movie - The Others, which stars Nicole Kidman. You can also watch Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back if you haven\u2019t. Then there are films that have plot twists just for the shock value. I abhor those plot twists. ",

            "answer_text": "Se7en  Description When retiring police Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) tackles a final case with the aid of newly transferred David Mills (Brad Pitt), they discover a number of elaborate and grizzly murders. They soon realize they are dealing with a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) who is targeting people he thinks represent one of the seven deadly sins. Somerset also befriends Mills' wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who is pregnant and afraid to raise her child in the crime-riddled city. Memento  Description Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty, however, of locating his wife's killer is compounded by the fact that he suffers from a rare, untreatable form of memory loss. Although he can recall details of life before his accident, Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he's going, or why. The Sixth Sense  Description Young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is haunted by a dark secret: he is visited by ghosts. Cole is frightened by visitations from those with unresolved problems who appear from the shadows. He is too afraid to tell anyone about his anguish, except child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). As Dr. Crowe tries to uncover the truth about Cole's supernatural abilities, the consequences for client and therapist are a jolt that awakens them both to something unexplainable. Gone Baby Gone  Description In a tough Boston suburb, private detective Patrick Kenzie is hired to trace the missing daughter of Helene McCready. Police chief Doyle doesn't think Patrick has a chance as she's been missing for 76 hours already. Patrick recognises the threat from molester Corwin Earle and Haitian gangster Cheese, but in a neighbourhood where he's lived all his life, the real danger may be closer to home. Donnie Darko  Description During the presidential election of 1988, a teenager named Donnie Darko sleepwalks out of his house one night and sees a giant, demonic-looking rabbit named Frank, who tells him the world will end in 28 days. When Donnie returns home, he finds that a jet engine has crashed into his bedroom. Is Donnie living in a parallel universe, is he suffering from mental illness - or will the world really end? ",

Peter is just getting ready for the dance, goes to her house, and Adrian opens the door. this also led to a very nerve racking scene in the car where Adrian is beginning to realize Peter is Spiderman. and Michael Keaton\u2019s acting really made this whole situation very suspenseful.

            "answer_text": "Quora is remiss here, as this question was asked a year ago. My answer in August 2017 still holds: Having seen quite a few movies over the past 60 years, the best plot twist that comes to my mind is the one in The Crying Game, released in 1992 and directed by Neil Jordan. The problem is, it is such a crucial plot development and, for most, such a surprise that I cannot bear to describe it. After all, there may be people out there who have never seen or heard about this terrific film, and even a spoiler alert wouldn\u2019t guarantee that I could avoid ruining someone\u2019s potential viewing experience. But if you haven\u2019t seen The Crying Game, find some way to do so (without reading about it first), and see if you agree that it\u2019s at least one of the best twists ever. (I\u2019d like to add now that another answer here is probably my second choice, The Usual Suspects [1995, directed by Bryan Singer]. I\u2019m happy to see that the twist for that film is also left unsaid.) ",

Physco from Hollywood and Kaun from Bollywood are two of the movies that stand out for me. But there is one movie in particular in Malayalam(film industry is called Mollywood :)), that could give the aforementioned movies a run for their money. drum rolls please\u2026.  Manichithrathazhu is a Malayalam thriller released in 1993, directed by Fasil. The movie has some amazing actors , Mohanlal, Shobhana, Suresh Gopi, Nedumudi Venu, Thilakan to name a few. This movie may not have started the thriller genre in Mollywood, but surely had given a new breath of life with it\u2019s captivating story telling. The movie revolves around a couple moving in to a bungalow(or palace), presumed to be haunted and how the movie reveals who that ghost is. I do not want to narrate the whole story simply because I want every one here in Quora to watch it and find it by themselves. The story is told in such a way, with occasional comedic elements, captivating background score, jump scares, a story that is rooted at least in the believes and mysteries of Kerala, superb acting, direction with a clarity of what the end result should be and of course a plot twist that is one of the best Indian movies have seen. Do watch it and let me know whether you liked it or not :) Manichitrathazhu - Wikipedia ",
