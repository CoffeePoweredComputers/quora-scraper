            "answer_text": "Vikas Saxena's answer to Is buying an extended BMW maintenance warranty a good idea? Do not buy extended warranty! Believe me, this is one area where people have spent billions of dollars. An average person buys a lot of gadgets, appliances and automobiles in his life. The moment you happen to buy one, the salesman comes after your life to request you to buy an extended warranty. This extended warranty comes with additional premium a part of which goes to the manufacturer (of that item) and another to the insurance company. Just recall, how many times has it so happened that your purchased item has failed during that extended warranty period\u2026.! Almost never! On top of that (to your utmost frustration) the item fails just after the extended warranty period, doesn\u2019t it? A large percentage of people falls for it and repents later why they bought one. I\u2019m going to save you a lot of money by sharing this with you. Why I suggest not buying an extended warranty is because the failure pattern of most of these Electronic/Electrical/Mechanical items like gadgets, appliances, automobiles follows a Statistical distribution which is called the Weibull Distribution. You please do not need to get into the details of this theory. Let us try to take advantage of this. Please have a look at the distribution image below. Please do not worry, the image looks a bit formidable but I\u2019ll make it simple for you to understand. \ufffd\ufffd  When you purchase an item, its failure follows the graph as shown above. The highest Probability for the item failing is for a short period after the unit comes into use, this is depicted by the Zone A in the image. This happens because there are parts that may not have been thoroughly tested and some manufacturing defects. Then all those defective parts fail and get replaced and the item possibly functions without faults for years. This smooth running period is depicted by the Zone B in the image. Then the item reaches its lifetime end, and again probability of failure becomes much higher since most parts wear out and start failing one by one. This happens in the Zone C. Now come to the secret of the extended warranty sellers. Manufacturers offer you initial warranty till the end of Zone A which is normally called the Manufacturer\u2019s Warranty that usually comes with most of the standard items. They try to sell you the extended warranty only up to the end of Zone B (and the start of Zone C), that\u2019s it, not even a day beyond that! Why\u2026? Because they know the failure pattern of their product and they also know that giving warranty for the Zone C definitely will cost them dearly as the item is most likely to fail in that period. BUT, they are happily selling the warranty up to Zone B since they know that it is the most efficient working time for their product so they are safe and most of their warranty offers will expire without a claim. Great\u2026isn\u2019t it? Yes, exceptions never make an example and hence some items may fail during zone B also but that\u2019s highly unlikely. If you happen to be one of the victims, please don\u2019t start trusting ext. warranty again. Do I need to say now, don\u2019t please buy extended warranty and save a lot of money? Thanks for reading! ",

The times I've made a claim with this company, they were more than accommodating. Plus; If by the end of this service contract, there hasn\u2019t been repairs; They rebate the price for the extended warranty! Really, you have to be pretty short cash if you opt out of this extended warranty. So I bought the three year, accidents included warranty, cost 140 bucks, I should go through at least two batteries, they\u2019re expensive on this ultra thin, and not an easy swap, that by itself is the cost for this warranty. I have accident insurance, covering cars running over it. If dropped in water, whatever, that\u2019s not deliberate is covered. Every laptop I\u2019ve ever had I break the screen, this one's a touch, one screen and bing, more than it's cost is covered. [edit] Someone tripped on my power cord, sent the box flying, broke the screen and hinge, they shipped packing material overnight, paid shipping my box to them overnight, paid shipping back overnight, they replaced screen, new battery sine the old lost a bit, and new nvme since I documented read/write speed began to diminish. If you\u2019re buying a new laptop, check the actual manufacturer\u2019s site for this type of service plan that gets refunded if it goes unused. First off, they gave me a far better price for my state of the art Ryzen, than the store claiming they have \u201cthe best buy\u201d, and the extended, accident protection was less expensive, covered more, and is refunded if it goes without a claim.

            "answer_text": "A warranty is the original manufacturer\u2019s guarantee that the product is free from manufacturing defects. If a manufacturing fault is found, the manufacturer agrees to repair the fault, free of charge. It\u2019s not a guarantee that the vehicle won\u2019t need repairs. Parts wear out. An \u2018extended warranty\u2019 could be more accurately termed as \u2018repair insurance.\u2019 So what are you actually getting with an \u2018extended warranty\u2019? You pay someone (either the manufacturer or increasingly a third party) a set amount each month, then when the car needs repair, they theoretically cover the costs. The problem is, these places will try their hardest to worm their way out of paying up. Things will miraculously be \u2018not covered by the warranty\u2019 and you\u2019re left out of pocket. It also precludes taking the vehicle to a trusted local mechanic, as the terms of the agreement will dictate where the work must be done. You\u2019re far better off setting aside the amount of money you\u2019d be paying into a \u2018repair insurance\u2019 scheme, then when the vehicle needs work, use this money to pay for it. It cuts out the middle man and gives you more options. ",

            "answer_text": "Like most financial decisions in life the answer is: dundundun it depends. It seems we are talking about cars so it depends on the terms of the warranty. My mother purchased a warranty from the Ford dealership where she purchased her SUV. The terms of her warranty state that she must take the vehicle in for maintenance every so often and it must be taken to them. In addition their maintenance is not cheap. Like most dealerships they actually make their money on the maintenance side not the selling side. Also when she told me what the warranty actually covers it were things that almost never go wrong in a car after 1\u20135 years after the expiration of the initial manufacturers warranty; for example the drive train or transmission. Much to the chagrin of my mother the sparingly used back door latch was faulty causing the door ajar light to constantly be on. She took it in thinking it would be taken care of only to find out she would be charged for the repairs. I got them to give her a discount and got her to contact Ford to reimburse her for the repair. Now you may be thinking the point of this story is to explain why extended warranties are a waste of money but you\u2019d be wrong. My mother is happy with her extended warranty and has stated she would do it again. Why? Because according to her she has \u2018piece of mind\u2019 that if some unlikely circumstance does occur she won\u2019t be stuck with an expensive repair bill and to her that\u2019s worth the incredibly askew terms of her EW. I explained to her she\u2019s already spending a lot of money just to maintain the warranty but thats immaterial to her. She writes it off as the cost of piece of mind. ",

            "answer_text": "While, in a given instance, an extended warranty pay off, Consumer Reports says that, in general, extended warranties are not a good investment. Quoting portions of their December 2014 Extended warranty Buying Guide: You might be tempted to buy a service plan--also known as extended warranty--on your next laptop, dishwasher, or a new or used car. But chances are that what you spend will be money down the drain. ... There are many reasons why we recommend against buying service plans: Repairs may be covered by the manufacturer's warranty.  Although manufacturers' written, or \"express,\" warranties often don't last as long as they used to, there's a good chance your product is covered for at least 90 days. Buying a service plan may not only duplicate coverage you already have, it sends manufacturers a message that limiting their express warranties will increase the sale of service plans. You shouldn't have to pay extra to get manufacturers or retailers to stand behind their products. Products seldom break within the service plan window. Our data show that products usually don't break during the two-to-three-year period after the manufacturer's warranty expires and the service plan is in effect. Repairs aren't that costly. When electronics and appliances do break, the repairs, on average, cost not much more on average than a service plan. The median difference in our latest survey was $16. Manufacturers sometimes cover out-of-warranty items. If a product breaks down in an unreasonably short time or if there's a known problem affecting many customers, manufacturers often will help by replacing the item free or at low cost or by providing free or discount parts or repairs. So contact the manufacturer and ask for help. If necessary, appeal all the way to the executive office. Your credit card may have you covered. Many credit cards automatically extend the manufacturer's warranty up to a year or so on many products purchased entirely with the card. The coverage is free. ... What to do Self-insure. Save the money you'd otherwise spend on service plans. Place it in a savings account, where you've socked away six months to a year of living expenses, or put it in a designated product repair/replacement fund. Then, when a product breaks, you'll have the money to repair or replace it. Of course, you first should try your other options, such as contacting the manufacturer or retailer if you think the problem was the result of a defect, or using coverage you may have from your credit card. Another benefit is that the money you've set aside will be available if you need it for some other reason, such as paying your living expenses if you lose your job. Buy reliable products. The more reliable the product, the less likely it will be that you'll have to fix or replace it prematurely. Brand-reliability information for major products we test is available to Consumer Reports Online subscribers. Also, check out user reviews on this website and by using a general web search with the product name and/or model number and the word \"reviews.\" Read the manufacturer's warranty before buying. Under federal law, a seller is required to show you the warranty before you make a purchase. If you find the warranty inadequate, consider another product or manufacturer. Examine the retailer's return policy. Some online retailers say that your only recourse if they sell you a defective product is to deal with the manufacturer. Some others say that you can return a defective item, but only for a limited period or while the standard return policy is in effect. If you run into this, consider shopping elsewhere. A retailer should never disclaim responsibility after taking your money and selling you junk. You're entitled to get what you paid for. ",

            "answer_text": "Buying an extended warranty plan is a good idea, as it gives you peace of mind. Most electronics start giving trouble after a year or two, as soon as the manufacturer\u2019s warranty ends. If your device breaks down after the manufacturer\u2019s warranty period, you will have to go through the hassle of visiting the service center to drop and pick your device as well as follow up with them on the repair status of your device. No matter how reliable gadgets are, their parts are still expensive to repair or replace. The repair cost and the cost of spare parts vary depending on the brand and the device\u2019s cost. Instead, it\u2019s best to buy an extended warranty plan along with your device. This way you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about your electronic for the next few years. You could do some research about the best third party warranty providers online and compare the plan features before you decide to buy one. Onsitego provides extended warranty for up to 4 years, depending on the device or appliance. It also offers a free pick & drop service across India. So when your device needs repair, you just have to contact Onsitego and your device will be picked, repaired and delivered at your doorstep within 14 or 21 working days, depending on the brand. Similarly, you could check for other brands online and accordingly buy a suitable plan for your device. ",

In normal cases,the company provide a 3 year warranty and in most of the cases,the above mentiones spare part damages appears in a 3+ years of use and so is the extended warranty a better option which is usauly a 2 years extention after the 3 year normal warranty for most of the companies and go through the terms n conditions before ",

Often the warranty includes pointless checking that won't be done. You will still be charged. I have found it usually goes two ways. If a firm has a helpful warranty section. it is usually because they sell lemons and the staff are well practiced. Having a warranty is vital then, but it won't help you too much because you own a junk car. Usually you have firms trying everything to get out of the warranty.  Your car will be obselete before the warranty runs out.  I think you are better off buying at auction and learning basic mechanics. 99% of the useful thing done in a service is changing the oil. The rest is messing about. I have bought new vehicles a few times. I always viewed the money I spent on the extra services outweighed the money saved on warranty. I have only used warranties twice and both times were a nightmare.  Warranties just didn't give me peace of mind. In fact keeping them going added stress. ",

We called them the \"bag of air\". After a colleague completed a sale we'd ask \"Did they get the air?\". We got 15%, the sales manager got another chunk, the store manager got theirs and then the hard ass area manager got his. What was left went to corporate for them to take their piece and cover the actual cost of the warranty. Working in Circuit City taught me a lot about commissioned sales and extended warranties.

Here are the results: The Dodge warranty cost $1,200.00 but paid out over $5,500.00 in actual retail repairs over the 7 years I had the car. Definitely a wise investment given Dodge\u2019s repair-prone reputation. The Honda warranty, on the other hand, cost $1,800.00 and, over the 8 years I owned the car, it paid out about the same amount in repairs. I would have been better off investing it in the stock market! These were both manufacturer extended warranties. I never had a problem with them paying for any covered repairs and they were always done at the dealerships. Most of the repairs on each vehicle were done after the original 3 year bumper to bumper warranties had expired. Both vehicles were sold with less than 80,000 miles on them when the extended warranties expired. ",

In-store salespeople frequently push for extended warranty more for consumer electronics. Is it since they fear you'll harm your gadget and be left without coverage, or is it because that extended warranties are hugely productive for them. Reviews have appeared that extended warranties are not a good deal for most buyers but rather there are devices when you may need one and that can be worth. A few people feel progressively great realizing they are secured. In the event that you feel it's feasible, you'll require additional help or cover for accidental damages, at that point some extended warranties or coverage may be the best deal for you. There have seen different studies throughout the years recommending that somewhere in the range of 30 to 50 percent of cell phones fall victim to some sort of accident, from a small scratch on the screen or body to a dunking in the toilet or a broke display after a fall. With regards to cell phones, additional cost protection or warranties may appear sensible protection for the day your smartphone breaks or abandons you unexpectedly, but not tend you to pay off. As you buy a new device or appliance it comes with manufacturer warranty along with it. It is for the limited period like 1 or maximum 2 years. But what if this default warranty expires. At this point, you can opt for an Extended warranty for consumer electronics covering Smartphones, tablets, computers, TVs, gaming consoles, etc. and home warranties covering all your appliances. Therefore, I feel an extended warranty is worth to buy.  ",

If you were to add up all the extended warranties that you bought, chances are that amount would cover the cost of the repair on one of them ( should it fail, which is unlikely ) On vehicles, the only way that I would recommend extended warranty is: 1) make sure that it is a factory warranty and not aftermarket. 2) negotiate the policy price, as often you can get 10 to 30% off the premium just by asking for it. 3) Consider the extra new or used car warranty only if you plan on keeping the vehicle for an extended length of time. Many customers make the mistake of buying the extra warranty and trading their vehicle off after only one or two years and assume they can get the cost of the warranty back because it was not used. In fact, they would only get a pro-rated portion back and it can be a disappointingly small amount. ",

They have worded the policy so it doesn\u2019t pay for all repairs, just specific problems that really are unlikely to happen. About half of what these warranties cost goes to sales costs. You get some coverage on a new car from the maker so that if the car was made with a defect, it will get fixed early. If you put the money you would spend on a warranty in a safe place and use it for repairs the warranty would have covered, the odds are about 95% that when you sell the car, that money will still be there. That warranty doesn\u2019t cover regular repairs like brake replacement or accident damage, new tires or regular services. ",

While there are always some instances where an ESC paid off the fact is the majority of people who purchase and ESC will not recover what they paid for the ESC. No provider of an ESC could remain in business if it paid out more in claims than it took in as payments from buyers. What makes an ESC even less of a good thing, cost wise, is not only must the provider of the ESC take in more than it pays out the seller of the ESC must also earn a profit.

After th\u00e0t time I started facing many problems such as non heating, light issues etc. I was so exhausted to spend thousands of bucks on this. Then one of my friend suggested me to go for an extended warranty. To be honest I was not at all awared about this teran earlier. And searched a lot. Then the same friend suggested me to take from GoWarranty He was already taking their services. GoWarranty really helped me out which plan of warranty should I opt for. Their terms are clear. After taking service from GoWarranty now I can say that I am tension free for my microwave as they \u00e0re covering everything. My personal decision is to go with the extended warranty and if you want better service, no other option is available apart from GoWarranty ",

Here is what I wrote in an answer to Is purchasing an extended warranty on a car a good idea or does it depend on the make i.e. Ford Toyota ...etc? : For what it worth, I had so far two cars for which I bought an extended warranty: A Toyota had the tire pressure monitoring system fail when it was 4 years old. The cost to fix it was much more that the cost of the warranty (so it already paid itself). About a year later, the rear door's struts had to be replaced, and we're also coveredA Ford had the power seat motor fail when it was 5 years old. The cost fixing it was a few hundred dollars, accounting for about a third of the cost of the warranty. It still has about 18 months before the end of the coverage",

On a very simple level it comes down to the fact that if it were a better deal for most consumers then they wouldn't exist because the company selling the warranty would make no money on them. The reason I say \"maybe\" is due to the fact that most warranties are nothing more than an insurance policy on a given product. You could get lucky and get more value out of the repairs than you pay for the warranty but odds are you wont, and spread across all those who buy the average purchaser definitely won't. ",

I guess the cost of the warranty also affects whether it is worth buying, if its less than 10% of the purchase price for a 3 - 5 years, I might just go with it. ",

However, we as a whole realize that \"precautionary measure is superior to a fix\". In instances of a considerable fixed charge, a maintenance agreement goes about as a friend in need and covers all the costs. For example, your costly cars like Volkswagen or appliances like Sony Bravia or ur gadgets like iPhone 11 pro, etc sometimes go under certain issues which may cost you in tens of thousands. In these cases, the extended warranty plays a handy for you. So, I think GoWarranty is a very best choice and should be highly considered ",
