            "answer_text": "Writing the first book was exciting and lots of fun. Then came proofreading editing, revising and doing it all over again. Not fun. Publishing the book was also very exciting, all fulfilling. You feel proud. Your friends and family are proud of what you did and show off the book to their friends. Then marketing. Long hours and hard work. Not fun at all. The first book I published was a book of quotes that I did just after the mortgage meltdown as a way of promoting ethics. The book, Success and Happiness Quotes to Motivate, Inspire and Live by, under the pen name Atticus Aristotle actually did very well. I made the ebook free and the paperback as low as possible. During the first three years the ebook averaged about 4,000 downloads a month while the paperback averaged 20 per month. My second book was a memoir called Coming to Astoria, an Immigrant\u2019s Tale. Writing it was fun but that\u2019s about it. Everything else was hard work. It got decent reviews but didn\u2019t really sell. After the third year I stopped marketing and promoting the books. Too time consuming, and you need to invest some money, which I couldn\u2019t do.

            "answer_text": "As a philosopher, I measure the successfulness of my books not by popularity, but of how logically-cohesive the content in them is. The logic of a content is not determined by popularity but by the level of how much it makes sense. My first philosophy book, that I have nicknamed \u201cBook Zero\u201d, is so much of a mess, that I have decided to not print it, and to this day it rots in the chambers of my disk-on-key. However, its writing has served as a training ground for further writing and for further self-discipline, so I am not entirely disappointed with its outcome, although I am at large look at it negatively. From the second book onwards, however, I believe my content has become more and more logical, with each passing book. It might seem at first to be very difficult to write a book, but the more you practice, the more natural this skill will come for you, like with any skill in life. ",
