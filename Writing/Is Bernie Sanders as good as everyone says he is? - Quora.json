            "answer_text": "He\u2019s a VERY Good PersonYes, he absolutely is a good person, and probably one of the only politicians who means what he says and has fought for it his whole life. Killer Mike said it best during the Democratic primary in 2016 with this emotional video:  \u201cIf I can find a picture of you from 51 years ago, chained to a black woman, protesting segregation\u2026 I know that the only person I have the conscience to vote for, is Bernard Sanders\u2026\u201d Human Rights Advocate Since CollegeAnd if you think that sounds too good to be true\u2026 We\u2019re just getting started.  Yes, that is Bernie Sanders. You want another photo of him?  Yes, that\u2019s him marching with Martin Luther King Jr. For the People Not CorporationsGood person doesn\u2019t even begin to describe Bernie Sanders. The man has spent his whole life fighting for human rights, and while degenerates cling to corrupt corporate cronyism in our government, Bernie only took donations from small donors. Because he represents the PEOPLE, not the corporations. His PoliciesThat\u2019s why his message rings true and resonates. What did he campaign on during the primary?Issues - Bernie Sanders1. Single payer healthcare, because without healthcare, you die\u2026 Plain and simple.2. A living wage, because if you\u2019re working all day and still can\u2019t make ends meet, you will eventually die\u2026 Plain and simple.3. Getting money out of politics\u2026 Because if your government is PURCHASABLE as ours currently is, you will never get fair representation. His Authenticity\u201cOh but all politicians just say what we want to hear!\u201dReally? What politicians are fighting for single payer healthcare? Which ones were fighting for it before Bernie Sanders brought that issue to the forefront? When Bernie Sanders talks to people, he doesn\u2019t tell them what they WANT to hear, he tells them what he\u2019s trying to do. He doesn\u2019t make false promises, he\u2019s very realistic about what he thinks he can accomplish. Watch him interact with this lady at a West Virginia Townhall (keeping in mind this is long after he lost the primary).  Does that not seem like a compassionate human being?If you can\u2019t recognize the genuine article when it\u2019s right in front of you, I have to question YOUR humanity. Voting RecordLook at his voting record, what does he vote for? Wealth equality, human rights, supporting our veterans, supporting our troops (but NOT for war, because he\u2019s anti-interventionist and wants peaceful solutions), supporting our infrastructure, and supporting the citizens of the United States, not corporate subsidies. The Voter's Self Defense System Who Funds His CampaignsLook at his campaign financing. Where does the money come from? Individual contributions are over 90%, because he doesn\u2019t take corporate money, unlike the majority of politicians who currently screw us over at every opportunity.Sen. Bernie Sanders A politician used to be, and is supposed to be, a representative of the people. Bernie Sanders is the genuine article, and though he isn\u2019t the last, it\u2019s so incredibly rare these days that I question the integrity of anyone who would try to besmirch him. Anti-Bernie Paid ActivismCorrect the Record (now Shareblue) had actual paid trolls who would attack Bernie in various forums and sow dissent among his followers. They still do that to this very day, fearing a 2020 campaign (which Sanders has not ruled out). I suspect some of the answers here are from David Brock funded smear campaigns. Now why would corporate entities want to smear Bernie\u2019s name? I think it\u2019s pretty obvious. Anti-Corruption AdvocateBernie has an agenda that would end all the corporate cronyism in the U.S. political system. He would push hard for anti-corruption measures. We have politicians like Joe Manchin who are funded by Saudi Arabia\u2026 Joe Manchin was 1 of 5 Democrats who betrayed his party to help pass the Saudi Arabia $110 billion arms deal for Trump!Joe Manchin Was One of Five Democrats Who Saved Saudi Arms Sales. His Primary Opponent Is Furious.Loophole Allows Saudi Arabian Businesses to Spend Freely in Our Election This garbage would end if Bernie ever took the White House\u2026 But hey, you\u2019re still not sure if he\u2019s the genuine article? Just watch the man speak. If you haven\u2019t done that, you haven\u2019t given him a fair chance\u2026  \u201cWe are in this together, we always have been and we always will be.\u201d-Bernie Sanders He has fought, and always will fight for the greater good, and if that doesn\u2019t make you a good person\u2026 I don\u2019t know what does.

            "answer_text": "Is Bernie Sanders nice? I have absolutely no idea if Bernie Sanders is \u201cnice\u201d. This has nothing to do with his work. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s nice like it matters if he\u2019s ethical or a good candidate or efficient or consistent. I\u2019m not going to get into that. I will say that while this question is totally irrelevant, it\u2019s actually somewhat refreshing for a change of pace to see a fluffy ad hominem misdirecting conversation pointed in the direction of a male candidate such as Sanders. Not at Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, Kirsten Gilibrand, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cynthia Nixon \u2026Yoko Ono, Cecile Richards, Emma Gonzalez, Serena Williams, Chrissy Teigan, Hillary Clinton, Monica Lewinsky, Emma Watson\u2026 and every woman who has ever stumbled into the public eye. Women and men are held to the standard of being competent and ethical and all of the necessary things - and women are also attacked for something intangible. The ways they don\u2019t fit. The ways they aren\u2019t wanted? I hate to speculate. Why does artist Yoko Ono get hate for John and Paul breaking up the Beatles? She got married and stuff happened. We don\u2019t hear a lot about the boys\u2019 screw ups as much as they are lauded. Were they nice? Is it not tacky to attack a grieving widow and her family for decades after she lost her musician husband while ignoring her own body of work? Isn\u2019t she nice? Bill Clinton had an ill advised affair that he is accountable for with a young intern while he was President of the USA. He was impeached for it. It wasn\u2019t non-consensual, but it was dumb. Monica Lewinsky and Hillary Clinton have absorbed much more damage. Why? Aren\u2019t they nice? Julian Assange and Edward Snowden are critiqued on their actions. A third of the main description on the very top of the Wikipedia page for Chelsea Manning is about the fact that she\u2019s a trans woman and about her hormone therapy. Which is a part of who she is: but no one discusses the gender or identities of Snowden or Assange. It must be hard to date in exile. Are they nice? Our president is not nice. Whether or not you support him, he mocks the disabled and chants about sending other people to jail at rallies. He breaks apart families due to what seems to be xenophobia or a fixation with a base-catering promise to xenophobes. He\u2019s not very good at looking like he cares for equality. He allegedly assaults and definitely harasses and definitely speaks degradingly about women. But the conservative press loves to make character attacks on all of the new diverse women members of Congress. Are they nice? Is the president? What about all of the mostly male members of Congress who are not usually attacked this way who have been in office quite a while? Are they nice? So, is Bernie nice? No idea. Don\u2019t really care. More worried about his ethics and his job performance and all the things I mentioned above. But thanks for asking. It\u2019s nice to see this spread around. Or, maybe we could all collectively cut the crap. ",
