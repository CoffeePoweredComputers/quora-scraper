            "answer_text": "I can think of many reasons: You can\u2019t give a proper and fair review of a product if you don\u2019t give it a chance. That\u2019s why tech reviewers often spend at least a week using smartphones and laptops before writing their reviews. That\u2019s why automobile reviewers might spend an entire month getting to know a car before putting out a review. The more you know about the product, the more comprehensive your review will be.A game may initially seem like a great game, but then gets worse as you delve deeper into the gameplay.A good example of this is World of Tanks (and to a slightly lesser extent, World of Warships). It\u2019s a very easy game to get into, and it seems pretty straightforward at first. But the more you play it, you start encountering the toxic player base, people spamming premium ammo, and the exponentially more painful grind. After playing over 100 hours, you may decide that this game is trash\u2014 and that is, in fact, how a lot of people view World of Tanks.A game can get worse with updates. Usually this happens due to changes in management or in staff, and the direction of the game changes entirely.World of Warships is a fantastic example of this. Initial versions of WOWS showed great promise. The game was initially released in 2015, and IMHO it peaked around late-2018. In April 2019, a brand new line of Soviet battleships were introduced to the game\u2014 and that\u2019s when the shit started to hit the fan. These new ships were WAY overpowered, and while the developers eventually got to nerfing some of these god-tier ships, the general design philosophy never went away. Almost every new content update since included some overpowered shit that broke the game entirely. In addition, developers have also included in the updates new features that unnecessarily complicate the game.Scrabble Go (mobile game) is also a good example. Scrabble is (and always has been) a simple, straightforward game. I\u2019ve always enjoyed Scrabble on my mobile because it was a stark contrast to Words With Friends, which included a bunch of extraneous frilly bullshit that unnecessarily complicated what should be a simple game. And then EA handed the reins over to Scopely, which turned vanilla Scrabble into Scrabble Go. If you thought Words With Friends was chock full of frilly bullshit, oh boy\u2014 Scrabble Go turns it to eleven. There\u2019s so much extraneous frilly bullshit in it, it\u2019s actually migraine-inducing.Just as a game can start out great and get progressively worse with updates, it can also start out horribly and get progressively better with updates. Problem is, initial negative reviews are seldom deleted or amended. So one might see a negative review from someone who has played the game for hundreds of hours because they only enjoyed the game after the developers started addressing player concerns.",

            "answer_text": "Most modern games are so complex, you can\u2019t give it a fair assessment after an hour of gameplay. When you\u2019re a new player, what you perceive as frustrating, could simply be your lack of skill when attempting to progress. Broken games are generally discovered when someone is somewhat of a veteran player, and knows the game thoroughly enough to know that certain elements suck. Usually, getting to maximum level is not the end of the game. You also have \u2018alternate\u2019 advancement levels, flags, keys, special armors, and things like that. What if you found out: You just obtained maximum level. The only way to progress at that point is to enter a PVP zone, and there are people at your level who have full weapons and armor that are much stronger than yours. They camp the zone in with a pack of 12 players, and kill everything that moves. You will never overpower them, because they camp in 8 hour shifts, and other people from their guild/clan replace them when they log out. They are also much stronger than you, being decked out in all the armor from the zone you are trying to get into. Or they have special \u2018raid\u2019 armor that requires a team of 54 to beat, all their guild members got fully geared in raid gear, and they just happen to be in the \u2018casual\u2019 zone to kill you for fun because they are bored. To add insult to injury, you will never be able to join a \u2018raid\u2019 guild because you cannot obtain the gear from the casual zone.You purchased a $60 game, got to maximum level, and the only way to proceed is through a special dungeon once a day that requires a special ticket. The ticket sells for $20 in the game\u2019s cash store.There is no content after maximum level, and it took you less than a week to get there. Too bad.",
