These will need to be ordered carefully to fit the pieces of work you have. Keep in mind the reason for a bibliography and ensure that it is possible for someone who is reading the resource to be able to track down any point which has been made to see where it comes from. Bearing this in mind, you will need to clearly date each fact of note, each important point which is being made, and it\u2019s origin so everything may be traced\u2026time date name of paper/article and author. Your lists of information must be alphabetical and numbered to match numbers in the text of the resource to which they pertain., or they could be in numerical order of the numbers in the text.

Some scientific books have both, list of the quotations in the text by number and another list of authors alphabetically ordered with cross referencing linking each list. ",
