            "answer_text": "Yes, stenography is useful \u2014 especially since the Open Steno Project has come on the scene and released Plover, which is a free steno program that works on Windows, Linux, and the Mac. Regular steno software \u2014 or more commonly, CAT software, as in \u201cComputer Aided Transcription\u201d \u2014 start out at about $2000 on the low end, and get up to $5,000 on the high end \u2026 and there was nothing available for the Mac \u2026 and Linux? Pffft. Since Plover has been released, if you are a writer, programmer, or just curious, you can use Plover and a steno machine to write (not type) into any program you can use a regular keyboard with. The world record in speed for steno is 360 words per minute(!!), but thankfully, most people would just need to get to the point where they can beat their QWERTY keyboard speed. When I am working on my website using Plover, I use my writer (a ProCAT Flash, for the curious) and a few steno dictionary definitions so I can stroke a couple outlines like this \u2014 PHRA-S /PWA-UD (say \u201cPlas Bod\u201d) \u2014 which gives me this: <p class= \u201cbody\u201d> \u2026 and my HTML editor of choice autocompletes that body tag, leaving my cursor right where I can write whatever needs to be written there. I don\u2019t program (planning on learning to use Xojo), so I\u2019m not sure what sort of entries to my steno dictionary I would need, but I do know that a few of the Plover developers use Plover to write their code. The folks at the Open Steno Project also have low-cost steno machines \u2014 or more correctly, gaming keyboards that emulate a steno keyboard one could buy and learn how to steno. Ordinarily I would tell you at this point that I am using Plover to write this post, but \u2026 well. I\u2019m sitting in bed, typing on an Apple Extended Bluetooth keyboard, connected to a MacBook Pro (too many of the keys don\u2019t work, and yes, I should fix that). Probably more than you wanted to know, but now you know! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, very. And there is a national shortage of court reporters. Court reporting requires an associate degree and you must be able to write 225 words per minute on the stenograph machine. It is law in the United States that a court reporter be present for all types of trials, Civil and Criminal, pleas, sentences, pretrial conferences, all types of criminal matters. Project Steno is the NCRA\u2019s way of making people aware of our profession. ",
