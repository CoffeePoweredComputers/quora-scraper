            "answer_text": "I think writing is the primary symbol of handedness. I have a good friend what writes with his left hand. He wasn\u2019t very athletic, but when he did play sports it was his left hand. He identified as being left handed in a very casual way. I don\u2019t get the impression that he ever thought about it that much. Writing is such an important activity in our lives and it is not easy or quick to learn to do and I think this makes writing with your left hand difficult to be overshadowed by doing other things with your right hand. If you can write with your left hand and that is all, it\u2019s enough. Ultimately, it\u2019s your choice how you present yourself to the world. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable or good about calling yourself left-handed then call yourself mixed handed. You will have to explain to most people what that is, but if it feels right then go for it. If you\u2019d rather be known as a left handed person then do it. If you\u2019d rather see yourself as right handed, you could reasonably claim that also. You have choices, so feel free to choose what feels the best to you. Hope this helps. ",
