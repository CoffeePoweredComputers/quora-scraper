            "answer_text": "You are only asked to write an essay during an exam of a class you are enrolled in. There is scant possibility that the material was not covered either in class or in the required reading. Did you prepare thoroughly for the class? If the answer is an honest yes, then what you do, is you write nothing, put your name on the paper and you will fail the essay. If you prepared honestly for the test and you are still clueless, it is best that you are honest and fail. Then have a meeting with your instructor and tell the instructor that you were prepared as well as you could be and the question was so far afield that you did not know how to deal with it. Try and work out with the instructor some possible other strategies. Extra credit or what ever. However, if you really did not prepare well, and everyone else in the class did, you my friend are in an unenviable place. Take this as a lesson on why for every class room hour you should put in anywhere from 3\u20135 home work hours every week. If you are carrying 15 units, that means somewhere between 45\u201375 homework hours a week. There is no amount of BS you can possibly write on a topic you know nothing about. It is better to just turn in a blank paper then BS and fail anyway. The instructor will respect honesty and will dismiss BS in a heartbeat. ",
