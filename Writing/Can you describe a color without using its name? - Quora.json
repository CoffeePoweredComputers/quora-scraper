            "answer_text": "This one, is a very odd question. Without some common reference, color would be relegated to be described in vague terms or phrasings. For the differences of comprehension, for each of the senses, the information is processed in different places in the mind. The simplest one may lead to a very complex misconception. Taste is subjective, to say a banana is yellow is true, but what of those who've never seen one? And what of ripeness, or other yellows, like a lemon or inside of a pineapple, as these all would taste and feel differently, have different smells, and those are edible, unlike certain creatures or plants. When one cannot see the color, but can detect in other ways, they may visualize colors. What the description may do doesn't necessarily have anything to do with any resulting comprehension. The truth is, if someone cannot see the color, or ever learn by some indication for hearing problems a standard description, it will be no different than one without the ability of literacy, for whatever reason, kinda. If you wanted, you could try explaining the electromagnetic spectrum and Hertz frequency in relation to nanometers. Red light has less energy typically, blue is greater, but red has a higher frequency, and blue lesser, with the others spanning the gap, which is around 300 to 360 nanometers in range from 396 approx to 696 to 756 or there abouts for some types of light. Say that color is the wavelength refractions of photonic ionized energy waves interacting in a medium, in varying intensities, retaining a residual charge from any particles they interact with or are interacted upon. This is the same for hearing, which is in a different wavelength pattern frequency, or feeling of vibrations, but all forms of electromagnetic interactions, such as speech, need some pattern that is more universal. Mathematical geometrics show many recurrent patterns and fractalizations that are recurrent, shapes that relate to life, physics. All the colors can be described by shifts in Hertz nM ranges, or the shapes and angles of ocular entry for the electromagnetic radiations entering the eye. It's up to teaching a reference, conditioned understanding. We could change it and decide to teach all colors in a shifted spectrum to different groups, even giving different designations, and they would be colorblind to each other, but still be able to function. This is color a and this is b, etc. I'm sure at this point every basic gutteral uttering we could muster to describe colors has been, maybe not all possible combinations, but at least all possible noises. There'd be no way with words that hasn't been likely, especially when time and language comes into play. ",

            "answer_text": "I would go one of two ways depending on my audience. One I would refer to something that was normally or standardly that color. For example if I want to refer to red or describe I would say it's the color of a standard apple or tomato. Another way I could do this is by saying that it is the light with a wave length of 670nm. Brown you would say it was a mixture of teo or three colors and give their wavelength and relative intensity. For some colors you could compare them to another color. For example pink is a less saturated red. ",
