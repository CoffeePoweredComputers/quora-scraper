            "answer_text": "One would write with all one\u2019s memories of films and TV shows concerning Westerns as a separate genre to the full extent of American history. If this is a current events situation then we know that America has all sorts of customs and cultures and whatever the previous generation has to offer that affects people today ought to the brought in as extra to any main character. The lesser characters are sometimes regarded as comic relief rather than truly contributing in their own right. So while we can as writers get these flashback memories, we don\u2019t need to use these at all. The main thing is reality rather than fiction for special characters to be real to different readers. Even so, we know that written books may be used for films and for TV shows and then it\u2019s not always in our hands to manage the ways that characters or real people will be represented and represented fairly. : It\u2019s a definite responsibility to think ahead as to how lengthy dialogue in our written work may be edited and chopped up and about to suit directors, and producers with their own agendas, or financial restraints, and technical expertise. So if we can reduce scenes to the bare bones, we offer others no control over what gets written. As soon as we describe a scene, then we control the way a character will possible appear in such productions later on. Was the character wearing any specific item linked with the Native American, or in totally conventional clothes that showed nothing out of the ordinary? Were there specific phrases that needed extra explanations? Was offensive language used, but which could or should be edited out? Were any of the characters armed, so as to be seen as violent? If not, then maybe that needs to be clearly explained and not just left without explanation. One has to show character, as well as intent, whether positive or negative. Some writers seek extra guidance before submitting work to publishers. Remember that the question itself doesn\u2019t explain the story intentions or the genre, whether it\u2019s a romance or a crime or detective story or a comedy or serious social statement on society today and for previous generations. So don\u2019t expect us to provide more suitable answers. : ",

            "answer_text": "If you are going to fret about offending people then don\u2019t bother writing novels. I had a classic review on a blurb on amazon for one of my novels. Yes the blurb not the novel itself. It is called The Kilted Cowboy, and the review is still there. They were offended because in the blurb I used the words red Indians and not native Americans. However if you look through some of the reviews, you will find five star reviews from people who are obviously native Americans who loved the novel. I left one word for that person, it was idiot. I offend people all the time and I gave up giving a damn about it a very long time ago. It doesn\u2019t matter what you write it is going to offend someone out there. So I am afraid if you are too sensitive, this is not the career path for you. ",
