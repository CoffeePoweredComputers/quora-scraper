            "answer_text": "Hey, Comment is not just giving an opinion it\u2019s a responsibility too. If you want to comment on a blog post or anywhere else, you must read that entire post or go through what the author has published. Commenting is not only criticism. If you find the post helpful or adding value to your work or life then only thanking is also a great example of comment. There is no secret formula to get comments approved but before leaving comment you should do following things. Comment as yourself. Be real who you are. It\u2019s very important thing.Don\u2019t put own keywords or I mean to say keyword stuffing that\u2019s beneficial for you or your website name as identity of comment. It seems spammy & unethical too. (I think so)Respect the author because he has worked hard for his content which you would be reading.Make a friendly tone or conversation. If you like say, it\u2019s great and if you want to add something then write it in very pleasant way. You may ask for extra (it\u2019d be nice) or ask questions relevant to the post.Don\u2019t be scared to give your opinion but make sure you know before that or have well researched topic. Share your ideas about that topic with other people.Opening conversation through contact us is bonus tip here. The author will know who you are. It will build a bond or relationship between you & your comments will get approved easily.Be first to comment (by following above rules) for the blogs who accept comments from reader.With these top seven tips will definitely get your comments approved by the blog admin. I hope it\u2019s not too difficult, is it? ",

            "answer_text": "Not sure I fully understand the question, but I will try to answer. I\u2019m not sure if there are any secrets. I think that any answer that is an honest reaction to a blog post will be approved. Here are a few kinds of comments I do not approve: Spam. Some people just post comments about their business offer everywhere that comments can be made. It adds nothing to the conversation so it is irrelevant.A person who is vulgar or abusive will generally not get their comment approved.Some commenters attack someone else who has commented and I just think it is disrespectful.Some commenters attack me personally. It makes others uncomfortable and is not the purpose of my blog.Blog comments I like are those that add some insight to what has been written about. Sometimes people disagree with me and correct me or offer a different point of view, but they do it with respect. I am committed to lifelong learning and want to hear it when I am wrong. Just don\u2019t be nasty about it. Hope you find this helpful. ",
