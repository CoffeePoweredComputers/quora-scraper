            "answer_text": "A2A Your advisor is right: There is a difference between an Academic Paper and a Statement of Purpose (SOP). The SOP should demonstrate what you have accomplished and what you want to achieve, see my blog Statement of Purpose, the Human Touch. For example: \"In my senior years, I worked with Professor James where we research the effectiveness of MOOCs that cumulated in a published a paper entitled \"Are MOOCs moot?\" What we found was the key to this massive online open courses what a Single Point Of Contact (SPOC) that made the difference. With hundreds of thousand of students, it came down to a single person using that Social Media of MOOC Message Boards that was the conduit that replaced the office hours with teachers. There was not a replacement for one to one tutorial help but only an automation, a virtual touching the flesh.\" \"I hope to continue this work of exploring utilizing the web for educating the poor in the Center of Social Justice at Stanford.\" I think you can clearly see what was my research experience. The Admission Committee does not need to read the paper; they only need to know of the paper. For it is not the content but the published paper is the accomplishment. Also the concluding sentence tell the committee what and where my research area is at Stanford. ",
