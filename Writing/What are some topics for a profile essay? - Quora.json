            "answer_text": "The best profile essay topics are interesting. They generally use people, places and events to make the essay more vivid and believable. Students may use topics like a recent block party, political gathering for event ideas. When it comes to locations, a local business, restaurant or landmark building could be interesting. Often, students choose to use buildings or stores that are new to write about. Older buildings and landmarks have generally been written about in the past, so a newer store offers the opportunity of creating a unique essay. For people-related topics, students should find someone who has an interesting background or occupation. A more interesting topic equals out to a more engaging essay. ",
