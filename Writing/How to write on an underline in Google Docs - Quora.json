            "answer_text": "If the other answers don't help, I'm guessing you're doing something like filling out a form that someone sent you as a document. The form probably provides its \u201cspaces to write in\" as sequences of underscore characters. If you're filling out the form electronically rather than printing it and handwriting, just replace the underscore characters with whatever you want to type. Yes, the line will disappear, but so what? The space will still be there. If you really want to have a line, you can set the text as underlined, but it's not really necessary. ",

Just as in MS Word, one of the options on the task bar, beside B (bold) and I (Italic) is a U with a line under it. This is the underline icon. If you click on it before you type, what you type after that will be underlined. Click on it again to stop underlining. Alternatively, if you have text already typed, select it and click on the underline icon to underline it. ",
