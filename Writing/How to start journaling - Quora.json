            "answer_text": " 1. Create a journaling routine: Pick a time each day (or every few days) where you will dedicate 10\u201320min to journaling. I find it works best first thing in the morning or before going to bed every day. Put it in your calendar, set a reminder on your phone and stick to it for 3 weeks. After that, your habit will have manifested and it should feel like brushing your teeth\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can\u2019t go a day without it. 2. Get a physical notebook: Pick a really nice one, one that makes you WANT to fill it with words. Pick a nice pen too. This will make it feel more like a ritual. 3. Pick your journaling format: Depending on the time of day you are journaling, your journaling goal and preference, there are different formats that might be helpful. Here are a few examples: Question led journaling: Morning: What are my 3 most important things today that I need to get done?What am I excited about today?What is my intention for the day?Evening: List 3 things you are grateful for todayList 5 things that went well todayWhat could I have done better today?Open journaling: Do a Brain DumpWrite down ideasWrite down your feelingsReflect on your dayMeditate on a problem4. Stick to the same journaling structure every day: For example: always use two pages for each day, always have the same questions at the same order every time. Why? This will make it easier for you to discover patterns in your thoughts and behaviours. See point 5. 5. Regularly review your journal to discover patterns in your thoughts and behaviours: And ultimately, define actions to take based on your findings. Here are some examples: I have been complaining about severe back pain every evening in my journal. However, I haven\u2019t done something against it yet. It is time to take actionI have not been writing down ANYTHING that I am excited about for the following day in weeks. I should change something in my life.",

            "answer_text": "We keep a lot of things in our brain, but we put very little bit on paper. All those thoughts and ideas throwing around can sometimes feel very overwhelming. you have a to-do list, hopes, faith in something, dreams, secrets, failures, love, loss, and ups and downs.ideas will come and go, the feeling will pass. the ideas never stay permanently they will changes day by day. A great way to keep your thoughts organized and clear your mind is to write them down in a journal. Writing is a great exercise for anyone and by expressing yourself in a personal place is a wonderful way to stay sane. by my point of view, the keeping journal is the best things to do with ourself with that we know that what are the weaknesses and what is our strength about ourself.  Starting a Journal To start a journal, you just have to be willing to write. You don\u2019t have to write well, you just wanna write it. You don\u2019t even need to decide what to write, you just need to let your words flow from your head, whatever you feel just put on into the word and emotionalize thoughts .once you\u2019ve decided you want to create a journal. SET UP A SCHEDULE when you play to write in your journal. You want to turn your writing into a habit, so create a schedule Pick a time and the days o the week you will want to write and create a timely calendar reminder I prefer to google calendar, so you will never forget. By scheduling the same times, Journaling will become a natural and regular part of your agenda that you can look forward to.  FIND THE RIGHT SPACE TO WRITE When you are writing, it is exceedingly helpful to be in a space where you can focus and concentrate. A quiet room with no distractions works best. Allow yourself to focus on your writing, without any interruption and disturbances.make sure you are able to sit upright and are comfortable. a library and quite a room are always better.  CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REFLECT ON YOUR DAY you may not know what to write about and that\u2019s okay.your journaling can be anything about you wanna. journaling is formed by many things some people are used to productivity or maintaining or many things which we can do with journaling. A great way to begin writing is to close our eyes keep deep breath and just thoughts about the whole day and write our emotionalized thoughts and talk with ourself.  ASK YOURSELF QUESTIONS what has happened that day? How did that make you feel? Are you excited about anything? why? Reflect on the thoughts and feelings you\u2019ve been having. how are we can cultivating myself learn with my life wisdom? and what are the things which we have to focus more to improve improvement in ourself?  DIVE IN AND START WRITING it is easy t begin sentences with, \u201cI like\u201d, or \u201cI think\u201d, or \u201cI feel\u201d, or \u201cI wonder\u201d.Don\u2019t feel pressured to stick to any particular form or topic. The beginning of your journal writing can just be an introduction to your thoughts at the time. This is your personal space, so you should feel comfortable writing. MAINTAIN JOURNAL BEFORE GO TO BED AND AFTER WAKE UP FROM BED it is exceedingly important when you are doing or maintaining your journal in the morning our brain cell is fresh to learning something and make something which our day goes with a plan which was made by you. The night journaling is about the overview of the day How was my day goes? What things do which make me happy? what did I learn from my life wisdom today? TIME YOURSELF Set a timer for how long you want to write. Somewhere between 5-20 minutes is ideal, depending on how much you want to jot down. Setting a time will help you stay focused and stop you from getting carried away. It is easy to feel like you need to write down every detail and this will help prevent that.  RE-READ YOUR ENTRY AND ADD ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS When you are finished writing a journal entry, go back and read through it. Once you have reviewed what you have written, add a couple of sentences at the end about what you noticed or thought about your words. If you can, summarize your thoughts in a sentence or two. That is a great way to narrow in on topics.  Hope this will help you. \u2019ALL THE VERY BEST TO YOUR FUTURE\u2019 Edit 1: Start your Jounal from today, tomorrow what will happens no once know just start it, it will give more satisfaction and make you metafitness strong and last but not the least journal will give you the strength of know your self better and cultivation of self-awareness.its exceedingly grittiest toward the Self-Improvement. Edit 2 : I have been writing Journal since i was 16 yeas old.and from my wisdom's i assure you it will best journey of yourself that will definitely make you changer.

If your question is about motivation to journal or training yourself to keep up with your journaling an a regular basis, I would suggest keeping a notebook or planner of some type next to your bed as a reminder to write down your thoughts or events of the day each night before bed or first thing in the morning - dream journaling can be a fun activity too and a great way to get out the creative ideas that are milling around in your brain as you sleep. It will also help if you try to stick to a schedule, that way journaling will become a habit and you won\u2019t even have to think about it, you\u2019ll just automatically do it every day according to that schedule.

I got nothing. A couple of starts to journaling - I remember. . . And I don\u2019t remember. . . (Thank you Natalie Goldberg). Time the effort. Set your timer for five minutes and write anything at all for five minutes. The subject matters less than the effort. If you are happy with the results, be happy, acknowledge your efforts and close the journal. Tomorrow write for ten minutes. Like exercise, don\u2019t over do it the first couple of weeks or you\u2019ll become frustrated and reject the whole enterprise. A few minutes a day it all it takes to start, and sometimes all it takes for journaling to improve your life. Good luck! ",

My best way for journaling is on the go so has to be on my phone. Even in the digital journaling there are many variations. From super simple - type the journal to automatic journaling that create some of the content for you, make it beautiful etc. I use the automatic version since its the simplest in my mind to adopt with a busy schedule.  I personally use Stiya (Stiya - Automatic Journal and Experience Sharing for Life on the App Store) but there are others like (HeyDay, KeepTrax etc). With Stiya you get every day places you've been to and photos you took and all you need to do is add some notes and you journal is visually gorgeous. I find it really beautiful to look back and relive the days.  Anyway good luck! You'll love having the memories no matter what method you'll use. ",

            "answer_text": "There are as many different ways as there are individuals. A few suggestions, though. I was held back in the beginning by my inner critic. I was hesitant to put words on paper, to commit a thought, because I might not \u201cget it right.\u201d My solution was to talk to my inner critic, in writing. Even asking it, \u201cWhy are you bugging me?\u201d and answering your own query gets the ball rolling. To this day, I write my journal by hand in a bound book rather on the computer because I would constantly be editing, otherwise. Sure, I wind up addressing the same idea from different angles this way, but that's the beauty of writing that's not for anyone but yourself. I also allow myself to freely associate thoughts and ideas. When I change tack, I simply draw hash marks in the margin, skip a line, and keep on going. You can always go back to a subject. I frequently reference the date(s) where I previously addressed something, so I have a jumping-off place for further exploration without having to repeat myself. If I'm really stuck but I'm in the mood to write, I sometimes start out by posing a question. It can be anything, from silly to serious, a \u201cwhat if\" or a \u201cwhy,\" as long as it piques your interest. It could be a question you could imagine on an essay test about yourself. Then answer it. Often, a journal entry of mine will start with a single word. These \u201cwords of the day\" don't have to be esoteric. The word of the day yesterday, for instance, was \u201ccrazy,\u201d and boy, did that take off in many directions! Lastly, it's important to have fun. Take it seriously, yes. You're choosing to spend your precious time writing just for yourself. But allow your sense of humor to flow too. A great question to start off an entry: What made me laugh today? Hope this helps! Best of luck! ",

I always believe unless you\u2019re going to turn your journal in for a class, that you can style it any way you want.

Notebooks follow studies where the subject matches the topics, in this case, assigned by a bot. If it is about startups then it could have subtopics on tech transfer, for instance. They can plan ahead. Some authors like to keep logs of ideas, goals, values, sentiments, or speculations in addition to events and reactions. Phone apps also cover all of this and toss in the other devices for photos or voice to capture more senses. A process or method can be formally outlined like bullet journals or art journals. Morning pages are the inverse of end of day reflections. Any kind of entry may suffice, such as biography, autobiography, memoir, history, literary essay, scene, review, role models, research notes, or narrative. Some boast externalized memories, and others quantified selves. The cloud seems to be including virtual settings the way that the internet expanded upon domains before it.

The word journal comes from the same root (diurnus \"of the day\") through Old French jurnal (modern French for day is jour).The earliest use of the word to mean a book in which a daily record was written was in Ben Jonson's comedy Volpone in 1605. The oldest extant diaries come from Middle Eastern and East Asian cultures, although the even earlier work To Myself , today known as the Meditations, written in Greek by the Roman Emperor Marcus Aerilius in the second half of the 2nd century AD, already displays many characteristics of a diary. Pillowbooks of Japanese court ladies and Asian travel journals offer some aspects of this genre of writing, although they rarely consist exclusively of diurnal records. The scholar Li Ao (9th century AD), for example, kept a diary of his journey through southern China. ",
