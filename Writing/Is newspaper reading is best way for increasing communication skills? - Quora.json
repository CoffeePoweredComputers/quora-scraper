            "answer_text": "Though reading a newspaper is mostly for finding out what is happening in the world around us, the activity also can teach us some communication skills. Generally, newspapers (especially stories written by news services like the AP) present \u2018hard\u2019 news in what is called an inverted pyramid. This style give the key facts - the who, what, when and where of the newsworthy event - in the first few paragraphs. The rest of the story is then written to give further detail, color or meaning to those basic facts. Reading a paper may not be the best way to learn communications skills, but it can be valuable. I have heard of immigrants to the United States watching situation comedies and documentaries to learn many facets of effective, personal communication. ",
