            "answer_text": "Hi there, I had the same problem a while ago with my research proposal and I stumbled upon this site: fast-paper-editing. I made my point very clear that I needed an honest opinion about how good my essay was and my writer\u2019s response met with my approval. A word of advice from my experience \u2013 no matter what service you use, don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch with the writer directly and explain what exactly you are looking for. Because many services are mediators between a client and writer. Good luck with your application! ",
