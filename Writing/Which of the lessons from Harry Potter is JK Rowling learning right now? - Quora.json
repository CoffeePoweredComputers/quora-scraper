            "answer_text": "Which of the lessons from Harry Potter is JK Rowling learning right now? None of them! If anything she is forgetting all of the lessons she focused on in Harry Potter. She wrote it as a treatise against bigotry and prejudice, while currently engaging in bigotry herself.[1][2][3]She also forgot how harmful it is to spread disinformation about people, and has turned into Rita Skeeter. According to Rita\u2026 I mean Rowling, these are all \u201cmen in dresses\u201d:   JKR also forgot that some of her own characters changed sex with polyjuice potion\u2026 \u2026and she forgot about the Trans implications of being a metamorphmagus who can change their physical attributes without polyjuice potion. And when I look at JK Rowling following her own transformation into a bigot, this is who I see now: JK Rowling learned how to be a bigot, but not from Harry Potter. She learned that from ANTI-Feminists and TERFS. Footnotes[1] Nathan Beard's answer to Why do people say J.K. Rowling's pseudonym Robert Galbraith is associated with conversion therapy?[2] Nathan Beard's answer to What is the difference between people that want to Burn Harry Potter because J.K. Rowling is popularizing witchcraft and those that want to burn Harry Potter because J.K. Rowling has a polemic opinion?[3] Nathan Beard's answer to Why do some people have negative reviews towards the \"Troubled Blood\" book by J.K Rowling?",
