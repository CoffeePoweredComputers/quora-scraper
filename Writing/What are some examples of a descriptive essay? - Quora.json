            "answer_text": "Read this selection from ballerina Suzanne Farrell\u2019s memoir, Holding on to the Air. Then answer the questions. When you\u2019re finished (it won\u2019t take long), you will understand what descriptive writing is all about. The point is that the items in the hotel room help you understand the personalities and values of the three women who lived there. The Ansonia adapted from Holding on to the Air by Suzanne Farrell and Toni Bentley We needed a place to live, but we couldn\u2019t afford much. Acquaintances in the Cincinnati arts community had told Mother about the Ansonia, a large prewar apartment hotel on Broadway and 73rd Street. It was famous for housing musicians, opera singers, and other theatrical people, and now it seemed that we qualified. Many of the apartments were huge and spacious, with views over Broadway\u2014but not ours. We had a one-year lease on a one-room studio on the sixteenth floor, and after the trundle bed and Bev\u2019s second-hand baby grand piano were installed, there was very little room for us. There were two small window seats, but we kept the blinds drawn because we faced over the courtyard directly into other apartment windows. There was a little closet in one corner where we installed our hot plate, but we weren\u2019t supposed to cook because of the lack of ventilation. More often than not we ate at the Horn & Hardart Automat across the street. Mother had saved only enough money for the security payment and the first month\u2019s rent, so she immediately enrolled with a nursing agency that provided her with a steady stream of jobs as a private-duty nurse. She worked, as she always had, at night so that she could be home for Bev and me during the day. This was also practical, since the bed slept only two; she used it during the day, and because the curtain was drawn we had to do our homework by candlelight. Even with the scholarships\u2014Bev got one to the Manhattan School of Music and attended the High School of Performing Arts, which was free\u2014there was very little cash, and Mother often worked twenty-hour shifts, arriving home completely exhausted. The bathroom had a bathtub, but the toilet often didn\u2019t work, so we used the one at the Automat. None of these inconveniences bothered me, however; my home was not at the Ansonia. It was ten blocks uptown. Classes at the School of American Ballet began the first week of September, and I was immediately enthralled. Questions 1. Use these items to describe what everyday life was like for the two girls and their mother: candles toilet hot plate window seat trundle bed baby-grand piano 2. Use your imagination to describe what Mrs. Ficker might have heard, seen, and felt when she left the apartment for work in the evening. 3. What was typical about the teen-aged Bev and Suzanne? What was different? 4. Use your imagination to describe the kinds of encounters Bev and Suzanne might have had with other residents of the Ansonia when their mother was at work. 5. What was typical about Mrs. Ficker, the girls\u2019 mother? What was different?  Suzanne Farrell ",

            "answer_text": "This is a descriptive essay written by me, hope it\u2019s helpful. The sunset was not as pleasing as it usually is. The sun\u2019s vividly evident Cristine streaks that often pierce the blue canvas were snoring behind the heavy mists of the dark grey splash of the clouds. There are some days when the sun\u2019s fiery ray\u2019s stab us through. But not today. Our journey to the start of the trek in Igatpuri was no easy. The congestion on the road made each and every breath inhaled to be coughed out. Nevertheless, the journey being painful brought sights of amazement ahead. Soon, we reached the most longed starting point of our mission today, the Sahyadri ranges. High up the hilltop, the trees firmly gripped by the brown claws, swayed it\u2019s leaves and the rustling sound of the trees contributed to the chimes created by the synchronised chirping of the alluring birds. This synchronization outweighed the buzzing in the city and made my soul teleport to the world undiscovered. There were no busy infrastructure, densely crowded places, chunks of people but only me, nature and the dirty path that led ahead. As we followed this dirty path, the breeze kissed my cheek bone and swept through. Initially the nature did not accept my presence, as I followed the whining sound of the squirrels, theses minute creatures trotted their way up the dense trees. Soon, the presence of this charming little boy was welcomed by the nature and we together enjoyed the aura. The flora and fauna soon realized that all humans are not the same, having the same greedy and self-centred intentions. Soon after the rejuvenating water bath we approached the most beautiful sight of the journey. The view from the top of the mountain was spectacular. The view seems to be incredible, a sight that extend to endless miles. The view, blended numerous lakes reflecting the bright orange, yellow and ruby colours that brighten up the canvas above. I thoroughly lived the moment, I wish I could live there for ever, but not really. The miles that extend only portrayed the busy infrastructure, end number of people and the air rather than a tickle punched me in the face reminding me of the factories and industries that conquered our lives and living.
