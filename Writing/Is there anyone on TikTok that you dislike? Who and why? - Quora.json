For example this one:  But dentist Dr Linda Greenwall told The Sun that anyone considering teeth whitening should consult their dentist before trying anything themselves. She said: \u201cAs dentists, we are seeing an increasing number of patients desperate to whiten their already whitened teeth \u2013 a condition known as the Love Island effect. \u201cExcessive use of whitening products can lead to damaging the enamel, dentine, tooth structure and gum health. And also die the hair with something. For what? Will you look prettier because of that? You have to pay the price.  Is there anyone on TikTok whom I don\u2019t like? Charlie D\u2019Amelio\u2019s ex-boyfriend. I don\u2019t like him since he looks a little bit fake to me. I know nothing about him, but he looks gloomy and cunning. And his dancing is just so so. Why did he break up with Charlie? Please don\u2019t be mat at me. I just answer this question. I know nothing about them. Sorry, I can\u2019t answer this question. Thanks for reading.
