The only difference is that one is offered at a discounted price, while the other store charges a premium for it. So why should you pay a high price for the same tire you can get at a discount at Princess auto. When purchasing car parts, it\u2019s important to go to a reliable and recognized store known for selling quality car parts. If you are looking for a good quality tire at an affordable rate, Princess auto is where you should go. ",
