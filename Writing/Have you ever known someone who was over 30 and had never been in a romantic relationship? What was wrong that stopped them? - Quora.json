            "answer_text": "I have . Uhm this person had only had one relationship in life at the time and it wasnt something I would even consider a real relationship in the sense that it was long distance, they only saw each other once a year and they never met each other\u2019s family/parents or visited each other\u2019s home. This went on for a couple years. I dont really understand how or why this person had never had a real relationship. All I can conclude from an outside perspective is that I would not really consider the person a \u201ccatch\u201d . This person is not favored in the looks or physique dept, has a dead end job, still lives at home, not very sharp, not very social or driven, and is very immature for his age. So I would not expect anyone to be rushing to be the other half. Also rather religious so I guess somewhat harder to find a partner if you arent putting yourself in situations where you can socialize and meet other people . ",

There\u2019s nothing wrong. I just don\u2019t care. I have my friends, I have shit to do, I get annoyed when I don\u2019t have my own space. Why drag myself through the tedious process of dating, losing time and wasting energy that could be better spent on other things, just because society tells us that there\u2019s something \u201cwrong\u201d with us if we\u2019re single?
