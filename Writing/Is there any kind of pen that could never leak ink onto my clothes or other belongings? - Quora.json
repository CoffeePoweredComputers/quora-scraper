            "answer_text": "At the risk of seeming flippant (and drawing a BNBR warning) I will answer that the only leakproof pen is a dry one containing no ink. Ink is a medium that is formulated for the specific purpose of marking things. It is in the form of a fluid (yes, even ballpoint ink) and there is no completely and reliably leakproof method of containing a fluid. (Fluid wants to be free.) This is especially true of pens, which must be open to the air in order to function. The openings can be covered when the pen is not in use, but no removable temporary coverings or seals are completely foolproof. Keeping a pen from leaking is also challenging because the device is small and designed to be portable. Most (not all, but the majority) of ink pens are intended to be carried on the person, and that presents additional issues. There is absolutely no way to make a writing pen leak leakproof so that it can be forgotten and left in a shirt or pants pocket and sent through the laundry and not have it impart an abundance of stains on everything it comes in contact with. There is no guaranteed way to keep a pen from leaking when it is being carried in a hip pocket while the wearer goes kayaking or whitewater rafting. There is no way to reliably prevent leaks from a pen that has been casually tossed into the bottom of a knapsack or shoulder bag or tote bag that is subsequently loaded with 20 lbs. of textbooks, then lugged from class to class for a day or three and carelessly dropped onto the floor next to a desk at each stop. Pens cannot hold up and keep their inks contained without leaking when they undergo such careless handling. Some types of pens can take more of such abuse than others, but they will all leak eventually if they are subjected to enough physical and environmental stress. So the best way to minimize such problems is to treat your pens like the fragile leaky devices that they are. Put your pens in a protected cushioned pouch or pocket inside your bag or briefcase when you aren\u2019t going to be using them right away, and orient it so that they are vertical with respect to gravity, with the capped writing tips pointing up if at all possible. A padded vertical pocket, common on most models of backpack and similar bags, will work fine. It is OK in most cases (except for fountain pens) to carry a pen in a hip pocket for part of the day, as long as it will not be subjected to stress as you move around or sit down. It is better to carry it in a vertical pocket in a jacket, but that isn\u2019t always something that you will be wearing. A shirt pocket, even one on a t-shirt, will work, as will an outside cargo pocket. The most important thing is to remember that it is there, and to faithfully remove it and place it somewhere convenient and stable (like in a cup on top of your desk, for instance) when you aren\u2019t going to be using it anymore that day. And by all means do always check every pocket of every piece of clothing before you throw it into the laundry. Fountain pens, for the six or eight people (besides me) out there who still use them, require a bit more care in handling and transporting. Most fountain pen users already know this, but they should be carried vertically with the point upward whenever possible. As I stated previously, this is a good idea for any pen, but it is especially important for fountain pens. No, they won\u2019t immediately leak if they are tipped over; they have better seals than that. But the ink is very liquid and very runny and the pen does have a worryingly \u201clarge\u201d opening at the nib end. (It may not look very large at all, but it is big enough to allow big drops of the liquid ink to come out if the pen is subjected to vigorous shaking or jostling.) Carrying fountain pens in a cushioned pen pouch or wrap is the most preferable way. Most vendors of such pens also carry suitable pouches, which aren\u2019t large or bulky. ",

            "answer_text": "No, I am surprised at how ink seems to find a way everywhere. Fountain pens are exceptionally good at it. Most of the issue is being disciplined. I will often take a tray of ink bottles and pens into the bathroom for doing things rather than getting a mess started at my desk. Make a good habit of tightening ink bottle tops and pen caps. Think ink friendly. I use dip pens. It is a very good discipline because there is always an open ink bottle so I need to be very attentive. Never rush. Inkspots are a natural speeding ticket that gets given out without mercy when you go too fast. ",
