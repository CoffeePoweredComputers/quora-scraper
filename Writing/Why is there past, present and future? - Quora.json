            "answer_text": "Time \u2026 is what keeps everything from happening at once. \u2014 Ray Cummings Scientifically, although the job of science is to how, not why, Albert Einstein famously wrote: \u2026 the distinction between the past, the present and the future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.Time is an ordered series of slices in what is termed the block universe (aka eternalism or the static theory of time) \u2014 and consciousness determines past, present, and future. Some research indicates that Time is an emergent property \u2014 missing at the quantum level but emergent at the greater level. Many scientists think that the level at which Time emerges is tied to human consciousness. Psychologically, the past and future are our psychological impressions of what is termed \u201cthe arrow of time\u201d that arises from the causality of our timestream. The present (Now) is our psychological assessment of a temporal moment. Poetically, the past and future are a parts of the vast chain of Nows \u2014 each one of which is a portal by which God purviews the world. Each moment is an eternal glimpse of temporal manifestation \u2014 provided by us for the benefit of God \u2014 and reciprocally, our glimpse of eternity. As Walt Whitman wrote: I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then, in the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass\u2026",

            "answer_text": "Great question. This dimension is one of many that the Creator has developed.This is the 3d universe. One aspect of that is time which exists in three partsas you have said. There are other universes where time does not exist.But the question is- why does time exist at all? I think that it exists so that wecan study cause and effect closely. You set something in motion, then what happens in the present and then how does that affect the future?It is a perfect experimental set up for that study. There is also literatureavailable to refer to when doing experiments. In the Western world the tencommandments are well known. They give some guidelines from cause and effect experiments previously done. The religious text of the world are full ofhelpful guidelines and many times very similar results were obtained. Again-great question. ",
