            "answer_text": "There are many benefits to reading tabloid newspapers, and I enjoy them as part of an overall media diet that includes more traditional outlets like The New York Times and BBC - Homepage. First of all, tabloids like The Daily Mail, The Sun in Britain, BT and Ekstrabladet in Denmark, or The New York Post and the National Enquirer reflect the gut feelings of a large portion of the populace, whether it is bloodlust or resistance to mass immigration. Highbrow readers who shut themselves off from this type of information are then surprised by populist-driven events like Brexit or the election of Donald Trump. (The Daily Mail was almost alone in predicting the former; The National Enquirer predicted the latter, in part because its owner is a longtime friend of Trump.) Secondly, tabloids are often ahead of established media on important stories, in part because they\u2019re willing to publish with less secure sourcing. This also means they\u2019re less credible, of course: sometimes single sourcing or slopping sourcing means tabloids get things wrong. But often they are right. Finally, the language in tabloids is simple and accessible. For a new language learner or immigrant, tabloids are an easy way to learn about their new culture and political system, as well as learn the kind of local slang they\u2019re unlikely to pick up in formal language classes. I\u2019ve done this myself after landing in a couple of new countries. Tabloids have survived in one form or another since the invention of print, and I would suggest that popular sites like BuzzFeed and Mailonline are just the latest iteration. ",
