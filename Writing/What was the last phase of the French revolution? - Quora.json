Some may be surprised by this answer. Many people believe that Napoleon ended the French Revolution when he took power in a military coup at the end of 1799. I do not hold this view. I believe that Napoleon\u2019s reign was a continuation of the revolution. As a young officer, Napolean supported the French Revolution and the ideals it espoused. But, being a soldier, he also hated disorder, lawlesness and anarchy. He took power to end what he saw as the political anarchy which had taken over France by 1799. In this he was not wrong. While French armies had been winning on all fronts, internally, the political situation by 1799 was one of disorder and widespread corruption. If that situation was allowed to continue, Napoleon (and many others) feared that inspite of military successes, the revolution and what it had achieved would be lost when the country collapsed due to anarchy. This could give a chance of the Ancient regime to come back to power and undo the results of the revolution. As First Consul and later as Emperor, Napoleon stopped the excesses and the more radical elements of the revolution, but codified many of its achievements into a legal texts, the Code Napoleon which to this day forms the basis of the legal system in France. When, after the first abdication in 1814, the Bourbon king returned to power, his regime was detested by many in France. When Napoleon landed on his return from Elba, he was welcomed as a liberator by many French, who believed in the ideals of the French Revolution. ",
