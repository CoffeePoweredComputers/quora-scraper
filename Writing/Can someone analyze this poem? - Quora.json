            "answer_text": "Pay attention to punctuation (if there is any). Parse each sentence (not line) so that you understand its syntax. Obviously this will not work with a poem that has no logical syntax, but most do. And I would not start you off with a poem that has no logical syntax. That's how you turn students off poetry. I want to turn students on to poetry! Once you understand the poem grammatically, you know \"what's happening\" \u2014 the action. Next comes attention to the language. Pay attention to diction (word choice). What are the connotations of the words the poet uses? When you notice a pattern in the diction, the poet's tone (attitude toward the subject) will become evident. This is also where you'll notice metaphors. How does each metaphor contribute to the poet's message? Can you choose what poems you will analyze? If so, choose a poem that makes sense to you on the surface. That way, you will not start out with a feeling of helplessness. If you would like suggestions of poets that are accessible, let me know and I'll make you a list. Otherwise, post a poem you are having difficulty with (not your homework assignment) and point out what your difficulties are. ",
