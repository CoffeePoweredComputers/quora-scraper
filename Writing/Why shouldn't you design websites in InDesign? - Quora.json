            "answer_text": "The question did say \"design websites\" not \"code websites\", right? So why \"design\" in InDesign? It' s a layout and document structuring program not a print program. It supports web projects with RGB mode and pixel units (in the same way Photoshop and Illustrator support CMYK and inches). It has pages. Pages have a relationship to each other. Pages have masters. Masters can be built on masters. Pages can have different sizes. It has paragraph styles. Character styles. Object styles. Nested styles. (All these make for very DRY design files.) Dynamic styling powered by regular expressions (way friggin' cool). You can search and replace styles by name or attribute. Objects can be placed inside other objects. Objects can be placed inline with text. Objects inline with text can have text styles applied to them. It has cross references so that a text edit on one page is changed on another. It has text variables for things like dates, time, file names, and images names. You can set up preflighting to check for font size, stroke widths, image resolution, image scaling, disproportional images, missing images, style overrides, and more. It can collect assets. It has robust file linking features like showing effective ppi, linked file paths, and metadata info. Linked layered files can have layers turned on and off in different instances. It has advanced effects control. Effects can be applied individually to strokes, fills, or text on the same object. It has page columns, text columns, baseline grids, and awesome text reflow between objects. It has hyperlinks. Hyperlinks can be reused. Hyperlinks can be launched from the app. It has built in static and dynamic image captioning. Images can be auto-scaled when object containers scale. It has data merge for pulling in content from a spreadsheet. You can track copy changes. It has conditional text so you can have different copy on a single page and toggle different states. But\u2026 It doesn't slice. So you can't make websites that are giant tiled images. And it doesn't export HTML (it actually does). But what dev wants HTML exported out of a design program? And it has limited image export features. But you bring pictures into InDesign not send them out. Use Photoshop for image optimization. We don't fault HTML for not knowing how to move things across the page. Why? Because it's markup not Javascript. Use Photoshop for compositing images. Use Illustrator for creating vector artwork. Use InDesign for building layouts. And use a text editor to code your project. When it comes to using the right tools for layout, using Photoshop is definitely the wrong tool. And Illustrator is a weak one. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no reason not to design in Indesign. The people that say you shouldn\u2019t are ignorant of InDesigns capabilities. I\u2019ve been doing web development for 7 years and graphic design for 10 years. I\u2019ve made over 100 websites. It\u2019s actually far faster to create a design from a properly exported indesign file. If the designer provides the PDF of the design and exports all the assets into a folder, all the designer has to do is upload those assets to the site and then write the code. There is no chopping up PSD files. It saves a ton of time you set up a proper work flow. If you need to sample color codes just open the PDF in photoshop, and text should be in a separate file anyway. In that indesign requires linked assets just like a website it actually more closely mirrors how a web site is made. Additionally it\u2019s much faster to do page layout in a page layout program, so the designer saves time as well. ",
