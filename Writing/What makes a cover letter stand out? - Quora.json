            "answer_text": "5 Secrets to Making Your Cover Letter Stand Out As a career coach, I can tell you that there are plenty of things that make cover letters stand out in a bad way. But how do you move past mediocre and get it to catch the employer's eye in a good way?  That\u2019s the burning question, when one sheet of paper stands in the way of your potential employer seeing your masterpiece of a resume. You\u2019ve worked hard on editing and polishing it, after all, and even harder on earning the experience and accolades it boasts. So, to avoid your resume landing in the circular file and to achieve your goal of getting an interview, follow these five guidelines\u2014and the easiest-to-remember acronym ever: \u201cC-O-V-E-R.\u201d C Call out leadership positions, relevant awards, and advanced skill sets right at the beginning. This is the easiest way to catch someone\u2019s eye as soon as he or she starts reading. \u201cI am writing because I am interested in the Communications Manager position\u201d doesn't say a lot, but \u201cI believe that my experience securing international media coverage for high-profile tech clients make me the perfect match for the Communications Manager position\u201d does. Not sure which facets of your experience to include? Start with the points listed specifically in the job description. By proving you meet an employer\u2019s top requirements, you\u2019ll keep her attention to read on. O Offer stats to illustrate your impact on companies or associations you\u2019ve worked for in the past. Employers love to see numbers\u2014it shows them that you speak their language and that you understand what they\u2019re looking for in an employee: results. Show them that you\u2019ve made your mark in your past positions and didn\u2019t just follow your predecessor\u2019s checklist, whether it was at an internship, your last job, a college club, or a team-building event you organized to boost company morale. Earned your division more money than the person before you? Share that monetary difference. Reeled in more vendors than your peers did to participate in a fundraiser? Show that outstanding work with something no one can argue with\u2014math. V Verify the appropriate contact name to use in the greeting of the cover letter (you would be shocked at how many people don\u2019t do this). If you can\u2019t find it online, do some digging. Call the company and ask who the HR representative or the hiring manager is for the position. You should never have a general greeting like \u201cTo whom it may concern\u201d or \u201cDear [Insert Company Name].\u201d You want it to be as personalized as possible so that the employer sees that you\u2019re resourceful and that you\u2019re OK with doing your homework. E Exemplify your strengths. Avoid, at all costs, describing yourself as a \u201cteam player\u201d or a \u201cpeople-person.\u201d It\u2019s like a graphic designer using the font Comic Sans\u2014it\u2019s overused, oversimplified, and it underplays your unique attributes. Instead, show off your skills with descriptive statements like \u201cI\u2019m an expert communicator with experience bringing together diverse departments to develop a cohesive program.\u201d It\u2019s longer\u2014but it\u2019s also stronger. Then follow that point with an instance in which you displayed this skill, saying something like, \u201cFor example, when tasked with leading a marketing campaign for the rebranding of my company, I coordinated meetings with all divisions of the marketing department to ensure the promotion\u2019s consistency in all channels of communication, including business-to-business messaging and media materials.\u201d Remember, too, that your cover letter itself should serve as an example of your skills. Meaning, if you\u2019re an aspiring journalist, you\u2019d better check that you used AP style correctly throughout your cover letter. If you\u2019re applying for a graphic design position, then your cover letter should be a visual masterpiece. R Refrain from regurgitating all of the same information already detailed in your resume. Your cover letter should complement your resume, in that it delves into the high points and provides a fuller picture of who you are after the employer reads both. In addition, while your resume language is pretty cut-and-dry, your cover letter should have a personal touch\u2014almost like you\u2019d write a letter to a friend or family member\u2014expressing a tone and using language that is true to you. Also be sure to make your letter precise and punchy. You never, never need to go over one page\u2014the goal here is to draw someone in and showcase your qualifications using as few words as possible. Now, you\u2019ve got a checklist that\u2019s easy to remember and that ensures your cover letter will showcase why you\u2019re right for the job. So, your final checkpoint to get your cover letter ready to go? Make sure the one thing you\u2019d want to say to your dream employer\u2014before the elevator door closes on your conversation\u2014is in your letter. Then, my friend, you\u2019ve done it. ",

            "answer_text": "Many resume writers make bizarre claims about the idea that you can somehow get a job because of what you write on your resume, not what the resume reflects. As a professional resume writer, I can know some things that work. With your cover letter, you don\u2019t necessarily want to stand out, but there are some things you can try. Mostly though, you want your resume to quickly summarise your experience and qualifications as match to the job. It is basically the sale. Every sentence on the cover letter is a sales pitch. The way to imagine this is it is the same in an interview. If you go to a job interview and they ask you \u201cHow are you?\u201d don\u2019t say \u201cFine.\u201d say \u201cGreat, this is a great opportunity for me.\u201d or \u201cNervous, because I am really interested in this job.\u201d Don\u2019t over do it on your cover letter though. Usually the first sentence says things like that you are applying for such and such job. The second makes the claim that you can do the job. I am careful in my language. I write, I am suited, I am well suited, I am perfect match the requirements for the job, based on experience. Then in the same sentence I write why. Because I a degree in X, certificates in A and B and I have 5 years experience doing R and 2 of those in this field. After that I will explain this in more details in the following paragraphs and also address any specific criteria. How to stand out Sometimes you can do something differently on your resume and cover letter. I haven\u2019t seen anything that has really worked for me and usually the thing that stands out often is a flag that they person is not professional. Some things include cover letters, images of work done (your portfolio). Think about this, you are applying for a job as a mechanic and you have a hobby restoring old cars. So you send in several pages of photos of the cars you have worked on with your resume. It will make you stand out. But if you are going for a job working with children, make your resume super colourful with pictures that kids like. Maybe they will like this, maybe they won\u2019t, but if they don\u2019t like your colourful resume, you probably don\u2019t want to work for them. ",

            "answer_text": "Just like resumes, not all cover letters are created equal. There are those that thoroughly impress a hiring manager and those that get tossed to the side with the rest. No candidate wants their application to fall in the latter pile, but unfortunately, cover letters are just as vulnerable to the black hole as resumes are if they aren\u2019t engaging and well-written. First and foremost, there are a certain number of things every cover letter needs to address: What position you\u2019re applying forWhat skills, experience, and competencies you have to offerWhy you\u2019d be a great fit for that particular position and the company in general, to demonstrate that you\u2019ve done research on the companyA thank-you for the employer\u2019s time and considerationIn addition, be sure to include your name and contact information in the header; however, your contact information is the only part of your cover letter that should replicate your resume. It\u2019s perfectly okay (and encouraged) to expand upon something listed on your resume, such as certain skills and experience, but don\u2019t use up your valuable cover letter space to simply re-state what your resume already says. A cover letter should be kept to one page, so utilize that space wisely to include what may not fit on your limited CV. For example, if the position you\u2019re applying for requires experience with Excel\u2019s Pivot Tables function and you happen to have that, you\u2019d likely list \u201cAdvanced Excel skills, including proficiency with Pivot Tables\u201d in your resume\u2019s \u201cSkills\u201d section. So, when writing your cover letter, why repeat yourself when you can expand upon it? Try writing something like \u201cDuring my time with company X, I worked on a number of projects in Excel that required heavy usage of Pivot Tables.\u201d Going on to briefly explain one of those projects would be a great way to link up different items on your resume, show credibility, and show that you truly know how to utilize that tool; unfortunately, some do lie on their resumes to get interviews, and employers are on their guard for that. If you\u2019re having a hard time figuring out what to write, try asking yourself these questions: What does the employer need from the person in this position?How do I fulfill the employer\u2019s needs?How would I fit into this company\u2019s culture?What past work or academic experiences best prepared me for this role?What do I offer differently from anyone else applying for this position?Finally, make sure your writing style is appropriate for your industry. Are you a creative professional? Then feel free to take a more creative approach and tone. Are you in financial services? It may be best to stick with formal, professional writing. Approaching your writing with the most appropriate tone and angle will show you know your industry well. ",

            "answer_text": "The cover letter is one of the most important documents in your job application. It is a one-page document that you send to recruiters, giving them an introduction of yourself, and explaining why you\u2019re interested in the job. It should also tell the recruiter why you think you\u2019d be a good fit for the company. Think of it as a one-page advertisement of yourself that you get to show your recruiter. You need to make it count. Cover letters don\u2019t need to be flashy and extravagant, contrary to popular belief. There are a few SIMPLE key elements a good cover letter should have, that will greatly increase your chances of getting hired. We\u2019ll talk briefly about each. Introducing yourself If you don\u2019t tell the recruiter who you are, your chances of catching their interest are low. I mean, put yourselves in the shoes of a recruiter. Imagine receiving an application that doesn\u2019t even have a name or self-introduction. It only contains a few scribbles about his or her education and job experience. Would you be interested in hiring this mystery person you know absolutely nothing about? Probably not, right? Elaborate on your experiences Yes, the resume already contains an overview of your past experience and educational background, but that is all it is. An overview. In your cover letter, you can expand on these points, giving more details on your performance at the previous job you had, or the extracurricular activities you took up in school. Don\u2019t just list out experiences again \u2013 pick one or two memorable ones and talk about them in detail. Explain why you are suitable for the job Don\u2019t just go on and on about yourself. Talk about the company, and why it would be better off if you were to become a member of its staff. Make it all about them, and what you could potentially do for them. Draw the relevant links between your experience and skills, and what the company needs. This is what the recruiter is interested in. They only want to know who you are and what you can do in relation to the company itself.

            "answer_text": "You are well served here with a robust array of answers. May I respectfully add some other thoughts for your consideration: Do all possible to make sure your target employer WANTS to see a cover letter or e-letter. Fortune Magazine in late 2014 pronounced the \u201ccover letter\u201d dead on arrival at most major employers. Cover letters cannot be scanned by resume scanning software. Who sends resumes in the mail any more?Since the 1920s cover letters or equivalent have been composed by jobseekers who failed to get professional assistance. As a result cover letters gained a terrible reputation to this day.Larger, name brand firms do not pay people to read glittering generalities contained in most cover letters. Medium sized firms may tolerate cover letters for a few seconds, and then toss them. Entrepreneurs, start-ups, and small firms are more interested in seeing you and talking with you than reading pieces of paper about you.The truth is that no matter how \u201cbrilliant\u201d your cover letter and resume might be, there\u2019s a big problem, face time. If it is true that the average time spent with your resume, first time through, forget cover letter, is 6.5 seconds, what are the chances that \u201cbrilliance\u201d will ensure you will get a call back?FastCompany Magazine some years ago, still valid today, wrote and published, \u201cPursuing a career is NOT about finding a job. It\u2019s all about building a network.\u201d Most working and employable candidates claim they have four or five non-family members in their \u201cnetwork\u201d. Not true. It\u2019s more like an anemic 25. If you have 25, you need 50. If you have 50, you need 100.What you do not see in the credible answers here, is the importance of learning how professional recruiters network their hind ends off to cause employers to pay them to find THE candidate they are looking for. For starters, if you are willing to job search like you mean it, pull an all nighter and read Skip Freeman\u2019s book Headhunter Hiring Secrets, the original version, available Used-In Good Condition for peanuts from your favorite online bookseller, plus $3.99 shipping via Media Mail.As profane artist/writer, Hugh McLeod says, \u201cIf you want to stand out in the crowd (appear brilliant), avoid the crowd.\u201d That means avoid the hundreds of job boards being aggregated as we speak by a firm that promises their employer clients, \u201cNo e-mails. No Documents to Print, No phone Calls, No attachments (meaning no cover letters). None of that\u201d. As the spokesperson on the radio ads says, \u201cHiring is the worst part of my job.\u201d Imagine being considered by that person.Finally, don\u2019t go it alone, especially if this is your first serious job search or you are over 50 and haven\u2019t looked for a job in a long time. It\u2019s vicious out there. The competition for employers\u2019 scarce attention, is brutal.

Make sure you use a correct form of greeting In this time and age, there\u2019s no excuse for using \u201cTo Whom It May Concern.\u201d You\u2019re expected to research the name of the recruiter or the hiring manager online. LinkedIn is the perfect tool for this. Even when you are totally unable to find the recruiter\u2019s name, it\u2019s better to use other forms: 3. Introduce yourself with a BANG! Open strong.

Most people begin with \u201cI\u2019m applying for the position X I saw in Y place.\u201d That\u2019s a waste of text.

Why the company is a great fit for you. In this paragraph you want to show that you\u2019re serious about developing your career at this new company. Good companies want to know why do they appeal to you and how will your professional relationship be mutually beneficial. Consider the following questions: . 6. Finish strong and stay in touch You want to finish in a way that will make them remember you. In one or two sentences reiterate that your experience and enthusiasm make you a great candidate. This is to emphasise the two main points from the previous paragraphs. 7. How do you send a cover letter? I can\u2019t stress this enough \u2014 don\u2019t send your cover letter as a document attached to your email. Put it inside the body of the email. The email is your cover letter!

            "answer_text": "There are some key points which helps you to makes a professional cover letter stand out: 1. Address your cover letter to a specific person: find the exact name of the person who\u2019s going to be reading your letter. This will make your cover letter more personalized, and they\u2019ll appreciate that you took the steps to learn about who you\u2019re writing to. 2. Keep it simple and concise: it can be a challenge to describe how awesome you are within one page, but try not to go overboard. Cover letters should be a page or less, and the longer your cover letter is, the more you risk losing the employer\u2019s attention. If your cover letter is too lengthy, cut out unnecessary information and just leave in only the most important information. 3. Make sure to leave plenty of white space If your cover letter is overcrowded with information \u2014 this makes you appear to be sloppy and unprofessional. Include spaces between your greetings, the body of your letter, and your signature, and make sure to have appropriate margins. A cover letter that\u2019s tidy and concise is much easier to read than one that\u2019s overloaded with unnecessary details. The hiring manager will thank you for not wasting their time. ",

            "answer_text": "Cover letters used to be standard operating procedure for a job search, but they\u2019re rarely even read today. I\u2019ve read many thousands of resumes over my career as a recruiter, and the only cover letters I remember are the really weird or funny ones (and not funny on purpose). Those, along with the really funny resumes, went into a special file that we would break out once in a while and share over beers on Friday afternoons. One poor fellow from China once tried to say something like, \u201cI hope to hear from you soon\u201d, but the translation, probably from Mandarin, came out in English as, \u201cI am raising my ears in anticipation of your echo\u201d. The mental image of some poor little rabbit, standing on the edge of a canyon, still cracks me up today. Bear in mind that unless you are a candidate for the C-Suite, your resume is typically going to be put through a keyword-matching software program that makes the initial determination as to your qualifications. Your cover letter won\u2019t even make it that far in the process. That cover letter might get read at some point just before they contact you for an interview, but it should only reiterate that you are interested in a certain job, and when you might be available. The \u201cfluffy stuff\u201d \u2014 like how much you respect the company and how many of their products you\u2019v purchased \u2014 is probably going to be seen as b.s. and could do more harm than good. Don\u2019t be a \u201cfluffer\u201d. On the other hand, I once worked for a French company where handwritten cover letters were mandatory. They were sent to a \u201chandwriting expert\u201d to be analyzed for hidden personality traits that were said to be indicative of a candidate\u2019s intelligence, honesty, work ethic, motivation, etc. I understand that this practice had spawned an entire cottage industry of people with beautiful cursive writing skills who did nothing but hand-write cover letters for applicants \u2014 for a fee.
