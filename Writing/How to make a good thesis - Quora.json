            "answer_text": "It is important that you have your own meaning of happiness \u2013 unless of course you are after a purely academic thesis that you postulate and defend to obtain an academic degree. Personally, I do not like theses that do not have basis in reality, especially the author\u2019s reality. Having your own idea and position on happiness means you are able impartially, insightfully, and convincingly on the basis of research evidence defend your findings and conclusion on the research topic. For example, it means you can use independent and original thought to critique not just this particular \u2018Happy Man\u2019 but similarly or other \u2018happy men\u2019 in real-life settings. Secondly, you have to accurately pinpoint what exactly it is that makes this particular man \u2018the happy man\u2019. In other words, the reason/s that he is \u2018the happy man\u2019 and not any other man.Thirdly, the next natural step is to begin to use your personal and cultural value-base, meaning of happiness, your experience and readings about \u2018happy men\u2019, and what makes people truly happy to analyse and establish whether or not he is truly the happy man; whether the reason is unique to him; common to men in his situation; or to men in general; opportunistic or genuine.Fourthly, using the premises above as well as the evidences in the book, you begin to make a rational and analytical judgement or conclusion as to whether or not the man is indeed \u2018the happy man\u2019. However, whatever judgement or conclusion you draw is based on your own theory or hypothesis of what it means to be \u2018the happy man\u2019. Fifthly, thus in order to confirm OBJECTIVELY whether or not your underlying premise or theory that supports your temporary and anecdotal suspicion or hunch on (1) this particular man being or not being the happy man (2) whether his reasons for being the happy man support or does not support that claim, you go on to find and establish a reliable evidence or proof that goes either way. Sixthly, so, you design a neutral research question that seeks to settle once and for all (validate or invalidate) whether or not this man is, on the basis of sufficient, concrete, incontrovertible, and replicable evidence whether or not this man is indeed \u2018the happy man\u2019. An example of a neutral question in this context could be: \u2018Is Happiness a Function of Material or Spiritual wealth?\u2019. The question is not leading or suggestive of a position you have taken or are asking anyone to take. So that you are not doing the research to confirm your opinion and position or thesis on the topic. On the contrary, you are genuinely seeking to CREATE NEW KNOWLEDGE about the topic for yourself, academia, and general public. In other words, the fact that you have your own idea, meaning, and position on the topic MUST NOT interfere with the thesis\u2019s process and outcome. Rather, they are proofs that you know what you are doing, as you can\u2019t possibly successfully research a topic about which you do not have any or sufficient knowledge.Seventhly, source relevant materials that are for, against, and neutral to the research topic. This is not because the feedback you would get from respondents would fall into these three catgories.Eightly, design a method (system or order) that you are going to use to collate, analyse, and categorise your feedback.Ninthly, use the sourced materials to analyse and support your research findings and final conclusion or YOUR THESIS. Tenthly, present your thesis in a dissertation that you write in accordance with your University\u2019s approved style or format. Good luck. ",
