            "answer_text": "That depends entirely on your book. If an important part of the story involves the characters meeting and getting to know each other, then you want them to meet, but if the story is more focused on action and the like, then you may want them to already know each other. If characters get to know each other a little too quickly, it comes off as unrealistic, so if you don\u2019t want to explore that aspect of character development, you\u2019d be best off having them already know each other. That being said, you can totally have your characters get to know each other while other really important stuff is happening, making it a subplot, but that will make your book considerably longer and more complicated. Thanks for the A2A, First Last! ",

            "answer_text": "Cindy, drama arises from conflict, and conflict arises from change. You want to start in the midst of some change, such as two people meeting each other for the first time. In classic dramatic style, rising action ensues in the form of complications. Then, near the midway point of the story, our protagonist makes an important decision which sets in motion everything else that follows. \u201cFalling action\u201d of consequences arising from the climactic decision lead to a final denouement, or ultimate outcome. If the outcome is bad - like death and destruction - this is the tragic form. If the outcome is good - like a marriage or a new career - this is the classic form of comedy. ",
