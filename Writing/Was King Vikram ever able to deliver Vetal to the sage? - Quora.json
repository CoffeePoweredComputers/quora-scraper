            "answer_text": "Yes. The Betala does not narrate 25 stories, he narrates 24. The 25th story is the framing device - the story of how a sage visits King Vikramaditya and gifts him magical fruits in order to seek a favour. This favour is the mission to fetch the Betala. After 24 attempts, the Betala falls silent and allows Vikram to carry him to the sage's yagnashala. Once he reaches the yagnashala, Vikram realizes the reason for Betala's extreme reluctance - the sage is a tantrik, who seeks the Betala's power of possessing other bodies. The ritual requires a human sacrifice, which would be whoever brought the Betala to the tantrik. Vikram realizes this when the tantrik asks him to prostrate before the fire. But Vikram is cleverer; he asks the tantrik to show him how to prostrate himself, and when he does, Vikram beheads him. Following this, Vikram receives the Betala's power to leave his own body and possess another. Some versions of the story mention the presence of Vikram's minister, who also receives the same power.
