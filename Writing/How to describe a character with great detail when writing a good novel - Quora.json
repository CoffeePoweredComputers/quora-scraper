            "answer_text": "Readers like to immerse themselves into stories. When you leave the character\u2019s looks a bit vague, then that\u2019s easy for readers to slip into that role. When you write that the hero is 7-feet-tall with bright red hair, and has two different color eyes\u2026 then the reader can\u2019t get the fun of becoming your character. Remember readers don\u2019t fall in love with your character\u2019s appearance. They fall in love with their words, their thoughts, their hearts, and their souls. It is very important that the reader falls in love with your hero/heroine. A reader must worry and care what happens to them. Without that, your story will be flat. All good books are character driven. You can have the best, most wonderful story in the world, but if the reader doesn't care if your hero dies or not, they won't read the book. The hero drives the story. (And I use the word hero, but it could be a man or a woman.) He has to have a visible goal, which is his outer motivation for what he does, and an inner goal, which is something in his past that is holding him back. The inner turmoil could be a longing or need, a deeply held desire that he is afraid to go after; or an old wound from the past that your hero suppressed but is still affecting his life; or a strong belief such as \u2018if I love I will be hurt\u2019; or a fear of experiencing the pain he has felt before. You must have him conquer this inner torment by the end. The hero has to grow in order for you to reach a satisfying ending to your outer story. Let's say our hero was hired to blow up a building. In this version we don't know anything about him, his background, why he even took this type of job. We don't like him very much. If he sets the bomb and completes the job, that's not a very interesting read. But what if he falls in love with the lady who works in the coffee shop on the first floor, and finds out there's a day care center on the 10th floor with 42 little kids in it? Now, he's conflicted. He saw kids being hurt in the war and he wants no part of this. He tries to back out, but the bad guys are pushing him to complete the job or else they're going to hurt his own daughter. Now we have a good story going -- and the reader's attention. There are five ways to initially draw your reader to the hero. Chose two to work with and be sure to include them in the first few pages of your book. Hook the reader right away. 1) Create sympathy, make him the victim of something or some undeserved misfortune. 2) Put him in jeopardy, make us worry about him. 3) Make him likable or liked by others. 4) Make him funny. 5) Make him powerful in some good way. In order to create a memorable character you, as the writer, must know him inside and out. Know what makes him tick, what makes him mad, what makes him act out. Then you will know how he will react when you put him in danger, or threaten to ruin his business, or have his lovers leave him. Create a background story for him. There are lots of character check lists you can find on the Internet, but don't spend too much time on it. His favorite color is probably not all that important to the story. Focus on the items on the list that carved out his personality and/or made him the man he is today. Think out your characters. Did they have a crappy childhood? Were they rich? Poor? Mom was a drunk? Dad was in jail? Did they have a privileged life? Were they in the military and saw despicable behavior? Did they take part in it? All these things will shape who they are and how they deal with the situations you're going to put them into, and how they will react to others, especially the love interest. Make them interesting and not clich\u00e9d. They can be tough but remember we have to like them, so don't make them too cold. Give them a soft side. A hero always does the right thing, even if his behavior is not always perfect. Make sure your character cares passionately about what is happening. Give him emotions. If he doesn't care, why should the reader? Also give him a flaw. Nobody is perfect and we hate reading about perfect people. We want to relate to the character; we want to become them. And we want him to solve his problem. Just a quick note on naming your characters. Don't use a name so difficult the reader can\u2019t pronounce it. Don't have a John and a Jake and a Jerry. Too confusing. Use names that fit the personality and the time you are writing in. For example very few young girls are named Gertrude today but that was a popular name in the 20s.

            "answer_text": "You don't need a great amount of detail. The more attention you give to the character's appearance, the more it detracts from the story. Make it interesting. Don't just have a paragraph listing the character's features. And please don't make them describe themselves in a mirror. Ugh. My main character lives in a dystopian world. In this world, he doesn't even have any mirrors in his home. So he has to pluck a few hairs to remind himself that his hair is black (but doing this is strictly discouraged by the state). This intertwines the descriptions of the main character with the oppression he faces, as opposed to an \u201coh, by the way\u201d block of descriptive text that interrupts the story. And if you must describe your characters, only point out a few features. Your readers don't need to be able to visualize your characters down to every pimple and birthmark. ",
