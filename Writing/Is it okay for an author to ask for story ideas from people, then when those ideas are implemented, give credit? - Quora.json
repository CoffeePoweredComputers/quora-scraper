My treatise is several volumes and I include strategies, sample pleadings and such that originated with colleagues. I always give attribution, and always ask for written permission to include it in my work with attribution. To me, it is a matter of courtesy, personal integrity and respect for the generosity of other practitioners. In the realm of both fiction and non-fiction works, it is customary for authors to credit the contributions of others. I once read an author who thanked a person for teaching aword fighting techniques. I think authors generally have an understanding of the importance of others\u2019 contributions, including story ideas, characters and so on. In general, authors inderstand that writing is hard work and appreciate help, that all of us have teachers, mentors and contributors, and welcome the chance to say thank you. But always ask first. There can be reasons why a person would not want public acknowledgement, and it is not the author\u2019s business why. Ask and proceed accordingly. ",

The hard part is turning an idea into a compelling story with conflict and believable characters, that makes the reader want to find out what happens next. I don't know that it's unethical to ask for ideas. It's certainly morally correct to acknowledge assistance. I just don't know how helpful going to others as you've suggested woukd actually be. I know of writers who actively discourage this type of \u201chelp.\u201d ",

Is it okay for an author to ask for story ideas from people I think many authors get ideas from a variety of people. then when those ideas are implemented, give credit? I think you are asking: Should an author give credit to people whose ideas are used in the story? All I have to go by is the work of others. Many authors do. Look in the front or back of a book for either: author\u2019s notes, oracknowledgementsI have learned a great deal about the lives and work of authors by reading those notes and acknowledgements. Not every novel has such a section but I always look for it. ",
