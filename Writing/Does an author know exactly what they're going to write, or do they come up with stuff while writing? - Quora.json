            "answer_text": "There\u2019s two types of writers\u2026 Plotters (or planners), and pantsers. Plotters plan their plot as a timeline, with all its twists and turns, right through to the end before beginning to write the book itself. Others, like myself, write by the seat of their pants (hence \u2018pantsers\u2019). I usually have no more than a few ideas in my head, and two or three themes I want to explore, noted down. I then write a scene involving each subject - for example, in one book (http://lrd.to/disrespected) I wanted to include arranged marriage and honour crime, a hijack of a bus, illicit firearms sales, and identity theft/fraud. I wrote a scene involving each, then put them into some kind of order and filled in the gaps to get the ball rolling\u2026 cutting the scenes to show things that were happening at the same time but in different locations. As I wrote each separate thread, I let the characters lead me (I write series fiction, so by now I know my core characters well). I believe that if I have to keep turning pages to find out what\u2019s happening next, so will my readers. As the threads develop, I get an idea where it\u2019s going to lead and write an ending. I then begin to steer the plot towards that ending. Once I get to the ending I\u2019ve written, I write a twist in the tail, often a short final chapter, or even just on the last page, to surprise the reader again. This is my usual method of writing my novels. Of course, during the journey, sometimes another idea comes into my head\u2026 for example, I decided as a whim, to kill off a good guy character. This led to her partner hunting down the killer in a car chase, confusing the police even more because they still hadn\u2019t connected the different crimes. There\u2019s a FREE e-book available with two complete short prequels to my series. Go to http://lrd.to/this-is-lena and click on the link which will take you to the book\u2019s page on your local Amazon site. Both these short stories were written in the same \u2018pantser\u2019 manner. There are also links to the rest of my books. ",

Everyone else has an inclination, a variety of feelings and knowings that are forming, I think, that meld enroute, perhaps not as bold as a world tour but rivalling a coast to coast tour with intended/cannot miss stops. Enroute to each stop we are deterred by myriad distractions but kept from most by a copilot / navigator , schedule, itinerary or such. In writing we have our editor and publisher no doubt overseeing and a well thought out overview and mind set. But the assignment is largely, a well fleshed out and focused probability which needs to evolve according to writer\u2019s style, preference, prerogative and circumstance. Just as no writer or traveler proceeds without pit stops, no writer knows exactly what the writing content will be devoid of revisions, alterations, additions and deletions -which are all part of the writing process and novel\u2019s production melding in progress. Adding workable bits and essential ideas as they come to mind is what raises the writing often from good to excellent, and it empowers the author to trust their thoughts and judgment.-for who would or could ignore a good and fitting thought.

Her father was of a high bloodline. Her mother was his apprentice. She has silver and red hair. A staff with a blue crystal. Travels the land, righting wrongs according to her own personal code. She is well spoken, educated, diplomatic, but somewhat of a wild card. She rules a border province devastated by chaos magic centuries ago. Though she is an Elf, she feels a kinship more with the Wizards of the Magocracy, rather than the Elves that live in the Mountain passes. Write her story. Yesterday's plan: Detail a guild of local (mostly dwarven) thieves that have stolen the Gauntlet of Anvilfinger from the Warden of the Citadel of the Thane, throwing three families vying for power into chaos, thus destabilizing the frontier defenses in the local area. The guild has \"30?\u201d members. Among them are Dwarves whose clan name has been stripped. Others are brigands, road bandits seeking a haven, or pirates hiding out miles from the coastal towns. Write about the Guild, defenses.. what is the hideout like? Write how this all ties in with the Protagonist. ",

He or she might have an outline (i.e. a basic plot or thematic idea) and sketch things out, but a lot of the time it\u2019s common to wing it once you\u2019ve put pen to paper and edit afterward. This may or may not be true for other writers but in my experience, both as a writer, and speaking to other writers, it\u2019s fairly common. E.L. Doctrow had this to say about authoring a novel: It's like driving a car at night. You never see further than your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way. ",
