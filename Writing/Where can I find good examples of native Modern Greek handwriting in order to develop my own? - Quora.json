And the workbooks that go with the textbooks are full of great writing exercises. It goes over the basic, generic forms of the letters (with some variations) and shows you how to trace them. But it doesn\u2019t come close to covering ALL of the dizzying variety of cursive letters you\u2019re likely to encounter. It\u2019s good for beginners, but the handwriting examples they give are pretty artless and boring. I wish there were a better resource available; at least I wish I had had such a resource when I first started learning Greek. Maybe someone on Quora can suggest one.
