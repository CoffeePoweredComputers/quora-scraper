            "answer_text": "\u2018Is it \"1,5 months\" or \"1,5 month\"?\u2019 First of all, the character to use for the separator between the integer part and fractional part in a decimal format is to be either a comma on the line or a point on the line; which one to choose is to \u201cbe that which is customary in the language and context concerned\u201d (that is, country, language, and application). In all countries in which English is the dominant language, the usage in English is to be the point on the line, not the comma on the line, for all applications. In that sense, neither is correct. (And, no I am not at all against the decimal comma, but actually rather like it, and in most applications and locales in French, German, Italian, and Russian the decimal comma should be used.) [The quotation is from Brochure SI 9, Section 5.4.4.] Once we correct 1,5 to 1.5, the answer is based on whether you are using the timing in a noun sense or an adjective sense: Noun (months): We are setting up appointments with you every 1.5 months. Adjective (month): We are setting up appointments with you at 1.5 month intervals. This is true for all measurement quantities, except when the numeric quantity is greater than 0 and at most 1, in which case the singular (month) is used in both categories. ",

            "answer_text": "In English is if it\u2019s more than one, it\u2019s plural. If it\u2019s less than one but you pronounce the decimal point (i.e. \u201cpoint five\u201d) then it\u2019s plural. (As an aside, in some countries, a \u2018.\u2019 is used instead of a \u2018,\u2019) If it\u2019s less than one but you instead read out the fraction (i.e. \u201cone half\u201d), it\u2019s singular again. So \u201cOne point five months\u201d is correct. \u201cOne and a half months\u201d is also correct. However, if you were to say \u201cHalf of a month\u201d it would be singular, where as \u201cPoint five months\u201d would become plural again, even though it is less than one. ",
