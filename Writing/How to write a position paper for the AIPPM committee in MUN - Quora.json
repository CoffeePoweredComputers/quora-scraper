On the right, put up the residential or official address of the leader . 2. Date and the Agenda in hand :-  3. The text of your script : Tips For Writing A Good Position Paper: Keep it simple: To communicate strongly and effectively, avoid flowery wording and stick to uncomplicated language and sentence structure.Get organized: Give each separate idea or proposal its own paragraph. Make sure each paragraph starts with a topic sentence.Cite your sources: Use footnotes or endnotes to show where you found your facts and statistics. It is always important to state your sources. End your Position Paper with a Bibliography.Read and reread: Leave time to edit your position paper. Ask yourself if the organization of the paper makes sense and double-check your spelling and grammar.Speech! Speech!: Do you plan to make an opening statement at your conference? A good position paper makes a great introductory speech. During debate, a good position paper will also help you to stick to your country's policies. However your speech must be different and separate from your Position Paper. You may take points from your Position Paper, but do not make your speech the Position Paper, as the Executive Board will strongly notice this.Let the bullets fly: Try not to let your proposals become lost in a sea of information. Create a bulleted list of your proposals along with your most important facts and statistics so that you will not lose time looking for them during debate and so that the reader of your Position Paper can make them out easily.Begin with Important Points: Begin your points with the most impotant information. Do not beat around the bush. Just by reading the first line the reader should be able to understand the point. Elaborate later on in your paragraph or sentence about the point.Highlight: Highlight the beginning of your paragraphs and begin your paragraph with the most important points.Remember Each Director has 100\u2019s of Position Papers to read and judge.In context to the AIPPM committee , I would also attach one of the policy statements I had made. I, Shri Narendra Damodardas Modi , the hon'ble Prime Minister of India come into this All India Party Meet filled with optimism and with an intention to find solutions to the loopholes in the sedition laws of the country along with a view to amend the Section 377 of the Indian Penal code which would further strengthen the constitution of the country by expanding the scope of fundamental rights and freedom of expressions. I believe that through deep discussions and deliberations, all the political parties would be able to find a unanimous solution to the agenda which would protect and foster the integrity and unity of the country and at the same time, confine its definition in a way which would stop its misutilisation by the governments. I also sincerely hope that the political parties would agree to embrace the idea of protecting the rights of the individuals irrespective of who they are and who they love. The recent incidents in few parts of the country have brought into light the controversial sedition law which also triggered discussions and uproar not just in the Parliament but in many parts of the country. We condemn all those incidents and at the same time believe that they were unfortunate. We also concede that the drama and the aftermath following it were unavoidable in most cases. While many were of the view that archaic law has no place in the present-day government , there is a large section of people who continue to advocate that maximum measures should be taken for the protection of the country. After the 16th of May , 2014 , since I took oath as the Prime Minister of India , I have devoted a large share of my time in identifying archaic laws which are irrelevant to the present world and scrapping them. I am very pleased to announce that 1159 obsolete and redundant laws have been moved out of the statute book. Even though many British era laws were removed without much fuss, the sedition law is one which is complicated and controversial. The Bharatiya Janta Party has always believed in protecting the unity and integrity of the country above everything else. A firm belief in the ideal that a truly rich and diverse nation like India is optimally united when its people give precedence to their identity as \u2018Indians before everything else\u2019 is what led to the birth of the BJP. As a dedicated patriot and a responsible prime minister of this country , I have always believed in the words of \"Nation first\". As the Prime Minister of the country and the head of the government , I also reject all the charges leveled against my government of suppressing the voice of the youth of the country. After assuming office, In June 2014, I said \" Our democracy will not sustain if we can't guarantee freedom of speech and expression.\" I have always respected all the diverse views and opinions and I have always favoured what suits best to the interest of the country. The union government is always open to all kinds of criticism, dissent and diverse views, however it is not ready to accept something that goes against the very principles of the basis of the nation, that may possibly have deep reaching implications and consequences on the peace and unity of our motherland. For all people who do not support this argument, they need to understand the very basic nature of our parliamentary system and our diverse country. The Bharatiya Janta Party and the government strongly believe that there must be tough action against those creating communal divide in the country and instigating violence against the country at large. As a result of my party's efforts, after the BJP government came to power, we are finally seeing success in controlling the anti-India sentiment in the Kashmir valley. The government admits that the sedition law in its present form is too wide in its definition which makes it vulnerable to misutilisation by the governments potentially. The Law Commission in its 42nd report has said that the sedition provision was defective. However, the panel didn't recommend scrapping it. We believe that disaffection or disapproval with the government or its policies and ideology are welcomed in a democracy, however it is the responsibility of the political parties to draw a thick line between the country and the government. The Indian Constitution gives the basic fundamental rights to all its citizens in its truest sense and this can be made more effective and consistent with our international obligations with progressive changes in these provisions, keeping the unity and peace of the country intact. The history and the values of our country teaches us to protect its unity at all costs. The diverse opinions and the different voices inside the country makes it a beautiful place to live in. I am optimistic that this meeting would see the political parties resolve their differences to make the discussion solution-centric. I also hope that this meeting would help us to strengthen the unity of the country and at the same time , further expand the freedom of expressions in our country.
