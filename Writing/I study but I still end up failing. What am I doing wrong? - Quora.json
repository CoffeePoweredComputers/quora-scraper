            "answer_text": "Try the Feynman Method!  The great man once said, \u201cStudy hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent, and original manner possible.\u201d Let\u2019s learn a bit about Feynman. He was an American physicist who pioneered in the fields of quantum field theory[1] and quantum electrodynamics[2] , as well as many contributions to quantum mechanics. He won the Nobel Prize of physics in 1965[3] for his work in QED. He is not known just for his work in physics, however\u2026 he was a great player of jokes and had quite the phenomenal personality. But how does this help you in studying? Here\u2019s what he had to say about it. Write the name of what you are studying at the top of a blank piece of paper.Write an explanation of what you're studying. Throw away all the jargon and pretend you're explaining this concept to someone new. Highlight what you know, and pinpoint what you don't.Review what you pinpointed, then go back to the original material of what you're studying and re-read it then repeat step 2.Avoid the jargon and try to create a broad analogy of what you're studying.This allows you to develop an understanding of what you're studying at a fundamental level. What often happens to those to \u201cstudy\u201d and end up failing is that they don't actually understand the material at all, they have just memorized it. Feynman also had something to say about this. I don't know what's the matter with people: they don't learn by understanding, they learn by some other way \u2014 by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile! Feynman sought out to ensure that he was not \u201clearning\u201d like this, AND that he was not facilitating this type of learning for his students.

            "answer_text": "Sometimes when you fail a course, you can learn from it as well. I failed a course that I was taking while I was going to college. The course was supposed to be about the server for Windows. I had this huge textbook that was required for the course and I had an instructor that decided that they were going to teach Linux instead of using the correct textbook that was required for the course instead. I did not have a text book from Linux and I had a very hard time trying to understand the course and it\u2019s because of mostly the way the class was taught as well. The instructor that I had a certain way of teaching things to the class and that way was teach it one time and you\u2019re done learning it. Not so with me. I had to ask my instructor to repeat it because I couldn't get what he was saying right away. I felt frustrated during the course because I couldn\u2019t get the material at the way the instructor was going over it because I felt like he was going way too fast for me, and I had a very hard time trying to study for all the exams he gave us because I didn\u2019t have the right book(s). I was very glad when the course was over and I learned that I had failed it. I knew the reason for my failing the course and it was because I honestly gave it my best shot and I partially blame the instructor for me failing it as well too and the reason for failing the course was the wrong textbook. I also remember writing on the rating form something like use the correct textbook when you are teaching the windows server course. I figured if this instructor can have a one and done way of teaching, so can I. I did it once and I\u2019m done. If I ever have to take this course again I hope I get an instructor that will listen to me whenever I have questions and help me get caught up when I can\u2019t understand things that are going on in class. Otherwise it will be a one and done class for me ",
