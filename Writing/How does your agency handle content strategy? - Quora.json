            "answer_text": "I work for a content marketing agency in London, and I'll just answer for our part.  A proviso: When we talk about content strategy, we're talking about content marketing strategy. Content strategy purists may not like this, but there you go. In one way, content strategy is cooked into every content marketing project that we pick up. Our relationships are generally long-lasting and start with either messaging and positioning work or an explicit content strategy process. This informs much, if not everything that we do thereafter. Either of those two approaches usually involve a considerable investment, which will then roll into the content work that comes downstream. Without doing this upfront work, however, we'd be making content blindly later, and our stuff would be hit or miss. Not good for us. Not good for the client. These processes usually involve one or more strategists, an accounts person and potentially a creative (copywriter or designer). The strategists/planners work out the personas, the ways to reach them, the kinds of content that are appropriate and the messaging. Accounts manages the relationship. Creatives start to put the strategy into a format that looks like finished work. Initially, we measure success by a mutual feeling that we've done our legwork and our content plan \"makes sense\". There's no easy way to measure that, but you know it when you feel it - throughout the agency and the client-side team. Everyone's clear on the challenge and how we'll proceed to tackle it. Later, of course, we'll measure the performance of our content campaigns and - if possible - compare these against earlier campaigns, guesstimates worked out during planning or any other benchmark. And tweak thereafter. Hope that helps. I don't mean for this to be a plug, but it's simply an appropriate summary of how we address content strategy. It's our most recent eBook, called the Content Marketing Strategy Checklist. Use it or don't. But it adds color to my answer. ",
