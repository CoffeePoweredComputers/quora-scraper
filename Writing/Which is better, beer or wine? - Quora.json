            "answer_text": "Beer, hands down. I don\u2019t drink wine, and it all pretty much tastes the same. Sure there are red wines which are slightly different from white wines, but the differences are minor. And it isn\u2019t particularly good even then. Now beer, on the other hand, covers an amazingly broad range of beverages. Beers can vary from 1\u201320% alcohol by volume. It ranges from almost colorless to pitch black. And the range of flavors? You can make beer taste like pretty much anything you want. Fruit, spices, vegetables - even oysters have been used in beer making, and I know Dogfish Head brews a beer with scrapple in the mash. Different grains, hop varietals, and yeast strains will give you vastly different flavor profiles. You like wine? There are some perfectly good strong, tannic Belgian beers that taste similar - but far better. You think you don\u2019t like the taste of beer? Try something like a fruited lambic - a sour beer flavored with various kinds of fruit that tastes nothing like what you might think of as \u201cbeer\u201d. Coffee drinker? Stouts brewed with coffee are quite popular - and many of them are very good, as well. Mikkeller Beer Geek Brunch Weasel even has that extremely expensive civet shit coffee in it (and is a damn good beer, though had I known about the civet shit beforehand, I probably would have never bought it). There is a beer for every weather, for every season, for every event. There is a beer that goes well with every food from pizza to chocolate cake. Wine is just wine, like it or not, but there is a beer for everyone. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is that wine in X quantity (be it a glass or a gallon) is no better or worse for the average drinker than beer in a comparable quantity. In fact, wine may have a worse effect on some drinkers due to tannins that cause harsher hangovers. Both have demonstrated an ability to lower the chances of osteoporosis, Alzheimer\u2019s and heart disease. The key flaw in earlier studies that championed wine was that researchers failed to accurately account for the lifestyle differences between wine drinkers and beer drinkers. Wine appeared to win out because wine drinkers tended to be younger, healthier, smoked less and were more physically fit than their beer-swilling counterparts. Beer advocates are quick to tout studies that also show brew\u2019s ability to reduce the incidence of kidney stones in men and lower blood pressure in women. Some would say that puts beer in the lead in the health race between the two, especially considering the beating taken by resveratrol(red wine\u2019s so-called \u201cmiracle molecule\u201d) in the press. Of course, there\u2019s no need to be nasty. There\u2019s enough positive research out there to give both booze choices a rosy glow, although at the end of the day it\u2019s important to remember that neither beverage is going to do you any favors in large quantities.
