            "answer_text": "Why not? Your very question shows that you have sn urge for writing. That's enough for a start. You can start writing straight away. This urge is the backbone of the attempt. Don't expect any spectacular admiration from the public at once. On other hand, if you get it, you are very lucky. Writing, in most cases, tends to be an uphill task! You must be able to sustain your interest. Endless reading is the key to good and successful writing . You must be thinking about it day in and day out. It must be a job of love. Success will breed success. Talk to people who are knowledgeable. Get their ideas. There will be an interaction in your mind between their and your ideas. That's the pleasure to be devoutly wished for. If you have other means of sustenance, you can pursue this with will and vigour. The first praise Will take care of the rest! All the best to you! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Age is no barrier. Yet a beginner is best off starting with their church or school newspaper. Saleable articles pretty much require that you earn your chops. Your writing has to achieve polish and all the important stuff like vocabulary, grammar, and a general life sense. This where \u2018non-pro\u2019 situations come in. Small audiences let you begin to understand what readers like and don\u2019t. You have various \u2018editors\u2019 to please even on these occasions. They DO have organizations, at least informally. It serves as a training ground. It doesn\u2019t end with just one article. A following needs building, always! Quora is good. Upvotes are the way to track your personal progress. People come to know you as a solid source of info and interest with others. Your audience in other words. Getting asked back is the best compliment. You never know who is reading you. ",

I have students in California, one in high school and another in eighth grade, who have published articles in their local papers. When I was in high school, I offered to write for my hometown newspaper for \u201cbed, board, and bylines.\u201d My offer was not accepted then. but after college, that publication gave me my first job in journalism. If you are in college, consider interning at a professional newspaper. Both paid and unpaid internships are available. They are a wonderful training ground. It sounds like you may soon be entering the most exciting profession on earth. Hang on tight \u2014 it\u2019ll be quite a ride. ",

Let me clarify that out of the hundreds of thousands of students in this university town, no more than two or three students at a time held that position. In other words, being a student does not disqualify you from writing for a newspaper, but not every student who likes to write will be accepted by the newspaper. Contact the paper to find out the possibilities. Perhaps if you have experience on the school paper, it could help, or courses in journalism, or prizes for your academic writing. ",

For example, if you like sports, talk to the editor of the local weekly paper in your town and offer to go to area high school games and write about them for $25 per story. These should be 500\u2013800 words and you may need to have access to a decent SLR camera, as well. You can talk to the team coach after the game to get quotes.
