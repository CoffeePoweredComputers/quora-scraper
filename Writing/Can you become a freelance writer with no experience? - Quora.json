            "answer_text": "Yes you can become a freelance writer with no experience. You will just need to start building your experience now. Just know that you may need to take a longer time to work your way up to a full time income. So, hold on to your day job for now. Starting a writing career can seem to be an impossible dream when you have a full schedule every day. This was my experience. But by taking small steps, I was able to accomplish this. Here are some of the steps I took. I first started my own blog, yourBarnabas.com in 2012 and began posting weekly. This was not easy because of my hectic work schedule. But I developed the practice of an early morning time of meditation and prayer. As a result of that time in the early hours of the day, I began writing in a journal. I made it a point to write at least one paragraph every day. Out of that journal, I began publishing one thought per week to my blog. As I continued this every week, my writing skills gradually began to improve. For a long time, I tried hard to monetize my blog, but I couldn\u2019t. Although many people sold online courses to help monetize your writing, I just was not able to accomplish that. But finally, someone suggested that I monetize my writing skills instead of monetizing my blog. That\u2019s when I stumbled on the concept of freelance writing. I tried many platforms from 2014 onwards, but many failed to deliver what they promised. Upwork finally clicked for me and became my primary freelance platform.[1] Upwork Advice Footnotes[1] Upwork Advice",
