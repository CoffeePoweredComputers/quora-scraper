            "answer_text": "Life is hard for nearly everyone. Most people suffer in their life. All jobs have their down sides, otherwise they wouldn't be jobs, they'd be hobbies and no one would get paid to do them. Currently I make a living for doing an average of an hour\u2019s work a night. I get to travel the world for free, people regularly thank me for doing my job. I love being on stage, it's generally the favourite part of my day. My job leads me to meet fascinating people all the time. I have met four different leaders of my country, and made fun of them to their face. In the past I have been given free drugs and had sex with women normally not approachable by a man with my looks. I haven't seen my kids in over a month. My traveling contributed to the breakdown of my thirteen year relationship. When you're the last performer of the night you HAVE to be funnier than all the ambitious and talented comics on before you, at a time of the night when the audience is getting tired and drunk. I am regularly complimented by people who then try to tell me repellently racist or sexist street jokes. As a stand up comic, no matter how experienced and talented you are, you are never very far from an ego destroying failure on stage. To provide for my children I have to be away from them. I have been technically homeless for six months and might remain so for the next year or two. Most of the people I admire and respect and love are other comedians, but I rarely get to see most of my friends. Some comedians are absolute arseholes, and it\u2019s hard to be on tour with someone who is trying to make your life hell. So, how hard is it to be a comedian? Probably not as hard as it is to be a plumber or a police officer or a nurse. Probably a lot easier than nearly any other job to be honest, and more fun. ",

            "answer_text": "Extremely. Imagine, standing on a stage in front of a room full of strangers you don't know, and have no idea about their sensibilities or sense of humor, and being expected to make them laugh. All while those spot lights are cooking you. You have to do this with material you've written, and may have even rehearsed, but it's not like you can read it off of cue cards, you have to know it, by heart, inside and out, forwards and backwards\u2026 to the point you can actually make it come out organically as if you were just having a private conversation with a close friend. All while those spot lights are cooking you. Everything has to be perfect. Your tone, your rhythm, your cadence, and ESPECIALLY your timing. You have to be charming and charismatic. You have to connect with that room full of strangers. All while those spot lights are cooking you. And even if you're legit funny, there's no guarantee the ROOM is going to think so. It's entirely possible you will bomb, fall flat on your face and barely get a chuckle\u2026 and it won't even be your fault, it's just a bad room. All while those spot lights are cooking you. And here's the worst part\u2026 even if you ARE legit funny, and you are legit GOOD. You do EVERYTHING right and get laughs. You're VERY successful with the rooms, over and over again\u2026 it doesn't matter. You'll make shit for money, spend your whole life on the road doing sleazy clubs all over the country, staying in flea-bag motels or worse: club condos. Barely surviving, for YEARS before you start to make any kind of a name for yourself and actually start getting paid anywhere near what you're worth. This is why I truly love comedians so much. They suffer through all of that, not for the money (most of them never make any)\u2026 but for the laughs. To make US laugh. They truly are some of the most wonderful people on the planet. All while those spot lights are cooking them. ",
