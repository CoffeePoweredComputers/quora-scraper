            "answer_text": "Google love multiple articles with same focused topic rather than keyword. - Welcome to the age of topical optimization.  Traditionally, SEO has focused on optimizing pages for a single keyword or phrase in order to help that page appear higher in the search engine results. Beginning with the release of Google\u2019s Hummingbird algorithm, the most forward-thinking members search engine marketing industry now believe that semantic search, or \u201creal language\u201d queries are now the way forward. With Topical Optimization, the goal is to write effectively about a topic, theme, or subject rather than trying to work around just one keyword. This will help make your content more effective in reaching more people, mostly due to increased traffic from \u201clong tail\u201d searches about that topic. Topical Optimization Versus Keyword Optimization  Maybe in the past, you felt that you could only optimize one keyword per page, or maybe you were already grouping keywords together like this. So where does the whole topical optimization come in? Topical optimization doesn\u2019t mean you have to have a single page or post that covers everything that needs to be said on the topic. Not only does that limit the number of entry points, it also doesn\u2019t necessarily help searchers to land on the page that best represents their intent. Instead of optimizing your site for keywords and hoping to rank here and there, focus on building the site out to dominate a topic with multiple pages and blog posts. Each page or post will target a tightly correlated group of keywords, but all built around a slightly broader topic. That gives you a chance to dominate a topic through multiple related pages, each focused on a specific visitor intent. That\u2019s tough to beat. ",

By writing articles you must follow the SEO rules. You can submit these articles in different submissions sites to more benefits. Because we can get backlinks or traffic for those keywords from different domains, which is more useful for a website. The usage of keywords in a article not more than 3%, helps to SEO.  If you use more than 3%, website will be penalized. ",

Put one content on your blog or website, second on one of the popular article submission site and third on the guest blogging site.  In this way you will receive a backlinks, credibility and engagement from multiple sites for your content too. Thanks ",

In sort build link for that Article when it gets good amount of links. the page value of this article will increase automatically. you can check that through PA and DA in moz bar tools. then you build internal link for the page which you want to rank with multiple article.
