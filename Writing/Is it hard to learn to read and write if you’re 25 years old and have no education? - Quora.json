            "answer_text": "People can learn at any age. It might be difficult to gt started, because people get scared to make mistakes, or they might feel ashamed they can\u2019t read and write at that age, but the truth is it\u2019s still possible to learn. What\u2019s important though is to find a good mentor/facilitator. If the mentor(s) is helpful and give constructive feedback, learners can improve their skills quickly! But it\u2019s important to start with small, achievable targets. Use SMART goals, to learn to read words, then short expressions, then short sentences, paragraphs, articles, etc. And later on when choosing books, they should be interesting yet not too overwhelming.

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. I think that with a little dedication and sincere intent, it is quite possible to learn anything no matter what the age. India has always encouraged more people to come forward and get educated. There are plenty of NGOs and governmental organizations that have pro-actively taken up the cause of \u2018education for all\u2019. In India, there is a separate Directorate for Adult Education in the Ministry of Human Resource Development.  Most of the people who come for these programs are fully grown adults. And they do get the basic idea of how to read and write and be relatively self-sufficient that way.   ",
