            "answer_text": "Is it illegal to take cocaine in the UK? No, it's not illegal to take, it's illegal to posses, it's illegal to sell, it's illegal to drive under the influence but actually taking it isn't illegal. This is true of all drugs in English law. For example; If you rack up a line in the view of a cop and snort it, it wont be 'taking cocaine' you're charged with. Most likely the charge would be 'possession of cocaine' which, depending on where you are in the uk and your criminal record, could get you a fine or a stay in jail. However, If that was your last line, and you have nothing else on you, you'll probably be released without charge - provided you didn't do anything else wrong such as resisting arrest etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Being in possession of cocaine without a legal reason for having it is illegal, but the actual act of taking it is not. Moreover, once you have taken it, you are no longer legally in possession of it. A blood or urine sample showing you have cocaine in your system in itself will not put you in prison, but will if it shows you were under the influence while driving. Even a photograph of you snorting a white powder will not get you convicted of Class A drug possession, because a) it could be a drug in a different class (e.g. amphetamine - Class C), or b) it could even be a non-drug, like glucose powder.
