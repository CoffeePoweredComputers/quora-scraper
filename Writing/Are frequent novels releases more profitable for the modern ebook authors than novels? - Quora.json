            "answer_text": "Hello Domo, For self-published authors, I do think so, and as Rebecca noted, also especially in the romance genre. Romance readers are very loyal and will read almost any book from an author they enjoy. But there is so much competition in that genre, that if an author takes too long between books, especially if they are writing a series, then the readers can lose interest. I currently write I think it is seven series, and I put a new release out almost every month. Even then, I get readers who enjoy one specific series more than the others writing to me in the months between releases for that series, asking when their favorite is coming out. My goal for 2019 is to have less series lol. I always suggest to new writers who have planned a series to write the first two books before publishing the first - I know some authors recommend writing the whole series first. But if you want to keep your reader\u2019s interest, then you don\u2019t want to leave it too long between release dates. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, no. Just like authors look for ROI when doing their marketing, readers look for ROI in their book buying habits. You can build a catalog very quickly with rapid-fire novella releases, but then the question is, why not just write a novel? And a large backlist really doesn\u2019t mean much if you can\u2019t convert your readers and convince them to buy all those novellas. There are ways to sell novellas, but it\u2019s much easier and cheaper to sell fewer novels rather than trying to sell a huge list of novellas. ",

However, it looks like the majority of self-published authors make more money from novels in series than novellas in series, no matter how rapidly published. I looked at a web tool that searches Amazon for estimates of sales, and it looks to me like novels are more lucrative in general, although I caution that the tool estimates earnings, so it could be wrong.
