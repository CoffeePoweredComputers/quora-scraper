Can\u2019t he read your mind, prays, etc.? Writing seems\u2026. like you doubt what you believe in then. Or at least don\u2019t follow \u201ceverything\u201d they teach. No? But hey, if you still don\u2019t care about the planet, still think writing is \u201cmore efficient\u201d, and like \u201cdouble-talking\u201d to your god,\u2026. then go ahead. At least when our kids write to Santa, it makes more sense since they are small and don\u2019t think like an adult. Just saying. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "It can be quite helpful, though not in terms of God responding. (I\u2019m an atheist, so I don\u2019t think there is a god that can respond.) The benefit for the letter writer is a clarification of his or her thoughts, wishes, and plans. It\u2019s helpful in much the same way that a journal can be helpful, and writing about one\u2019s feelings (for example) can help one understand and deal with them better. (See the book Opening Up for a good description of benefits.) ",
