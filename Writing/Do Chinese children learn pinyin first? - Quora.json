            "answer_text": "Not anymore. From September 2017, all regions in Mainland China has adopted unified textbooks for the subjects of Chinese, History, and Civil Ethics in the 1st grade. In the past, Pinyin was taught before Chinese characters as Pinyin is the method of denoting pronunciations for characters. In the new textbooks, some simple Chinese characters will be taught first such as \u2018\u5929(sky)\u2019, \u2018\u5730(earth)\u2019, \u2018\u4eba(human)\u2019. These are the common words which children are already very familiar with and should know how to pronounce. Whether they know Pinyin or not will not impair their ability to learn these characters. Pinyin will be taught starting the second month of 1st Grade. Pinyin is merely a way to denote pronunciations of Mandarin. It is to Mandarin as the International Phonetic Alphabet is to Latin language. It is useful when you need to learn how to pronounce a word, but literal adult do not actually write in it. ",

            "answer_text": "In 21st yes. But long ago, Chinese children didn't learn Pinyin first. Just like my father and mother both of them can't use Pinyin perfact.And lots of Chinese elder people also can't. Pinyin is a language tool,which is like phnetic symbols in English.And such at first,Chinese had invented Wubi,a special typewriting,in order to import Chinese characters in computer.However there was another person create the new way to express Chinese to computer and Pinyin is much more convince than Wubi so that we learn Pinyin first. Obviously,Pinyin makes the Chinese learning easy.Perhaps we will never learn Pinyin in the future. ",
