            "answer_text": "U.S. perspective As far as copyright law is concerned, fanfiction is nothing special - it\u2019s just another literary work. This means that fanfiction may, but will not necessarily, infringe upon the copyright of the original work on which the fanfiction is based. The most likely defense to infringement, if it is available in a given case, would be fair use. A fair use analysis requires considering four statutory factors (see Chapter 1 - Circular 92). In each case, such an analysis is highly fact-specific. Of the four factors, the most important is the first, the purpose and character of the defendant\u2019s use of the plaintiff\u2019s copyrighted work. The analysis of this factor frequently is expressed in term of whether the defendant\u2019s work is transformative, i.e., whether it adds something new with a further purpose or different character. Here are two cases concerning fanfiction-like works based on well-known antecedents that came to opposite conclusions concerning whether the fair use defense was available: Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin[1] - An injunction prohibiting the publication of The Wind Done Gone, based on Gone With the Wind, was vacated (fair use defense applies - work is transformative because it is critical of the original work).Salinger v. Colting[2] - Preliminary injunction prohibiting publishing, advertising, or otherwise distributing 60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye, a derivative work of The Catcher in the Rye (no fair use because not transformative - just made the main character 60 years older).In summary, the treatment of fanfiction under copyright law, including whether the fair use defense to copyright infringement is available, is like the treatment of any other literary work.

            "answer_text": "As a general rule, you\u2019d probably consider fanfiction to be a derivative work of the original book or movie. This means that the copyright of the original work covers the derivative work, and the fanfiction can be considered a violation of the original. However, there are, of course, lots of exceptions, possible the most important being the doctrine of fair use. Fair use is the idea that, in order to talk about a work, we have to tread very close, if not on, its copyright protections. For example, you\u2019d have a hard time righting a movie review without referencing the characters or plot elements. The idea of fair use also allows you to lampoon or parody the work, as such expression can help to point out inherent issue in the work, like subtle political bias or stereotypical characters. For the most part, fanfiction is not actually protected expression because the Fair use arguments don\u2019t really apply. The main reason the writers of fanfiction are getting called into court all the time is two fold: damages and public perception. Damages is what you win when you win a court case. They are supposed to be fair, so they either (1) give you back the violation of your right made you lose or (2) give you any gains the violator received. Generally, its hard to prove that fanfiction hurts the author of the original, so there is nothing to give back, and most writers of fanfiction don\u2019t make any money doing it, so there are no gains to recover. So, generally, there\u2019s not much benefit in cracking down on fanfiction for the original author. The next issue is public perception. Fanfiction is written, obviously, by fans. Its generally not a great idea to antagonize your fans, as they provide you your livelihood. So, even if there was something to gain from suing the author of fanfiction, it would probably do more harm than good in the long haul. ",
