            "answer_text": "War story time: I hope I don\u2019t bore you. It is four days till my wedding to my Vietnamese fiancee, I am in my final few weeks of being \u201cin country\u201d, and I am flying the units brand new helicopter. Could I be any more of a lead magnet? Ok, so I just picked up one critical patient from a hot landing zone, and was called to do the same at another hot (enemy contact just broken) landing zone. Just across the Mekong river from this area was the huge army base of Vinh Long, but do you think I could get gunship cover? yeah, right! So breaking the rules again, landed for pick up. We always turn the tail to the last known enemy position to present the smallest target. Well, the ground unit was fumbling with a stretcher, (wrong move) when the rice paddy in front of me erupted, one could here the bullets tearing through the helicopter, my medic is shouting \u201cI\u2019m hit! I hate to say it, this was the only time in 13 months that I failed to pick up a patient, but the soldiers were hugging the rice paddy, and had lost interest of trying to get the wounded into the helicopter. Picked up, turned tail, and applied so much forward cyclic, you would think the rotor was a prop. Landed at n nearby forward fire support base, rally in the middle of nowhere. however it was nice to be on the right side of some 105 howitzers. Made radio calls on the way, a sister ship got my patient, medic, and the one I missed with no issues. the rest of us had to sit it out for awhile. Took 44 hits total. 45 counting the medic. The huey was a tough old bird though. We were just getting crashworthy fuel cells in our birds. in this case, the rounds hit the cells, but did not penetrate. The engine somehow got us safe in spite of a couple go hits. And one round almost severed one of the control cables for the tail rotor, only a couple of strands holding it together. (That one scares me the most!) However, it wasn\u2019t all bad. See, the morning, before, I had to pick up some patients on the coast my the mouth of one of the Mekong Delta river outlets. It was a beautiful early morning, and breaking the rules again, was flying at tree top level, at around one hundred knots, inches above the ground. A real no-no, but everyone was giving me a hard time about getting married, and I didn't. care. So, how does this tie into being stranded? Well, I didn\u2019t retract the search light after a night mission, ant it it a palm tree I nearly cleared. It now just hung down, and would only turn off by pulling the circuit breaker. Did I mention, I was already on the hot seat, and wondering How I could explain the damage. Lucky me, it got shot out. Finally, they hooked the helicopter with a chinook, and hauled it to the scrap yard. Also, in 2007, now ex wife took me Back to Vietnam, and on the way to visit family. we went right by that spot. No shooting this time.` ",

            "answer_text": "Very good friend of mine was part of a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) deployment returning from the Persian Gulf. He was flying AV-8B Harriers as part of the MEU\u2019s attached squadron. They were flying missions of an LHA (amphibious carrier), In the South China Sea, near the southern Philippines, he got a fire light. In the emergency procedures for the Harrier, you are supposed to make sure the nozzles are pointed aft. This ensures that, if there is a fire, its not caused by the very hot air in the reaction control/puffer duct system that is used to control the aircraft in the hover. (Very hot air going through fuel-laden wings is a bad combination). That means he can\u2019t return to the ship for a vertical landing. So he diverts to a small-town airfield in the southern Philippines. He flies over the airfield twice\u2026 Once to get people to clear farm animals off the runway. Second time to land. Vito lands. The MEU and American embassy and Philippine government eventually get everything figured out, but this takes several days. A Marine C-130 lands with an engine and repair crew to fix the airplane. An officer gets off the C-130 and makes Vito sign for a big bag of US cash. He would have to pay cash for fuel, lodging the crew, etc. I believe they had a second Harrier fly off the ship to stay there too. Eventually, they get the aircraft repaired, but the ships are already half way across the Pacific. So my buddy and the second aircraft launch out of the Philippines and follow a USAF tanker across to rejoin the ships in Hawaii. ",

            "answer_text": "Not me, but just before the UK went into lockdown a military Apache helicopter which had been visiting our local airfield went tech and was forced to stay with us overnight and the following day. The two crew must have been pretty hacked off - As they were required to remain with their Helio overnight, but one of the flying schools sent out for fish and chips for them. They finally departed the following afternoon after the software fault had been resolved. ",
