            "answer_text": "Absolutely, categorically not. It was a tremendous privilege, for which I was always extremely grateful. Today, nearly thirty-five years after graduating, I still feel that way. It was not boarding school where I encountered an ongoing struggle against an environment that was snobbish, materialistic, drug-infested, and ridden with bullying; rather, it was the public K-8, which I had previously attended for eight long years, that was chock-full of these. So the prospect of attending the 9\u201312 public senior high school in that area, into which the rotten little swine from my K-8 and three other similar schools in the neighborhood flowed, was nothing short of appalling. Moreover, the boarding school I attended was only an an hour\u2019s drive or so away. I called my parents every week (bear in mind, this was the pre-cell phone, pre-internet and pre-personal computer era). Also, I went home for visits every four or five weeks, on average, in addition to the usual vacation periods. That amounted to plenty of family time, trust me. Meanwhile, at boarding school I made the closest friendships of my life and began to discover music, art, literature, history, and the outdoors. Never in the years since have I experienced such intense bonding and genuine laughter. In retrospect, I do realize that my experience wasn\u2019t universally shared. Thanks to improved communication in recent years via Facebook and the like, I\u2019ve found out that my beloved school had an ample quotient of bullying and even sexual abuse. But for me, the memories are unsullied. On a final note, let me say that when discussing the merits of boarding school, one should differentiate between normal boarding schools and the classic English \u201cprep\u201d school \u2014 which refers not to boarding academies for teenagers, but rather to boarding schools for children as young as eight. There is a world of difference between an eight-year-old and a fourteen-year-old. At fourteen, you are on the brink of puberty, if you haven\u2019t already gotten there, and you\u2019re just a few years away from being old enough to vote, work, etc. At fourteen I was thrilled to get away from my parents for a bit and to \u201cmake my own scene,\u201d as it were. At eight it would have been, without a doubt, utterly traumatic. ",

I think that by far it was one of the best decisions my parents have ever made. I am from a rural area, and did not have access to many of the opportunities that city kids did, and now I am able to receive an education that I could have only ever dreamed of. In addition to this, I live with kids my own age, and whilst this can be frustrating at times, ultimately it is a great experience. Originally, it was my idea to go to boarding school, and my parents were very hesitant to send me, even refusing on a number of occasions. So I don\u2019t feel any sense of neglect at all, as it ultimately was my choice. However, I can\u2019t speak for those people who were \u2018forced\u2019 to attend by their parents, as their opinions may be different. ",

            "answer_text": "Although I attended schools for the deaf throughout my childhood, my first \u2018boarding\u2019 school (we Deaf people call them residential schools) was at the age of 12. I didn\u2019t feel unwanted at all. I understood that there were really no other choice available to me at that age. It was a choice between a residential (boarding) school for the deaf (actually, there are two schools for the deaf within an hour away from my parents\u2019 home) or a mainstream school with hearing students, and for my hearing parents and myself, this wasn\u2019t really a true choice. (More like a no-brainer.) Mainstreaming at a local public school in the neighborhood was never a consideration for us, because my parents and I felt it was very important that I get to have full visual access to my education. Interpreters in mainstreaming programs don\u2019t provide Deaf students with the same full access that Deaf students in residential schools get.

            "answer_text": "For the most part deaf residential schools are also boarding schools that happen to be public schools. It may have changed some dynamics of the family relationships within my family, I did not go to the deaf school because my parents did not want me, I went because of the quality of education better suited my needs. I could get by with interpreters and other support services, yet I would lack the direct interaction between my teachers and students that the deaf school provides. Many families find that their local public schools may not be a qualified success for their deaf kids and send them to a school more than an hour away and have them stay at the dorm. One advantage of today is the accessibility of videophones that families can use. I used to use the teletypewriter device back then. I still had access to my family. They came to some of my games (I have other siblings after me) or came down to get me home after being in trouble\u2026happens. The major dynamic changes would be my sister and our roles in the family. I would be the oldest kid on weekends while my sister would be the oldest during the week. Almost every Friday, my brothers would complain that my sister was being bossy. If I were there, I wouldn\u2019t be that bossy. I guess some traits come out stronger. I also would bring back home some philosophical discussions and my mother would be having those with me. Depends on the reason why. I know many families don\u2019t bother with their deaf kids so state takes responsibility, yet long term impact affects mental and emotional health. ",

First off I think it\u2019s important to state that the majority of parents of boarding students (despite the archetype) are pretty hesistant to send their kids away. I know for my parents I had to convince them to send me away. Second what it made my parents, my 3 siblings, and I realize was that our time together was something we always took for granted. A lot of the time we would end up bickering and arguing over nothing. Yet now we don't nearly spend as much time creating something outta nothing. We're a lot more aware of each other and don't want to waste time bickering over trick stuff and more time being close to one another. We as a family have gotten a lot closer in the last couple years because of it. ",
