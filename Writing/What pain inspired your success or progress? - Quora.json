            "answer_text": "The pain that inspired my success in life was the fact that every morning I would wake up and not be able to breathe because I was to lazy to do my breathing treatments. You see I suffer from a lung disorder called cystic fibrosis where the mucus in your lungs is stickier than usual and doing treatments in the morning and night help you stay healthy but when the treatments aren\u2019t done you risk long term infection that can\u2019t always be recovered from. So from that pain in life gave me motivation because I knew deep down that I was a better person that what I had made it seem like and I knew that in the future I wanted a family and to be able to take care of that family and I couldn\u2019t do that if I couldn\u2019t breathe so that\u2019s what inspired me is the pain and fear of not being able to do what I dreamed of!
