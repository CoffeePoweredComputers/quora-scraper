            "answer_text": "There are a couple of ways that this can happen, I am using the United States as a reference. Way 1: My way I draft an entire new application from stem to stern. This is the cheapest easiest, best and most likely to succeed solution. However, you may not feel like you are \u201cgetting a deal\u201d or contributing. For comparison purposes let\u2019s say that this option costs $10k plus costs. Way 2: Your way I take your cobbled together pile of nonsense and throw some claims on the end of it. I charge maybe $5k, but then you get a ton of objections from the patent office and I need to file a preliminary amendment. One that looks a lot like my way. Add $10k more, $15k total plus costs. At the end of the day you feel like you contributed but not like you \u201cgot a deal.\u201d I saw one of these last week. I read all of the rejections on the first office action and asked \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with the attorney who drafted the specification. It reads like there hasn\u2019t been any case law on software since the 80\u2019s.\u201d The inventor responded, \u201cI drafted it based on a bunch of other applications I read.\u201d Oops. Way 3: Hybrid I take your cobbled together pile of nonsense and harmonize it. Basically I use software to make sure that terms are consistently used. If this is software, I add on a ton of material to try to evade (an inevitable) 101 rejection. We go back and forth a dozen times on what to change and why and it takes forever. Attorneys only do these applications hourly, starting with a 4x retainer ($20k). It\u2019s always amazingly expensive to do things this way, but clients really think they \u201cgot a deal\u201d and contributed. I can\u2019t explain why. Most patent attorneys find this arrangement so annoying they refuse to do it. Maybe if you find someone really underemployed who just got a license, you might find someone will to take this on. Probably not. If you want to keep costs low, just let the attorneys do their thing. You can do it another way, but it\u2019s really just a lot more expensive. It\u2019s a good deal for the patent attorney, but not really a good deal for you. Good Submitluck. ",

            "answer_text": "In the United States, an individual inventor filing an application and having it examined will cost at least $400.  If it is granted, there is an issuance fee of $240, followed by maintenance fees several years down the road if the inventor wishes to keep the patent enforceable for its entire term.  If the inventor is acting on behalf of a company, or if prosecution goes on extensively, the fees will be higher. To prepare an application, you should talk to a patent attorney or patent agent, but you can deal directly with the Patent Office if you choose.  The Patent Office provides free materials to inventors who want to represent themselves. Every patent application must have a drawing of the invention, written description of the invention, and a set of claims.  You can search on Google Patents to see examples of patents and patent applications on similar topics. ",
