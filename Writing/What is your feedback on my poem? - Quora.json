            "answer_text": "While I have done the following, the intention was to understand the poem. What a good poem does is starts to relate to the reader's life. It disappears and it just becomes the reader thinking about it. A good poem is without noise. The words take him to his own place. I understood your poem in the context of my own projection, hence projection follows. I would say that I truly liked your poem. Perhaps, I took liberties and misunderstood parts. My mother came to mind and thus my bias took over at a point. I sensed someone who never actually lived their life, lived on platitudes, and never seemed to really get her hands dirty, except perhaps in the sense that she manned a garden, but it was as a frillish attempt and never seriously did she apply herself. She cried a lot and she did this out of misunderstanding. She did not have the discipline nor the gumption to get out and figure out why. But, also where I was off, you could say that it was me going off on my own, but it could also mean that it wasn't quite clear and I could take it where I wanted.  Anyway, I enjoyed this very much and I don't think I have a complaint about you not choosing the right words. Thank you. I think you are doing fine.  In an accumulated grace, Over the course of her life,Which was ending,Her fingers, under their own cognitionHad wasted time on the Edges of trivial things. There were tissues from snotThat littered the encampment,Like small goose down duvets in an all-white room.She used long sentences to embellish What was just a boring life. She cut ties to itAs she cut her hair, her nails, and then her weight.Looking back things remain unfinished,Having donned a hoarder\u2019s house. She looks aloof at entire countriesRaking not the matrix of their most dense designsBut the centers matter to her,The hub, keen department storesWhere jewelry glitters. Everything else was just a frame,Like the Cadillac she drove to get there.Walking the red carpet --The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes. She knew no one Other than the ones she had given birth.Everyone else was an \u201cother.\u201d I would ask her if she could add 5+7 and She never even blinked:\u201cI cannot.\u201d She would turn over and over in her bedAt the nursing homeScreaming cursesShaking her handsToward the sounds of her Halloweened colleagues. It got worse for her.Taking a bath was like pulling her skin,Prodding her with a branding iron. She carried hemorrhoids,Like beaded curtains.It embarrassed her That her son bathed her. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for sharing this poem. Like the others who have commented so far, I enjoyed the strong imagery (\"So many tissues twisted into a skyfull of clouds\"), interesting metaphors (She will never till all this sky\") and creative descriptions (\"Her past contains/ Graveyards of stray pieces: half moon clippings,/ Paper shreds, dirt, dust\").  The opening, portraying a dystopian view of this woman's world, made me think of \"The Second Coming\" by Yeats. That impression was strengthened when I got to \"Only the centers matter: that is where the matter is. Somewhere there is/ A bright abyss.\" Yeats wrote, \"Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;/ Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.\" Like Yeats, you have deftly juxtaposed light and dark with images such as \"bright abyss\" and \"They wander alone, flying through the air sunlit particles.\" I like the description of planets as \"sunlit particles\" in space with the stars and \"busy novabodies.\" The word play on busy-bodies is a delight. There is so much here, and that is what makes great poetry.  Your introduction of the extended metaphor of farming in the third line of the third stanza, \"Immune to her harrow,\" gave me a different way of interpreting the final stanza in which you write \"She will never till all this sky;/ She can only/ Turn, and return, and return.\" Because tilling the soil requires \"turning\" the soil with a plow or harrow, I didn't see this in a reincarnative sense or the sense of persistence until death, but as the woman's compulsion to continue fretting with the dead things in her sky. There's an archaic meaning to \"harrow\" which means to \"descend into hell and bring back the souls of the righteous.\" If you intended that meaning as well as the farming one, then that third line of the third stanza is profound.  As Ian has suggested, the line \"They wander alone, flying through the air sunlit particles\" needs something. I suggest putting \"of\" between \"air\" and \"sunlit\": \"the air of sunlit particles.\"  All in all, this is an excellent poem and I enjoyed reading and thinking about it. again, thank you for sharing it and welcoming comments.
