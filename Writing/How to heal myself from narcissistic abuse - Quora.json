            "answer_text": "Okey i\u2019m going to sum it all up everything that you need to know and the process to move forward. Just follow the steps and you will break free. Early Stages of Relationship-Love Bombing symptoms: They portray themselves as victims, basically sharing all the sad stories that happened to them, how they got mistreated and abused by people, with this method they gain your sympathy and connect you even deeper to helping them, loving them and also trying to fix them.They are too good to be true.In the first conversations you connect deeply to them, basically they will mirror everything about your character traits, style, interests and it will feel basically like they are the closest person to you character from day 1.You are the best thing that happened to them ever, no one understands them as you do, they got abused by everyone else and you finally are their savior.The biggest red flag that the victims should be on the lookout for is Parental Neglect or childhood abuse, if they share those things with you, especially too soon, run for your life, it won't end up well for you.They will love bomb you, raise you on a pedesta, basically shower you with compliments, and every compliment or feeling you give to them they will answer back with more of the same. This is the stage where they hook you up to their validation, attention, adulation, and admiration.They are very interested in you, from the first few conversations, asking you everything about yourself, how your day was, basically they will give you an amount of abnormal attention early on, initiating the conversations first, talking to you for hours daily, they are gaining your trust in this phase and getting you hooked to the game.Unbearable mood swings, in one moment they are all lovely, the other moment they just go exploding on you, you feel like you are walking on eggshells due to their unpredictable mood swings, they are basically sucking and draining your energy alongside with your esteem.They cause drama out of the blue, since drama brings excitement and to see how much you are willing to tolerate and with how much they are able to get away with, they daily cause drama for no reason and then apologize telling you they were overthinking, basically you don\u2019t know what you are going to expect for the next moment, that\u2019s their manipulation technique to get you even more hooked to their game.They shower you with all attention, adulation, emotions, love, care, they are like babies they care way too much way to early, and expect you to answer back with the same things, that\u2019s the part where they try to connect you to their Empathy.Extremely sexual on the first meeting or conversation, they will try to hook you to their game with sexuality and if that does not work they will be emotional and lovely, they switch way too quick from manic to depressive state, basically today they will be sexual and tomorrow tell you off to see how much they can get away with, and how much you are going to insist for them to stay with you.Late Stages of Relationship-Devalue and Discard symptoms: All the attention, adulation, admiration, care is vanished they are cold and distant.Everything you do irritates them, even the jokes that they used to laugh at, or the things that you enjoyed together.You are never enough for anything that you do, they keep dropping sarcasm on every sentence.They get bored with you, since they possess no Empathy and a really low boredom tolerance level.You see their true face after 2\u20133 months, that everything was an act from them, the person that you thought they were does not exist, it\u2019s an illusion presented by them, their mask or facade drops off since acting takes lots of energy from them.They start to devalue after the love bombing.You feel like you are walking on eggshells, you want their attention, love and care and they withhold their feelings, they withhold everything, you try to search for answers they don\u2019t give you any clear answers, just dull and cold answers, never initiating the contact first, lies flying all over your face, they tell you they are bored, every time you ask for answers, you will get none, you are getting tired losing energy, you don\u2019t know what to expect from this relationship, all the thoughts going on in your head you want some kind of closure, where they give you as little to hang in there.When you try to raise an opinion or ask the relationship to be a two way street, asking them why they changed, or where is the old person you once knew, calling them on their actions and lies, they refuse everything, further manipulating you with methods like:1. Gaslighting: basically refusing everything that you are saying, they would slap you today and tomorrow tell you they didn\u2019t do it, since they know that you wont leave easy they have tested you and your patience, and they know you got a deep connection to them with empathy, they make you doubt yourself and your vision.2. Stone Walling: You ask a question about where are their feelings, she switches the topic and never answers, you ask a question about what they feel, they tell you they do not know, you never get a straight answer.3. Silent Treatments: Every time you call them on their actions this is the cruelest method that they can use,they basically vanish or give you the ghosting or the cold shoulder,they vanish for days,weeks,months,years by answering none of your calls or messages,you don\u2019t know what in the heck happened everything seemed so good,the silent treatment time increases much more when you call them on their actions and ask them for their empathy,you will feel ignored,shattered,in pain,in sorrow etc,then just when you try to move on with your life they re-appear like nothing happened and pick up the things where you left them off even doe if they went off for months or years,With this technique they will escape any responsibility for their actions,ignorance is their biggest weapon-They are giving you a message of:My dear object if you dare to call me on my actions-lies-manipulations i will give you my silence because you don\u2019t deserve my words,since you are a simple toy to me,i played you from day 1 and if you dare to rebel or see through that mask i will ignore you,because i know i\u2019m lying,i\u2019m manipulating,i just simply don\u2019t care because you are my possession and my object,you always were,you let me walk away with all that,so you are going to allow me to walk away once again like back in the time\u2019\u20194. Projection: Basically when you try to rise up your opinion they switch the blame to you playing the victim card telling you that you are overthinking stuff even though you are sure 100% they did that thing and you end up apologizing to them for the things you never did,because they know deep down inside how much they abuse you no matter what they do you will always stay,they are sure of it because they have tested you early on.What is the reality for the Narcissist. They are your typical Con Artists who received:Emotional Neglect,Childhood Trauma,Emotional Abuse from their parents their whole life.They daily feel internal insecurities,internal conflict,they feel emptiness,they have the void,they see the black hole,they feel worthless no matter what they do etc.The whole childhood abuse caused them lack of Empathy because they were never loved,respected,valued,appreciated from their parents to begin with.They are unable to love anyone including themselves,they hate themselves so that answers all of your question.If someone constantly hates himself/herself so much he will never be able to love someone else.And if you love him/her you are basically a loser because no one can love them because they feel like they always failed in life,that\u2019s their typical mentality.To ease their internal insecurities they manipulate the whole people around them by a fake persona basically faking everything about themselves and presenting to the public a perfect image of a caring,lovely,charming character.While they manipulate the crowd they gather up Admiration,Attention,Adulation,Validation basically to regulate their self esteem which is a temporary fix.No matter what they are your typical wounded child who never grew up emotionally,their emotional level is stuck at their childhood trauma period with one word the period of abuse.With all being said no matter how good the source of supply is they will sooner or later get bored since they possess a really low boredom tolerance level.They tend to hit on victims that possess high levels of Empathy or Empaths,because they are vulnerable and they are easy to be charmed and manipulated.Before the LB-DV-DI process they will start to test the new victim causing drama out of the blue,since drama bring excitement and everything that\u2019s new is exciting.They will cause drama out of the blue and see with how much they are able to walk away,if you leave them walk away with everything that gives them the green light that you possess high levels of empathy and you are a long term source of supply however if you resist their attempts they will discard you early on and move to the next source of supply.They are your typical druggies searching for Fuel aka their fix.If you passed their whole tests the cycle starts.They follow a predictable relationship pattern of LB-DV-DI.LB-rising the victim on the pedestal making him her feel special,telling them all the stuff they need to her while they mirror the victim aka shape shifting to the victims character traits or copying the victim,with one word making the victim fall in love with themselves.This is the closest the NPD will ever get to feel love,Idealization aka Love Bombing is a form of infatuation or obsession with their possession in this case the victim,they are obssessed with their new doll or object they want that so bad.A NPD enters the relationship to fill his/er void pulling all the weight to the shoulders of the victim with one word.They seek for the impossible basically wanting the other people to fix them or fill their emptiness. No matter what others do they will never be able to fill that emptiness because the problem is them not the other people around.After a period of time the void will be back in and they will start to think as maybe the new victim was not special after all since the void is still there,basically the boredom starts to kick in and they will start to Devalue,once the Devalue starts there is no turning back.Devalue-Basically it can happen gradually or suddenly when they get bored or called on their actions,once they start to devalue they start to groom new sources of supplies switching all their energy and time to someone else since it takes them a lot to manipulate new people,it\u2019s a whole new different challenge especially the people that are careful with sharing their empathy.They will pull back and suddenly switch all the attention from you to someone else.The victim will be left in vain not knowing what happened,what did they do,how it happened etc.The victim starts to search for answers they will totally or completely ignore the victims attempts further more manipulating the victim with methods like:Gaslighting-Basically when the victim calls them on their actions they will totally deny their actions taking no responsibility and telling the victim that they are going crazy and they never did tho\u2019s actions:They would slap you today and tell you tomorrow they never did it the victim will basically apologize for the things that they never did.Why is it easy to Gaslighten?Because they have tested you early on threatening you that they are going to leave with one word and you stood by their side,you showed them in one way or another that you won\u2019t leave easy no matter what and that you are going to keep fighting for that person. So once they start to gaslighten they won\u2019t have a problem with it because no matter what they do you will just suck it up and continue to stay by their side and you will fight for them even if it means losing your whole dignity to them.With one word they are using your vulnerabilities as a weakness and trying to turn you into Lunacy with their games and enjoying it to the fullest.Once the devalue starts to kick is you have been already replaced they never discard they will shelf you,being replaced means that the new victim is feeding them Positive Fuel and Excitement while you are the boring guy or the side kick,they won\u2019t ignore you completely they will give you as little as possible to hang in there since you will start to search for answers and you will feed them Fuel with any Positive/Negative reaction they will feel important.Silent Treatments-They like to combine gaslightening with silent treatments with one word.Once they are called on their actions they will basically neutralize your attempts giving you the prolonged silent treatments since they already know that you are aware of whats going on.With this they are giving you a simple message of\u2019\u2019My dear object if you dare to stand up for yourself i will give you my silence and withhold everything that feel\u2019t good on the love bombing phase including:Love,care,affection,attention,value,respect,appreciation etc.Their silence will increase the more the victim calls them on their actions and the more they start to search for answers.The more the victim craves for a closure the less that they are going to give it to them and the more the victim starts to crave for answers the less they are going to give that to the victim.They will never give you a closure or answers because you are an object and you don\u2019t deserve them and they know deep down inside that if they confuse you,you will with one word search more for answers and you will feed them more Fuel and they will finally feel important belittling you,that shows how insecure tho\u2019s individuals are.Projection-Another manipulation technique they will basically project their whole insecurities to you telling you that you are overthinking etc and you are going lunacy.You will end up apologizing profusely for calling them on their actions.Stone Wall-It\u2019s a technique used by Sociopaths also the NPDS like to use it a lot with one word once they get asked for a specific question for ex:Do you still feel what you feel\u2019t before?Do you have feelings,what happened what changed?They will immediately change the topic or switch the topic to something else leaving you even more confused you will never get answers.Emotional Withholds-They will withhold emotionally every time they get called on their actions basically to punish you while you are craving for their attention,affection,love,care etc.Why is it so hard for the victim to move forward? They got you addicted to their attention,love,care,validation,while they fooled you or manipulated you,where you thought they genuinely feel\u2019t for you.Your whole self worth,self esteem,self respect,self value,self love is dependent on them,from the abuse they put you through.They are the bad friend to you who gets a good friend addicted to drugs,you are having severe withdrawal symptoms while they are withholding everything that feel\u2019t good for you including:emotions,attention,love,care etc.Your self esteem is shattered from the abuse that they put you through.You doubt your own vision,your sanity,your abilities,your beauty, your character from the trauma that they put you through manipulating with gaslighting,stone walling,emotional withholds,emotional blackmail,grooming,projections,mirroring etc etcIt happened so fast and suddenly you are confused and you don\u2019t know what happened,you didn\u2019t see it coming you were flying high on Cloud 9 while they suddenly dropped you on the ground when you didn\u2019t expect it.You can\u2019t accept the fact that they fooled you or manipulated you since day 1,it\u2019s a really hard to swallow pill.You have mixed feelings of anger and love for him you can\u2019t difference whats going on.There is hope inside of you that they will see their mistakes and change,you believe that the love that you are giving him is stronger then anything and you can change them and overcome this madness,you are basically reflecting your own emotions of sorrow,sadness,anger,grief.You loved this person genuinely and feelt for him from the deepth of your heart while they never loved you neither cared about you,all they cared about was what they could gain from you basically NS(Any form of admiration,attention,validation,adulation).There is a battle going on with your mind and body,trying to make sense of what happened,and you can never find the answers,because they make no sense at all.They never provided you closure,because they know how much effect that have in your life,so they wanna confuse you further more,or leave the option to Hoover themselves back in when they feel like.You let them surpass all your boundaries,you did whatever they asked you to do,you were the sweetest person on the planet,this caused you to shatter your self love,self esteem,self respect,self value and self care,you don\u2019t possess anymore your old character you are just a shadow hidding in their back.If you head a chance to show them how much you love them,you would have even ripped your heart off for that person,while they never cared.You are surrounding yourself with questions like:Did he really loved me?Did i mean anything to him?How easy it was for him to move on like nothing happened,after all tho\u2019s things that we head together and after all tho\u2019s promises?Is it my fault?What could i have done differently?What does the other person possess more then i do that they are in the relationship with the NPD?Do i look that terrible,i mean if i head done my best they would have still been with me in the relationship right?What did i do wrong?The answer to all of your questions is simple NO,you didn\u2019t do anything wrong,you have to know that you are dealing with an immature kid at the end of the day,who never grew up emotionally because of the childhood trauma they head,they don\u2019t possess any Empathy,they can\u2019t connect to people neither love them,since they have no idea what Love even means,so you have to convince yourself that you are the mature person and you have to walk away from them,you don\u2019t need to fix anyone neither help anyone so they can love you,it\u2019s not your job,you don\u2019t either need toxic people in your life,you need someone stable who is stable with their feelings and accepts you the way you are,you don\u2019t neither need to punish them,because they are already punished by life,it\u2019s immature to seek revenge from a kid. HOW TO MOVE FORWARD? Accept the fact that you got fooled and manipulated.Accept the fact that the person never loved you,cared about you,respected you or valued you.Accept the fact that you never loved him,but you loved his mask or facade an illusion that he presented to you since day 1.Accept the fact that you did your best and no one could have done better the problem is them not you.Accept the fact that you deserve better,because you are human and you have rights not a monkey on their harem.Start regaining everything back by working on yourself,otherwise no one will do that for you,if you don\u2019t bring yourself up no one will be able to bring you up.Take it as you are on a drug abuse rehab,the moment you give up to your feelings you are back to square 1,and all the effort will be gone and vanished while you are half way to get clean and sober.Accept the fact that you don\u2019t need revenge,because that would only hurt you not them,revenge will make you no different then they are,with that they would turn you to them,soul sucking vampires,accept the fact that you are the mature person in here.Go out distract yourself have a wonderful time,listen to some rock n roll go crazy,and forget about them for your own sake and sanity.Go full No Contact cutting everything from them including social media and number,feel blessed that it ended and God saved you on the right moment from this person,it could have been much worst and they could have hurt you even more.God gives us the people that we need not the ones that we want,this was the most difficult test that he gave you,and if he removed this person from your life he head a strong reason behind that,accept the fact that what comes from God is always welcomed,and you don\u2019t posses the strength to question his decision neither change his decision,he will give you the right person when you last to none expect it,have some faith and believe.THE LESSONS YOU SHOULD LEARN FROM THIS EXPERIENCE: Do not trust people easily,it takes a really long time to trust someone.Do not empathize with everyone,be smart to share your empathy with the right people.Being nice to people is good,but that does not mean you should be someones doormat so they can abuse you.Do not allow anyone to abuse you in any way,if they do you walk away without confrontations,because they ain\u2019t worth of your kindness or energy.If someone cheats or lies walk away without a single thought do not hope,because if they do it once they will do it again,live by a rule of:Fool me once shame on you,fool me twice shame on me.Learn to judge people from their actions not their background or personality disorders or words,who cares if he has BPD,ASPD,NPD or Psychopathy,you ain\u2019t no one to help no one you are not a professional psychologist neither a psychiatrist,even they lack helping them neither an Angel from God or Mother Mary.Learn to help yourself firstly then people,if you don\u2019t love yourself respect yourself or value yourself you can\u2019t love no one else period.Learn to walk away from Toxic People,because life experiences help us grow as characters and make us mature individuals.Learn that no one can hurt you as soon as you don\u2019t allow them to,it\u2019s on your hand not theirs.Give people what they deserve,if they treat you like shit you answer back with the same things.Do not try to make sense of the none sense,do not drop yourself low enough to understand people with personality disorders,they will drag you to their level and turn you to lunacy,do not overthink just live for the moment.Blame yourself and apologize to yourself profusely for letting that person abuse you,he does not deserve an apology from you,your inner self does.Do not try to ask Empathy from a Predator ever,It\u2019s like walking with your both legs on a Wolf Lair and expecting them to understand you while you beg,cling,plead for the Predators empathy asking him to love you and never hurt you,Will he be able to understand tho\u2019s things,start asking yourself?If you do walk on that lair,i would blame you not the wolves,because you are an easy prey,it\u2019s a cruel world out there if you act weak or vulnerable to predators they will hurt you and care less,and you are the one to blame.Learn to look at things how they are,not how you want them to be,learn when you are dealing with predators to think with your head not with your emotions or feelings,knowing the truth and acting with feelings that\u2019s stupidity,Basically your mind is clouded by your heart and you can\u2019t see neither difference whats real and whats not,that\u2019s a big no,when your dealing with people that have no clue what Empathy means.How do you hurt a narcissist? Do not take any revenge at all,let them be who they are,because taking revenge from an immature kid makes you as narcissistic as they are.Walk away from them completely,going full No Contact(cutting everything off including their number and social media networks).Do not allow them to contact you on anything,because they know your weaknesses no matter what they will manipulate you again and drag you to the game,if they manipulated you since day 1 they will again do it no problem.If you see them on the road,the are Lord Voldemort to you,they don\u2019t exist on your dictionary,they are dead people thin air to you,ignore them completely and walk away.If you allowed the option for them to Hoover and they already did,ignore them completely,that will drive them mad,when you ignore them you don\u2019t do it to get them mad but you do it for your own good and safety.Do not,beg,plead for them to take you back,apologize to yourself profusely for letting them abuse you,you deserve self love,self respect,self value.Be the mature one to learn to walk away from toxic people in your life,no matter how hard it is you should learn that.You are no one to save them,neither help them or change them,we have professionals to do that thing,and you ain\u2019t one.You say i love him,you should always remember that mature love is built on respect,value,care and love,not codependency and rescuing people so they can love you,you ain\u2019t mother Mary neither an Angel from God to rescue someone,if it means you will ruin your whole life and be enslaved to them.Make peace with your inner self and mind,convince yourself that you got lied and manipulated,the person you knew never existed it was just an illusion presented by them.Fight with your inner self no matter how bad you try to take revenge stop yourself,because the revenge will only hurt you not them,they possess no Empathy neither do they care,the revenge will turn you to a terrible person someone that you are not basically to them,leave them be because they are immature kids,you can\u2019t take revenge from a kid that slapped you,because that makes you as narcissistic as them and as immature as them.Do not trust them on any occasion,they are Con Artists even if they promise they will change,because they wont,a person that lied you once and manipulated you once will always do it no matter what.Go outside spend time with your friends,enjoy your life that\u2019s the best revenge that you can give them,basically not caring at all,showing them that you can continue without them,and showing them that you took your life back,you got successful with your life,you are an independent person standing on your legs,and your whole self worth ain\u2019t dependent on them,life is too beautiful and short to feed yourself with hate or revenge for someone(no matter what they did,because it shows immaturity).Convince yourself that they ain\u2019t your friends,neither an enemy to deserve an revenge from you,you don\u2019t give revenge to someone that has no value on your eyes,you don\u2019t take revenge from thin air,because they ain\u2019t worth of your energy neither of your valuable time.Learn to love yourself again,taking your esteem back,include yourself with positive people who make you laugh and spend the best time of your life with them.Always follow up this code in life,if someone breaks your trust once they will always do it,you leave without arguing or confronting when they do,always follow up this quote\u2019\u2019Fool me once shame on you,fool me twice shame on me.You will go through hard withdrawal symptoms,you will burn your brain and body seeking revenge that\u2019s normal,do not give up,do not give yourself up,take it as you are in a rehab,because if you do they will win,if you learn to walk away\u2019\u2019They might have won a few battles but you will win the war in the end\u2019\u2019Stay blessed because good things are waiting for you on the future,God gives us the people that we need not the ones that we want,if he removed this toxic person from your life he knew why he did it,what comes from God always remember that is most welcomed,if you go against his will you will hurt yourself and no one else.Learn to never share your Empathy with the wrong people,being nice to someone that deserves it is cool,but that does not mean that you should be someones doormat,give people what they deserve if they don\u2019t deserve your words you feed them your silence.Once you disconnect form this person once and for all you take everything back,his/her hoover will be not welcomed at all,you will learn that you did yourself a big favor and that was the best decision you took for your life,you will learn that God blessed you with the most difficult test in your life and you passed it without a problem,you will come back in here,being surprised laughing your ass off telling me that i can\u2019t believe i wasted so much of my energy and time to take revenge from this worthless person,convince yourself that the best revenge that you will take from them is standing up for yourself and moving forward with your life,they don\u2019t deserve your anything,including your revenge.Why do Narcissists Run Away? Well a Narcissist is an immature kid trapped on that adult body and mindset who never grew up emotionally,they lack Empathy they can\u2019t love anyone including themselves because of the childhood trauma. So they trick the victim or charm the victim to receive NS(Narcissistic Supplies)which will ease their constant pain,emptiness and insecurities until they get bored and they start grooming other victims.A narcissist most likely will run away when the significant other starts to get serious about the relationship and asks them to make commitment,a kid is unable to make commitment not with that emotional level,asking a kid about commitment is like telling him/her to grow up lets say from 4 yo to hit 20 you will scare the kid and he/she is going to bail away. The narcissist is unable to love so they can\u2019t commit like normal individuals.The other case scenario might be that they got bored of you or you possess a threat to their safety so they will bail away before you open your mouth,refusing everything that they did and making you look like the crazy guy. How do you combat passive aggression from the Narcissist? By not combating it at all,that\u2019s the only way out. -When they give you their Silence or the so called Silent Treatment they are basically degrading you or giving you a message of\u2019\u2019You don\u2019t deserve my words so i will give you my silence.You my mere object if you dare to call me on my actions/lies/manipulations/boredom i will give you my silence and withhold everything that feel\u2019t good for you because i played you since day 1 i never loved you,cared about you,appreciated you as a human being,neither valued you. -They are expecting you to react in any way positive or negative any reaction from you would feed them fuel. So the only way out is not to play the game,because if you play their game,with their rules you will lose no matter what.Basically just go with their silence and move forward,move forward for your own good not to punish them when they come back Hoovering.You don\u2019t need to punish a immature wounded child who refuses to play because you confronted them with the reality,they are already punished.They are shallow immature individuals. -The passive aggression starts when you call them on their actions/lies/manipulations or when they simply get bored because they are unable to Empathize or feel anything genuinely they fake everything,so no matter how hard you try you will always fail. -They already found new supplies,new faces on the block,everything that\u2019s new for them is exciting while you are the old wounded toy who they sucked you dry.They crave on attention,adulation,admiration,validation(NS)and basically on Excitement and Drama.They simply got bored of you so they are keeping you as a back up the new supply feeds them high octane fuel while any positive/negative fuel from you would be always welcomed,they are keeping you there as an old object,confused,in pain,in sorrow. -So start asking yourself if someone totally ignores you and gives you their silence are they worth the chase?We need to learn to judge people from their actions,if they treat you like shit you have to answer back with the same things that\u2019s how this world works. -Just continue with your life find someone who really loves you the way you are,they fooled you and you already know who they are,just find the inner strength to move forward that\u2019s the only way out. -Find someone who considers you a priority not an option.You need to be a priority,and if someone considers you an option and is punishing you with their silence you need to move forward.Because that shows lack of love,appreciation,value,commitment,respect. Why does the Narcissist get jealous of the Victim? Let me tell you the difference between the Normal Individuals jealousy versus the Narcissists jealousy. The NPD gets jealous because he views you as his or her possession with one word object. So imagine a kid playing with his new toy and another kid trying to snipe his toy,he would start to attack the other kid and tear him apart just for that single toy,not because he loves the toy but because he feels that the toy is his possession and because the other kid wants it also.The normal or the emotionally mature individual who knows how to love,appreciate,value,respect,care about the significant other gets jealous because of the fear that they are going to lose their beloved one,because they love their significant other,they feel lucky that they have the significant other,they appreciate their significant other as a valuable person and as a perfect human being,they are connected to the significant other with their heart,emotions and Empathy.That is the normal jealousy of love in difference with the possessive jealousy of the Narcissist.A survivor is your perfect figure of success.All the survivors out there have my everlasting respect,survivors are warriors who entered the battlefield and fought to the last moment to get out alive from the battlefield,their scars are medal of honors.A warrior enters the battlefield to get out alive and unharmed his fire and will,will help him to achieve tho\u2019s things.Your survivor is not your typical coward who enters the battlefield to die and lose the battle or to give up early wrecking the whole army.The survivor knows that once he is in the middle of the battlefield he has 2 choices,1 to give himself up into the hands of enemy basically give up and 2 to fight to get our alive,because his comrades will need him,the giving up option does not exist in the dictionary of the survivor or warrior,he would die trying,because if he gives up he will not only lose the battle but he will also wreck his comrades.A true survivor knows how hard it is to win a battle but he will keep fighting no matter what.Only a true warrior will be able to walk away from tho\u2019s individuals and move forward from the pain that they have caused which is a really hard pain,a true warrior will move forward learning a lesson and getting himself everyday better,getting himself ready for the better things that will come in the future, for the light in the end of the tunnel.The people that observe from outside have no idea what survivors go through,to live tho\u2019s things and to observe tho\u2019s things is really different,to go through that agonizing pain no one will understand you without living tho\u2019s things.That\u2019s what differs a survivor from a coward,the ability to keep pushing and finding a way out to always staying alive,the ability to get himself up every time that life brings him down to his knees,while the coward gives up on the first obstacle escaping to suicidal things wrecking himself everyday until he is doomed.

            "answer_text": "Recovery from Narcissistic Abuse involves Rediscovering Who You Are at the Core. Shifting an almost addictive focus from the horrific actions, punishing venom, and heinous behavior of the abusive other back to the one who matters in this equation: You. Your Choices. Your Life. You at the Core. After the dizzying confusion, gut-wrenching reality, and the harsh realizations that come crashing down on us at the end of the toxic relationship, we need time to be validated and make sense of what happened. I know for myself I meticulously studied narcissists, psychopaths/sociopaths and abusers. I did this all to make some kind of sense of and come to some understanding of what happened to me. At some point, however, it is critical to move away from the focus on the explanations for the horrific actions of the toxic partner and put our energy into the determined work and focus that is required to heal ourselves. It is critical to peel back and make changes to our thinking and our behavior so we don\u2019t get ourselves involved with another toxic charlatan again. After a controlling, toxic relationship, we all want to trust ourselves and our decisions again. When we start discovering who we really are and what we really want, we can step out of toxic patterns and get ourselves out of those hopeless feelings of stuck. This takes incredible strength. Having the guts to examine ourselves, our patterns, and our habits of being, is transformational, but it is hard. Many times it isn\u2019t very pleasant. We can begin to set goals that are in concordance with OUR wants and needs and become more awake and aware of our thoughts, our emotions, and our actions. The importance of no contact cannot be underestimated. It is critical. No contact, means no contact. No social media. No texting. No searching. No reading about him/her. No contacting the \u201cnew love interest\u201d. No \u201cthis is the last time I try to hold him/her accountable\u201d discussions. Limit or cease contact with others who are in contact with the abuser. It is hard. It is possible. Reevaluate your \u201cfriends\u201d. Support means support. You need folks in your corner. You need folks to listen, to empathize, to understand, and also to be there when you need the honest, compassionate truth. Sometimes the truth is hard to hear. Know who has your back. Limit or distance yourself from the friends who thrive on chaos. Begin to practice boundary setting and calm assertive communication. This difficult work requires the support of counselors, mentors, experts, and/or support groups. Healthy recovery includes the support of professional and trusted others. Practice radical self-care and limit self-soothing as much as possible. What\u2019s the difference? A yoga class versus a bottle of wine. Care enough for yourself to take action and move forward into your new life. Care enough to rediscover who you are. With all my warmest regards.
