            "answer_text": "Nope! In fact, popular Quorans are just like us, but with a particular penchant for writing. I've been noticed by popular Quorans before, even had some cool exchanges with them. Some notices are minor, as if they probably skimmed over my name (Sean Kernan accepting my edit requests, for example) but even those prove that they aren't obsessively saying, \"Did a popular Quoran do this? Yes? Must not acknowledge. Must not acknowledge.\" I have been noticed by: Aishah Hannan (She upvoted my answer. After she upvoted, it blew up, so I'm super grateful. I love her answers so it's nice to know she liked one of mine.) Allen Kinney (He responded to my message. I was tragically uneducated about the SHAK \u2014 a really cool community, by the way, y'all should check it out \u2014 and he educated me. Pretty cool.) Gigi J Wolf (We had a pretty interesting exchange about one of my answers. She brought a second opinion to the table, something I hadn't even considered. So thanks.) User-11238777555976271851 (She upvoted my comment on her answer. I'm guessing it was only because I was early, but it's still awesome.) Naima Naji (She upvoted my comment on her answer. I didn't really deserve it because I was being a sarcastic asshole, but it made me smile.) I love all of those Quorans so to have them notice me was great \u2014 and, if you click on my profile, you see I really don't have many followers at all. But despite my excitement when I saw the notifications, I've begun to understand; they're just like us. They're all cool people, but they're people. Not aliens. (I don't know about you, but I'd be pretty damn excited if I got noticed by an ALIEN.) Anyway, I kinda got distracted. Point is, they're people. You don't have to rise to a stardom on a obscure Q&A website to be noticed. They notice everyone, no matter how followers you have, or whether or not you're Top Writer 1982. You'll probably be noticed too, someday. But there's no need for some huge panic at the disco when you are.  Edit: Isn't it ironic that THIS answer gets upvoted by a popular Quoran? AND I sound like a hypocrite because I'm getting excited over this, even though I told y'all not to. I stand by what I said, but it's still cool to know that someone so talented has shown a little (for lack of a better word) appreciation for me, a less talented being. I can see where y'all are coming from now when you freak out over getting noticed by a popular Quoran. Thanks, Jordan Yates. I love your answers, and it made me smile to know you liked this one. It's a fever I can't sweat out. OK, OK, I'll cool it with the emo band references.  Edit: TWO popular Quorans. Damnnnn. Irony. Thanks, User-11238777555976271851. I'ma stop editing now because I feel like one of those \"edit: WOW 1 upvote thx so much xxxxx\" people, and I do NOT want to become one of them. It bugs me. Call me a hypocrite (this whole answer already proves I am), because I am one, but it bugs me. Peace out. ",

            "answer_text": "Sayani Banerjee thanks for the A2A. First of all I really don\u2019t know what qualifies someone as popular, and someone as not. For instance someone with a 100k followers may not think that someone with a 5k following is popular enough, but someone with a 200 following will think they are. It\u2019s all relative to say the least. To be honest, I read whatever answer that comes on my feed. If I like it, I upvote it. If I really like it, I check the poster\u2019s profile. If I like more of their answers, I follow them. Additionally I also see who follows me, try to check as many profiles as I can, and follow whoever I think writes amazing answers. That\u2019s pretty much how I roll on Quora. Sure, there are a couple of Quorans I follow with a 100k strong following, but that\u2019s just because I love their writing. There are also a ton of other Quorans with a Crazy following, but I\u2019m not particularly fans of their writing so I don\u2019t follow them. It\u2019s really that simple for me. I follow people who I really like, or whose writings I really like. ",

The most interesting Quorans write well about their own topic ranges. They appear to follow others who do the same. That will eventually create a certain overlap.
