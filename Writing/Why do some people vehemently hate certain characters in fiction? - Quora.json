            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure why this is even a question. Characters are always a matter of preference, so people would often find characters that they vehemently hate. Maybe because they\u2019re evil or because they\u2019re simply annoying. Or maybe they did the absolute worst deeds that no person could comprehend. But I do have a special reason for hating a certain character:  Futaba Sakura With a case of social anxiety bordering on agoraphobia, Futaba is strongly discomfited by going outside. When the player first meets her, she is a hikikomori who does not attend school and almost never leaves her room. She communicates with the world remotely via the Internet. Having disconnected herself from humanity and the world beyond her apartment, Futaba is lonely, lives without passion and enthusiasm, suffers from suicidal depression, and questions the point in her living. When first encountered, Futaba is so consumed with self-loathing that she suppresses her desire to live. Futaba plays video games and watches anime as a means of fantasy, escapism and to help cope with her depression, but even then, this activity is starting to grow mundane and repetitive to her. Now some of you Persona fans are wondering why I hate Futaba. Is it because she\u2019s a shut-in with no life? Actually, yes! Futaba in reality, reminds me of myself. A lot. Seeing Futaba act out in this story was almost like looking at a mirror. But that was it. I hated a character that resembled my personality because it gives me a good look at my most major flaws that I have often suppressed. Futaba is the person that I never wanted to be but somehow ended up being. It\u2019s sad really. I hate a character because that character reminded me of myself. It\u2019s almost self-loathing at this point. ",

            "answer_text": "In short, people hate some fictional characters, because some fictional characters were created to be hated. Let\u2019s take a look at a very hated character from the Harry Potter series: Dolores Jane Umbridge.  (Isn\u2019t that just the face of pure evil?) Dolores Umbridge is created to give the students of Hogwarts a common enemy so they create the private DADA(Defense Against the Dark Arts) classes, and in turn, the Dumbledore\u2019s Army. She is the only character, besides Voldemort, to have left a permanent scar on Harry. She is universally hated, because she was written that way. You may be thinking, what about Jar Jar Binks? I\u2019m getting to him  (As I was looking for this photo on Google, I found out that Palpatine\u2019s first name was Sheev) Well, we knew it would come to this. He is a clumsy-as-all-hell Gungan, and is more hated than Umbridge. People hate him because they think he is stupid and a pointless auxiliary character, because he was written either to be an absolute idiot, or as some theorize, an incredibly intelligent Sith Lord. But he is hated by nearly everyone. ",
