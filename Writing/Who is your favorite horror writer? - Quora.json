            "answer_text": " Stephen King, with no hesitation or a shadow of a doubt. You see, I grew up in Bangor, Maine, and went to school with Owen King, Stephen's youngest son, for over twelve years, and was also on his Little League team. Although I wasn't one of his best friends, we had classes together, and socialized from time to time. For the past 40+ years, his father Stephen, has been a permanent fixture in Bangor, and you'll note that parts of many of his books are based on real life places in and around Bangor. His large red Victorian home with the wrought-iron bat-adorned tops, is a fixture on West Broadway, amongst the homes of the city's select few surgeon and lawyers. It's striking, if you stop to look, but apart from the conspicuous eccentricities, you'd never know this was the home of the wealthiest writer and most celebrated horror author living today.  When I was younger, I had the pleasure of being a guest at the King home, experienced their hospitality, and probably like many, consider the King's friendly acquaintances. Stephen and Tabitha King have been more than generous to our grateful city, donating huge sums to help renovate our library and build a state of the art baseball field, playground, and public swimming pool, as well as owning and operating one of Bangor's premiere rock 'n roll radio stations. They have also contributed to the local professional theatre, and this past year, Stephen worked with the theatre to open the Bangor premiere of his newest stage show, The Ghost Brothers of Darkland County, a musical collaboration with John Mellencamp & T Bone Burnett's Supernatural. Although Stephen spends most of his time in Florida, these days, his heart is still in Maine, and we are proud that most of his famous works were written in that study of his, in the big red house, on West Broadway, Bangor, Maine. As for me, I started out young, reading Carrie and Cujo, before moving on to Pet Semetary, The Shining, and It. Then came Thinner, Misery, and Nightshift. I have to admit, that I have never read any of his large series of novels, such as The Stand or The Dark Tower series. There's still much to read. As a child actor, it was the Stephen King films that were filmed locally, which gave me my first opportunity to act in movies. My first one was Pet Semetary, but I was also in The Langoliers and Graveyard Shift.  Some of my favorite movies of all time are adapted from Stephen King books, novellas, and short stories. Some include: Misery, It, The Shining, The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, Carrie, Pet Sematary, and The Running Man. All my life, Stephen King has been there -- scaring me and providing for me, and all my life, watching over the town we both call home.    For those favorite horror writers I don't know, my top five list would be: Edgar Allan PoeH.P. LovecraftNeil GaimanRay BradburyMary Shelley/ Bram Stoker*Several write in various genres, and couldn't strictly be called 'horror writers' ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, this is an easy once. Algernon Blackwood. Do you remember that mediocre movie, the Blair Witch Project? They took\u2026 I think it was 3\u2026 scenes directly from his novella The Willows. And his story The Man Whom the Trees Loved creeps the F out of me to this day.  Arthur Machen. I\u2019m not sure what my favorite story by him is. Maybe it\u2019s the one where animals rise up and fight back against the people who eat and mistreat them. 25 years before \u2018veganism\u2019 was invented, that\u2019s pretty cool. I think it was called The Terror. But I think he\u2019s most famous for his twisted sexual writings\u2026 never anything graphic, I had too much style to be crude\u2026 but his story The White People tells a strong tale of what happens to someone who is sexually abused as a child. He does it through weird woodland fairies. The Great God Pan is another wonderful story.  Now, this one is kinda a cop out, but I also like Edgar Allen Poe. To be honest, I really didn\u2019t at first. Then I read Ligea. This is probably one of the most multi-dimensional stories I have ever read. It could be a ghost story. It could be a drug fueled dream. And it could be someone suffering from mental delusions. It works equally well on all three levels. Literature nerds out there\u2026 you know how sometimes it just \u2018strikes you\u2019 and you \u2018get it?\u2019 I can remember the exact moment\u2026 where I was and who I was with\u2026 when I decided Edgar Allen Poe was awesome.  You\u2019ll notice a trend here. I like the old stuff. Don\u2019t even ask me about Stephen King. After all, I\u2019m a Christian and try not to say bad things about others. Richard Matheson was cool. He kinda invented the zombie genre, even if he did so with vampires. Judge all you want, he was a trail breaker in the apocalypse.  H.P. Lovecraft is another of my favorites. Have you read At the Mountains of Madness? Six foot tall penguins\u2026 what kind of mind creates that image? Giant evil gel cubes in tunnels?  I\u2019m not sure who are the popular horror authors of the day. I\u2019m old school. I don\u2019t really get into 12 year olds having sex in a sewer. I leave that for pedo perves. But horror\u2026 or weird tales and ghost stories\u2026 have a rich history. ",
