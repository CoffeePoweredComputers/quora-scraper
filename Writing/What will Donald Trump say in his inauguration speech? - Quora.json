            "answer_text": "\u201cVice President Biden, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Obama, Vice President Pence, Reverend Clergy, and the ten citizens who weren\u2019t paid to show up to acknowledge my landslide, historic victory in an election that was clearly rigged in my opponent\u2019s favor: We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration--symbolizing an end as well as a beginning--signifying renewal as well as change. For I have sworn before you and the Almighty God in whom I don\u2019t really believe and who may smite the lie from my lips with a bolt of lightning at any moment, the same solemn oath our forbears prescribed nearly two and a half centuries ago. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in the twentieth century, humiliated by terrorism, disciplined by a hard and bitter unraveling of the middle class, ignorant of our ancient heritage\u2014and willing to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed\u2014let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of myself and my cronies in The Global Swamp. We are gathered here to honor the hallowed traditions of American democracy, which now include threatening journalists and political opponents; attempting to delegitimize the courts and the intelligence community; inciting violence; marginalizing and attacking minorities, publicly boasting of sexual assault and the size of one\u2019s genitals, and threatening to violate or revoke the civil liberties enshrined in our beloved Constitution. Now we are on the precipice of a great civil war, testing whether this nation or any other nation faced with significant economic inequality can long endure in the face of authoritarian government wedded to corporate economic power. Stay tuned. With malice toward none except those who oppose me, and charity toward all except the disabled, veterans, women, minorities, losers, and the uninsured, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for me, Vladimir Putin, and all the alligators in The Global Swamp. Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their party, unless of course their party endorses a protofascist for President, in which case, they may change their mind, and then recant and fall in line when it suits them. I\u2019d especially like to give a shout out to John McCain and Paul Ryan, who found they could swallow their scruples and hand their balls to the Republican Party after all. I\u2019d like to thank the American public school system, which for the last fifty years has failed to teach consumer math, civics, reading, critical thinking, world history, and current events. Thanks to my wonderful family: my wife Melania, the good kind of illegal immigrant, who has treated us to the vision of her bare backside and is publicly on record reassuring the public that I am \u201cnot Hitler;\u201d my lovely daughter Ivanka, who is the beauty and brains of the whole operation, except on Saturdays when she\u2019s not paying attention; and my son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has his eye out for the main chance and has forgotten his family history and remembered the lessons of the Weimar Republic. Thanks to all of them for providing the sideshow to this circus, thereby diverting the populace from the finer points of my detailed policy proposal of \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d Thanks to Vladimir Putin, who has graciously agreed to accept influence in American democracy in consideration of the debts I owe to various Russian oligarchs and annointed me the first Manchurian Candidate. Thanks to Hillary Clinton who wasn\u2019t really the crook I made her out to be, the American people who drank the Koolaid, and the American liberals who misjudged the campaign. Thanks to FBI Director Comey, who did everything in his power to ensure that Hillary Clinton suffered under the canard that \u201cthere were more significant emails.\u201d Thanks to the America mainstream media who made fun of me and gave me free coverage for years, until it wasn\u2019t funny anymore and it was too late. Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me, unless it\u2019s Alex Baldwin on SNL, Meryl Streep, or CNN, in which case, I know you are overrated and a loser, but what am I? Neener, neener, neener. \u201cShave and a haircut, two bits!\u201d ",

It\u2019s what the man does best. Those may be the only two complete sentences in his whole speech. I\u2019ll get a transcript and do a count. I\u2019ll be too busy laughing at him during his speech. Obama will be gracious and I feel sorry for him having to hand over the presidency to a man such as Trump. He will do so with great dignity and should be honored for that. ",
