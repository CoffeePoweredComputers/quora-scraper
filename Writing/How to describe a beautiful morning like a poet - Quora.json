            "answer_text": "The first signs of lightening of the skies, Into a pale blue from a dark grey of the night, Is when the sun starts to peak, after the night, And the first chirps of the birds sound rather light, The sky turns pink at times & a pale red other times, Most mornings spent watching a rising sun bring about them smiles, And even when not, they bring along a hope of wading the remaining miles, Like a rising sun every single day, life is all about waking up & those tries, And most beginnings happen in the mornings, from waking up with a smile, And even when not, a morning frown can easily be turned into a smile by night, The fresh air of the mornings is meant to push away the heaviness of the night aside, Or to instill an aura to get you through the day like a joyride.
