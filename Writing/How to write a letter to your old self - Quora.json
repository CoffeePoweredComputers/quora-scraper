            "answer_text": "Dear Khristian. I'm you from the future. And if you don't believe me I know that you are scared of the sound of fans running at night. Well anyway we've been through so much together and I know that the age I'm sending this to is the age when you started feeling worse about yourself than before. Your parents told you to give up on your dreams, your siblings hate you, you are friendless, and it's Covid 19 so you have to be at home all the time. This is also the age where you had to wake up at 5am everyday Monday through Friday to do your virtual school work so at 9am you could teach your brother. I'm here to tell you it's gonna get 10x worse. Your dad's gonna switch out all your wardrobe to long shirts and long shirts. And mom and dad are going to argue loudly in front of everyone at a Tennessee Pizza Restaurant. BTW you get to go to Tennessee for Kobe's birthday. And your gonna ride the Tennessee tornado at Dollywood . Also you win a script writing contest and at the moment I'm not sure if we won the movie making part. I'm also here to tell you to stop apologizing for everything. And you have to work harder so that when if we walk across the stage and earn a Tony we can thank the people who stuck with us the whole ride. I promise it's gonna get better. It's not better for me right now but I hope it does so that you\u2026me\u2026we have something to look forward to. PS: I know your gonna ask and yes we still love Kurt from Glee and we are still working on theatre Bye Mini me ",
