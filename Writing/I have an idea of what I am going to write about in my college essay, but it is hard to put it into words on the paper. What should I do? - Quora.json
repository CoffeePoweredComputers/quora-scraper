            "answer_text": "Start by writing stuff that you know is not going to be The Essay. Start by just jotting down super casual notes in a notebook or on your computer, like a journal. Tell yourself that this is not For College. Because it isn't! It's not The Essay, and the big bad colleges are not peering down their nose at it, judging you for content and style and typos. No one else is going to see this. It's just you thinking about something, and scribbling down your thoughts for organizational purposes. It's for your eyes only.  If that's too much, then record yourself talking through it, and then play it back and type it out.  So there is no point in editing it while you are writing. You might have voices in your head saying \"this sucks\" or \"that sentence is lame\" or \"I dunno what I'm doing\". Those voices are poisonous demons infecting your brain. You are trying to build something, and they are essentially saying \"hey your building is unfinished and therefore currently sucks so tear it down.\" Nah. Ignore those demons. AFTER YOU HAVE COMPLETED WRITING SOMETHING, then read it, and organize it a bit. See what you think about it, at least structurally, and whether you successfully have some main point, and whether that main point is useful. If you need to toss it and start from scratch - do it.  Now at this point what you have is a Shitty First Draft. Yes, it is shitty, isn't it? All first drafts are shitty. That's not because you suck, it's because a final draft is the product of iterative improvements. So forgive yourself for that. No one writes a decent final draft the first time they write something. (Throughout high school you maybe, just maybe, possibly, could  have been fooling yourself into thinking that you can write a final draft or an almost-final draft the first time you write something. You might have even gotten A's on them. Yet in reality, in the context of real life, they were just Shitty First Drafts that you turned in and knew you'd probably get a decent grade on because you did before. Stakes are higher now though eh bruh?) GOOD JOB you now have a first draft. Now, walk away from it and go do something else. Then later come back to it and improve it. Then show it to someone you trust. Listen to their feedback - if it makes sense, incorporate it and make changes as necessary.  NOW you have a decent draft.  Take it to your college counselor at school and get feedback. Revise. Done. Good job. Alternatively - contact someone like me if you want professional support. ",

            "answer_text": "In my 30+ years in the editorial, publishing and printing lines, I've had many occasions to deal with people in the same situation. Some emergency measures for your consideration (assuming you have an idea for the essay already and your chief obstacle is in the writing up of it): If it's hard to write out, write an outline in bullet points and broken sentences but get the thing down first. You could always rework it later. When outlining, you could write the individual points on index cards as they occur to you. Afterwards, organise and reorganise until best fit is achieved. Then write out the thing in accordance. If it's hard to outline, diagram it. Draw a diagram (e.g. mindmap) so that you start off by writing descriptions of that diagram. You rework the text later. If it's hard to diagram, voice record it. Monologue your ideas and then transcribe. You might even record a dialogue with your collaborators and then transcribe it. You can rework the text later. Worth a shot for you, I think. ",
