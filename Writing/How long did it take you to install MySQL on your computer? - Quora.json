            "answer_text": "It took me about 30 seconds. I can\u2019t remember how long it took the laptop to then actually run the installation. That\u2019s because I run installations like this. docker run --name=mysql1 -p 3306:3306 -d mysql/mysql-server\u00a0And I find out the new root password like this: docker logs mysql1 2>&1 | grep GENERATED\u00a0.... shows a line like:\u00a0.... GENERATED ROOT PASSWORD: 0d5aSADEHaHEJYHk@N@pwaceJdOb\u00a0That\u2019s to say, for things like MySQL, I will always use Docker on a dev machine. I need to switch between versions of MySQL just enough that even if I could be bothered to work out how to install it \u201cnative\u201d, then it would be a world of pain. I\u2019d never have done that in the days of VMs\u2026 but containers really are an incredibly different experience from the perspective of performance on older hardware. I then connect to it like this: docker exec -it mysql1 /bin/mysql -uroot -p\u00a0Enter password: \u00a0... paste the password I saw earlier\u00a0And sure enough, I get: Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \\g.\u00a0Your MySQL connection id is 21\u00a0Server version: 8.0.19\u00a0Copyright (c) 2000, 2020, Oracle and/or its affiliates.
