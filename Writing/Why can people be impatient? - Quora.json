            "answer_text": "I\u2019m really impatient, it\u2019s mainly because I have some life goals which I want to achieve untill I\u2019ll be 25 (4 yrs from now). It\u2019s because I\u2019m kinda afraid of getting old and be pi***d off, because I worked all the time, when I was young and had to enjoy my life. There are two reasons why I work so hard. Because of making money as fast as possible and reduce amount of time which I need to spend in work. I\u2019m so lazy, so I don\u2019t want to work 8 hrs. every day, but I want to have enough money for me and my parents to enjoy. And this leads me to be impatient, because I want to have everything asap. I want my project to be done asap, I want sell my project asap, I want to have everything asap, so I can enjoy after it. And this made me so impatient about everything, not just about work, but about almost everything I do\u2026 This is just my reason to be impatient, of course everyone has their own behavior and someone is just swallowed by society, so I can\u2019t answer you objectively. Anyway I hope this helps you. :) ",
