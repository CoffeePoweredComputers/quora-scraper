            "answer_text": "That's a very interesting question. I've asked this myself a lot, I still ask the same question. Well there are many reason for that, one of the main reason is your audience. You might be writing about health or tech, but you'll notice that blogging niche blogs get more comments compared to any other niche. If you still don't get it, I'll explain. Usually we run blogs on WordPress, blogger or medium etc. The commenting system is not that simple, you've to write down your name, your email and your comment. So it's kinda like a thing to do (though it's not a big deal). But most people skip commenting when they face this. But it's a very good thing to measure, some people do comment after all this efforts and it's simply means that they wanted to convey something about your article and those comments matter. I think the main reason is audience, commenting efforts and content quality. More engaging content will surely get more comments, especially you'll see comments on facebook, why? Because it's as easy as typing and pressing enter (some lazy people find that hard). So it's okay. ",

            "answer_text": "Could be for a couple reasons. First, it depends on the size of your audience. The larger the audience the more likely you are to get comments. That\u2019s an obvious one, but something to consider. Second, your audience may not be the type that is most inclined to comment. They may be more reserved and thoughtful and not as quick to jump into conversations. Even online conversations. Third, the topic you\u2019re blogging about may not be as conversational. Or even as controversial and thus more passionate for your blog readers. Generally the more passionate people are about something the more likely they are to comment. Fourth, your writing style could play a role. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask for comments at the end of the post if you are looking for comments. And if you do get a comment make sure to reply to every single one. You could even jump into the comments asking for comments or to add additional comments. One last thing, don\u2019t get too wrapped up in comments. They\u2019re not necessarily something to track unless you\u2019re just looking for passionate engagement with your readers. A blogger could write on very polarizing topics just for the sake of getting comments, but going in that direction might not lead to the best blog. ",
