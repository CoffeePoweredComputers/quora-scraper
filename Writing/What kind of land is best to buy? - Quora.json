            "answer_text": "What kind of land is best to buy? The kind that best matches your needs. You want farmland? Buy farmland in the Midwest. You want a house in the mountains? Buy a lot in the mountains. You want something that will appreciate? Don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s usually too difficult to predict which way progress (and land prices) will move. Beyond that, you\u2019ll incur substantial holding costs, especially real estate taxes. You want to live there? Make sure the area is served by a sewer. If not, make sure the land percs. As you can see, the answer depends totally on what you\u2019re looking for. ",
