            "answer_text": "Before you find out how to avoid plagiarism using Turnitin, it\u2019s worth to know what it is and how it works. It\u2019s a professional anti-plagiarism tool that helps to detect the amount of originality or similarity to other apers in your own content. It works the same way as other plagiarism-prevention programs do. Although it\u2019s a very useful tool, there were lots of cases when students tried to cheat the system and beat Turnitin.  Here are some of the best ways that students used to cheat Turnitin and avoid plagiarism: Provide proper references to all of the sources you\u2019ve used in your research.This means that all material taken from another person\u2019s work should be quoted and accurately cited. In such a way no plagiarism checking tools will be able to detect any piracy and you won\u2019t feel guilty for stealing somebody\u2019s words. 2. Check your content for plagiarism on your own using another anti-plagiarism software before you use Turnitin. Since this program saves all of the documents you\u2019ve uploaded previously, there\u2019s a chance that you might even plagiarize yourself, so to avoid that, better utilize a couple of free plagiarism checkers to beat Turnitin.  3. Paraphrase. This is one of the most effective ways to avoid piracy but bear in mind that replacing only a few words with their synonyms will be still considered as an act of stealing somebody\u2019s words. 4. Ask for the professional help from experts providing online writing services. That is one of the easiest and fastest ways to get the job done, nevertheless, it\u2019s not a safe one. Your professor who is likely to know your writing style well may recognize that the work wasn\u2019t completed or rephrased by you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s better to do it on your own or ask somebody who is qualified enough to help you. 5. Change the letters in some words. This way is one of the riskiest ones so I wouldn\u2019t recommend you to do that. ",
