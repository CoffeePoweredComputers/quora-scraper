            "answer_text": "Tidal: An area of renewable energy that continues to struggle despite some good fundamentals. Run-of-river designs and other hydrokinetic technologies seem to be doing well, but not tidal for some reason. Enhanced Geothermal: Its an area that has been in development for a couple decades and struggles to take off. Fun-fact, it currently causes earthquakes in its nascent form. Non-Battery Storage: It is renewable\u2019s counterpoint. Pumped hydro, subterranean compressed air, are all implemented/developing areas of electrical storage Biofuel: This topic has been done to death if you are going to do algea (ie. don\u2019t). However, I think an interesting topic is urban fuel generation (restaurant oil, etc\u2026) vs. the intersection of hydrocarbon burning. There are many opportunities where we put these potential fuels to waste, and with little to no effort, we could turn and burn them for heat or electricity - offsetting a hydrcarbon. Electrification: This is the knock-on effect of renewables. If you want to decarbonize stuff, it doesn\u2019t help to generate with renewables and just keep that electricity isolated to the power sector. You need to electrify transportation, heating, cooling, etc\u2026. Godspeed. ",

            "answer_text": "Renewable energy is a very wide field, so there are endless topics for research. The first cluster is the energy generation, and within this cluster, the solar and wind converters are by far the most relevant technologies, due to the fact, that these energy streams are the biggest and so have the largest potential. Solar: cheap solar panels (e.g. glass with an absorbing surface)easy to install technologies (e.g. swimming artificial island)long time reliability (no degeneration of cell)high efficiency (today 20% is standard, 50% would reduce the land demand)Small land demand (e.g. space-based)Wind: cheap wind converters (e.g. sails)low environmental impact e.g. offshore (e.g. swimming systems)low maintenance costThe next cluster is about energy storage cheap storage technology (batteries with cheap raw material, just \u201cdirt\u201d)low environmental impact (no chemicals with environmental side effects)And the third cluster is about distribution: Low energy loss over a long distance (supra conductor)Invisible transmission (Underground, Tesla coil,\u2026)Every problem is a 1000 Billion question. Hope you can solve one of them. ",
