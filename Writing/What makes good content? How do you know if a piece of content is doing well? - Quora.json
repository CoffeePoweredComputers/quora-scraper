            "answer_text": "Content is a long-term game. The instant measuring metrics can only give you an indication if its received well depending on the content-type but the complete picture will only form in long-term. Here are the most important content metrics to measure your content performance: 1) Pageviews 2) Unique visitors 3) Returning visitors 4) Social shares 5) Avg time spent 6) Pages viewed per session 7) No of backlinks from external sources 8) Number of comments 9) Search engine ranking for targeted keyword Listed above are the basic metrics for every content type but depending on your content type, there can be additional metrics to determine your content performance. For example, for gated content like ebooks, whitepapers, and webinars, your focus should be on the no of email subscriptions, number of conversions, etc. It\u2019s very important to set your content goals beforehand and track the right metrics so that you can gauge how your content is performing. For example, if your focus is on brand awareness then you can\u2019t be judging your content based on page views alone. ",
