            "answer_text": "Do you believe in writing without fear? Yes, I believe passionately in writing without fear. Fear constricts. It constricts the blood vessels, the muscles, the mind and the emotions. It constricts creativity, imagination, memory, engagement, passion, and flow. Good writing cannot be done with fear, and it cannot be done in an atmosphere of censure. I learned this long ago. I started writing as a child, curled up on a chair in my room, pouring thoughts and feelings onto paper, things I was not allowed to express in my emotionally abusive dictatorial home. These writings were a means of connecting with that which was real and true and genuine within myself, a means of preserving that which was most precious and most worthy of preservation. I risked the danger of being caught expressing contraband thoughts and feelings, and I was caught and punished. But my need to write overcame my fear of being caught. In my teens and early twenties, I lost my connection to the blood and guts aspect of writing. Being real is the only way a child knows how to be. Later, I was self-conscious, as a writer, and in life, and I struggled to find \"my voice.\" I wrote in different styles, sending pieces off to magazines and collecting rejection letters, some complimentary, and ending with \"Please try us again.\" I got at least 10 of those from one editor at \"Redbook.\" I figured she must mean it. But what did she want? I searched books and magazines for that elusive element that separates good writing from sold writing. I eventually found two answers, one more critical than the other. The first, for which I don't recall whom to credit, is \"Write what you know.\" The second is from Erica Jong, a writer I didn't even personally enjoy: \"The only thing writing has to be is honest.\" That second thing--that is what all good writing is--honest. Felt. Spontaneous. Real. I was about 25 when I found this answer, which helped me not only with my writing but with my life. It put me back in touch with my genuine self. Over the years, as I connected to, and wrote from, my inner voice, I let go of fears and mores that had been instilled but were not really mine. I found that four-letter words rolled easily off the tongue of my inner voice. My inner self was a bit of a rogue, not the lady-like thing it had been told. My inner self was outraged by lies and hypocrisy, and manipulation and exploitation, and exhilarated by truth. I've had dry spells over the past 40 years. I was coming out of one when I found Quora. I was transported. A site wholly devoted to writing. Just writing. About anything. For everyone. With an audience of millions. I thought I had found Nirvana! Then I discovered that Quora operates in an atmosphere of censure in which \"policy\" is cited for \"violations\" but never explained. Which policy was violated? 99% of the time the writer (at least when the writer is me) violated no policy. We are able to \"appeal,\" but this is just a formality. There is no discussion. Are we not allowed to use four-letter words? No one knows. Are we not allowed to criticize public figures as is our First Amendment right? No one knows. Are we not allowed to express outrage and speak our hearts? No one knows. These issues are not addressed in \"policy.\" In actual practice, \"policy\" is applied unevenly to those blessed, and those cursed, by Quora moderation. Those blessed will come on Quora pontificating about how fair and righteous Quora moderation is. You know what I notice about those writers? Their writing is dull, poltically corrrect, formulaic, predictable, brown-nosey, and uninspired. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you\u00b4re doing. If you\u00b4re writing a fictional story, then maybe you can\u00b4t openly voice your beliefs. Maybe your protagonist has the exact opposite viewpoints of your own. But I do disagree with Mr. Eisenberg. He mentions that literary works would all near identical if we hid from the people that we truly are. I disagree. As cruel as it sounds, your actions, thoughts, and philosophies are largely dependent on the society that you grew up in. For example, some of my relatives in China don\u00b4t understand why for some people, person freedom is worth risking the lives of millions of people. That's not exactly their fault. In the United States, we are taught that we should appreciate individuality, that every freedom is equally important, and should be defended at all costs. We are also constantly told that our dignity is worth more than our lives. But not how the majority of the Chinese think. Many of my friends and relatives believe that it is right to save each life, even if it means giving up some of the basic freedoms. Contrary to public belief, if everyone voiced their own opinions, then the world would be more similar than different. Let me give you an example of someone who probably doesn\u2019t write without fear: Stephen King. One of King\u2019s best qualities is that he can write any character, no matter its gender, race, age, political belief, sexuality, or anything else. With all of the novels and characters the Mr. King has written, do you think he writes honestly for every one? No! That\u2019s not possible. And his \u2018dishonest\u2019 writing is what makes each of his characters so unique. My point is that we are merely a product of the society and environment that we grow up in. Of course, you should always stay true to your opinions and beliefs, but if every author wrote with their own thoughts and opinions, what a dull world we would live in. ",

            "answer_text": "Fearless writing is essential. Readers want and expect writing that rings true, reflecting candor and courage, even if it may encompass material that some readers find difficult or even unacceptable for any number of reasons (solution: stop reading). Writing about the relatively boring middle of life (McDonalds hamburgers: billions sold) does not require fearless writing. Writing about the edges\u2014life and death, war and disease, murder and suicide, love and hate, sex and rage, triumph and disaster, intimate violence\u2014demands fearless writing that probes the core realities and does not sugarcoat them just to be \u2018nice.\u2019 Many subjects are hard to write about effectively unless the writer is willing to bare his or her soul, unapologetically. Fearful, timid, cautious writing does not push the reader\u2019s emotional, intellectual and spiritual buttons. Such writing fails. An old saying has stayed with me, which explains a little bit about fearless writing. The writing itself may be plain and unadorned, but can still be powerfully candid. The saying: \u201cObject without being objectionable.\u201d In writing, there is no subject, however \u2018easy,\u2019 that cannot be rendered poorly, and no subject, however \u2018difficult,\u2019 that cannot be made accessible with enough fearless care. Or you could take guidance from the late, great physicist Richard Feynman. It\u2019s all in his book title: \u201cWhat do you care what other people think?\u2014Further Adventures of a Curious Character.\u201d ",
