            "answer_text": "Both the objectivity of history and the impartiality of the historian are desiderata we keep pursuing, not achieved goals. The whole thing is like physical beauty or strength: we know when a person is handsome or muscular and we can usually compare the degree to which two people possess those qualities, but we cannot say absolute beauty or strength can ever be reached. As of the relationship between the two, the impartiality of the historian (both the pre-modern historiographer and the modern academic historian) is definitely a requirement, but not a sufficient condition for a narrative to be \u2018objective.\u2019 Even the most well-intentioned historian may fall into one or more of the following traps and offer us an inaccurate image of the past. Lack or scarcity of information. That\u2019s especially true for those who study pre-modern history. There have been entire centuries we have no written sources from (e.g. the so-called Greek Dark Age).Information from biased or inaccurate sources.Inability to comprehend the sources either because they\u2019re written in a foreign language or dialect, or because of their obscure style and wording.Contradictions between sources.Ignorance of objective elements like geography, materials and art.Lack of critical thinking on the historian\u2019s part, which makes them unable to recognize propaganda, inaccuracies and lies or ask the proper questions. Always remember: The sources only answer the questions we ask them.Bias that comes so naturally that the historian doesn\u2019t even notice it\u2019s there. Almost everyone, including ourselves, wears the colored glasses of their national and cultural milieu.",
