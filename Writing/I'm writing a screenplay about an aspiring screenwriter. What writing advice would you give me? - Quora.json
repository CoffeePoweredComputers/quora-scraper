            "answer_text": "Don't. The only person who should write about an aspiring screenwriter is an accomplished screenwriter. It's an old rule about fiction that you don't write about being a success nor about being a failure until you are a success. This is because you won't have had enough authentic experiences to generalize the emotional content, nor to make the specific details seem authentic. In order to appeal to an audience you have to be able to do three things: Relate - tell a story they can understandEducate - teach them somethingMove - make them experience a range of emotionsIf you are asking questions about screenwriting, then you don't yet know enough about screenwriting to tell a story about a screenwriter. Tell a different story. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually that\u2019s a fine and funny premise and you should go about it by studying farce, which is a very specific kind of humor. Also, in my opinion, such a good premise that you should 1) keep it to yourself 2) go ahead and write it as quickly as possible. The remainder of my advice is what I give to any writer. Don\u2019t talk about it, write it. And write in a straight line, from the beginning to the end, before you start revising. Without a good conception of your ending point you can never fully see what you have. ",
