            "answer_text": "Joy was blocking all of the other emotions because she is personifying Riley\u2019s optimism blocking her complicated emotions. She is a young girl and therefore unable to deal with complex feelings. She hides her sorrow because she is afraid that is not the appropriate behavior at the time. Eventually, she does allow her other emotions to take control and they learn to balance themselves as they control Riley through the movie. Sometimes, we just try to bottle up emotions because we are not ready to deal with certain feelings. It happens because we are human. However, it is always important to express our emotions healthily so we don\u2019t snap and do something regretful. ",

I guess they do so by just stuffing it down inside. Which for real life humans is very unhealthy. I don\u2019t hide, block, or suppress my emotions. I let myself feel what I feel and I let the emotions connected to whatever it is I feel express themselves. ",
