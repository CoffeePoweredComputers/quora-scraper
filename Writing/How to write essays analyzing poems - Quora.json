            "answer_text": " Throughout your career as a student you'll have to write several kinds of essays. One of these is the compare and contrast essay. Literature students, for instance, must write compare and contrast essays on two specific works of literature -- in this case, poetry. Such essays analyze the similarities and differences between two literary works to encourage critical thinking.   Step 1  Choose an idea or theme to focus the essay on, such as love, nature or death. Literary movements have certain characteristics that make it easy to pinpoint two poems with similar ideas or themes. For example, compare Miguel Hernandez's and Pablu Neruda's accounts of love.  Step 2  Make a Venn diagram by drawing two overlapping circles -- one for each poem by the two authors. Write the similarities in the overlapping section of the circle, such as similarities in form, technique or ideas. In the individual spaces of the two circles write characteristics independent of each other. When making the diagram, consider what each poem is about. Are they part of the same literary movement? What is the focus of each poem? What is the author's tone? Is the poem broad or narrow in scope?   Step 3  Work on the thesis of your essay. Your thesis will organize the thoughts swirling in your head so your essay has direction for not only the reader but also for you. Consider the expectations of the essay. For instance, why are you writing this paper on these poems? Why should people care? To this end, consider the content of your class. Your thesis should not merely announce the comparison to the two poems but also your method of doing so.  Step 4  Organize your paper either subject-by-subject or point-by-point. The former involves discussing all the characteristics, ideas and themes of the first and second poems in full. The latter discusses one point of a particular poem and transitions into a similar or contrasting point of the second poem back and forth.   Step 5  Outline the essay according to the format you are using. Write the main point of each paragraph followed by a list of subpoints to emphasize or exemplify your main point.   Step 6  Write the introduction of the essay. Move from the general (poetry) to the specific (the poems). Your first two sentences should tell the reader the \"what\" and \"why\" of the essay. Include your thesis near the end of the paragraph but before the transition into the body.   Step 7  Draft each body paragraph according to your outline. Start each paragraph with a topic sentence telling the reader the main point you are discussing. Use examples from the poems to make your points stronger. Use transitional phrases to help the reader comprehend the flow of ideas. Some transitional devices include: like, similar to, also, unlike, similarly, in the same way, compared to, likewise, again, on the contrary, however, although, yet and conversely.   Step 8  Conclude the essay with a brief summary of the main idea or ideas. Make a conclusion based on the two poems' similarities and differences. End with a restatement of the thesis and a final thought on the essay that leaves readers thinking long after they finish reading.     ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking me. You've gotten a lot of wonderful answers already. I'm just going to take apart what I see as your assumptions: that what's important is the formal structure. I think that may lead you astray. Think analogy: an editorial is to a story as an ad is to a poem. In other words, a poem is a form where every word counts, and should do at least double meanings whenever possible. My poetry teacher used to say you couldn't be a poet if you didn't like puns, and that's sort of true. A dedicated poet spends as much time on a single short poem, or more, as many writers do on short stories. But while the writer is focusing on character, scene, plot, and so forth, the poet is focusing on sound, image, and association. Those things matter to help provide the overall feeling in a poem. Emotion, not reason, is the primary drive. So (to take your last sentence as an example) a caesura slows the pace down, but why?  It's because the poet (if technically gifted, or obedient to the rules, which is entirely the opposite) wants the line to move more slowly. She's got lots of choices. She can add white space -- plain old blanks between words, and line breaks to make the reader slow down. She can use slower words (words that rumble along, and have several syllables, rather than simple anglo saxon words). She can use syllabic strategies, like using trochees instead of iambic to go against the expected (since standard English lines are commonly iambic by nature, with every other syllable stressed). She can do... well lots of things, depending on how much her ear knows the language, how much she's studied its nature, and what she thinks works. It's not a set of rules; it's what the poet hears and does. This leads to a problem for the essayist. If he's writing an analysis of a poem written 250 years ago, say, one of the British romantic poets such as Keats, he can be reasonably sure that the poet had been educated in formal poetry (syllable, stress, rhyme scheme, stanza) and therefore which rhymes he selected were deliberate. He can also be sure that if it's iambic pentameter, has a sestet, a quartet, and a couplet, it's a sonnet even if it's not labeled \"Sonnet 24\" or something else revealing. Therefore, he can discuss the choices the poet has made, reasonably certain that the poet knew the choices available. With a modern poet, formalism is far less common. She may never have learned what a dactyl was, tried a villanelle, or even a rhymed couplet -- and yet you may notice in her work echoes of these formal decisions. The caesura you mention may be a complete accident -- or it may be the product of a refined ear which might not have known the term, but knew what needed to be done. (Or a tin ear which chose the wrong thing, again from ignorance.) So for this I prefer to use a weak version of the New Criticism -- unless you know a poet's work very well, or know their lives very well, or both, assume nothing was intentional and just talk about its effect.  I'm going to give you an example: an old poem by Adrienne Rich, one of my favorite poets. It's not her most significant work, but I return to it often because I love it, and it speaks to me.  I never wrote about it in college because I didn't know what to say. It wasn't complicated, in the way famous poems are. It's simply entitled \"Song.\" This is how it starts: You're wondering if I'm lonely:OK then, yes, I'm lonelyas a plane rides lonely and levelon its radio beam, aimingacross the Rockiesfor the blue-strung aislesof an airfield on the ocean. And this is how it ends: If I\u2019m lonelyit\u2019s with the rowboat ice-fast on the shorein the last red light of the yearthat knows what it is, that knows it\u2019s neitherice nor mud nor winter lightbut wood, with a gift for burning.  (from Adrienne Rich, Song ) which btw has a really nice, simple discussion of it to give you a perspective on critique.  The question is not \"How do I write an essay about this,\" but, \"what do I want to talk about? That stymied me for years. I thought you had to be able to say something brilliant and New Yorkerish.  Finally, I realized that several things struck me. Formally, it was arranged in stanzas. Several stanzas, all in either 7, 8, or six lines, but no apparent decision to do that. It felt like a rhymed poem, but wasn't -- which made sense for a song, because they usually do have similar stanza length and rhymes.  But what the poem fiercely emphasized was that it was a response to the short question, \"Are you lonely?\" presumably from some letter or friend's casual comment. And all those responses were images of herself -- in the first, her loneliness is like a plane on a radio beam, in the second, a woman driving across country, several other metaphors ending in that glimpse of her \"with\" the rowboat -- as the rowboat? in that remarkable list of things she's not before it ends with an ordinary image -- and an extraordinary reference. \"Wood, with a gift for burning.\" So this poem depends on image to define the persona: the speaker in the poem. Those images range, starting out with an enormous geography of a plane suspended between where it was and where it's going. By the last stanza, the image is small, and personal: a rowboat. She seems to be trying to answer her friend's question. Is she struggling? That's when we tend to change metaphors; when we try to explain what something's like, how we're doing, in a way the friend will understand. Or perhaps she's talking to herself? Who is she speaking to and for? And why does she start by flying over the Rockies and end with a small rowboat by a frozen shore? I could write about it now. I could have written about it then, if I'd know that it's permissible to figure out what the poet is doing, and saying, and why it speaks to me. So I'm going to pass that along to you. If it's a modern poem, you've got sound, you've got image, and you've got economy of language. Any decent modern poem will have those things. Your job is to figure out how one of those, or some of those, or all of those, place you in the end. \"Wood, with a gift for burning\" has taken me through some hard times. The rest gets me there.  Even the title could get you an essay -- why \"Song\"? most of Rich's poems either emphasize the formalism -- the Blue Ghazals for example -- or have descriptive titles so that we know what's happening. Why ever something as non-forthcoming as Song? What do songs do? What is this one singing about? Why don't we know by description? So you have my permission, at least, to forget every term you've ever learned which doesn't help answer the questions you want to answer in your essay. I have written hostile, snarky essays on famous poets (13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird\" springs to mind) and loving, transfiguring essays on minor poets. What matters is that they grab you, and irriitate you like sand in the bed, and you have something to say about them. Then figure out how to explain that to other people, and you'll have a fine critique.  ",
