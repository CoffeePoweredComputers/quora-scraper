The first book I ever read that showed me how this is done is The Moonstone, by Wilkie Collins. The story itself is about a jewel theft, but what has made it famous is that each of the numerous characters has their own voice, way of speaking, accent or not, etc., and demonstrates this voice throughout. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve read a book since that displayed that kind of talent. In most of the books I read, the author doesn\u2019t care, the same voice belongs to every character. They are lazy writers. I recommend that you read \u2014 no, study \u2014 The Moonstone which will help you to isolate voice in the speech of the people around you. If someone says to you, \u201cThat guy is a real character,\u201d that\u2019s somebody you want to listen to. Or \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of stories to tell,\u201d ditto. Story tellers often have distinctive voices. ",

            "answer_text": "An important thing you have to know is that every one of your characters will have a little bit of you in them, because all of them are being written by you. That\u2019s something that the biggest and best of authors will acknowledge. For me, personally, when I\u2019m writing fiction, I find it difficult to come up with characters out of thin air. I believe that\u2019s probably the case for most people, which is why I think that in many cases (certainly my own, I don\u2019t actually want to speak for anyone else): the parts of a character that don\u2019t come from you directly usually come from someone you know. Literally every character I\u2019ve ever written has been at least partially inspired by a family member, friend, or person I met for five minutes at the supermarket and then never talked to again. If you are having trouble coming up with original characters or characters with their own unique voice, my advice is take inspiration from the people around you. Tweak different things about them and shape them into your characters. Since every real-life individual has their own voice, personality, etc., you should find your characters coming to life much easier. Check out my blog here: Film Reviews with Ethan J ",
