            "answer_text": "It\u2019s important to look at the historical context of publishing in considering your question. For most of publishing history (up until not too many years ago), it was necessary for books to be a certain length to be economically viable to publish. Cover design, interior design, distribution set-up, promotion & publicity, contract execution, offset pre-press and creating press plates\u2026 all of these things (and more) were basically the same cost whether the book was 50 or 300 pages. However, a 300-page book could command a higher price, which meant that the economics favored longer books from the publisher\u2019s perspective. Thus, otherwise arbitrary benchmarks came about \u2014 \u201ca novel has to be X length in words\u201d; the Library of Congress only considers a book a \u201cbook\u201d if it\u2019s longer than 50 pages; etc. None of this is relevant now. We have the ability to economically publish books of almost any length thanks to digital printing, self-publishing, print-on-demand, and online sales (primarily Amazon). As long as your audience thinks the price is fair for the quality of the story (or information) you deliver, the length doesn\u2019t matter. Thus, we have Nobel-prize-winning Jos\u00e9 Saramago\u2019s The Tale of the Unknown Island, which clocks in at a mere 62 pages including all the front matter and three blank back pages, and is highly acclaimed and popular. (It isn\u2019t print-on-demand, but it could be if you weren\u2019t a Nobel-prize-winning author.) So, your novel of 60,000 words isn\u2019t \u201ctoo short\u201d if it successfully tells its story and sells for a fair price\u2026 but nor would it be at 25,000 or 30,000 or 40,000 words. Concern yourself with quality, not quantity. When 6\u20325\u2033 and long-legged Abe Lincoln was reportedly asked, \u201cHow long should a man\u2019s legs be?\u201d he\u2019s said to have answered, \u201cLong enough to reach the ground.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The rule of thumb for length of a novel is 60,000 words, approximately, so you\u2019re right there. However, I suggest you ask yourself a few questions, which might affect the length going forward. You haven\u2019t shared any details, so I don\u2019t know the genre or subject matter. Therefore, these comments are blind. Editing can either add or subtract words. In some cases, I\u2019ve discovered that I hadn\u2019t properly set up a scene and needed precisely placed paragraphs earlier in the book to provide justification/orientation. Example: I had a character who showed up late in one of my novels. An early reader told me I hadn\u2019t earned her appearance, and he was right. I added scenes with her in several spots earlier in the book. 1,700 words added. In many cases, I find duplication and remove the offending prose. Have your characters struggled to reach their objectives? Any story that allows a protagonist to go from Point A to Point B easily isn\u2019t very interesting. Adding failed attempts or difficult situations will enhance the story and lengthen the work. Have you provided sufficient backstory, peppered throughout? Can a reader see the setting from the way you\u2019ve described the locations, or from the way your characters have interacted with their environment? Those are great opportunities to appropriately lengthen your work and give your readers a better sense of place. ",

Get advice and input from people you trust (not the ones who will just pat your back!) and you may find there are problems with the novel that require rework that will add the words you need. Roughly another 10K words would make it suitable length for publishing in many genres (detective, romance etc.) If it\u2019s epic fantasy or a thriller though you are probably 20\u201340K words short and that might be a problem. Is there a hidden third act? Something that could logically happen after what you currently think is the end of your novel that would be exciting, surprising and make it a better read? Good luck! ",

Secondly, different genres have different range of word length, you should search for it online. Then, anything between 40,000 to 60,000 word length is good for any novel provided you have done the editing for it. ",
