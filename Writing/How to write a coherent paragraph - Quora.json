            "answer_text": "Good question. Imagine your phone battery is at 1% and you want to convey an idea (with a bit of context) to a good friend by text. You state your idea, then flesh it out with a few related ideas, or examples. Wrap up restating your topic sentence in a slightly tweaked way. If you get stuck, try swapping your first and last sentence to see how that changes the flow of thought. Finally, read it aloud, or, even better, have your phone read it to you in an unfamiliar voice, which helps refresh your perception of the words. Opt for active (imagine, opt, swap) rather than passive verbs (is, was, were, etc.) when possible*. I do like your question, which deserves a solid answer. I hope this helps. I aimed (above) to show by example. ;-) *one caveat: Academic/scientific writing has conventionally used the passive voice, e.g. \u201cThe beakers were filled with toluene\u2026\u201d presumably because saying \u201cI filled the beakers with toluene\u201d would put an emphasis on you rather than on the objective process which (ideally) can be replicated by others with similar results.

            "answer_text": "Alternate methods of decision or revision. One way is to think about the topic for a while until it seems clear enough to explain to someone and get that down. Another is to draft and edit: write all of the statements on the topic, remove any that are irrelevant and shuffle the order so it makes the most sense. Since an outline can be in sentences or phrases, that also means that at any time each can be made into the other depending upon punctuation. If there is a major shift in ideas, then a blank line may be inserted to separate a new paragraph, possibly after a transition statement. The order of those might then be made into an argument or narrative. This allows you to write in any mood. ",
