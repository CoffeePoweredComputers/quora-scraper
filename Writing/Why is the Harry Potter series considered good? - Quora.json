            "answer_text": "Harry Potter series is considered amaizing because of many reasons :1. The style of writing is amazing. Even missing one page may lead to missing some important detail. The novel is written in such a way that one is able to picture it properly in front of there eyes..The extent of imagination is such that a whole new world is created and the world is created in such a way that no one can find out a loophole in the track...These are some interesting points which makes and proves JK Rowling maam is a genius :::1. When Snape first speaks to Harry, he asks him \u201cPotter! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\u201d In the Victorian language of flowers, asphodel is a lily that means \"my regrets follow you to the grave\" and wormword not only means \"absence\" but symbolizes bitter sorrow. That whole passage could possibly be interpreted that Snape was saying \"I bitterly regret Lily's death\" right when he met Harry.2. Ron's Patronus takes the form of a Jack Russell terrierJack Russell terriers are known to chase all sorts of animals considered vermin, including otters.And of course, Hermione's Patronus takes the form of an otter.3. Professor Trelawney says she won't sit at a table with 12 people already at it in Prisoner of Azkaban\u201cI dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be 13! Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when 13 dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!\u201dThen, two books later in Order of the Phoenix, Sirius is the first person to stand from a table of 13.Later in that book,he becomes the first of the group to die.Then, in Deathly Hallows, only 13 make it back to the Burrow after the Seven Potters encountered Voldemort Lupin was the first person to leave and go look for Mad Eye Moody's body. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he's the first person to die.4. A Squib is someone who is born to a wizard family but has no magical powers of their own Well Squib also means a broken firecracker, or one that should create sparks, and cannot.5.By the end of the series, all four Marauders are dead.They died in reverse order of which they were named on the map.6. Harry and Ron make up predictions for Harry to finish their Divination homework in Goblet of Fire, and their predictions actually end up coming true.They end up predicting the events of the Triwizard Tournament.They first say he will be in danger of burns, then that he will lose a treasured possession. Next they say he will be stabbed in the back by someone he thought was a friend, and finally he will come off worse in a fight.Harry had to face a dragon in the first task, then lost Ron and Hermione when they were put in the lake. Professor Moody then betrayed him, and that led to his fight with Voldemort in the graveyard.7. The Weasley twins once pelted Voldemort in the face with snowballs in harry potter and philosopher's stone chapter 12 \" the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they follow Quirell around, bouncing off the back of his turban\".8. Sirius was the favorite of the Greek gods.Greek mythology says that Orion cared for his dog.Artemis so much that a star was put up for the companion. This star is Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. And what do you know, Sirius' Animagus is a dog! And while we're on name origins; Albus means \"white\" in Latin And! In second century Britain, the governor was named Clodius Albinus. Albinus attempted to take the thrown and ended up in an alliance with another contender, Septimus Severus.9. Each of Voldemort's Horcruxes were destroyed by a different person. Harry destroyed the diary, Dumbledore destroyed the ring, Ron destroyed the locket, Hermione destroyed the cup, Crabbe destroyed the diadem (inadvertently with the fiendfyre), Voldemort destroyed the Horcrux inside Harry and Neville cut of Nagini's head.10. In one of Dumbledore's memories from Half-Blood Prince that Harry sees, he watches Tom Riddle ask Dumbledore for a job at Hogwarts. After Dumbledore tells him no, Voldemort becomes angry, and accuses Dumbledore of being \"omniscient as ever.\" Dumbledore simply replies saying \"No, no. Merely friendly with the local barmen.\" In the next novel we learn this barman is in fact Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth.11.The Dark Mark is a skull with a snake for a tongue.This mark signifies those who have the ability to speak to snakes, a trait that Voldemort shares with Slytherin, which enforces his belief he's the heir to Slytherin.But there might be some other inspiration. When the Basilisk comes out of the mouth of Salazar Slytherin in the Chamber of Secrets, it looks an awful lot like The Dark Mark.12. When Harry and Cedrick are transported to the graveyard in Goblet of Fire, there is a large yew tree near the grave of Tom Riddle Sr. Voldemort's wand is also made of Yew.13. In Prisoner of Azkaban, Trelawney says to Harry, \"I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in midwinter?\" Of course Harry is born in July, so Trelawney's prediction is written off. However, Voldemort was born in mid-winter. Later in the series we learn that Harry was accidentally turned into a Horcrux, and had some of Voldemort's soul within him. That piece of the soul is what Trelawney was sensing.14. Voldemort was just 71 when he died....if only he would have not seek mortality then he would have lived longer according to wizarding standards.Also the book if read considering its deeper meaning gives a wonderful message that love is above all and evil and hatred and going against nature only causes destruction. Also there are many wise quotes which actually holds true for our non magical world also...Their are many words which JK Rowling invented for Harry Potter series but since the series is written in such a manner that it feels we are living in the wizarding world that we forget that some words are actually invented...In fact most of the words invented are invented in a technical way..such as :1. Muggles ( the word means non magical people and it is now included in English dictionery) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone.2. Horcrux ( the word means storing a bit of some object by act of evil) The word Horcrux may be also composed by \"hor\" or \"hore\" (old English/middle-English) meaning \"dirt, evil, impurity\" and \"crux\" or \"cr\u00face\" (old English) meaning \"container, pitcher(ful), jar\". Besides, Horcrux is a contraction from \"horrible\" (English) meaning \"frightful, flagitious, unworthy, wretched, terrible, monstrous, fearful\" and \"crux\" (Latin) meaning \"the Cross\". First mentioned in Harry potter and the Half blood prince.3.Animagus ( it means a witch or wizard who can transform into one type of animal on will) Animagus \" is a portmanteau word , dropping the last letter of \"animal\" andoverlapping the previous two with \"magus\" meaning magical. Thus this word is invented from real words. First mentioned in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.4. Metamorphmagi ( Metamorphmagi are witches and wizards with the innate ability to change their own shape at will) first mentioned in Harry Potter and the order of Phoenix.5. Portkey ( A Portkey is an object enchanted to instantly bring anyone touching it to a specific location) first mentioned in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.6. Expelliarmus (the spell to disarm the opponent ) it is invented by combining the Latin words of expello meaning \u201cI drive away, banish\u201d with arma meaning \u201cweapons\u201d. This disarming charm makes the victim\u2019s wand fly out of reach. first mentioned in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.7. Priori Incantatem ( An effect which occurs when two wands of the same core material are brought into combat with one another, causing one to force the other to release shades of former spells. This effect is characterized by the appearance of bright, gold-colored threads which unite the two wands and encase their owners) it is not apparently derived from any real word. first mentioned in Harry Potter and the goblet of Fire.8. occlumency ( The ability to close off your mind from outsiders from reading it) it was mentioned first in Harry Potter and the Order of Pheonix.9. Legilimency( The skill of extracting feelings and memories from another person's mind. It also allows one to convey visions or memories to another person, whether real or imaginary.) it was first mentioned in book Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix.10. Parseltongue ( Parseltongue is the language of Snakes). First demonstrated in Harry Potter and the philosopher's Stone when Harry free the Belgian boa and first explained in Harry Potter and the Chambers of secrete when harry comes to know that he is a parseltongue.Harry Potter is thus such a book that it will never end....the magic will remain in tact by all its lovers....

            "answer_text": "Well, I think so! It\u2019s definitely one of the best series of our time. Let\u2019s look at some data (I know it\u2019s not the most reputable but we\u2019re just going for ballpark numbers here). It is the best selling book series (of 7 books and 8 supplements) with approximately 500 million copies being sold worldwide in 20 yeas. The Goosebumps series (with 62+ books) has only sold 350 million copies. Between those two, that\u2019s a huge difference. It\u2019s been translated into numerous languages, which has certainly helped the sales. Likewise, the movies have helped to raise the popularity of the series and helped to draw a lot more readers in otherwise. List of best-selling books - Wikipedia But the Harry Potter series came into the world at a really special time. The rapid increase of technology allowed it to spread even faster than information was able to be spread in the past. In the past, series weren't really written like this. Books were stand alone. It was hard to get them spread to a wide audience. Harry Potter was able to use the technology of today to capture the attention of millions. So in numbers, yes, Harry Potter is at the very top. The question is whether or not it will remain that in years to come. Personally, I believe that it will stand the test of time. However, I don\u2019t know if it is the books or the franchise that will stand the test of time. The Fantastic Beasts movies are helping kids now to experience the reinvention of the series and once again drawing in the original readers. I am sure that they will be redone within 20 years (The original 8). But that\u2019s the movies. That\u2019s not the books. I hope that the books stand the test of time. I hope that they are the model for our culture today as Dickens and Shakespeare were for theirs. I hope that they are referenced in the history books and I hope that grandmothers read them to their great-grandchild and tell them what it was like when the series first came out. I personally believe that Harry Potter is an incredible series and that it should be considered to be one of the greatest series - if not of all time, then of our time. The only way to prove that it is the greatest will be to see how the next decades shape up. Fingers crossed! ",
