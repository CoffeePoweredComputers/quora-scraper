            "answer_text": "There are two ways to take the question. How do you go from not writing a novel to some steps toward beginning the process, and what are the steps. My take on the question is the first part. What gets you from nothing to the beginnings of a novel. Everyone has a different approach. Also, one book may show up in your head fully formed and another might start with a single concept but take work to tease out. Here\u2019s an article about how the book Dune developed. Dune, 50 years on: how a science fiction novel changed the world Doyle had a teacher (a professor, really) who was big on observation and logic. Joseph Bell - Wikipedia Bell was involved in helping the police and later Doyle helped solve some real world mysteries. Conan Doyle Info Here\u2019s two more articles on this subject. The Ideas that Inspired The Hobbit, Animal Farm & 8 Other Famous Books The big idea: bestselling authors reveal the creative secrets and inspirations behind their greatest books Once they have something to work with, each author proceeds in the way that makes sense to get the idea out. Some people think the hard part is over at that point and that it is all down hill for the writer to get it into a book. Unfortunately the second hard part starts there. Getting it turned into a story. That\u2019s where the writer\u2019s skill and craft come in to play. And to an extent talent. Some build a plot to place their idea into. Some start writing to tease the idea into the shape it needs to become. Joyce Carol Oates suggests that you write your first version of a short story in one sitting. I think you can do that with a novel if you are writing a big synopsis rather than a skeletal plot. James Scott Bell (who has written many books to help authors write) has a method called \u201cwriting from the middle\u201d which lets you consider a main character\u2019s story arc from something he calls \u201cthe middle moment\u201d. The part of you that interacts with the world through writing is going to have a preference. The writer has to work with the first things they\u2019ve written and turn it eventually into a novel or a short story. People don\u2019t want the raw idea any more than they want raw meat for dinner. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple (and cheap) answer is \u201cAt the beginning,\u201d but the best one is \u201cin the middle.\u201d However, I believe you want to know what makes a good beginning, in other words, where to start. For this purpose, I always recommend starting where something is about to change, and possibly not for the better or when the character is required to make choices, any of which could be wrong. A fascinating character is \u201ca fish out of water.\u201d Give your character something to worry about, something to knock her off balance, something to make him take a quick step back or rush in, fists flying or saying \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d e.g. \u201cJoe had two serious problems. One, he lay naked, strapped down on a cold autopsy slab and two, he desperately needed to take a leak. Slashes of light and crackles of weapons fire beyond told him it would not be prudent to leave, but his overstressed bladder urged him to move. Before he did, the door opened. Was the autopsy of his warm, living body about to begin? Or, you could write, \u201cIt had been a long day. Joe, after arriving on the shuttle from Earth to Luna wanted a tall, cold beer, a friendly, feminine smile, some music and maybe a game or two of poker before he crawled into his hammock. What he couldn\u2019t decide was which one he wanted most. He sighed, chose the hammock, and fell asleep.\u201d Sadly, so did the reader. When beginning any story it\u2019s best to leap into the middle of the action and/or dialogue or better, both. \u201cWho are you? What do you want? Get out of my room!\u201d Sally shouted, pulling the sheet up to shield herself. Fat lot of good that did. The intruder snatched it away and jammed a gun between her breasts. \u201cWere is it?\u201d he snarled. \u201cSally lay in her comfortable bed, half asleep, listening to the soft twitter of little birds singing in the trees outside her third-story apartment. She yawned, stretched, and thought about getting up. The scent of freshly-brewed coffee from the machine she set to turn on at 7:15 every morning wafted from the kitchen down the hall. She rolled out, shoved her arms into her robe, tied the sash and wandered toward the aroma of coffee. Another day had begun in Sally\u2019s nice, calm life.\u201d Ho-hum. Of course, not every day in Joe\u2019s life is likely to start with him on an autopsy slab. Not every day in Sally\u2019s life should begin with an armed intruder, but either of those openings will capture a reader\u2019s interest more quickly than the quieter ones. The calm can come later. In some cases, the scene can begin without any drama at all. \u201cBong\u2026bong\u2026bong\u2026 The sound of the steeple bell echoed, doleful, off the high stone wall. Before Sally, white headstones lined up, row on row. Her vision blurred as tears filled her eyes. Not wanting to approach closer, but knowing she must, knowing she had to know, to be sure, she took one step. Bong\u2026 Then a second. Bong\u2026 And another. Bong! That one made her jump. She whirled. Looked over her shoulder. No one there. As the sixth toll faded, she approached, blinked her eyes to clear them and saw, as the seventh knell rang, exactly what she had dreaded. Her own name. ",
