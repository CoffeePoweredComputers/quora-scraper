I have then asked questions after the essay (and provided a lot of footnotes). Should you look at this essay as a template? No, but it should inspire you to try something that might be a bit quirky (or even not in good taste). And essay like the one I am including could doom the person who write it iif a certain reader found it offensive or not organized in a traditional way. The people I know who I trust about essays those who have written books on the subject) have found this essay compelling.  The following essay was written in response to the University of Chicago's supplementary admission prompt: How does the University of Chicago, as you know it now, satisfy your desire for a particular kind of learning, community, and future? Please address with some specificity your own wishes and how they relate to UChicago. *****************************************************************Chicago is not yet stamping out hundreds of angel headed hipsters. That\u2019s corporate unorthodoxy. That\u2019s Facebook execs acting Moly inspired stupid at Burning Man. That\u2019s some epic shit dude. Marshmello me. Really? You try to take your quirkiness seriously. Yes, ok, so it is branded and t-shirted fun comes to die stuff too, but still, I would gladly sit in an unsterilized room in a sketchy Hong Kong mall waiting to get my intellectual tear tattoo. Then I\u2019d show everyone that I\u2019ve killed my share of clich\u00e9s. I\u2019m ready to take out the Wall Street sleek suits who work too many hours on the verbal exchanges that make their way around the globe in micro-milliseconds, gathering speed as they meme into increased Likes and emoji smiles, backed by healthy steroidal and sugar enhanced back room deal-making selfies and oh so deep data.

And yes, I would too. I do dare and double dare you. But take me I\u2019m yours is not me. Just try and you\u2019ll see. I take no prisoners. Not when it comes to words. Not this little girl. Dylan and Ginsberg are over. This new girl\u2019s in town wearing my badge of dishonor proudly, plainly, not insouciantly come hither ironic, that\u2019s too PostMod for me. My red letter days and nights are not Hester inspired. No it\u2019s the red weather of tigers. My quicker blood does not contemplate escape. Put that in your pipe and toke it, my bloody Valentine. In case you haven\u2019t noticed I steal tongues, shove them in my mouth, nothing secret about it, no madwoman and no attic. Borrowing is for timid women. I am not afraid to artiste myself naked in front of a crowd, verb myself right where I\u2019m standing, in the open, smiling, looking right into your Sandberg inspired soul. Here I am, come and get me. I believe in truths, but there is nothing self evident about me or my country. Time to make a choice. Vote your conscience. Vote twice. Vote from the cemetery of Great White Ideas. I\u2019ll win. I will. I want to. I\u2019m ready for my close up. Are you? But you know you want me too. Let\u2019s get consent out in the open. Don\u2019t be afraid. It\u2019s time to make me great again. Pull the lever. I promise never to repent. I promise to electrify you. Me too you, she said.

            "answer_text": "Creative is one thing, but you want to make sure you don\u2019t do something entirely unexpected. Regardless of how \u201ccreative\u201d your essay is, it still needs to answer the question being asked and tell the program you\u2019re applying to what they want to know about you. I would do research on other students who have successfully matriculated to the programs you want to apply to and review their essays, if possible. First, DO NOT plagiarize other essays. What you want to look for is how the essays are written, meaning organization, topic, grammar, vocabulary, etc. Also, particular fields, schools, and programs come to expect a certain type of information presented in a certain way. The Internet is swimming in sites people post to about which program has what requirement as far as the essay goes. Do as much research on this as you can. Once you have all that information, pick a topic and get writing. The last thing I would advise is to place the emphasis of your writing process on editing over the actual writing; 80 : 20 editing to writing is a good rule of thumb. Honestly, if you don\u2019t edit your essay at least 20 times, it won\u2019t be worth the paper it\u2019s printed on. ",

            "answer_text": "The question seems an odd one, if you think about it. By creative, most people mean different or original. Asking me to provide you a way to be different or original seems silly, since you are original, and I don\u2019t know you. Look, nobody knows you, not really. Only you know you. Nobody else can provide you a way to be yourself. You have to be yourself, to accept that self, in order to be original and different. Your experiences are real. No one else has those experiences in just the way you do, no matter what anyone tells you. And those experiences, as you intimately experience them, are more important than the college admissions process. Focus on what\u2019s meaningful to you; write about it honestly. That\u2019s a good start. ",

For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re writing a 6 paragraph essay (1 intro, 4 body, 1 conclusion) about how you want to intertwine spirituality with science. Layer it with anecdotes from spirituality and science in the 4 body paragraphs. Weave them together with examples. For example, Jesus, scientific accounts of his life, Buddha, scientific accounts of his life. Ok that example wasn\u2019t so good. OR\u2026Transformers, p2-Michael Bay\u2019s direction of the film, p3-The commercial aspects of it, P4-How Michael Bay\u2019s direction of the film was interpreted by the actors, P5-How much the actors made.

            "answer_text": "Not everyone is creative, per se. The other suggestion to intertwine two ideas is a good strategy. The important thing is to be authentic, not creative. Authenticity differs by the writer, so we can't tell you how to be authentic. Think about one or two things that are important to you. If they are two disparate qualities, that makes it easier to write something interesting. So if you are both a football player and a ballet dancer, that would pique the reader\u2019s interest. If you don't have anything interesting to say, the problem isn't the essay. Spend some time thinking about what is important to you. What do you care about? What is your purpose in attending college? What do you want to do in the future? Be yourself. If that doesn't get you into a college, then find a college where you are a fit. ",
