            "answer_text": "First of all, it does actually happen in real life. Not too often, but it does. For example, the Air Force PJ's like to fly like that. The Army can, but we're restricted on our flying a bit if we do, plus you don't really lose anything by closing the doors and using seats. I pretty consistently fly around with my legs hanging over because I'm in a MEDEVAC unit and that's how we run the rescue hoist. In reality, it's pretty safe and stable. When a group has their legs out, there's typically a cargo strap or other safety device across the door as added insurance, but most of what keeps you in is gravity and the motion of the aircraft. It feels like sitting on the stairs for most of the ride. When I'm running hoist, I have a monkey tail from the back of my flight vest to a ring inside the helicopter. The idea is that if you secure it correctly, the strap will catch you right before you fall out, or at least right after so you don't fall that far out. Here's a picture of what I mean. The strap connected to my back is the monkey tail:  When you're turning, the aircraft will enter a bank. Because it rolls to the side, you still feel like you're pinned down by gravity (due to centrifugal force) . It's like that carnival ride where you start by standing on a wall and the whole room spins. You then get pinned to the wall and the floor drops out. But you don't actually fall at that point because you're being forced into the side of the wall. It's kind of the same concept. If the aircraft were to rapidly change direction without banking, sure, you might go flying out. But I've never felt like I was going to fall out, even in windy and bumpy conditions while leaning out and over the side of the aircraft and trying to manage a cable oscillation. Sitting down like that is just a pretty stable position, and the roll of the aircraft keeps you stable. On a different note, and to address some other answers, I get the reasoning behind flying gently and everything, but we do things a bit differently in military aviation. We have to fly to avoid fire, fly for speed, and engage in some other somewhat risky activities. For example, in a MEDEVAC situation, we would fly 20-40 feet above the ground over 120 mph. That's not going to be smooth at all, but it keeps us from being seen and even heard until the last second. Anyway, hope that answers your question. Yes, it does occasionally happen, but with some sort of restraint depending on the circumstance. ",

            "answer_text": "I was a UH-1 Crew-Chief in the Marines. I spent thousands of hours in the back of a Huey and about 90% of that time was doors-open. (With doors closed, you couldn't access your gun and you couldn't see your tail) If I had any passengers, they were sitting in the seats with a lap belt. If I was not wearing a lap belt in a seat, I was wearing the gunners belt (a lot of people refer to it as the monkey strap) I had it adjusted to allow me to go about 3\u2032 past the door. If I fell, it would only let me fall to the point of embarrassment. In flight, to shoot forward or backward, I would often step outside the cabin and stand on the rocket pod. I never slipped. Inertia keeps you \u201cdown\u201d even in a banking turn. If you take a bucket on a rope and start spinning it, the bucket may be perpendicular to the ground, but it doesn't spill because inertia or \u201ccentrifugal force\u201d keeps the contents from spilling. The same thing happens inside a helicopter. ",
