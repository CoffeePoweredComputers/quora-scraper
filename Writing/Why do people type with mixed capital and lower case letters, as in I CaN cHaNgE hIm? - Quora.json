I do not recommend asking questions entirely in this manner, because it might trip the Quora bots\u2019 grammar alert and mark the question as \u201cmay need editing\u201d, even if the question is why people type like this. This question does not have such a warning as of 5/13/2020. It is also possible that asking a question entirely like this could get it the warning that it \u201cshould be phrased with neutral and sincere language\u201d if Quora\u2019s AI does know the meaning of such typing, and perhaps righteously so, depending on the question. Also, I don\u2019t like to do this without explaining what it means, particularly because I didn\u2019t find out until I ran this search today what it meant! I prefer to use <sarcasm> before and </sarcasm> after if I do decide to use sarcasm in writing. Also, excessive use of alternating caps in answers could get them auto-collapsed as \u201cneeding improvement\u201d due to the automated grammar alert I mentioned. Some users who can\u2019t take a joke or don\u2019t know what the alternating caps mean could also report it as poorly written. You can probably better get away with this in comments, because they are not expected to answer questions in ways that are reusable. Since I know what this kind of text means, I could let some comments in alternating caps that would otherwise be BNBR violations slide (as in not delete, downvote or report, though other people might downvote and/or report them), because I recognize the sarcastic meaning. Still, don\u2019t assume that alternating caps are a license to insult people, however sarcastically. Researching this and writing this answer, to me, begs the idea of a \u201cAlt+Caps Lock\u201d keyboard shortcut which would automatically make you type in alternating caps, while the \u201cCaps Lock\u201d light flashes, and \u201cSaRcAsM mOdE\u201d showing briefly on the screen to let the user know the purpose of such text.
