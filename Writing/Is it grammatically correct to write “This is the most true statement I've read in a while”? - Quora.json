            "answer_text": "Is it grammatically correct to write \u201cThis is the most true statement I've read in a while\u201d? Yes, it is (you do not need to say \u2018truest\u2019). Often \u2018more\u2019 and \u2018most\u2019 are used for emphasis or clarity, even though grammar says you can use \u2018_er\u2019 or \u2018_est\u2019 as a suffix on the adjective. However, it is extremely debatable as to whether you should use \u2018most\u2019 or \u2018_est\u2019 at all. I would not. True and false are binary opposites and do not have degrees of truth or falsity (unless possibly considering multiple statements). A statement is and only can be true or false. There are rules in logic and philosophy that define this better. Just like perfect cannot be more perfect or most perfect. As communicative English does not expect everyone to be logicicans (or even rational), informally and colloquially, we do accept and understand the sentence. Grammar is not subject to sentential logic, but you would be wise to use both good logic and good grammar if you are in a formal situation, especially in an argument or debate. ",

            "answer_text": "No,it isn't correct. What made your sentence grammatically incorrect is the incorrect adjective form. It is true that \u2018true\u2019 is an adjective, noun and adverb. When we use \u2018true\u2019 as an adjective, the sentence must not be in the superlative or comparative context.You can't correctly say \u201cthe most true politician\u201d or \u201c the more true report\u201d .In such contexts the correct adjective form is \u2018truthful\u2019. Nevertheless, you can use the superlative or comparative form of true by itself, e.g. \u201cthe truest story\u201d or \u201ctruer version of the story\u201d. The correct way to construct your sentence is this: \u201cThis is the most truthful statement I've read in a while\u201d I hope this helps. ",
