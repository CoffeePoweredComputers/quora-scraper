            "answer_text": "Here is my take on it: Learn what good grammar really is When we say that people have bad grammar, what we are really saying is that they probably don\u2019t know how to express their idea in what would be considered the correct way using the laws of written English. It is not a lack of ability holding someone back, but just a lack of instruction. The solution, then, is to learn. There are fantastic grammar books available on the likes of Amazon, or you could even avail of a composition class which will cover the important points. Starting at the beginning of a huge grammar book and working though can be overkill, though. Instead, seek out the grammar that really applies to you. Look at the examples, and then complete the exercises. Keep on writing Studying grammar and completing grammar-focused exercises is important, but the only way you can truly apply what you have learned is by writing. And it really doesn\u2019t matter what. It is always great to get some help at this stage. For example, a proper grammar checking and language learning software can help enhance your vocabulary by suggesting synonyms to words you type. I use Linguix for Chrome as a such tool. (Just hold down the Alt button and double-click on a word to see a list of its synonyms when you type anywhere on the web).  Read It is no coincidence that most of the best writers are or were voracious readers. Through reading we truly get a sense of the language and all its intricacies. Read as diversely as you can, and you will begin to appreciate the limitless number of styles that exist, and the mastery that great writers have over the written word. It inspires, and it teaches us in equal measure. Also, reading enhances your vocabulary, especially if you use new technologies. I've already mentioned Linguix, and this tool is handy not only when you are writing, but reading as well. If you have a browser extension installed, just hold Alt and double click on a word you've encountered while reading and do not now to see its definition:  These are my recommendations, but the main one is never be ashamed of your grammar. No one has perfect grammar, and it is a skill that even accomplished writers seek to improve over the course of their career. Just never stop learning and seeking to improve, read and write as much as you can, and never see it as a chore, but instead as an opportunity to improve. ",

            "answer_text": "As one has the willingness, determination/ambition to understand English grammar, then I must say it needs diligence, focus, hard work, spending much time in reading, ability to remember things quickly due to the fact that English grammar involves many aspects/patterns that have to be followed in their proper dimensions and to lead you to an understandable manner. On the other, an advice that seems to be more meaningful of which I have to give (to) you is that; you have to put in much effort and learn what are being termed as \u2014 rules, laws, and principles of grammar as far as English language is concerned. You can never rule out the laws/principles of grammar and go by usage of phrases or sentences anyhow and have in mind that you understand grammar very well or to consider/regard yourself as a good grammarian; no, and never at all, it's not being done in a haphazard manner. The so called \u201claws/principles\u201d are always applicable in all aspects (of grammar) and you cannot do-away or ignore them in any situation. As I have earlier on indicated, you must be a broad reader by putting in effort to absorb definitions, meanings, interpretation of words, formation and knowing the variations between phrases and sentences, how to ask and answer questions in different perspectives, etc., in fact it entails a lot of intricacies and it needs diligence; this is factual and not that i\u2019m to scare you, not that at all. Another important approach is that, \u201cknowing the definitions and some major key words in grammar\u201d are of great importance as a measure of keeping on your fingertips and applying them quickly without any hesitation when the need arises. The so called keywords are for example: knowing the terminologies or meaning of some words like: noun(s), pronoun(s), adjective(s), verb(s), adverb(s), gerund(s), modal(s), clause(s), punctuation sign(s), conditional(s), conjunction(s), positive & negative aspect(s), phrase(s), sentence(s), etc. It's very essential to keep all the meanings of the above mentioned grammar terminologies and topics in mind at all times and also to know when and how they are being used or applied when/where necessary. Always keep on making research in books by reading and finding out how sentences are being constructed in proper ways. It's necessary to keep the grammatical key words or terminologies, meanings and their usages in memory because when there happens to be a question asked in a text/ an examination, the questioner/ examiner will straightaway mention the terminology for you to answer whereas he/she will not explain to you what the meaning of an \u201cadjective, adverb, pronoun, or conjunction is. Therefore as I have earlier on advised you, all those words and their meanings or functions should always be remembered speedily, quickly, and accurately at all times (without any hesitation). Indeed, there are hundreds of thousands of words and phrases under English grammar topics of which we all need to keep on studying them every now and then in order to avoid making common mistakes in our spoken and written aspects (of the English language). In your learning/studying ability, do not figure yourself out by means of concentrating on a particular aspect only; for example: you may want to study/learn \u201cacademic English\u201d and avoid contemporary English, and business English, all because you are with the focus to pass your final year examination therefore your concentration is on the academic English only. I suggest that is not the best as someone who wants to understand English grammar, you have to dive into all sectors / patterns in the English language in order to be well-versed in knowledge of understanding and competence. Moreover, by putting in much effort and studying all the four major segments/categories of the English language, namely: speaking, listening, reading, and writing, you will certainly acquire the skills and experience through common understanding. Please you should always read broadly, but your reading habits should not be limited only onto grammar books due to the fact that you want to understand grammar, no. You should do well and read text books, story books, news papers, novels, read news online, books/magazines of other faculties, such as: science, business, arts, etc., putting them together in that manner will certainly uplift your understanding of English grammar at a faster rate.
