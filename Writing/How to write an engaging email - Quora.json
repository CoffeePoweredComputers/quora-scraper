            "answer_text": "Great question! Here\u2019s an excerpt from a recent Clickback blog with some tips! Email marketing campaigns are a mainstay for the majority of marketers, and we know how tough it can be to keep contacts engaged. You can send out as many campaigns as you like, but if people aren\u2019t opening, reading and clicking them you\u2019re just firing messages into the void. Here are our top 4 tips to help you keep email campaign engagement up. Craft Subject Lines Carefully Your subject line is the first key factor in email engagement. That\u2019s because it\u2019s the very first thing your contacts will see, and will determine whether they open your email or not. Knowing that, you can imagine why it\u2019s not a good idea to treat the subject line as an afterthought. You should craft it carefully and intentionally, focusing on the question \u201cWill this convince people to open the message on its own?\u201d Maximize Impact, Minimize Length Once you convince someone to open your email, the last thing you want to do is scare them off. If your email is a giant wall of text, that\u2019s exactly what will happen. Especially if it\u2019s a cold email lead generation campaign. Designing your email well is very important. That means having a layout that\u2019s visually appealing, flows smoothly, and is easily scannable \u2013 while also conveying enough information to convince the reader to click. Don\u2019t Sound Boring B2B marketers often use very similar tone and language. I know. Shocking, isn\u2019t it? You know your email is marketing material. Your contact knows it\u2019s marketing material. The trick is that it doesn\u2019t need to feel like marketing material. Again, this depends on your audience. If your target audience tends to be high-level professionals who communicate in a very formal manner, then matching that can be beneficial. Solve Their Issue, Don\u2019t Market Your Solution This point is as much about mindset as content. If you write your emails with the intention of marketing your solution, it\u2019ll feel like that. If, on the other hand, you write your emails with the intention of solving the contact\u2019s problem, that will come across clearly. You can reinforce this by using customer-centric and benefits-focused language \u2013 that is, write about solving their problem and the benefits of your solution instead of the solution itself.
