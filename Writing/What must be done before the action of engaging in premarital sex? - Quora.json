            "answer_text": "What must be done before the action of engaging in premarital sex? The exact same thing that must be done before having sex after being married. Consent and safer sex practices apply, regardless of marital status. The idea that sex outside of marriage is any different than sex within the bonds of marriage is bull-cocky. Sex is sex. Sex is what the people involved make it. Sex is not intrinsically sacred. Sex does not cause some mystical bond between people. Sex does not lessen a person. It's time to toss the idea of premarital sex being shameful into the dustbin of history. ",
