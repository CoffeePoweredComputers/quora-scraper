            "answer_text": "Zero-day is a flaw in software, hardware or firmware that is unknown to the party responsible for patching or otherwise fixing the flaw. The term zero-day may refer to the vulnerability itself, or an attack that has zero days between the time the vulnerability is discovered and the first attack. Once a zero-day vulnerability has been made public, it is known as an n-day or one-day vulnerability. Since zero-day vulnerabilities aren't known in advance, there is no way to guard against such exploits before they happen. Ordinarily, when a researcher detects that a software program contains a potential security issue, he or she will notify the software vendor so they can fix the code and distribute a patch or software update. The hope with a zero-day vulnerability is that even if an attacker hears about the vulnerability, it will take time to figure out how to exploit it without being detected -- and meanwhile, the fix will have been made available. Anti-malware software, intrusion detection systems (IDSes) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSes) are often ineffective against zero-day attacks because the attacks do not yet have a known signature. One of the best ways to detect a zero-day attack is simply to monitor network logs. Activities falling outside of the normal scope of operations could be an indicator of a zero-day attack. Other suggestions for mitigating the effects of a zero-day attack include: Keep all systems patched and up to date.Perform regular vulnerability scanning.Apply encryption and authentication controls to network traffic.Isolate sensitive traffic flowing between servers.Use network access control to prevent rogue machines from gaining access.Lock down wireless access points.Stay on top of security news. Zero-day vulnerabilities are presumably unknown by the software creator, so there is no way to patch the software to defend against the vulnerability. ",

            "answer_text": "A zero-day sometimes refer as vulnerability, it means flaws in the software, hardware or firmware which is unknown to the parties and they\u2019re responsible to resolve it. When someone detects any of the software programs consist security issue they will notify to the company about the same. They take some time to resolve it or patch it on an update, at the same time if any potential attacker heard about the vulnerability. They\u2019ll try to exploit it before the software company fixes the issue. So, Zero-day sometimes used in Trojan Horses, Viruses, Malware, Rootkits, etc. to distribute and harm additional systems, it\u2019s called ZeroDay or 0-Day. ",
