            "answer_text": "Yes, you can publish on social media, however the idea must be validated for technical feasibility and commercial viability before you put it forward to people. Also remember that there may be people who can be better in execution that you, they may execute your idea without even informing you. Therefore you need to first get the idea validated, build it yourself to the extent that it becomes easy for others to join rather then building it from scratch, then offer them to join as a team. Offer them appropriate equity and/or remuneration and you will be in a perfect zone to raise a startup. All the best for your future. ",
