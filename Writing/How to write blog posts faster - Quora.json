            "answer_text": "I am just laying down some ground rules here on How to Write Your Blog Posts Effectively. This may help you to write your blog posts a bit faster. I honestly believe writing a blog on a regular basis is a daunting task. Sometimes, having your general outline can help you kick start your juices and write that new blog topic which you really want to work on and eventually publish it on to your blog post. Do Your Research and Plan What You Want to Write About As a blogger, I usually take 2\u20133 hours max for writing a compelling blog article. It may take a bit longer or even an entire day if you are a newbie blogger. It may be a good idea for you to spend those vital minutes to plan out your post, i.e. what topic would you like to write about, what sort of value you can provide to your readers, how would your post be unique from other writers, and things like that. Make Your Blog Post Headline Catchy It\u2019s always a good idea to make your blog post headline look catchy. This makes it appealing for your readers to click on your latest article post and have a run-down of it. It\u2019s very essential to have a compelling title because more people will read your title than actually read your blog post. So, you need to have a title to help your readers want to read your blog article. If your title is not strong and interesting, then you already lost your readers attention. The first impression of your blog article title always counts. There is a say, the first impression is the last impression. Add Value to Your Main Content  Try to convey the message in your lead paragraph. Your lead paragraph should get right to the purpose of your post, i.e. what message are your exactly trying to convey to your audience and make it relevant to the reader. After the title, this could be the most important part of your post. If you take too long to summarize what your article to convey to your reader you may lose their interest. The main point here is to keep your readers engaged with your post and your content for sure should be attention-grabbing. Keep your content short, concise and keep it strong. Focus on what topic you want to write about and stick with the topic. Do not try to run around the bush and be vague with your content. Hope you understand what I\u2019m trying to say here. And as a blogger, Yes, thinking counts before you write your blog post. The point here is to be consistent with your blog post. Don\u2019t expect all and each of your blog posts to be a star attention grabber by your readers. Some of your posts may be getting less engagement and some or a few of them may get a lot of engagement from your readers and even a high amount of appreciation and appraisals. So, not every post is going to get your motor running. It\u2019s Always a Good Idea to Add Your Personal Touch  Adding a good personal touch is highly favorable if you want your audience to engage and connect with you. Start using more of \u201cI\u201d and \u201cYou\u201d when you are trying to convey a point to your readers. If you make your content like a textbook type material, chances are your readers will lose interest in your content and they will not be able to engage with you. It\u2019s always good and fun to put yourself into the post when possible. This helps your readers connect better with you. Try to share your personal experience or a twist with them and let them get to know you. Avoid Lengthy Blog Paragraphs If you have a run-down of all my blog posts (The Affiliate Hub Blog) I usually don\u2019t keep more than 4 sentences on each of my paragraphs. I mainly do this, to keep my blog article more scannable for my readers. Try to stick to three or four sentences per paragraph. If you do more than that, then your readers will find it harder to read and they may eventually lose interest in your blog article. Always better to write in shorter sentences. Bottom line, using shorter sentences makes reading faster. Keep Your Blog Post-Short and Concise Now some bloggers will tell you that you ought to stick to writing a blog article with at least 1000-1500 words. This is all rubbish!! Well, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad to have some longer-form posts, but not each of your posts needs to be at least 1000 words. You should strive to keep many of your posts short. To have a good SEO blog, it\u2019s good to maintain 400-500 words. How Reliable is Your Source of Information Now, this applies to a well-researched blog article which you want to write about. It\u2019s always a good idea to cite your information. Don\u2019t just come up with facts and figures/data without citing it. If you don\u2019t cite your facts and data, then your readers will not take your information seriously and eventually call it a B.S. and not come back to your blog website again. The main point here is the reliability factor and how good is your source? And finally, Always Add that Conclusion Make sure to write a Conclusion every time you use a blog post. And label that conclusion as, \u201cConclusion\u201d. Like this - To Conclude\u2026; Conclusion For me, having a conclusion keeps it really simple and your readers can scroll down, read your conclusion, know what your blog post is about, and decide if they want to scroll back up and read the rest of your blog article. Having a conclusion is a great way to have a reader pattern. Hope this helps! You may also like to check my other post on How to Think like a Blogger ",

            "answer_text": "People always ask me how the heck I\u2019ve been blogging for over 10 years. And how I\u2019ve written thousands of blog posts (4294 to be exact). I usually tell those people that blogging is like any sort of long-term relationship. Some days are great. Others aren\u2019t so great, but you\u2019re in it for the long haul. After several years of blogging, I realized there was a process behind it all. I learned how to cure blogging burnout, and I pinpointed the important things I was doing to keep up my blog. Identify and organize your tasks Stop and think for a minute: What do you do during a typical workday? By \u201cworkday,\u201d I mean the time you set aside for blogging. Let\u2019s say that\u2019s an hour a day. (If \u201cscrolling through Facebook\u201d is high on your list, your workday isn\u2019t as optimized as it could be.) You probably can\u2019t name every little thing you do during that hour, but it\u2019s important to be aware even on that tiny level. You could be wasting time without realizing it. You don\u2019t notice it, but it adds up. Even \u201cgood\u201d things like double-checking (or triple-checking) your work can suck time away from you. Here are some common time wasters, courtesy of Time Doctor:   But identifying your tasks isn\u2019t just about sniffing out wasted time. It\u2019s also about putting yourself on autopilot so you get more efficient at everything you do. So get out pen and paper or a new text document and write down everything you do in a typical blogging workday. Use timestamps to estimate how long each action takes you. Don\u2019t leave any small details out. If you refill your water bottle from 12:32 to 12:34, write it down. This sounds intimidating, but there are some big payoffs. First, if you\u2019re wasting time, you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re doing and how much time you\u2019re wasting. Then you can make changes to make your day more productive. For example, if you find that you spend 10 minutes checking Twitter at the beginning of your blogging time, you\u2019ll know you need to stop. Second, once you know what you have to do, you can structure those tasks. Try to break down your blogging workday into essential and nonessential tasks. Which essential tasks take priority over others? Map these out and find a way to measure what you\u2019re accomplishing during any given workday. Outline your post Before you write your post, you should outline it. List the main points you want to cover in your introduction, body and conclusion. Once you have the main points you want to talk about in the body section, break them down into subheadings. In this post, the subheadings are: Blog on your passionCreate a listSpin the titleOutline your postFill in the detailsEdit, tweak, and massagePost and shareConclusionMake sure your subheadings clearly describe what you are going to write about. This section shouldn\u2019t take you longer than ten minutes. I know you may miss some details by being efficient with your time, but that\u2019s okay. No blog post is ever perfect, so whatever points you have in your outline, just run with it. Use Trello Here\u2019s how you can use Trello to organize your tasks. If you don\u2019t already have a Trello account, visit Trello and click the big \u201cSign Up\u201d button on the first page. Fill in your information and hit \u201cCreate New Account.\u201d Once you\u2019ve created an account, you\u2019ll see this screen:  Click \u201cCreate new board\u2026\u201d Give your board a name (in our case, \u201cFacebook Ads\u201d).  You\u2019ll see an option to \u201cAdd a list\u2026\u201d But what exactly is a list? Trello uses two main components: lists and cards. Lists are vertical columns that hold cards, which are the smaller parts. In our case, lists will be for general categories, and cards will be the specific tasks for those categories. Add a new list and give it a name. Now you\u2019ll want to add your tasks as cards. Click on the \u201cAdd a card\u2026\u201d button at the bottom of each list to add a card to that list. Now you can customize your cards. For example, if you have \u201cFacebook ads\u201d as a general category, you could list things like \u201cchange CTA\u201d and \u201cincrease budget\u201d as cards in your list. When you click on cards, you can edit them in this screen:  Organizing your tasks will allow you to put your mind on autopilot. You won\u2019t be stressing out over every little task. Instead, you\u2019ll know how to navigate all the bumps that might get in your way. You\u2019ll be amazed at how much this process will improve your productivity. Write on the go Even writing in a cubicle is becoming outdated. This is especially true for bloggers. Bloggers work anywhere and everywhere. A desk at home, a coffee shop, a library\u2013\u2013these are all fair game for bloggers. In fact, I\u2019ll often work on blog posts when I\u2019m waiting in line or going on a car ride. (While I\u2019m the passenger\u2013\u2013don\u2019t blog and drive!) This is another reason you should carry a notepad or waiter\u2019s pad around. You need to be able to jot down ideas the instant you get them. The lesson here is that you can (and should) use any spare time you have to work on blogging. You might even come up with some new ideas you wouldn\u2019t have otherwise thought of. Blogging on your phone Phones are amazing. You can write, publish, and share an entire blog post right from your mobile device. I\u2019m going to show you a step-by-step process to creating an awesome writing process on mobile. You\u2019ll be able to automate a large part of your workday without any hassle. You\u2019ll need a word processor that\u2019s easy to use, and you\u2019ll also need to be able to access all of your files on the go. In no opinion, the best option is Google Docs, hands down. It\u2019s cloud-based, and you can sync files between the desktop and mobile applications. Google Docs gives you all the standard word processor abilities, and it\u2019s also insanely flexible. Every article you see on my blogs had its birth in Google Docs. Best of all, it\u2019s easy to use on mobile. A lot of time when I\u2019m taking an Uber or on a plane, I pull out my phone to work on my articles. If I start a draft, I just make a note of it directly in the title. And then I start typing\u2026  But what about the stuff you can\u2019t do well on your mobile device, like research or finding media? I typically make notes in the text of what I need, and I make sure it\u2019s bolded or highlighted so I notice it. A lot of times, I\u2019ll put stuff in brackets and then come back to it later. Then, when I get to my computer, I run through the article and find all the necessary research and media. This has saved me so much time. For a while, I wasted lots of time trying to do research on mobile. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s pretty difficult and not intuitive. This isn\u2019t the perfect process, but right now, it\u2019s as good as it gets. If you have a tablet, try to carry it with you as much as possible. I\u2019d recommend carrying a physical notepad, a phone, and a tablet everywhere you go. If you\u2019re pressed for time and need to jot something down, write it on the notepad. If you have a little bit of time, use the phone. And if you want to record more involved ideas, use your tablet or laptop. Automate your publishing schedule A blog post is useless if you don\u2019t publish it. More importantly, you need a publishing schedule that can be almost entirely automated. Too many bloggers screw up their schedule by not publishing on time. And they\u2019re not publishing on time because they haven\u2019t automated their schedule. You need to be able to painlessly schedule your posts, and I\u2019ll show you how to do that on a WordPress site. First, you should ideally write several posts ahead of time. I like always having at least a week\u2019s worth of articles at any time, so I\u2019m always a week ahead. Wordable allows you to export your Google Docs straight into WordPress with a single click. Yep, you read that right. And the best part: It preserves your formatting. Anyone who\u2019s pasted a Google Doc into WordPress can tell you how awful it looks at first. With Wordable, your formatting stays exactly the same. Once you\u2019ve got your content into Wordable, you need to schedule it. With WordPress\u2019s native options, you can only schedule one post at a time, which isn\u2019t ideal. So we\u2019re going to use the Drafts Scheduler plugin to schedule multiple posts at once. Once you have the plugin installed, make sure all your posts have been moved over from Google Docs. They should be drafts in the Posts tab. Next, go to Posts > Drafts Scheduler. Make sure Post type to schedule is set to Posts. Next, choose a start date for your posts. So if you wanted to schedule them for the week of the 12th, your start date could be that Monday, the 13th. Under Posting order, you can choose to either publish the drafts randomly or sequentially. I like the sequential method because I can arrange drafts in a particular order. Next, choose your post interval. This is a great feature because it\u2019s so flexible. You can make the post interval a few hours, a day, or several days. Finally, hit Schedule Drafts, and you\u2019re done! This entire process will save you so much time. The typical 500-word blog post takes about 1-2 hours to write and publish. With this process, you can shave off a nice 15-20 minutes. (And if your posts are longer, you\u2019ll save even more time.) Conclusion The best bloggers have action plans. They don\u2019t sit down and wonder what to do. They\u2019ve planned out every detail so they can get stuff done. You can be wildly productive and write much faster if you take the steps now to build a rock-solid foundation. I\u2019ve survived over a decade of blogging because I have all of these systems in place. Now, writing a blog post doesn\u2019t take much effort because I\u2019ve done it thousands of times. ",
