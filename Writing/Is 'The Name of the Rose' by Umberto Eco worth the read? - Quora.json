            "answer_text": "I read The Name of the Rose back in the late 1980s, when everyone I knew seemed to be recommending it. That was a long time ago and I have only read it once since then, but I still have a good memory of it. Umberto Eco had been a popular media intellectual in Italy for many years. His big thing was Semiotics which was very fashionable at the time. Everyone wanted to talk about Semiotics. All my friends went on about semiotics . Bearing that in mind when I began The Name of the Rose I was somehow expecting a very different book from the one I found., it was more approachable and less loftily intellectual than i had expected. However I really enjoyed the book which is why it remains in my imagination after all these years. It is in fact a very readable mystery set in a medieval northern Italian monastery. A monk William of Baskerville( an intellectual possibly inspired by the character of Roger Bacon) is brought in from another monastery with a young novice monk to investigate the mysterious death of one of the monks who appears to have fallen from a high tower - or was he pushed? During Baskerville\u2019s investigations more monks are murdered. I shan\u2019t give away any of the plot as it may spoil your enjoyment if you do decide to read it. Eco takes the idea of a popular mystery novel in a medieval setting - like say the Brother Cadfael books by Ellis Peters - but reworks it into something more intellectually satisfying. I am always aware, however, that I was reading the novel in translation and whenever we do this we are missing out on many of the nuances of the writing. I hope you do decide to read The Name of the Rose. I found it very enjoyable at the time and I am sorry that it now seems to be somewhat forgotten after its initial \u201ctrendiness\u201d with the cognoscenti. I would advise you not to bother with the film version starring Sean Connery. Much as I admire Sean, the film is pretty terrible and a poor reflection of its source material. The monks are presented as freakish looking things which is very distracting . I am aware that dramatisations of novels often have to change aspects of the original but the changes here seem unnecessary. Having written this answer I am now inspired to dust off my copy of The Name of the Rose and read it again. Hopefully I will find even more elements in it this time around. ",

            "answer_text": "Italian author Umberto Eco is definitely worth reading. When you\u2019re ready. Before the 1980 publication of The Name of the Rose, his debut novel, Eco was a well-published philosopher and Medieval historian, renown for his work in semiotics. In 1956 he published an in-depth study of Medieval theology called The Aesthetics of Thomas Aquinas. Before The Name of the Rose \u2014 which not only became a worldwide best seller shortly after it was published in 1980 but a one of best selling novels of all time \u2014 he wrote scholarly tomes like The Middle Ages of James Joyce and A Theory of Semiotics. So there is a great deal of density to Umberto Eco\u2019s writing. I was not ready for Eco\u2019s first novel. I didn\u2019t even know about it until the movie \u2014 1986 starring Sean Connery:  I wasn\u2019t ready to tackle Umberto Eco\u2019s brilliant work until I was fifty. And I\u2019m glad I waited. The Name of the Rose is a brilliant novel. (I enjoyed the film as well, but mostly because I\u2019m a Sean Connery fan.) ",
