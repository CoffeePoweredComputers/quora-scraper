            "answer_text": "Ofcourse. They do. Atleast programmers do. I believe 99% of the programmers who is associated with making something meaningful and relevant, (irrevelant example being, College coding assignments here in India, no one bothers to write code, just google it, find some code, tries to run it, mostly fails, submits as partial solution), everyone else do write something.  Ofcourse, there is a lot of help from libraries. If you are referring to, is there someone out there who write 100% their own code?, then the numbers might be very low. Everyone uses libraries. But just putting all libraries together wont get your job done. Libraries help you achieve a specific task. Say, you want image caching in an app you are making, you go find a library, You want to implement authenticated sessions in a website you are making, you go find a library. But the library will only have procedures on how to get the specific task done. You have to write code to fit the library into your own application. Now, a different case, I have published 3 apps in the google play store. Out of these 3, only 1 of them I wrote from scratch. The other 2 I found source code of similar apps I am trying to make for sale, bought it, customized for my needs and used it. On the first project, there was 5000 lines of Java code, in which I changed atleast 1000 in the initial release and added another 500 on new features in subsequent app updates. The 2nd app contains 4 times more. I didn't do it because I can't do these from scratch. This saved me a lot of time and gave me a good code base to work with. So it doesn't matter if you largely depend on some others code or libraries, unless you are doing something completely irrelevant like an exact clone or using scripts like to wordpress or vBulletin to start a blog or a forum, you would have to code something or another by yourself.  If you are reffering to stuff like wordpress, or vBulletin, then there is a very little chance that you have to write something on your own. A programmer would have done obviously more than using a script.  So, in summary, Yes. Programmers still write their own code. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually I think there is more writing of one's own code going on right now than in recent memory. During the most recent olden days, say 20 years ago, programmers indeed wrote their own damn code. I'm talking about the High Desktop Era. If you wanted hash tables you had to write your own damn hash tables. Everything was C++ if you were lucky; C if you weren't. The C++ standard library sucked at the time plus MFC sucked... (and in Macintosh world, well, Mac world was half-dead at the time so wasn't really a factor but even if you were doing Mac stuff I don't remember Metrowerks PowerPlant et. al. giving you a bunch of free functionality.)  Mostly you got reference-counted strings, a crappy wrapper around Win32, and some crappy container data structures from Microsoft. The rest you had to write yourself. Then the web came along. For a few years the web wasn't really about programming because web pages were static. You had some people who installed Apache and wrote HTML and called themselves programmers but everyone just kind of snickered behind their backs. That is, until those people took over, and Ye Olde Desktop Programming Job was relegated to the dustbin of history. Those HTML people were always comfortable using other people's code for things, and they changed the culture. Web programming was about various kinds of frameworks almost from the very beginning: I think, because of the way that the actual programming aspect of it ended up rolling out and because of the shallowness and similarity of the common initial use cases. Heavy-weight frameworks actually worked for most situations, so people used them. But that is speculation. I can however say with confidence that this early web era was the first time you could get a professional programming job in which you mainly just slapped together various libraries and frameworks. But lately things are changing again: (1) even the \"slapping together\" part of it has been sufficiently comodified such that it isn't really a job for programmers any more (i.e. one doesn't need a degree in theoretical computer science to set up a WordPress-based website for one's taco stand) and (2) the web doesn't matter any more. The browser-based web is not so much dying as irrelevant; it is about to go away as a cultural force. Mobile is the future and mobile is a different thing than web. Yeah, you have traditional web programming on the backend, but those client apps don't write themselves and are actually starting to get thicker not thinner which is a little surprising but nonetheless the way it seems to me. Mobile development is getting to be more like desktop development and less like web programming and is taking over. So it's the cycle of life or some shit ... but for mobile you mostly have to write your own damn code. ",

Of course they do, but they are not individually chopping down trees, turning those into 2x4s, forging the iron nails, using hammers and such.No, you use the tools available to the best effect, but then add on top of that all the things that are specialized. Now, you could also be asking about something I have seen in a previous job, a group of coders who lived by the mantra \"If I can't copy and paste it, it can't be done\".  For those people, they spent all day on google searching for code that did each task they were needing.  Less than 10% of the final product they made ended up being originally created code. You could also be talking about code generation tools.  That I have no idea on, none of the coders I have ever worked with used those. ",

I use a lot of code other people wrote. I can't help but do that. Certain tools are not worth re-implementing. On the other hand, not having to re-implement those tools means I am free to focus on more difficult problems that need the lower-level stuff. And on for those more difficult problems, I write a lot of my own code. Do I write my hash tables? My own linked lists? No. Do I design more sophisticated data structures and implement them myself? Yes. Do I implement my linear algebra tools? No. Do I implement my own differential equation solver? Absolutely! This is my research area! So yes, people still write their own code.

I've been an Enterprise Architecture consultant for over a decade, involved in fundamental decisions on Enterprise IT level, teaching and mentoring other Architects, occasionally running business-level presentations etc. I am also as technical as I was in 1988. With the complex tasks, say related to semantic integration of metadata and specifications, I believe it is faster to write than to try to explain someone what should be done and how.  Menuhin once said that he was playing Bach daily as a form of mental hygiene. For a technical person, that's programming - it keeps you grounded, it keeps you honest and focused. It takes you back to the basics. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a game developer and I use my own engine. It is cross platform,  pretty powerful, fast, extensive and easy to use. I have been tinkering with it for several years now. I occasionally use libraries or scavenged code when I have to, but in general, I write 99.9% of the code I use, even things like loading textures and rendering fonts. I am pretty hard-core old-skool about programming. ",

Yes, you can even make the OSX menu bar and the apple menu using code. ",

If the programmers created all of this code themselves, the project would have taken an extremely long time. For situations like this, resources like APIs and open source code are very useful so that programmers do not waste time duplicating code. But I agree with Random Blackburn, even in instances like this, original coding still needs to be done. ",

If you're not writing for your own personal satisfaction, whether it's your project or not you'll find that if you write everything yourself, then you have to test and maintain everything yourself. That's not a big deal if the code you're writing is inline with your primary goals, but if it's secondary to your goals, then these secondary tasks can quickly overwhelm the primary ones. e.g. Bob, can the users edit their characters yet? If your answer is \"No, but I'm almost done with this really cool compression library that they can use for their textures.\" You might have this problem. ",
