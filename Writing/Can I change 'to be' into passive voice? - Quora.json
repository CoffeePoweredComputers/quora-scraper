The agent acts on the patient. If the agent is the syntactic subject in the sentence, the sentence is in the active voice. If the patient is the syntactic subject, it is in the passive voice. There\u2019s a tree. There\u2019s a man. The sentence to describe the man (the agent) acting on the tree (the patient) can be constructed in either voice since both exist. The man chopped down the tree. Active because the agent (the man) is the syntactic subject of the sentence. The tree was chopped down by the man. Passive because the patient (the tree) is the syntactic subject of the sentence. ",
