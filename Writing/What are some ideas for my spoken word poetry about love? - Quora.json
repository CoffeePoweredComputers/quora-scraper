The love the poet holds within can now come to the fore, Such that new lines can then begin to build up and restore\u2026 To comfort broken hearts again, to let new beacons shine, To bring some light to guide all men or some sad Valentine\u2026 : The audience has no idea, just like that poet there, Who battles darkness making clear what\u2019s noble, pure and fair\u2026 No tainted words to stab or wound, to leave us high and dry, Or on some island left marooned, no rescue ships nearby\u2026 That poet loves to help Mankind, that poet loves to write, That poet shares what he can find, no matter, day or night\u2026 When time and space no longer seem the limits of all things, He sits alone, as in a dream, yet sees the King of Kings\u2026 : Then unto Him, that poet walks, in Heaven, up above, Thus with God\u2019s Son, he daily talks about this thing called love\u2026 \u2018What must I write today, my Lord? What must I write this time?\u2019 And then he listens, overawed, to hear truths quite sublime\u2026 With thanks beyond my heart or yours, that poet writes them all, God\u2019s wisdom shared so it assures faith for a miracle\u2026 Though doubters think all poets sad, my friends, if you but knew, The way God makes His poets glad when they do what they do! : Denis Martindale June 2017. : Denis Martindale Poems : ",
