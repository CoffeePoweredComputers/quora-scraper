            "answer_text": "Many (if not most) master's programs do not require faculty recommendations, and you can rely on your bosses for letters. I would advice academic recommendations only if they are required for the field of study or application, because they will be at least 5-6 years old by the time you're applying. The good news is that you have a couple years, which gives you plenty of time to start reaching out to professors you've had. Anybody you contact out of the blue to ask for a recommendation will have little to say about you. However, if you start building those relationships now, keeping them informed about what you're doing, and asking about what they're doing, you'll have real references you can use when the time comes. Not only will they be able to describe what you're doing with your life, and why you should continue your studies, they'll be great examples of your ability to proactively consider long-term roadblocks, and work around them.
