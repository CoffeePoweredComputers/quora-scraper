            "answer_text": "I agree with Jack Epner. But I would like to add that I would never bother sending an unsolicited script or treatment to an established production company. If they have specifically stated they are looking for samples from new writers, then send away with a nice cover letter. Otherwise do not expect your material to be read. If you do not have an agent, the next best way to approach is through a connection you already have to the company. Someone needs to introduce you or the material for maximum impact. Barring that, you simply have to make a call and ask who the best person to send a query letter to would be. Make the letter good, very targeted and specific to the person, and perhaps you'll get a call requesting the script or treatment, or an invitation to meet.  Don't ever go into a meeting empty handed, however, or even with just the one idea. If you are lucky enough to get an actual meeting, phone call or just a chance to send in your script, be prepared for the typical \"I like the idea but what else do you have\" response. HAVE SOMETHING ELSE. Also, before you send your script anywhere, please be sure it is actually good enough to send out. It should have been read by at least three other people not in your family, preferably with some industry experience, and it should absolutely conform to Industry Standard Formatting. If it shows even a hint of not being professional, most readers won't get through the first page or two. That often means a reader will flip through the script to look at the layout before deciding to even read the first scene. Just always present your material like you know what you are doing and you will stand a much better chance of success later on. And don't be disappointed by getting passed over or even having your work rejected. It's all part of the process. ",

            "answer_text": "Through an agent. Sending a production company an unsolicited script by yourself is tantamount to running up to a movie producer on the street and saying, \u201cHey I got this great idea for a movie you should check out!\u201d It\u2019s impolite, presumptuous, and the producer would be perfectly in the right to ignore you. An agent has industry contacts, and tends to know who wants what, when it comes to movie scripts. They probably have an idea of the tastes of certain script readers, and can generally match your script with someone who might like it. Of course, you\u2019d have to convince the agent to take you on first, and there\u2019s a cost involved for their services, but it\u2019s how things are generally done. Get used to the idea of unions if you want to work in Hollywood in any capacity. Almost everything is under some kind of union, and that means there are rules for everything, and you \u201cpay to play,\u201d or do any kind of business in Hollywood. You pay your agent, your agent shops your script to script readers, and maybe eventually you get paid for your script. ",
