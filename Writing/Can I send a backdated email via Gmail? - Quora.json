            "answer_text": "There are two different things Sending date-time and receiving date-time. You can somehow put sending date time of past in \u201cDate:\u201d headers, while using SMTP plugins through codes written in any PL. But you can\u2019t forge receiving time. As this receiving time is set by the receiving mail server and you have no control over it. So even in that case lets say for Gmail client, mail will be shown in current time (as per receiving time) but its sent time will be shown in past (as per sending time). I hope this will answer your question. ",

One very basic way to send an email with a previous date is to change your PC's clock to the time you are trying to simulate, and then send the e-mail. Some older e-mail clients like Outlook Express will accept this date and send it to the e-mail server with the local date and time. ",
