            "answer_text": "Yes, the e-Yantra lab actually make a difference in learning in SVVV as it provides a platform to the students who newly enters in this field of engineering and technology, to enhance our knowledge by thinking , implementing and innovating some new ideas and get in touch with the real world technologies. As along with the academics , it is required for a student to have soft skills such as presentation skills, communication skills, team work and thinking power to develop a approach towards a particular problem. So, it helps to develop the professional attitude as learning to behave professionally can't be learned in a day but it is a gradual process which is the prime demand to work in a corporate world in the future and also help to think something out of the box along with the acedamics acheivement and all. So ,e-Yantra lab helps to make the better career of students in SVVV. ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah!!! It really makes a lot diffrence in the learning. I m an btech cse final year student of SVVV. I had participated in eyantra robotics competition twice in 2 nd and in 3 rd year of engineering, and in eyanta idea competition for once . Though there are some issues at my team which never lead me to reach at finals still i managed to reach at semifinals of robotics competition. eyantra labs at svvv helps me alot in growing my knowledge in the field of robotics and certain diffrent life aspects also. So i must say it really makes diffrence in learning. The mentor are also supportive so that it is easy to get anything quickly.Here's the journey of mine at SVVV IIT Eyantra - Labs which makes changes in my learning.Reply Naresh Purohit53m ago \u00b7 1 upvote ",

Embedded systems and Robotics are subjects that involve multi-disciplinary approaches to problem solving with an emphasis on hands-on experiments. Due to lack of infrastructure \u2013 robotics labs to execute projects, or trained teachers to mentor projects \u2013 engineering students in India do not get the benefits of hands-on experience. e-Yantra Lab Setup Initiative is designed as a scalable and sustainable approach that addresses infrastructure creation and teacher training to create an ecosystem at colleges to impart effective engineering education.
