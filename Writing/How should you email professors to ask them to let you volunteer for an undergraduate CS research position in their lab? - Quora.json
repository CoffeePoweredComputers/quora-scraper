            "answer_text": "I recommend against volunteering for anything in academia. By volunteering, you undercut people with less money who have to do something that earns them money. Your time and skills are valuable and you should expect to be compensated in some way. Similarly, professors should not accept volunteers for those reasons.

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t email professors unless it\u2019s okay that they never see your email. And if that\u2019s the case, why bother? Professors get more email than just about anyone and I always went to see them in person.For the specifics in the details, working with a professor is probably not going to happen with a GPA under 3.0: those students don\u2019t have a strong grasp of the material and almost never attend graduate school. I\u2019ve never seen a case personally, and even a GPA under 3.7 was rare for me. One\u2019s time is better spent making sure one understands course material.",
