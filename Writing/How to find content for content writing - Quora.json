            "answer_text": "Hello Gautam, Thank you for requesting my answer to this. If you are willing to write content yourself, you can try searching for few blogs written by some great bloggers on the internet previously. You can take some overview and start writing the content. If you are looking for someone who can write content for you, you can check out some freelancing platforms that can give lots of options on content quality and the pricing. I hope this answer helps you. Your one upvote can encourage me to write more :) Thanks!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, To find content ideas for your blog/website, you can do the following: Read a lot of intellectual books. Here, I am not talking about the HOW-To Guides, but books which open your mind. These books should be something that help you brainstorm.Look for trending topics on Twitter. See if you can revolve a piece around the topic which is trending.Apart from Twitter, you can also explore other sites like - Pinterest, Reddit or BuzzsumoAt times, even daily conversations (through friends/colleagues/family) can help you click an idea.These are the only options that I am able to come up right now. Will update the answer as and when something new clicks up. I hope these websites I mentioned help you out in picking up fresh topics. Cheers,Manu Mathur [Content Marketer - Neil Patel Digital] ",
