            "answer_text": "No, we make fewer spelling and grammar mistakes. \ud83d\ude09 Actually, the answer really depends on what measurement. Per all words written, including rough drafts? Per all words written in a \u201cfinal\u201d draft to an editor? Per all words written, self-edited and published (e.g., on a blog)? And writers and authors of what level of experience? Daily writers, occasional writers, professionals? On one hand, we make more spelling and grammar errors than non-writers simply because we write more. It\u2019s like the famous quote from basketball legend Michael Jordan: \u201cI\u2019ve missed more than 3,000 shots.\u201d That\u2019s way more than I\u2019ve missed! So, if you put it into the context of quantity and proportion, and compare writers to all non-writers, I\u2019d say overall we make fewer mistakes. In other words, let\u2019s say the typical person writes 10,000 words in a year that *should* be error free (i.e., not texts or casual emails). Compare that to 10,000 words of a typical regular writer that also should be error free (again, like a blog post), and I\u2019d say the writer\u2019s words will be cleaner. To be clear\u2026 this isn\u2019t some self-perspective of superiority or that writers are naturally better at spelling and grammar. It\u2019s merely a matter of practice. I write and call upon a mental vocabulary of thousands of words every single day. I don't have to look up the word parable or acumen to spell them, because I just used them within the past few days. I don\u2019t have to remember to use an Oxford comma (my preference) or when to use a semicolon. These come to me easily, due to constant practice, the same way that Michael Jordan didn't need to think of the mechanics of his jump shot every time he took one. Now, all that said, being a good writer or author is not all about spelling and grammar. In fact, that\u2019s not even the majority of it \u2014 and an \u201cindustry secret\u201d is that there are many professional writers and authors who are absolutely incompetent spellers or grammarians. But that\u2019s because the essence of great writing is in being a successful communicator. Of course your ability to use the tools of spelling and grammar matter, but it\u2019s far more about your original thought and ability to convey it through the words. As such, writers and authors effectively fall into one of three main categories: teachers, persuaders, or entertainers. Your ability to connect with your intended audience and accomplish your goal (teach, persuade, and/or entertain) is what defines success. Part of the reason spelling and grammar matter less is because we have editors and proofreaders (unless it\u2019s self-published content, like a Medium article or Quora answer). Editors and proofreaders refine the art of the writing \u2014 writers are creators; editors and proofreaders are improvers. The talents and skill sets behind each of these roles are quite different. This is parallel to directing and editing in film and video. The director is often the visionary, the creator, the auteur (note the similarity to the word author). And the director, like a writer/author, has an editor to handle the mechanics and details of the filmmaking process \u2014 to improve the final product. And last, back to editors\u2026 to give them a shout-out\u2026 their role is far greater than spelling and grammar. This is widely misunderstood among new writers or non-writers. As I mention above, the editor\u2019s job is to improve the writing to better connect it to its intended audience. This includes structure, organization, style, voice, continuity, and much much more than simply spelling and grammar. In fact, there are different types of editors (or editorial functions) because there\u2019s so much involved in the process. (I did not proofread this answer.\ud83d\ude0a) Thanks for the A2A!

Even mistakes relative to the quantities written will probably stack up to an impressive number of grammatical discrepencies per paragraph. I experiment a lot with language. I write first drafts where following my inner mind is such a haphazard race the likes of grammar, nay consistency, has little room in the process - that\u2019s what editing is for anyway. When looking at stuff readied for public consumption I\u2019d agree we\u2019re starting to look at a greater care and attention to well worded literature, but for everything presented to a potential readership there\u2019ll be at least ten things that won\u2019t (nor should) see the light of day, at least until it\u2019s been purged of its worst violations against grammatical decency. So no. I don\u2019t think writers make fewer mistakes. The farthest I\u2019ll stretch myself is mayhap suggesting many writers hold the potential for a greater vocabulary and theoretical knowledge of how conventional language works. That does not, however, guarantee we\u2019ll be consistently using our theory in praxis. ",

I simply tell a story, my way, I use spell check, I use google for the uncertain, and just keep my story flowing.

            "answer_text": "Ha! I don't know the actual statistics on this, but I can say that I have a large knowledge base of grammar, spelling, and semantics, and I always make mistakes. I would say that grammar is where you would find the most similarities and semantics the largest percentage in difference. Grammar is meticulous, with many rules and definitions of applied use. When I write I just go..then I will edit for mistakes, of which there always are. Semantics, the linguistic branch that involves meaning, are something that a writer would know well. Spelling is probably subjective, but a writer I would assume writes a lot, and therefore naturally has the most experience with common words. Unless we are talking about research papers or philosophical concepts, most writers use common words. ",

If they don\u2019t, and hope to communicate well, they\u2019d be wise to learn those basics.
