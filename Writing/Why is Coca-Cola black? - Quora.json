            "answer_text": "caramel coloring makes the soda very dark brown. this coloring has it\u2019s own flavour, as such is part od Coca Cola, or any cola type soda. Pepsi Crystal, a clear variant of Pepsi had (has?) a similar yet distinct taste, alluding to the importance of caramel as a coloring and flavoring ingredient. Hope this helps! (btw, caramel is basically just nearly-burnt sugar\u2026 well much more to the process than that) ",
