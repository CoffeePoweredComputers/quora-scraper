            "answer_text": "You will have an assistant in parking your car. In our place we have these guys called the \u201cparking boys\u201d they help by signalling to the driver if he still needs to back up more, and whistle when to stop. Also they signal to the other drivers that your car is backing up. The only thing is, you need to pay them. Not to much though, just some loose coins. the down side is, they\u2019re not everywhere, they\u2019re only in the down town area, so backing up on the rural areas can be a bit tricky, maybe not though since spaces are wide. Having a smart parking system is like that. But it comes built in to your car, and you can use it everywhere. The problem with these smart parking system is that it makes the drivers dependent. ",

            "answer_text": "My wife\u2019s escape had a parking system. My neighbor and I tested it. It could put the SUV into a parking place that was hard to get out of. Beyond that, I never used it. There aren\u2019t a lot of parallel spaces these days, and by the time I was parked, I\u2019d forgotten I had it. When I got my license, 1963 you had to parallel park for the driving test. I practiced for hours, I\u2019m still pretty good. ",

            "answer_text": "Having an automatic park system in a car, where you press the button and it parks in whatever space is there, would be brilliant. Some cars have half a system, where it'll reverse park for you but there are no full systems yet, I believe. ",
