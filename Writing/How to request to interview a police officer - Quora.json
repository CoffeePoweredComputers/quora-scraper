We especially like talking to citizens to answer questions and help in any way we can. We generally see either traffic violators, criminals, or people who have had a really bad day. Who calls a Cop when they\u2019re having a great day? So talking to someone that just wants an interview, or ask a question, is actually a pleasure. ",

If you try and interview an officer by surprise - such as catch them in the street - you will get very guarded answers and may not get the most articulate one of us. Ask to pop in and you\u2019ll get a pick of them, all willing to chat all day long. ",
