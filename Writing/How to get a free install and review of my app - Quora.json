You can post some articles on different platforms to advert your app, but it\u2019s not the easiest way, moreover doesn\u2019t work well. But if your app is new and you don\u2019t have experience at ASO and other things connected with marketing, then the most easiest and the most efficient way will be to buy installs and reviews from real people. There bunch of websites that provide this service. ",
