            "answer_text": "They can be used together in certain instances. But generally, one can be used in place of the other, with slight modifications.  \"Harry and Tom, as well as Mary, went to the movies\".  \" Harry, Tom and Mary went to the movie.\"  But, in this instance, you can't say \"Harry, Tom, as well Mary went to the movies. \" However, you CAN say, \"Harry, as well as Mary and Tom, went to the movies.  A more appropriate use of \" as well as\" would be \"Harry as well as George went to the movies\". Notice that \"and\" could've been used there as well.  Hope that helps. Cheers! ",
