            "answer_text": "Keyword research can be tricky. On the one hand Google\u2019s keyword research tool is pretty much the main source of keyword traffic data. So, for keywords that people do ppc on, Google will spit out fairly accurate numbers. On the flip side, if people aren't paying to advertise for those keywords Google may spit out 0 monthly searches which can be deceiving. This is where you have to use google search's auto suggest and some common sense. Let's say for example you had a problem with constant hiccups and you wanted to find the best solutions. When you start typing into google \u201cGet rid of h\u201d it will show you the following.  As you can see, hiccups is the top result. Now let's just say that you plop that keyword into your keyword research tool and it comes back with 0 monthly searches. We know that is wrong because obviously people are searching for it, otherwise google wouldn't suggest it as our search. So that's why you should never rely 100% on keyword research tools. Sometimes you have to use common sense but also think a little outside the box. Put yourself in the shoes of the people you are trying to reach. What would you type into the search box when looking for the subject you want to write about? You also have to think about the difficulty of ranking for high search volume keywords. If there is a lot of monthly searches for that keyword, chances are high that there is stiff competition for that keyword. You can gauge a keywords difficulty by seeing how many ads are on page 1. If you see ads at the top and bottom of the organic search results, it's a pretty good indicator of good competition for that keyword. What about the organic results? If you see sites that are authoritative and we'll known, it will be tougher to rank for that keyword. In summary, if just starting out, what I would recommend is to go for lowest competition with highest search volume. You will have to target more keywords to increase the search volume but you will see quicker ranking when targeting the low hanging fruit. Hope this helps. http://www.socialgiantmarketing.com ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t matter. A keyword can have 10,000 searches or just 10, it still won\u2019t make any sense to target it individually. These days, you don\u2019t target just one keyword (as if it was 2007). You cover hundreds of inter-related keywords at once \u2014 both long tails and head ones. You see, around 40% of all searches are coming from billions of long-tail keywords. And those have less than 50 searches per month. Less than 50! Obviously, if you\u2019d try to target them one by one, it wouldn\u2019t bring you any traffic. That\u2019s why you should target hundreds of them with one piece of content. That\u2019s how keywords work in 2017. Let me show you an example. The keyword \u201cwebsite traffic\u201d is quite popular (duh..), its monthly search volume is around 10,000. So if you manage to rank #3 for it, you can expect to win 10% of all these searches \u2014 1,000 visits per month. But take a look at the search results for this query:  You see, a website that occupies the third position is actually getting almost 7,000 visits from this keyword every month. How come? You can see the reason for such a huge number in the next column. This single page doesn\u2019t rank for just one keyword \u2014 \u201cwebsite traffic\u201d. It actually ranks for 591 other keywords. Basically, these all 591 keywords have the same search intent behind them \u2014 people are looking for a reliable method to check website\u2019s traffic numbers. But there are hundreds of ways to ask the same question (see the list of keywords below):  So how do you rank for such an amount of keywords with just one page? Here\u2019s a basic workflow. When doing keyword research, don\u2019t just pay attention to the search volume of just one keyword. Check all the keywords ideas related to your topic.Collect related keywords into a huge list and group them by subtopics.Write a post that covers all of the keywords-based subtopics. You need to write up each section, making sure you go super in-depth to create a truly awesome post.A crucial moment here is that you don\u2019t have to stuff those keywords in your text. It\u2019s not necessary these days. Those are only ideas that you have to cover in your writing. Hope it helps :) ",
