            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. I haven\u2019t been a fan in 30 years but started watching again on the chance that they\u2019ll have Alec Baldwin skewer Trump. But even those are becoming dull. I guess you can only go back to the well so many times. And the cast is too big! I don\u2019t know half the performers when they do get 3 minutes of air time. How many are there nyway? 20? Back in the heyday they had 7 or 8 and they all had to WORK for their air time. Occasionally a writer like Bob Odenkirk would appear on stage or a filmed parody but you knew every member of the cast. So, having been watching again for the last 3 years or so, this season is definitely NOT better. So far into this season I can say I have laughed less than the previous seasons. The one spot I still look forward to is Weekend Update, when they don\u2019t add some cast members doing their bits. I never got that \u201cGuy with a boat\u201d thing. What\u2019s the ongoing joke there, Some pompous ass with a small penis? Oh, now I get it. Hilarious . . .NOT. Nope. NO Wayne\u2019s Worlds here. ",
