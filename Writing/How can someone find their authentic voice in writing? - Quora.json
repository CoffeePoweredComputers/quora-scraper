            "answer_text": "Find your authentic voice is simply a matter of finding a writing style that flows naturally for you and develops from regular writing. It involves your use of vocabulary, use of grammar, and the way you construct sentences and dialog. Learn the rules, then break them creatively until it all \u2018clicks\u2019. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment with different styles, points of view, types of story, genre, writing tenses, characters etc. In fact, the more you experiment the better. Realising you have a voice to your writing is a real confidence booster \u2013 it is a style unique to you. Some will find their \u2018voice\u2019 quickly, some will take a long time to find it, some will change their \u2018voice\u2019 as they change character or genre. There are no hard and fast rules.
