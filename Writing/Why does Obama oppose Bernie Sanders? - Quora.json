            "answer_text": "Because he knows him\u2026 Unlike any of Bernie\u2019s Quora fans, Barack Obama has actually met Bernie Sanders. He knows him well. He knows him better than any of Bernie\u2019s Bros ever will. And I don\u2019t think he likes him personally. I don\u2019t think A LOT of Democratic politicians like Bernie personally. Barney Frank has said that Bernie has a tendency to lecture even people who agree with him, and alienate even people who are ready to vote for his bills. There is something \u201cholier than thou\u201d about Bernie Sanders that rubs rank-and-file Democrats the wrong way, and NOT just \u201ccorporate\u201d ones. But\u2014of course\u2014to Bernie\u2019s fans, anyone who opposes Bernie does so solely and exclusively because they are Wall Street-owned sell-outs. In 2016, all the \u201cBernie Bros\u201d were saying they weren\u2019t sexist against Hillary because they liked Elizabeth Warren for President. Now she is actually running for President and the same people are saying \u201cNever Warren.\u201d To them, there is NO ONE in politics they like better than Bernie Sanders, and that cult of personality (especially one that has such a disdain for the Democratic Party) is scary to any Democratic politician who is not actively in love with Bernie Sanders.

            "answer_text": "Obama is owned by the oligarchs. Bernie Sanders stood for working people and Obama stands for the rich. Early in his administration, Obama had the money to either forgive mortgages and save black people from foreclosure or artificially jack up the stock market and help mostly white people who were making over 250000 a year. Obama chose to help the mostly white people who were rich and let working mostly black people fall into poverty. This was the final proof that the Democrats are for the rich and are against people who work for a living. This is why Bernie Sanders decided that he had to run for president and why the Democrats fixed the nomination for Hillary Clinton. Unless people do there own research they will believe the last source that they heard and that will always be the corrupt news outlets. Here is what the Democrats stand for.   ",
