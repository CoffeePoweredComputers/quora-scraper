            "answer_text": "Hi. Good question; both terms are usually referred to in tandem and thats why many people aren't clear on what falls into the literary technique category as opposed to a literary device. Because words are inherently paradoxical (they're nothing more than structured symbols organized according to rules of a particular language, yet they are the foundation human communication and harness immense power power (even more so when they're written)), clarying literary devices and techniques is never a simple task. Most authors/writers usually don't have the luxury of being present when their work is read, so they must use words to convey the complex and vast range of situations, emotions, senses, understandings, and states of being that human may experience and/or react to. Literary devices are standard writing mechanics that are used to enhance an idea, thought, or feeling that a writer wishes to express. Unlike oration, where the speaker\u2019s tone of voice and body gestures, or lack thereof, often add (or detract) from the meaning of the words being spoken, authors must rely on literary devices and/or techniques to enhance the written word. The best way to differentiate between literary devices and techniques is to think of anything that is written is a house (structure) that was crafted (built) by a carpenter (author) for a specific purpose (educate, entertain, criticize, etc.). Literary devices are the items that the author chooses to focus on to best suit the purpose of the house. There are only six (6) areas that writers create and/or focus on or else theyre doing something else; not writing\u2026 Just as carpenters can only work on constructing certain things else what is created will not look like a house (I.e. kitchen, living room, bathroom, bedrooms, etc). The most universal literary devices are characterization, theme, plot, mood, tone and setting. Writers can use all of the former or just one. Literary techniques, on the other hand, are how the writer chooses to construct the literary device(s). Just like a carpenter might decide to craft a living room that is sunken and contains a spiral staircase, so might an author describe the setting of a character\u2019s hometown using an extended mixed metaphor and an alliteration. Easiest way to remember: devices are what\u2019s being developed and techniques are how the writer is choosing to develop that device. Another way is DEVICE has 6 letters and there are 6 literary devices; TECHNIQUES begins with \u2018T\u2019 and they are the specific tools used by authors. How effectively/creatively/purposefully etc. an author chooses the myriad of techniques and device combinations is ultimately separates excellent writers from mediocre ones. My apology for the lengthy reponse, but I wanted to answer your question thoroughly but without all the jargon that can impede clarity. ",
