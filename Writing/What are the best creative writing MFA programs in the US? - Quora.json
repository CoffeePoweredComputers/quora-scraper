            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll tell you what I know about this. There are many prestigious creative writing MFA programs, including the ones mentioned below, but also including Columbia, U. of Alabama, Vanderbilt, Purdue, U. Houston, Cornell, and many others. There are also extremely selective schools. They are mostly the same schools, but some schools get a boost because of their location (NYC, California, etc.), or offer generous financial aid. You can find lists of prestigious or selective schools pretty easily. But neither of those attributes mean they are the \u201cbest.\u201d They usually mean they have the most famous writers on the faculty. They tells you nothing about how well they teach students to write. Nor whether those famous writers will pay any attention to you, or even teach any classes. Nor how much financial aid the schools provide (that is especially important because the degree is essentially worthless, in a future earnings sense.) Nor about whether they actually teach something that you want to learn. So let me compare two schools. The Iowa Writer\u2019s Workshop in Iowa City is the oldest and probably the most famous writing school in the US. If you go there, supposedly agents seek you out, instead of the opposite. Many famous writers have taught there, and have graduated from there. But here are more facts. It is large; it takes about 50 new students a year. Financial aid is not universal; grants go to some students and not others. And that information (about who gets which grant) is PUBLIC, meaning you all know which students were deemed more desirable than others, which seems designed to promote competition, jealousy and inferiority. And anecdotally, I hear it is not the warmest, most comfortable place for students. The focus is on poetry and fiction (meaning Literature with a capital L.) They have added a nonfiction section or division, but it seems not to be part of the regular Workshop. There is no genre fiction like sci-fi, mystery, etc. Compare that to the Iowa State MFA in Creative Writing and the Environment (in Ames.) It is small, taking about six students a year. Every student is guaranteed a tuition waiver and I believe a stipend (a salary.) It offers a particular focus on nonfiction writing, especially environmental writing. Which is the \u2018best\u201d school? You can go to the Iowa Workshop, possibly spend a lot of money (which might take decades to earn back), maybe study with some big names (or be ignored by them), regretfully put aside your interest in, say, science fiction, and get a big name degree. Or you can go to Iowa State, come out with zero debt, study with possibly lesser known writers (though they are no slouches,) and be more or less guaranteed that you will get close personal attention from your teachers. If you are interested in environmental nonfiction, it will feed that interest far better than the Iowa Workshop. And that is two Iowa schools. Consider that Columbia (a top-ranked school) is in New York City, and your rent might be $4K a month, and you might get no financial aid other than loans. Also consider (again) that an MFA qualifies you to teach as an adjunct in a community college, or maybe be a part-time instructor in undergrad composition, or teach literature in a high school. Even those jobs are hard to find. The joke is that with an undergrad degree in geology and an MFA, you can get an entry-level job in geology. Another anecdote: the University of Denver has probably the top PhD program in creative writing in the country (but no MFA.) In other words, it is a frankly academic degree, intended to send grads into jobs as creative writing professors. But in three years, I know of only one PhD grad who got a job as a creative writing prof. Just one. I know creative writing professors who consider most MFA\u2019s a cash cow for the universities, much like law school, but even more exploitative. They don\u2019t even want an MFA program in their universities. In that context, \u201cbest\u201d might not be your most important consideration. Maybe a better criterion would be \u201cbest for you and your needs.\u201d Maybe an even better one is \u201cdoesn\u2019t actually screw you.\u201d And keep in mind that many of the best writers in history didn\u2019t get an MFA. Also consider that there are hundreds of books on writing, and although some of them suck (and some professors suck too), even the most expensive book is cheaper than just a few days of grad school.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m wary of the term best for multiple reasons. Best in what genre? Best by what measurement? Best for whose needs? For instance, in my case 30 years ago, best for me included the opportunity to study with certain teachers/ writers and then I chose my program based on the money and opportunity to teach. It wasn't rated the best program at the time, but I got a full time college teaching gig 5 months out of grad school and I've published numerous books of poems, prose poems, fiction, and even a textbook on poetry writing. That said, many people choose programs because they are close to where they live as they are unable to relocate. I teach in a low residency MFA at Carlow (a terrific program) but like many low-res programs it doesn't offer much in scholarship help so the qualify of its mentorship and the terrific opportunity it offers to study in Dublin is offset by the cost. \u201cBest\u201d is ultimately a subjective term. I know someone who went to NYU to study with a terrific poet only to discover he was on sabbatical for a year. Another friend went to Iowa (often considered the \u201cbest\" program for years) and found the atmosphere toxic (she went on to be a famous writer). Another went to Michigan only to learn the author she wanted to work with had left, and the program hasn't informed her he was leaving them though she told the program she chose it to study with him. Metrics like publishing rates, etc. give useful data, but they only tell part of the story. Consider what your needs are, then work from there. You'll find the program best for you. ",
