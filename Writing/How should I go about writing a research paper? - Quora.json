            "answer_text": "A research proposal describes what you will investigate, why it\u2019s important, and how you will do the research. The format of a research proposal varies between fields, but most proposals should contain at least these elements: Cover pageIntroductionLiterature reviewResearch designReference listThere may be some variation in how the sections are named or divided, but the overall goals are always the same. This article takes you through a basic research proposal template and explains what you need to include in each part. Purpose of a research proposal Academics often have to write research proposals to get funding for their projects. As a student, you might have to write a research proposal to get your thesis or dissertation plan approved. All research proposals are designed to persuade someone \u2014 such as a funding body, educational institution, or supervisor \u2014 that your project is worthwhile. Research proposal aims Relevance Convince the reader that your project is interesting, original and important Context Show that you are familiar with the field, you understand the current state of research on the topic, and your ideas have a strong academic basis Approach Make a case for your methodology, showing that you have carefully thought about the data, tools and procedures you will need to conduct the research Feasibility Confirm that the project is possible within the practical constraints of the programme, institution or funding How long is a research proposal? The length of a research proposal varies dramatically. A bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s thesis proposal can be just a few pages, while proposals for PhD dissertations and research funding are often very long and detailed. Although you write it before you begin the research, the proposal\u2019s structure usually looks like a shorter version of a thesis or dissertation (but without the results and discussion sections). Download the research proposal template Title page Like your dissertation or thesis, the proposal will usually have a title page that includes: The proposed title of your projectYour nameYour supervisor\u2019s nameThe institution and departmentCheck with the department or funding body to see if there are any specific formatting requirements. Abstract and table of contents If your proposal is very long, you might also have to include an abstract and a table of contents to help the reader navigate the document. What can proofreading do for your paper? Scribbr editors not only correct grammar and spelling mistakes, but also strengthen your writing by making sure your paper is free of vague language, redundant words and awkward phrasing.   See editing example Introduction The first part of your proposal is the initial pitch for your project, so make sure it succinctly explains what you want to do and why. It should: Introduce the topicGive background and contextOutline your problem statement and research question(s)Some important questions to guide your introduction include: Who has an interest in the topic (e.g. scientists, practitioners, policymakers, particular members of society)?How much is already known about the problem?What is missing from current knowledge?What new insights will your research contribute?Why is this research worth doing?If your proposal is very long, you might include separate sections with more detailed information on the background and context, problem statement, aims and objectives, and importance of the research. Literature review It\u2019s important to show that you\u2019re familiar with the most important research on your topic. A strong literature review convinces the reader that your project has a solid foundation in existing knowledge or theory. It also shows that you\u2019re not simply repeating what other people have already done or said. In this section, aim to demonstrate exactly how your project will contribute to conversations in the field. Compare and contrast: what are the main theories, methods, debates and controversies?Be critical: what are the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches?Show how your research fits in: how will you build on, challenge, or synthesize the work of others?If you\u2019re not sure where to begin, read our guide on how to write a literature review. Research design and methods Following the literature review, it\u2019s a good idea to restate your main objectives, bringing the focus back to your own project. The research design or methodology section should describe the overall approach and practical steps you will take to answer your research questions. Methodology in a research proposal Research type Will you do qualitative or quantitative research?Will you collect original data or work with primary or secondary sources?Is your research design descriptive, correlational, or experimental?Sources Exactly what or who will you study (e.g. high school students in New York; Scottish newspaper archives 1976-80)?How will you select subjects or sources (e.g. random sampling, case studies)?When and where will you collect the data?Methods What tools and procedures will you use (e.g. surveys, interviews, observations, experiments)?Why are these the best methods to answer your research questions?Practicalities How much time will you need to collect the data?How will you gain access to participants or sources?Do you foresee any potential obstacles, and how will you address them?Make sure not to simply write a list of methods. Aim to make an argument for why this is the most appropriate, valid and reliable approach to answering your questions. Implications and contribution to knowledge To finish your proposal on a strong note, you can explore the potential implications of the research for theory or practice, and emphasize again what you aim to contribute to existing knowledge on the topic. For example, your results might have implications for: Improving processes in a specific location or fieldInforming policy objectivesStrengthening a theory or modelChallenging popular or scientific assumptionsCreating a basis for further researchReference list or bibliography Your research proposal must include proper citations for every source you have used, and full publication details should always be included in the reference list. To create citations quickly and easily, you can use our free APA citation generator. In some cases, you might be asked to include a bibliography. This is a list of all the sources you consulted in preparing the proposal, even ones you did not cite in the text, and sometimes also other relevant sources that you plan to read. The aim is to show the full range of literature that will support your research project. Research schedule In some cases, you might have to include a detailed timeline of the project, explaining exactly what you will do at each stage and how long it will take. Check the requirements of your programme or funding body to see if this is required. Example research schedule Research phase Objectives Deadline 1.

Revision Redraft based on feedbackGet supervisor approval for final draftProofreadPrint, bind and submit28th August Budget If you are applying for research funding, you will probably also have to include a detailed budget that shows how much each part of the project will cost. Make sure to check what type of costs the funding body will agree to cover, and only include relevant items in your budget. For each item, include: Cost: exactly how much money do you need?Justification: why is this cost necessary to complete the research?Source: how did you calculate the amount?To determine your budget, think about: Travel costs: do you need to go to specific locations to collect data? How will you get there, how long will you spend there, and what will you do there (e.g. interviews, archival research)?Materials: do you need access to any tools or technologies? Are there training or installation costs?Assistance: do you need to hire research assistants for the project? What will they do and how much will you pay them? Will you outsource any other tasks such as transcription?Time: do you need to take leave from regular duties such as teaching? How much will you need to cover the time spent on the research?Revisions and Proofreading As in any other piece of academic writing, it\u2019s essential to redraft, edit and proofread your research proposal before you submit it. If you have the opportunity, ask a supervisor or colleague for feedback. For the best chance of approval, you might want to consider using a professional proofreading service to get rid of language errors, check your proposal\u2019s structure, and improve your academic style.

            "answer_text": "There are plenty of different ways to do this so you will probably want to try some out until you find one that works for you. The approach I take is to state my research question. What am I trying to demonstrate? For example, a well-grounded approach is to state something you are testing quantitatively as a null hypothesis. That is, you state \u201cFactor X is not related to outcome Y.\u201d This does not mean that you thing X doesn\u2019t cause Y, but it provides a well-grounded statement that can be clearly tested. Then you propose how you intend on proving this: \u201cTo test this hypothesis, we propose doing the following experiment and analyzing our results.\u201d Then you carry out the experiments and you evaluate the data. If the data show it is likely there is a relationship, you have disproven the null hypothesis and can begin speculating about deeper meaning in your finding. In my experience, many people are uncomfortable with this approach because they want a positive outcome (that is they wish to prove their hypothesis, not disprove it.) A strength of the null-hypothesis approach is that it tends to help combat various biases that naturally creep into research, such as confirmation bias. But perhaps your research paper isn\u2019t really quantitatively focused. In that case, you need to make your research statement explain why someone might care. \u201cThis novel approach to solving the X problem demonstrates a simpler technique that is more general and more efficient than prior work in this field.\u201d One video I like on this topic that is relevant to my field is by Simon Payton Jones of Microsoft Research. I\u2019m assuming you have read other papers in your field. Try to identify the papers that you liked reading - what did you like? What did you not like about other papers. A well-written research paper should catch the reader\u2019s attention quickly - that\u2019s the purpose of the introduction. Then it should explain the work - how you did it and why you did it. Someone in the field should have a good sense of the strengths and weaknesses of your work by the time your done. If you have a quantitative aspect, you should include that as well. At some point (some like to do it early, others late) you should discuss prior work in the field and why your work is different. If you want to discuss future possible work, do so. Conclude by tying everything together for the reader. When you review your own work, try to put yourself in the position of someone who is an expert in the field and wants to poke holes in your position. What are your weak spots? How would you ask the tough questions? Don\u2019t fix them as you read, just try to be a critic. This is challenging, but useful - being able to critic your own work. Then revise it. Address those concerns. Rewrite it so it seems solid to you. Then go over it again and make sure it flows. Does it catch your attention? Does it keep you moving through the story? Does it overreach and claim to contribute more than is really justified? Does it under-reach and claim less than it should. Once you think it is good, it is time to get some external comments. Someone who knows your field is great. Someone who doesn\u2019t know your field is great as well. In the ideal paper, you\u2019ll be able to offer something to both of them. Make sure you keep your writing approachble (for the non-field expert) but don\u2019t sacrifice a defensible useful position (for the expert). Sound like a tough balancing act? It is. Why would you do that? Because odds are your work will be reviewed by both. If both find something good about your work, it\u2019s more likely to be accepted. If one likes it and the other doesn\u2019t, it depends upon which one feels more strongly about the paper. If they both dislike it, you won\u2019t be accepted. Keep in mind, you can\u2019t really write the perfect research paper. The reviewers will be humans and they will have their own biases. For example, if you get an expert in the field who disagrees with your findings, it is more likely they will dislike your paper. There\u2019s not much you can do about it. Sometimes that can work in your favor, depending upon the venue. When your paper gets rejected, you\u2019re going to be angry and hurt. You\u2019ll read the reviewer\u2019s comments and say \u201cthis person just did not get what I was saying\u201d or \u201cwow, what a jerk\u201d. Let the visceral reaction fade. Then go back and look at your work and address their comments. If they didn\u2019t get what you are saying, look at how you said it. Make it clearer. If you really disagree with a comment, figure out how to make that clear in your writing. Then submit it again. Good luck! ",
