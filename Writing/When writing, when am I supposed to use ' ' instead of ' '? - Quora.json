            "answer_text": "It all depends on the accepted style of the country you are writing in, who is your publisher/editor, what style of writing you are presenting, and what your readers accept. Double quotes \u201c\u201d used to be the only acceptable option. However, since the rise of the typewriter (remember those) and the computer keyboard, it has become much more acceptable, outside the United States, to use single quotes \u2018\u2019. This is because it is quicker, when touch typing to hit the Single Quote key than to hold down the Shift Key and then reach to the Double Quote key. You can, of course, programme your computer to replace single quotes with double quotes or or use Find And Replace to change all your single quotes to double quotes in one go at the end of the piece - being wary, of course, if you have used quotes within quotes. In the UK, a novel written in single quotes is quite acceptable, provided your use of double or single quotes is consistent throughout the novel. This is because there is no quotes-within-quotes rule in British English. If you are publishing in the United States, you have no option, you must use double quotes. This is because US grammar has a quotes-within-quotes rule where it is acceptable to use single quotes for reported speech within direct speech: Sheila said, 'Bobby told me, \"I love you,\" and I said, \"I love you too.\"' Hope this helps Nick ",

            "answer_text": "instead basically means \"in the place of\" or \"alternatively\". 1) The word \"actually\" or \"really\" would be more appropriate here, as no one is choosing between a small New York and a big New York, they are affirming the fact that it is a big city, not a small one. \"Really\" and \"Actually\" emphasis this. 2) I would rather use a real gun to shoot an alien/aliens instead of using a water gun. 3) Again there is no choice in the sentence between beauty and darkness. There is no alternative, just fact. I would probably use \"although\" here to contrast my opinion and the opinion of my friends. 4) In this sentence, \"instead\" would only be necessary if you said instead of what in the same sentence: \"I prefer to have an ice cream instead of potato chips.\"  Also, \"I'd rather have...\" would be more natural here than \"i prefer...\" I hope this is helpful to you.
