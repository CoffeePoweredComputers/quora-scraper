            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the thing to remember: people can\u2019t rewind your speech. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re reading a book, and you come across this sentence: While the men made bullets and the women lint, while a large saucepan of melted brass and lead, destined to the bullet-mould smoked over a glowing brazier, while the sentinels watched, weapon in hand, on the barricade, while Enjolras, whom it was impossible to divert, kept an eye on the sentinels, Combeferre, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly, Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and some others, sought each other out and united as in the most peaceful of days of their conversations in their student life, and, in one corner of this wine-shop which had been converted into a casement, a couple of paces distant from the redoubt which they had built, with their carbines loaded and primed resting against the backs of their chairs, these fine young fellows, so close to a supreme hour, began to recite love verses. (from Les Miserables) Hold on, what? But it\u2019s okay, you can just read it again, and again, and again until you get it. And if you don\u2019t know what redoubt means, you can look it up. Now imagine someone reading that to you out loud. And you get one chance to understand it.  The way people listen is fundamentally different from how they read. So things you can write won\u2019t work when you say them aloud. How do you cope? Use short sentences. If you have a bunch of independent and dependent clauses, your audience will get lost. Break up sentences aggressively.Use simple words. If you use words nobody understands, you don\u2019t sound smart, you sound incomprehensible. Plus, you want to sound relatable while you\u2019re talking, and big words make you sound like a robot. Writing a human-sound speech isn\u2019t \u201cchallenging,\u201d it\u2019s hard.Make your structure clear. You don\u2019t have section headings in a speech\u2014or if you do, you shouldn\u2019t read them. Instead, you should create structure by outlining your speech near its beginning, and repeatedly signposting where you are throughout the speech. \u201cNow that we understand the problems, let\u2019s take a look at the solutions.\u201d That sentence is super dry, so don\u2019t use it, but get the same message across.Be willing to mess with grammar. When you have conversations, you don\u2019t speak like you would write. You use figures of speech. Sentence fragments. And that idea you bring up at the start of your sentence, before you go off on some tangent so everyone\u2019s forgotten about it\u2014that idea is something you repeat when you want to say something meaningful about it. Be willing to write according to the rules of spoken English, not written English. It will feel weird at first, then quite natural.The most dry speeches ever are the ones where it\u2019s really obvious the speaker is reading off of a page. There are always two telltale signs of this: the monotone, quick voice and the convoluted, incomprehensible words and sentences. You fix delivery by speaking slowly, pausing for emphasis or structure, and varying your voice and facial expressions. You fix language by applying the tips above and writing like you would talk. ",
