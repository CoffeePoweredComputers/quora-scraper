            "answer_text": "Yes. For example, most of a first person book may take place in the present. But there will be times when the narrator needs to refer to something they did last year or discuss a tragic event in the past. I think what Neil Sarver is trying to point out is that you shouldn\u2019t be switching back and forth unnecessarily. They should only be relaying short points in time that clearly relate to the present moment. To avoid showing not telling, you should also be careful not to fall into the trap of having the narrator explain something that just happened in the past tense. Instead, the narrator should be living that moment in the present. If you get stuck and find yourself slipping into another tense, you\u2019ll find this article very helpful.

            "answer_text": "The only situation I would find myself in where I would use both past and present tense when writing in the first person would be if the story is generally told in the present tense. Then in some situations\u2014during flashbacks, most likely\u2014you would go into past tense to signify that you were talking about something that happened in an earlier time. To do it any different than that, from my perspective, would be confusing. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure! Your narrator is probably going to be talking about what\u2019s happening now and what happened in the past. You need to study published novels to find out what novelists do and see how they solve problems. You can go to your local library, pull novels off the shelves, and study the strategies the authors used. It\u2019s a great way to build your writing skills. ",
