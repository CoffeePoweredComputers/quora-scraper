            "answer_text": "I could not teach you comedy in a single written answer. I run classes to teach people this skill and there are so many techniques that I could share but they are likely to cause confusion at this stage. Watch comedy for great ideas. There are many you can watch on YouTube. Watching others often stimulates ideas. Someone shares about an embarrassing experience and suddenly you remember one of your own. Jot it down. Just keep writing. Key is not to judge your thoughts or be too self critical. In comedy, quantity is better than quality. You can always go back and pick out the gems. Jerry Seinfeld apparently wrote for a minimum of 3 hours a day. I can guarantee he didn't present original material for that long. He picked through the volume of his work and delivered the lines that he knew were likely to get laughs. The simple formula for creating jokes is: Setup -> Punch line Think about it this way: Predictable statements -> Incongruous statementGo along a predictable path and then deviate from that path. Example:\"I went to a doctor and told him that I hurt my arm in various places and he said I should stop going to those places.\"  If you wish to write a comedic speech, share stories and anecdotes rather than trying to put a series of one-liners together. Pick stories that your audience can relate to and have fun. Use hyperbole or exaggeration. The line, \"I am busier than a mosquito at a nudist colony\" is an example. Johnny Carson often used this technique. Here is one of his lines: \"The town was so small, the enter and exit signs were on the same pole\" The key is not to hold back. Be extreme: \"She ages faster than a day old bagel in a dumpster\" and \"The singer sounds like a parrot giving birth to a water buffalo\" It doesn't have to make sense. The more incongruous, the better.  Take a subject, any subject, no matter how small and see how you can expand upon it. Here is an example of a comedian exaggerating the size of a spider: \"There is a spider right outside my house that could serve, all by itself, as our NATO forces. This spider has erected a web that covers most of our property and contains wrapped-up food bundles the size of missing neighborhood dogs.\" Hope this has been of some help to you. There are plenty of resources to be found on the internet if you do the search but honestly the best thing you can do is let loose and have fun. Choose a personal story or experience and then embellish it and keep working it. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "From what I discovered from giving speeches in school, and from my own general knowledge, comedy depends largely on candor and timing.  A lot of comedians - Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Steve Carrell, the Broken Lizard troupe, and many mote famous names you would recognize - a lot of these comedians actually improvise many of their jokes.  That is to say, they make stuff up while the camera is rolling and it gets incorporated into film later. You asked about actually *writing* a speech, so I am assuming you can't improvise.  But it might help if your speech *sounds* improvised.  As you writr, try improvising a bit, to yourself.  Think about how you would say it.  Use contractions whenever you can.  This is comedy, not politics. (Ok, so those are kind of the same thing.) Try saying something random and unexpected.  I'm answering your important question from a McDonald's bathroom, for example.  You want it to sound like you're just making things up as you go, because it will sound much more natural.  As long as you seem natural to your audience, they will interpret whatever ridiculous things you say as comedy. Keep in mind they won't laugh at everything.  A lot of comedians might change their voice as a que so their audience knows \"what I am saying is a joke.\"  Don't expect people to \"get\" any references. Don't even expect them to laugh: maybe they're being forced to sit and watch you, and they hate it there.  If they do laugh, great, but it is more important for you enjoy yourself.  Comedy is all about that shared enjoyment.  And if they don't have a good time, at least you will. ",
