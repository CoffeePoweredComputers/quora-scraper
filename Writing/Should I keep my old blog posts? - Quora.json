Because it does show your evolution as a writer, in any languagethey will show Google that you've not just starting out, but have been writing for some time - which adds to your level of authorityif your old blog posts have a lasting relevance, they can still bring you traffic and new readerswhen we moved the marketing blog at our company from a /blog-URL to a blog.domain we took the content with us and even translated some of it, if it made sense. The original post still gets visitors: Interview zum Thema Content Marketing: 11 Fragen an Joe Pulizzi - and the english one as well: Interview on Content Marketing: 11 Questions for Joe Pulizzi So if you think your content still offers value to people interested in your topics, keep them and if need be translate them.

            "answer_text": "Hi Leonard, Great question! The short answer is: move them. It's nice to see that people who blog have been dedicated to blogging for some time. Especially when you look at their archives and see the first post was before 2009. However, if the first post wast not before 2009 you might consider a platform other than blogging. Most people need to have long established SEO in order to make a blog work, outside of having a record for themselves of their personal writing. I say this because I've had many of them. As some agents have said to me recently, is there something about the first blog that wasn't working that you are trying to remedy in the next? I have a feeling it's not language. And in fact, it could be the form all together, which is somewhat challenging since a blog post is essentially dead the minute you publish the post. ",

Possibly try to post from time to time and share posts from my new blog back to the old one (translated of course) and mine the good content from the old blog when ideas for new posts get scarce.

Eventually, Google will catch up and agree with you - it's getting smarter all the time. Your new audience are all English speakers. Some, but only a few, will also speak enough German to be able to read those other posts. Most of us English speakers are pretty lazy about learning languages, I'm afraid. We know foreigners usually understand IF... WE... SPEAK... LIKE... THIS ! So you should write for a primarily American audience, with an awareness in the background that your audience also includes native English speakers from Canada, Australia, UK, etc, and non-native/bilingual speakers from other countries. Ask yourself - would these people want to read posts in German, however fab they are?  Mostly not, but a few might. So there's your answer. Add a link on your About Me page to your blog in German, and write a post on your German blog explaining why you're switching to English, with a link to your new blog.  With any luck, Google will count these as inbound links! ",

Then people who come across one can also easily find the other German posts.  I find that I still get a lot of search traffic from older \"evergreen\" posts. These are posts that are still relevant even if they were written several years back. So you may have similar results.  While it is true that many native English speakers don't speak German (Mein Deutsch ist nicht so gut.) many German speaking people do speak English. So they may discover your blog through the older posts and then continue to read the new English ones. ",
