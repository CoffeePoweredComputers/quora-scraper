            "answer_text": "In terms of the note, there\u2019s no difference. The difference is only notational, depending on the scale you\u2019re performing in. For example, in the key of E-flat minor, the note would be called a G-flat, since a minor chord has the third tone a half-step down from its major counterpart. But in the key of D major, it would be called an F-sharp, because that\u2019s the note two whole steps up from the root. ",
