            "answer_text": "Guns are a tool used by humans on an occasional basis. Debate assumes either a pro or con stance. The first presentation defines everything about guns and if you choose the pro side, you explain, why, where, when they are used to advantage and then stored for the same advantage. Here the primary goal is to focus on benefits. Your second argument gives you the chance to answer any con statements made by an opponent, basically anything bad that could be said about them, showing these disadvantages can be offset by the benefits. Your summary should restate the two positions, while your intro points out where you intend to focus your evidence since a topic like this can be quite broad. You could limit your discussion to rural use for hunting, for instance, or just for target practice. Your main variables are people, which ones, level of training, needs, etc.Guns, which ones, which ammo, licensing, storage, etc.Use, where, how, why, and for what purposeThe possibilities are quite extensive and your research data to support your points are the most important factors.
