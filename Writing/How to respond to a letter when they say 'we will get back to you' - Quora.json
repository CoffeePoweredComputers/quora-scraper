            "answer_text": "If this is a response to a job interview, you need to call them and ask them by when they expect to (reasonably) let you know if you have the job. The word \u2018reasonable\u2019 is important here. If they are seeing 50 candidates, this could take them a while. Don\u2019t expect a response straight away as not everyone will have the time to do that, especially if they have a lot of applications. Be patient. How you behave now could make an impression that could add credence to your application or undermine it. Be professional, respectful, courteous - and human. They are human beings too. If this is from someone you don\u2019t know, you can ask them the same, but it may also be a way of saying \u2018we don\u2019t want to continue contact\u2019, so be careful to read their response properly. If it were me, I would call and ask for a timeframe, saying I have some diary issues to attend to, so a bit of a steer about response time would be appreciated and so that I can deal with these matters, and not be left hanging. If they are not forthcoming, I would not contact them again and move on. Be aware that some people are very bad at committing to giving responses and very slack at giving any at all. They come back late, have no sense of how this affects others and don\u2019t care. If this is the attitude you get, you need to think carefully about whether they deserve the flattery of your attention. After all, what does it say about a party (person or organisation) if they think only about themselves and don\u2019t consider that other\u2019s have lives to lead. I remember once I was contacted by a blue chip civil engineering firm and asked to edit a pitch for the building of an underground tube station/intersection in London. It was an enormous project and the edit was of course going to be appropriately involved. I made my conditions clear during the meeting, and gave them a rough quote (over-estimating). I followed up immediately in writing, including my quote, terms and information about when I would need to get the job in order to get the job done to their timeframes. They sent me a letter saying I had the job and should await further instructions. The job was about two months away. Plenty of time. I assumed they would get the paperwork done with me inside a week. I heard nothing. As time passed and the date - by when they should be submitted the text to me - neared, I wrote several letters and left several messages, saying the quote was only temporary, as agreed and everything needed to be firmed up. I clarified that I would need terms to be signed and agreed and that, assuming it would need to be cleared by several parties internally, we were now seriously short of time. I sent a final letter, by Special Delivery and Advice on Delivery, so signed, tracked and receipt of it at their end confirmed to me. They had two weeks to get all the paperwork done. Again, I heard nothing. A few days after the deadline for the start of the work had passed, I got a casual call, saying \u2018 we are ready to send over the job now.\u2019 I spent some time finding out whether there were any reasons for the delay. He could not come up with any. At this point I was actually very angry, but I let him have it, as it were, with quiet, deadly courtesy. I said I had delivered on my promises, but they had not. I said I had been professional at all times, but had no evidence that they were any of the things they had said they were. I said I didn\u2019t feel I could trust them and so a collaboration would not be possible. You could hear steam coming out of the man\u2019s ears on the phone\u2026 I drew his attention to my terms, and the dates of the several letters I had sent, and said that even if I wanted to work for them, it would be impossible as there would now not be enough time to complete the paperwork or do a proper job, and I had no intention of being put in a position where I could not deliver a job that was of top quality. \u201cHow dare you leave us in the lurch like this!\u201d Me: \u201cI have waited two months to get all the paperwork around this sorted out. You have no-one but yourselves to blame if you now have issues around it. You quite clearly didn\u2019t take this matter seriously. Editors are professionals like anyone else - or do you agree to build bridges without signing contracts?\u201d \u201cYou will never work for us again!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to work for you,\u201d I said evenly. He slammed the phone down. I have no regrets. Know your limits and know what you will say if you get a response very late. If you do hear late, let them speak first and do some information seeking as there may be some circumstances beyond their control which had a perfectly acceptable impact on timescales. But, do make sure you know the facts before you choose your response. If you choose to say no, then remember that sometimes a strong, but courteous \u2018no\u2019 is more devastating than silence or shouting. Best wishes. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWe\u2019ll Get Back to You\u2026\u201d Most of us have heard the Zuckerbergian response far too many times. It\u2019s become a household phrase in the world of recruiting. And although most of us would like to see it go, it refuses to give in. What does \u201cwe\u2019ll get back to you\u201d even mean? Let\u2019s try to decode what these guys may have in their minds while talking to you: \u201cThere are some other candidates we need to consider. If they are not as qualified or as experienced as you then we will get back to you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have the answer right now. I need to talk to someone before giving you the answer. Only then will I get back to you.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re not quite eligible for this position. Still, I won\u2019t say anything right now because it\u2019s not good manners to say so. That\u2019s why I need to use: I will get back to you.\u201d1. Try to prevent the situation in the first place Before you leave the interview, ask about next steps and the decision timeline. Try to get an exact date or date range from the interviewer. Ask directly: \u201cWhen can I expect to hear back about this position?\u201d 2. Take initiative If you\u2019re waiting for a response, sometimes the best choice is to be bold. Considering you\u2019ve sent a thank-you note some time ago, the next step is to call the HR department. Let them know about your continuing interest in the position and that you are eager to hear back. Without being too pushy, ask what the status of the position is. 3. Show dedication Yes, it\u2019s important to follow up and stay on the company\u2019s radar. But discretion always comes first. Feel free to call for a status update, but be consistent with just one method of communication. Calling, emailing and mailing at the same time \u2014 that can send the wrong message and put them off for good. ",
