            "answer_text": "Do you know anything about crime? How about policing crime? I would advise you to research your topic. Assuming that you already have a seed of a story in mind, get your rough ideas and thoughts and turn them into an outline. From your outline, get to your research. As crime revolves around the criminal vs. the law, it would be a good idea to gather as much knowledge as you can from both perspectives. Crime stories tend to be specific in their realism of how the law and the criminal function in society. Let me liken it to a game of chess. The idea is to outthink and outplay your opponent. Your strategy is to try and anticipate your competitor's reactions to your actions. In order to get away with a crime, the criminal needs to think one step ahead of the law. To catch a criminal, the law needs to think two steps ahead of the criminal. Why two steps? Because the law is garnered by certain morals and ethics to keep it functioning within the lines, whereas the criminal has no such compunction. With that in mind, set up the scene between your criminal and your force of law, and start to pit them against each other in different scenarios. When writing as the criminal, it is crucial that you are pulling for them to get away with the crime. You want them to be successful and to outthink the law. The same is true of the law. When writing their part, you need them to delve into the mind of the criminal in hopes of stopping them. You need to step inside your character and push the boundaries of the law until you come to the line you can't cross. As the author, you want them both to be successful until the game is decided, one way, or the other. ",
