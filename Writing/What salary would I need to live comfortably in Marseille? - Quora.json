            "answer_text": "French gross median salary is 2300 \u20ac/month. For a long term contract that is a net salary (on your account after taxes) of 1677 \u20ac. I imagine that you will want a two bedrooms recent flat with a see view and a large balcony (who would not ?). Such a flat can reach 800 \u20ac/month depending on the area. After I let you do the math according to what you consider \u201ccomfortable\u201d. It is more about you\u2026 do you plan to travel a lot ? do you like expensive restaurants ? Yes there is an Apple store in Marseille and the basic iPhone 11 is at 809 \u20ac. (Minimum Salary is called SMIC. Most jobs without qualification provide this salary. It is 1522 Gross = 1183 Net.) At this salary let say that Comfort and See view is hard to get\u2026. as a reference A BigMac Menu in MacDonald is 7,40 \u20ac Hopefully most of pleasures in Marseille are priceless:  Source : random google search of Calanques view ",
