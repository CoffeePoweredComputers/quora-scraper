            "answer_text": "If you update your content every week then you cannot rely on Google doing more towards your ranking. The Boss requires a period of time to test your page over and over to justify that your site is good enough for its ultimate position. So how often should you do it, I\u2019d do it 3\u20134 times if your Search Engine Optimisation skills are very good. If it is just correcting your spelling, then do it straightaway because this is a little ranking factor or optimising some images will increase loading speeds. ",

            "answer_text": "When it is necessary to do so. Follow the latest news and happenings around the topic that you\u2019ve published about and update your posts where there\u2019s something important that happens that changes things. I review my posts several times per year. I especially look at posts that actually get traffic as I want to make sure that those posts deliver a useful and relevant experience. It is not the best experience when someone lands on your post and quickly figures out that it is outdated. That\u2019s a quick bounce and these kind of things affect the strength of the rest of the site too. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your niche. If you manage a blog in the gardening niche, you won\u2019t need to update much. People are growing tomatoes and carrots the same way today as they did 15 years ago, changes in this niche are minimal. But if you manage a blog in the science or technology nice, you need to update a lot. The answer to your question is, you should update your blog posts when you feel it needs an update. I update an article if I see it starts to loose it\u2019s rankings in the search engines. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very good question! In fact I am guilty of not being too consistent at updating my old blog content. If your blog is already stable and getting a consistent flow of traffic, it is always ideal to update it once a week. However, it is very subjective to each individual blogger and it also depends on what results you are looking at when updating your content. ",
