            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give you a simple plan that you can follow to get started, but first, there are some things you should know. The internet is awash with advice about how to learn to blog successfully. Unfortunately a lot of it builds towards getting you to sign up for someone\u2019s course (via an affiliate link). The rest is usually a variation on the theme of getting web hosting (again via affiliate links) and setting up WordPress. However, both of these approaches cost time and money- and if you\u2019re just starting out, you don\u2019t have to do either straight away. The simple plan is based around acquiring two basic skills without which nobody ever makes a success of blogging. These are: Working out what you\u2019ll write about andLearning how to write consistently.At a basic level, these are the two most important skills to master. The first ensures you have a consistent theme or approach to your blogging, and that you\u2019ll be able to find your audience. The second ensures that you provide consistent content for your blog, without which no blog succeeds. The good news is that both of these can be done easily and cheaply. First of all, ask yourself this question? What do I want to blog about? If you already know, then great. If you don\u2019t, then the best thing to do is think about the things that you enjoy, you\u2019re passionate about or you\u2019re good at. If you\u2019re really lucky, you might have all three of those boxes ticked with one thing! This is important for one key reason. Your blog readers will come to you if you can help them with a particular subject. If your content focuses on this over and over again, they\u2019ll come back for more. If your content is all over the place, they won\u2019t stick around. So once you\u2019ve established what you want to blog about, you have to write consistently and regularly. Without this, you won\u2019t succeed. So how do you do this? My answer might surprise you, because it runs contrary to what many people will tell you. But here it is. Write answers on Quora. Seriously. It\u2019s the best way of getting started. The work is already done for you in terms of setting up the platform. All you have to do is create an account. Then start answering questions related to the subject chosen for your blog. This works because your answers don\u2019t have to be long. You can write a small amount each day, which will get you into the habit of doing this regularly. That way, your writing will also improve. There\u2019s nothing like getting stuck in if you want to learn a skill. You\u2019ll also learn what people in your subject area are looking for, which will help you to refine your blog when you come to set it up. Of course you should look at setting up your own blog. But you can save yourself a lot of time, money and stress by taking this approach first. ",

            "answer_text": "An Ultimate 12 Steps Guide To Start A FREE Blog On WordPress Sometimes you need a space to write about something so that you can read your writing later on or your writing could motivate thousands of people to be successful. The decision of writing blog posts was completely from the bottom of my heart. The best way to start writing is by creating your own blog. I have started blogging for fun when I was in high school. I had a passion for design so I started writing about modern architecture. If you are searching about starting a blog on WordPress, you have found the right article. I am planning to go over every single step to start a blog from scratch. When I started blogging, I wasn\u2019t sure how keywords work properly. I am talking about 2007! Anyways, let\u2019s go through the steps to start a blog on WordPress. A 12 Steps Guide To Starting A Blog On WordPress Step 1: Finding A Topic Or Niche Step 2: Figuring Out The Blog Name Step 3: Blogging Platform Step 4: Blog Hosting Step 5: Blog Design Step 6: Plugins And Necessary Stuff Step 7: Necessary Settings Before Creating Your Content Step 8: Create Main Pages Step 9: Create Forms Step 10: Content Creation Strategy Step 11: Publishing Schedule Step 12: Monetization Step 1: Finding A Topic Or Niche Finding a topic to blog about can be a difficult one. It takes forever for the majority of the people to find a specific topic to build a blog on. When I started my first blog, I just went with the thing that was interesting to me. I would watch videos on YouTube related to modern architectural designs. There were not that many videos available at that time but I would watch as much as possible. I wanted to become an architect at one point. But again, a blog topic has to be something that you are interested in. Maybe you are interested in driving, your blog can be related to driving. You may have an interest in cars, you can write blog posts that are related to cars. Now, People often try to find a short cut way to make money off of a blog. There is no shortcut way to make money off of a blog. In 2019, you need to put up great content to get google\u2019s eyeballs on your content. So how do you actually find a perfect topic or niche? Finding a niche can be difficult if you keep on searching \u201chow can I find a profitable niche to start blogging\u201d for a month. I have seen people doing that! They search for this question online and can not find a niche! You don\u2019t find a niche this way. I have told you before that your niche has to be something that you really enjoy doing or talking about. At the same time, it has to be something that people also search to find answers online. Here are my 5 tips to find a perfect blogging niche: 1. Write down 5 topics that you currently love talking about When I first started blogging, I didn\u2019t have time to do this. I just started writing on various architecture designs. I didn\u2019t know how to find a niche to blog about. I don\u2019t want you to be the same as mine. First, let\u2019s open google spreadsheet or excel spreadsheet. Start writing down 5 topics that you are currently interested in. For me, that would be driving, traveling, raising a kid, starting a side hustle, and my personal finance. Once you are done picking yours, you can start testing these topics before you move forward. Take a piece of paper or open Google Docs or Microsoft Word, whichever is convenient for you. I use google docs and I find it convenient. Write down 10 blog post ideas. You might be like, \u201cdamn! That\u2019s hard!\u201d Trust me it is worth it to write down 10 blog post ideas before you start a blog. Entrepreneur and blogger Syed Balkhi always recommends writing 10 blog post ideas on top of your head about the topic that you found interesting. In fact, he mentioned this in one of his blog posts that were published on Forbes. I know it\u2019s time-consuming and you will thank me later for this. If I go back to the 5 topics that I found interesting to blog about, I can write 10 posts on driving, raising a kid, and starting a side hustle. I can probably write about traveling hacks and tips because I have been traveling every year since 2012. But I did not document all the travels that I have done, so I wouldn\u2019t blog about this topic at the moment. Another is personal finance. Personal finance is a very broad topic. Majority of the bloggers and YouTubers are on this niche since it is very much related to your own finances. I would keep this topic aside because I can write about my saving skills, money-making strategies, and other cool stuff. But some people may not find it interesting or beneficial. For now, I would only pick driving, raising a kid, and starting a side hustle. 2. Research Now I have gotten the 3 topics that seem interesting to me. I would like to make sure I have researched enough to choose one out of these three different category topics. let\u2019s take driving. I\u2019m passionate about driving. I love driving so much that I drove over 18 hours without taking rest when I bought my JEEP WRANGLER from Florida back in 2018. If I go on google and type driving\u2026  I have seen the questions that people are asking for. I would love to answer these questions because I know how to drive safely, things to know before driving, and so on. I would be interested to write on these small topics like driving safely, beginner\u2019s driving skills, etc. I have picked three because I would start three different blogs if possible. But you don\u2019t have to pick three. You can pick one that is the most interesting. Let\u2019s try out starting a side hustle which is my niche on this blog. I am a hustler. I have been hustling since I was 15. I have been trying to establish my own business to help other people. As an immigrant, I have been to these difficulties that people face when they migrate to a new country. Starting a side hustle that doesn\u2019t cost much, can be helpful for every immigrant family that migrates to the states. That\u2019s why I\u2019m building a blog around starting a side hustle project where I can inspire college students, high school students, and immigrants who work 7 days a week to make sure they have food at home to start a project on the side that I can be a full-time hustle in the future. 3. Go for a smaller topic Looks like I am passionate about starting a side hustle. I don\u2019t know about you. But comment below if you have already found yours. Let\u2019s assume you found travel. Now, travel is a very broad niche. How did I find out? Google keyword planner \u2026. I also use free tools like SEMrush, Ubersuggest, KWfinder. Let\u2019s use the tool called Ubersuggest and see what comes up for the broad niche travel.  How about breaking the big travel niche into smaller parts and pick the part that is the most interesting to you? Let\u2019s consider the road trip in the US sub-niche\u2026   This keyword has less competition and there are also other related keywords that are relevant to the parent keyword. The content idea would be tips to survive on a week-long road trip in the US or the best places to visit in winter in the US. Now you have found the sub-niche that looks more interesting to you and it can be easier to find people that are also interested in the topic that you are in. You can create content and help to solve their problem as a blogger. 4. Check the profitability of the topic Checking profitability is the key when It comes to the monetization part. You are building a blog but you don\u2019t know how to monetize your blog. Because you did not research the topic\u2019s profitability! How do I find out then? Do market research and see if people are also searching for this topic or a similar topic like this.  Google trend says it is a good topic that people often search for. Let\u2019s look at this picture for a minute.  Advertisers are paying a good amount of money for some of the keywords are relevant. You would want to target these low competition keywords. 5. Ask questions Asking people directly can be a good way to find a profitable niche. Ask your friends and family about their recent google searches. Create a poll on Facebook to survey. I think these five tips are very important and useful to find a niche that you can use to start a profitable blog. Step 2: Figuring Out The Blog Name Naming your blog can be difficult if want to make it difficult. I always try to find a simple blog name that people can remember. Some people make the blog name harder because they want to find the .com domain or the relevant domain name. I have used the .net and .site domains before. It was a time when Google would only rank .com domains but now it\u2019s all about content. So how do you pick a good blog name? Picking a blog name is a prerequisite to start a blog. Many people focus on the blog name because a meaningful blog name indicates what is your blog about. There are over 1 billion blogs on the internet. That\u2019s a lot of blogs! In order to stand out, you and I need to pick names correctly. It takes forever to find a meaningful blog name. I usually follow 5 steps formula to find a good name if I decide to start a blog or passive income website. How to pick a good blog name by following 5 easy steps: 1. Take some time to research your niche deeply 2. Understand the purpose behind your blogging 3. Think about future banding 4. Audience and readers 5. Use ideas that are available Step1: Take some time to research your niche deeply Have you picked a niche yet? If you haven\u2019t then I highly recommend picking one before you start researching your blog name. But if you have already picked one, then you are one step ahead of thousands of people. Spend a few hours to research the niche properly. When I do niche research, I try to find out the possible content ideas and keywords. Including a super focused keyword may help to rank on google better. Although it\u2019s not necessary to have that keyword in your naming conventions. When I create any niche-specific sites, I usually use one of the main keywords as the name of my blog. Let\u2019s assume, you want to start a blog and you are interested to start writing about budget cars. Although it\u2019s a big niche. But you can plenty of room to grow your blog if you start on a very specific thing about budget cars.  Google trends say it\u2019s a good niche. People are searching consistently. You may want to start writing about budget cars for students or low-income people. But if you narrow down the name, it will be hard to go with related topics such as budget cars for passionate car owners or budget cars for a drag race! Anyway\u2026. You got this. In order to find the name related to the budget cars, you can visit the namecheckr\u2019s website. Namecheckr will tell you if the domain is available and what other social media usernames are available if you use the specific name. For example, I have chosen budget automotive and if I look at the name on namecheckr, it gives me an idea\u2026  Step2: Understand the purpose behind your blogging When I start a niche website, my goal is to answer as many as possible questions to help my audience. It is very important that you understand the purpose of your blogging. Your blog should be a one-stop place for a small group of people to find answers that they are looking for online. If I take the previous example, the purpose of that blog should be writing about budget cars. So the purpose matters. Step3: Think About Future Branding When you create your blog, you should think about the branding opportunity. Your blog can be an element of your own personal brand. I don\u2019t think every post will lead a blog to become a successful brand but there should be some posts that will lead the blog to a brand. How to think about branding? In order to think about branding, a clear message idea is very important. Your blog should be around a topic that spreads a clear message to your readers and audience. Think about Ryan Robinson\u2019s Blog. He writes about side-hustle and building businesses on the side without quitting a full-time job. He\u2019s spreading a clear message to his audience and readers that you can build a freelance business or a side business without quitting your job in the beginning. Step4: Audience and Readers When you are just starting out, maybe there will be no one to read your blog posts. But there is a way to get a response from your future audiences! Use your social media or a YouTube channel. Try to build an audience first on YouTube because it is easier to get blog visitors from YouTube than any other social media platform. Ask your audience about the naming. Your audience may have a better suggestion! Also, you can create a poll so that people can vote. 5. Use ideas that are available There are thousands of existing ideas that are available already but don\u2019t try to copy them. Study other people\u2019s ideas and try to come up with something that can be better than your competitor\u2019s blog or a blog post. For example, if there was a blog called 99designideas, how about you create one called 101designideas and focus on better content than the other one. Write better and longer thorough content that Google will rank better than your competitors. Step 3: Blogging Platform I\u2019m not writing for affiliate commissions. So I decided to write about the platforms that I use and used previously. I started blogging about 11-12 years ago and I started on blogger. Blogger was a one-stop-shop to write your blog contents and post them online using your own domain. I am talking about the time before WordPress became famous. I use WordPress these days and I totally love it. I promote WordPress, recommend, and help friends & family to set up their blogs on WordPress. If you are one of them who want your own website (not only blog), WordPress has everything! I have 4 blogs that are online today. I have built many blogs before and sold a few of them. When I created my first modern architecture blog, I had the only option which was \u201cblogger\u201d Someone asked me\u2026 Is WordPress better than the blogger? WordPress is the best platform that I have used so far. Blogger is only for someone who wants to write about himself and his pet! Seriously! It is nowhere near the quality of WordPress! When it comes to the questions of customization, you will have no other choice besides WordPress. I have not tried out Wix or Squarespace yet. But if someone asks me which platform should they start their blog on, I say that it is one and only WordPress! Here\u2019s a link to understand the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com. Now, there is a problem. People also want to find if want to start on WordPress.org or WordPress.com! Remember, they are both different. If you want to start your own blog or a website, you start on WordPress.org. Why did I pick wordpress.org? When it comes to blogging, I need more freedom to make things more creative. Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS - WordPress gave me that freedom. If I want, I can use my own plugins instead of using their plugins. I have summarized the answer in five bullet points and here they are: On Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS - WordPress, you can download the WordPress software to use your own web hosting account.One-click installation with Bluehost or other hosting platforms. I use Bluehost.The WordPress software is 100% Free!I can use my own plugins!I can change the backend code and the database files whenever I want to.I came from a tech background and I enjoy the flexibility that Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS - WordPress offers. Other platforms: If you don\u2019t want to spend a minimum amount to have your own hosting, then a free platform would be the best choice for you. I started writing on Medium.com about 17-18 months ago and it is a decent platform if you don\u2019t want to deal with hosting or don\u2019t care about your own domain name. I am a regular contributor to Quora.com. I just like how people ask questions and I get to answer them. If you are willing to build your readers list then Quora is one of the best platforms to give it a try and it is free to use. Step 4: Blog Hosting When I created my blog, I was confused about the hosting. I looked at Bluehost and Hostgator both. I have seen other people promoting Bluehost heavily because their commission payout is very lucrative. Let me tell you one thing. I have used both Bluehost and Hostgator. I only promote Bluehost because I have built more than 10 blogs on the WordPress platform and used Bluehost as the hosting. Their offers look like this:  I always encourage people to sign up for the PLUS option. You can build multiple sites, unlimited emails, disks space, bandwidth, etc. for that $5.95 a month option! When I signed up, I took the basic option because I wasn\u2019t sure about blogging. Then I started building multiple blogs and I had to switch to the PLUS package. So, I strongly recommend taking the PLUS package instead of the basic package. To get started on Bluehost, you need to go to the Bluehost website.  Then click on the \u201cget started\u201d button as shown above. The next page will be about selecting the package.  I always recommend taking the PLUS package but in the end, it\u2019s your choice.  Then you need to select your domain. But if you have an existing domain, you can put in the right box and for a new domain the left box should be fine. If you want, you can skip this part and do it later.  Account Creation  You don\u2019t have to select everything they want you to do. I prefer selecting site lock security only as an extra option. Then put your payment info in and boommm\u2026 You are ready! Then you will be redirected to the BLUEHOST platform for the login. Step 5: Blog Design When you are just starting, I recommend you keep it simple. Simplicity is the key when you are starting anything new. There are a few very simple themes on WordPress. Just pick one of them. Themes like Astra, twenty-sixteen, Hello elementor, etc. are good for just starting up. When you get better at blogging, then you can customize your blog theme as much as you want. But at first, focus on content over the design. No one cares about your design unless you provide valuable content on your website. Step 6: Plugins And Necessary Stuff For starting up, you just a few plugins.  These are the plugins that I am using for one of my main websites. Akismet Anti-Spam Bluehost Elementor Google Analytics for WordPress by MonsterInsights Jetpack by WordPress.com: Create a Free Website or Blog Newsletter OptinMonster API Sassy Social Share WPForms Lite Yoast SEO These plugins are 100% free and I don\u2019t pay a penny for any of these. Step 7: Necessary Settings Before Creating Your Content There are some minor things that you need to do before creating content on a regular basis. Every blog should have terms of service, privacy policy, and the affiliate disclosure page for their users to read. Although no one reads these pages, it is important to create them as you are thinking about blogging as your business. Step 8: Create Main Pages I follow a very simple formula to create main pages. If you are just blogging and do not care about services to offer, I recommend having 3 pages on your blog. BLOG, About me, and Contact page. I keep HOME, BLOG, ABOUT, and CONTACT pages on the blogs I create. But it totally depends on you. I have seen the majority of the new bloggers spend so much time thinking about this stuff, they don\u2019t even focus on creating content! Step 9: Create Forms You need to get a form created on your contact page. I have a form for people to share their thoughts and expectations from me. That will help you to create content for your audience.  Step 10: Content Creation Strategy I like creating list-based posts. Research shows that list-based posts are more likely to be ranked on Google fast. There is a drawback. You will need to compete with thousands of others to get your post up in the ranking. If you don\u2019t have any writing experience, I recommend you start with an answer. Suppose your niche is blogging. You go on google and type blogging.  Do you see the questions? You need to answer people\u2019s questions to get a ranking on google. I personally use another website which is called \u201canswerthepublic.com\u201d. Also, Ubersuggest gives a list of keywords that is very helpful to eliminate the struggle of content creation. But the niche picking is important to find the best content creation strategy. Photos and videos are very helpful for readers not to get bored pretty often. Step 11: Publishing Schedule If you run a small blog, the publishing schedule can be very effective. You need to create an audience first who would read your blog posts on a daily basis. When you are just starting out, 1 or 2 posts may be okay. Because quality is always preferred over quantity. If you just write a lot of posts in one week and take the days of the next week, your blog will never take off. I have been through that situation in the past and I have learned lessons for ignoring the schedule. Step 12: Monetization I\u2019m not a huge fan of placing ads on the blog. Unfortunately, we bloggers to live on ads for quite a few time. But I always try to focus on different monetization strategies. Affiliate marketing can be a good one to start with. For example, I have written a detailed blog post about starting a blog and I have attached Bluehost links in the post. Every time people click and signup, I make a commission off of that. But the best way is your own products or services. Mark Weins from Migrationology has his own e-books. He writes some awesome content about food and travel. Make sure you check him out. ",
