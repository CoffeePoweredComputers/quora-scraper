            "answer_text": "I assume that you wouldn't have asked this question if you believed in honesty. So, honesty aside, really competitive employers and university admission committees usually crosscheck the information they receive.  For graduate admissions, this often turns up inconsistencies or embellishments, and this keeps people alert, so they keep on checking.  Needless to say, no one is going to offer you a position if they caught you lying, exaggerating or intentionally misleading. Call this checks and balances, or just another reason to be honest. ",

Don\u2019t make up qualifications or pretend you\u2019ve read books when you haven\u2019t (even if you\u2019ve read little bits of them). If you\u2019re interviewed for a university place, you\u2019ll very probably end up being quizzed about your favourite parts of the course you supposedly went on. You\u2019ll look incredibly foolish if you try to make up an answer. Your interviewer will spot what\u2019s going on straight away, and your chances of a place will rapidly decrease. ",
