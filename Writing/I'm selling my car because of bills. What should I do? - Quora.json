            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t need your car for transportation, then by all means, sell it. Vehicles are a depreciating asset. The longer you have one, the more you pay over time. There are many avenues to sell your dar. You can sell it privately on your own; you can sell it to a dealership. If you owe on your car (still paying on a loan) you will need to pay off your loan to get the title to be able to sell it. If you don\u2019t owe anything, you can transfer the title to the new owner. Depends on your situation. ",
