            "answer_text": "Here is an example: Dear Uncle/Dear Mr. John, Greetings from your nephew, John. I hope you're doing fine and your family too (if he has a family). We are breaking for holiday in a month's time. I would like to spend the holiday with you (or \u2018your family'). Please, let me know if you are okay with it. I would love to spend it with you\u2026(offer the reason(s) why). I'm looking forward to your reply, uncle. Thanks. John  I think you can get some ideas from the above example on how to write the letter. It should be short and clear. Remember, you should write in handwritten form if you're sending post. It sounds natural and writing from the heart. If it's by email, you'll have to depend on your smartphone, tablet or computer. If sending by post, remember to include your address followed by the date below it. On the right side below the date, write Dear Sir followed by a comma. Start with greetings below the salutation. Wish him good health including his family (if he has). In the next paragraph, state your reason for writing the letter. Let him know what you're doing now since there is an indication you're breaking for holiday in a few weeks' time. Let him know why you want to spend the holiday with him. Thank him and let him you know you're patiently waiting for his reply. End with your name. If you want you can put your title below your name 'Yout nephew.\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, it\u2019s not clear whether you want tips on ideas because you want to go to your uncle\u2019s or you want tips on how to ask properly in English, perhaps as a classroom assignment. Second, your question should be \u2018How should I write\u2026?\u2019 if you want advice, or perhaps \u2018How would I write\u2026?\u2019 if it\u2019s more speculative, advice on something you might do. \u2018How will I write\u2026?\u2019 asks for a prediction about the future. Third, assuming that you want ideas and not advice on writing a requesting letter, there are so many variables that it\u2019s impossible for me to suggest anything without more information. How old are you and how old is he? What\u2019s the generation gap? How well do you know him? How well-off is he (how much money does he have)? Who else will be there? Do you want to spend your vacation camping with him, say, or at his house or apartment? Do you expect him to feed you for free? What\u2019s your motivation? Is it him you want to see or do you just like where he lives as a vacation spot? Even if this is just a classroom exercise, you should answer all these questions before you start. It will help define the tone and style of the letter no matter what your goal. For example, if you\u2019re both young and he\u2019s only a few years older and you know him well, you can be direct, your tone can be chummy and your style can be slangy, e.g. \u201cHi, Unc, how\u2019s it going? Wouldn\u2019t it be cool if we hung out together this summer?\u201d If he\u2019s much older and you don\u2019t know him well, you\u2019d want to be more formal and indirect, perhaps starting out by referring to a common bond, then preparing for your request by explaining your motivation, e.g. \u201cDear Uncle Charlie, I\u2019ve been thinking about how much fun I had when you used to come over for Christmas when I was little. I feel bad that we\u2019ve lost touch over the years, and I was wondering if it might be possible for us to get together this summer\u2026\u201d You can\u2019t get a much more polite requesting expression than \u2018I was wondering if it might be possible.\u2019 ",
