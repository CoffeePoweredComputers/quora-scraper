Dear (insert name here) Please exuse (your name here) from attending (activity) as he/she is having some very difficult times at home right now and is experiencing some serious social anxiety issues and being in that kind of atmosphere will cause him/her to be very ill and possibly have to be hospitalized. I do hope you understand and can keep this to yourself. I very much appreciate your help and hope that (insert your name here) will be able to participate in the future. As it stands (your name here) cannot attend (activity) for the foreseeable future but hopes to soon. I can customize it for you for whatever you need but I gotta have more info. Hope this helps ",
