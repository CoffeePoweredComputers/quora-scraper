            "answer_text": "At 65 years old, I thought social media, FaceBook, YouTube, Instagram, and the obsession of our youth with the smartphone a total waste of time. After all, this electronic device not only wastes one\u2019s valuable time by seduction with a 24 hour news cycle and candy crush games, it makes you vulnerable to identity theft. Some digital thief could steal your financial information! Overall, I had a snobby attitude toward social media enthusiasts and even bragged that \u201cI enjoy human connections, read hard copy newspapers, and I don\u2019t waste my energy on social media.\u201d I was wrong! In modern civilization, there have been a handful of inventions or discoveries that changed the course of human kind. Here are several: automobile, industrial revolution, air travel, telephone, to name a few. Social Media/Smartphone usage is now another invention that has changed the world. The actual hardware (smartphone) and the platforms (social media) are synonymous with each other because one won\u2019t work without the other. Let me offer a caveat. I will not spend any time highlighting the negative effects of this medium because it is too easy to be a cynic. One can criticize hospitals because they have germs; make a case that airplanes pollute the planet; or assert that cars cause injuries. So here\u2019s my personal story with social media. Over one decade ago, I came to the realization that the smartphone/social media is a game changer in the world, so I made a concerted effort to invest in a smartphone and to learn how to use it. Just think in 1908, the early adapters of the automobile had to go through the same paradigm shift. It was one of the most frustrating periods of my adult life because I was not very digital savvy. I reminded myself that anything worthwhile in life is a challenge. Is being proficient at playing the piano easy? Is learning to speak Italian going to take effort? You get the idea, right? I won\u2019t lie to you. Years ago, I taught myself social media by asking my adult children, younger co-workers, read articles, and experimenting with media on my smartphone. I pulled my hair out some days in frustration. Today, it is much easier because the makers have improved the devices so much. Also, if you get stuck, you can find a YouTube video to teach you for free. My life today is enriched because my smartphone/social media is the \u201cremote control\u201d of my life. A picture is worth one thousand words, right? I share my life through snapshots of babies, dogs, my pizza recipes, just to name a few, with friends and relatives that live in other states. I keep up with my adult children on their Instagram pages. They know when I play tennis and I have the privilege of peeking into their budding careers and love lives. It creates a stronger connection because \u201cSocial media is the currency of today\u2019s generation.\u201d Anyone under 40 is on the social media bus. I made a decision to buy a ticket and take a seat on the bus. Great decision! One of my good friends has heart arrhythmia and uses his smartphone to monitor his heart condition. He even communicates with his doctor through the phone. On social media, he follows cardiologists and fellow patients from all over the world. He learns strategies from top hospitals to stay healthy. Not to belabor my point but here are two additional important benefits from social media. In an effort to keep my emotional healthy sound, I follow a top Indian guru on Instagram and follow his meditation philosophies. With exercise, my wife does dance and yoga classes via social media. Speaking of my wife, Mary, I met and married her years ago. Guess what? I met her on a social media dating site, and the rest is history. Unfortunately, my first wife died prematurely from liver cancer. So you see, the smartphone/social media can even help you with your love life and give you tools for a happier life. Did I persuade you to either adopt it and/or embrace it with a little more enthusiasm? ",

            "answer_text": "I think social media is terrible when used for anything more than connecting with close friends and family. People are not the same on social media as they\u2019re face to face! People on social media can release a darker side without fear of repercussion, you\u2019re behind a computer screen. This simple fact is a strong reason why I deleted facebook and will never use it again, I found a lot of internet tough guys, liars, bullies, shamers, and so on using facebook. I found fake people I know from my community, their lives and houses were a mess in person, as well as their finances but on facebook it looked like they were living the dream! I recall someone saying wow did you see her facebook pictures of that new car and their vacation!? My life is crap because I can\u2019t even afford a 50\u2033 TV I have been wanting from walmart. It makes people feel down about their lot in life, when in fact they should never be down. I am the kind of person that can see through the BS, but a lot of people can\u2019t! I am who I am on here or on any form of social media. I won\u2019t say something that is a lie because self glorification doesn\u2019t turn me on. I want everyone, friends or strangers to know me for who I truly am not a phony, my profile picture is my side profile, my worse angle of my big ole nose because its who I am\u2026 I found so many people on facebook living a lie or little lies constantly or complaining constantly. Frankly, I got sick of it and will never go back and if it all shut down tomorrow the world would be better off! Especially the younger generation who believes everything a picture says. ",

Set aside the multitude of ways to scam\u2026identity theft..and spam. I've found most people aren't at all like the persona theyve created online. I tried this online dating before\u2026.what a nightmare! I'll pass. No thank you. You can't go on anything without being bombarded with ads. News outlets want their story out there 1st..even if its not completely accurate..oh, just retract it later. I know peoples personal business\u2026and I don't even know them\u2026.and things I probably shouldn't! One positive I have discovered\u2026if anyone goes missing\u2026.you have a better chance of finding or recovering them. Those \u201c shares\" work in your favor at times. Police capture alot of local criminals at a higher rate than before. If you're selling something locally..its easier..but then there's the safety issue..which I, myself practice but alot of people don't. Its also a great way to stay connected with family..especially when they don't live nearby. Messenger with the ability to see people is great! There's pros and cons to everything in life. Just when I think social media has a balance of both\u2026something comes along to sway me the other way. Nothing in life is foolproof !! ",
