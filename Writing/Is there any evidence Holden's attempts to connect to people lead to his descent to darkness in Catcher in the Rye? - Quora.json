            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve seen this question for a while now. It pops up on my screen apparently because of a previous answer I gave last year. I\u2019m not savvy enough on Quora navigation (yet) to refer you to a previous answer, but the summary is basically that this story is about a young man who is developing a serious mental illness. It\u2019s beautifully and empathically told, and deserves its status as a great work of literature. If Holden\u2019s illness really is Schizophrenia, or even Autism, then his ability to pursue interpersonal relationships will be affected\u2014-but as a result of the illness\u2014-not as a cause. What the questioner calls \u201cdescent into darkness\u201d [dismal, though apt] is likely the development of an illness which, unfortunately, still abides at 1% of the population and appears to have a strong genetic basis. Holden\u2019s illness likely makes him more vulnerable to some of the bottom feeders he runs into, sure\u2014-but they are not a cause of the problem. For Holden, a challenge going forward as he leaves the hospital will be to avoid social isolation, even though his social options could be limited by his illness. This is a tricky balancing act for people with mental illnesses, and many become so intimidated by interpersonal interaction that they become isolated. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Sorry it took me so long to get to this, I assume by \u201cdescent to darkness\u201d you mean psychological deterioration. If so, yes. Holden reaches out to people and attempts to connect with them, but is disappointed. He attempts to connect with Ackley, whom he at first claims to dislike. This happens after Stradlater beats Holden up. Ackley doesn\u2019t want to \u201cconnect\u201d though, because he\u2019s tired and wants to sleep. He later tries to connect with Sunny, the prostitute, who rejects his effort at conversation as a waste of her time. He tries to connect with Sally by pitching his idea of a secluded life together, which she reacts to with disgust. He later confides in Mr. Antolini. This does\u2019t go well, because Antolini supposedly attempts to molest Holden. At the end of the day, Holden\u2019s attempts to connect with people are, in fact, what lead to his psychological deterioration. It can possibly all be traced back to the loss of his brother, Allie, though. One of his closest connections, and one that was taken from him too soon. ",
