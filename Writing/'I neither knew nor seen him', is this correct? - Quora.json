If you reversed the verbs it would be easier to see that it is incorrect: \u201cI neither seen him nor knew him.\u201d The correct verb is \u201csaw,\u201d thus, \u201cI neither knew him nor saw him\u201d is the correct form.

            "answer_text": "That is not grammatically correct. Here are some better options: I neither knew nor saw him. I neither knew nor have ever met him. I don\u2019t know him and have never met him. The third seems most natural to me. I don\u2019t think that we can accurately say that we have never seen someone, because if we don\u2019t know the person how can we be sure that we didn\u2019t see them in passing? ",
