            "answer_text": "You can insert any symbol in any font by selecting from the menu: \"Insert\", then \"Symbol\", then \"More symbols...\" Here's Insert symbols - Office Support Any symbol, foreign character, wingding you can think of is available there, in any font you have installed on your computer.  Among them is the equilibrium arrow you seek. If you are looking for greater-than-or-equal, or Less-than-or-equal, type 2265 then alt-x, or 2264, alt-x, respectively.  The shortcuts for these and all the other symbols are listed at the bottom of the same dialog box. If you use that symbol a lot, setup autocorrect to transform the two characters \"<=\" to the desired symbol.  I do this for +/-, deg, and dia since I'm an engineer and use \"plus or minus\" \"degree\" and \"diameter\" symbols a lot. ",
