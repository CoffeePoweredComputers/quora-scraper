            "answer_text": "Personal statements are all about selling yourself, and university is all about self improvement. With these things in mind, here are a few tips. Be Boastful.Include your achievements and skills, and show them in the best possible light. Don\u2019t be afraid to exaggerate a little, but keep it honest and truthful. Done a DofE? Say so. Even if you\u2019ve not fully completed it, it shows a willingness to get involved and to go beyond the bear necessities required of you. Great qualities in a university student. Show An Interest.Say what you want to learn, and why you want to learn it. If you have an idea of the career you\u2019d like to embark upon after graduating, say so. Room For Improvement.Is there something you\u2019d would like to be better at? Say so. Universities don\u2019t expect you to be perfect, and they\u2019d have no interest in you as a student if you were. Show that you\u2019re aware of your weaknesses and want to improve upon them. It\u2019s often much more impressive to universities than being an ubermensch. Don\u2019t Ramble On.Be concise, nobody wants to read a 10 page essay of your life story when they have 10,000 other essays to go through as well. Don\u2019t be afraid to explain things, but trim the fat and get straight to the point.Also, edit. Nothing is as detrimental to a personal statement as bad spelling and/or grammar. If you can\u2019t be bothered when you stand to gain a place at uni, why would you when your place is secured? Don\u2019t give them reason to ask that question. Hope this helps some, good luck. ",
