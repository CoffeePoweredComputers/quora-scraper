            "answer_text": "Writing is all about expressing your thoughts. If you have ever written something then there is no need to explain how important it is to have inspiration and if you are not inspired by something you can never write well. Even a small memory or thought of yours can be your inspiration. When you\u2019re inspired, you find it easy to write. But if inspiration seems elusive, you can\u2019t write at all. Lets take an example: Suppose you have some good childhood memories and you want to write it down than you can do it easily because you know what you want to write and how exactly you are going to write about it. Here your childhood memory is your inspiration to write something about it. But if you don\u2019t have any memories than you can not write anything about it because you don\u2019t know what to write. You will have to think what you want to write. Here your thought process acts as an inspiration. And for that reason, yes inspiration plays an important role in writing and without inspiration, you can\u2019t write anything at all. Thanks for A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no creative writing without inspiration. Inspiration just does not mean using someone else\u2019s idea and building on it. Inspiration can lie in others\u2019 lives, others\u2019 characters. Someone can say something or suggest something that might let you arrive at something new. Sometimes reading something can also have the same effect. Inspiration helps you foresee the results of your craft and hence is a major driving force. ",
