The act of citing sources is also your best defense against allegations of plagiarism. The idea of citing sources isn\u2019t about referring words but it is about referencing the idea that the author communicated. Even if you rewrite sentences in your own words, that is mere paraphrasing hence it is imperative to cite sources in research. ",
