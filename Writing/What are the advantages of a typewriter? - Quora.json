            "answer_text": "Funny enough, I actually bought a manual typewriter back in high school, and used it, seriously. As in, I was serious about my writing and enjoyed writing on my typewriter, more than the word processor on a computer. The advantages of using a manual typewriter depend on the conviction of the operator. A typewriter really forces someone to know their stuff, that\u2019s part of the reason why I bought one in the first place. Grammar, and especially spelling will be straightened after regular use. Referencing a physical dictionary helps too, but isn\u2019t mandatory. Another advantage is how much more focused someone can be on their composition. I used to worry about being distracted by the internet or games on a laptop. If you\u2019re the kind who easily gives up, or obsesses over mistakes (or a perfectionist as some people like to call themselves), a typewriter may either help cure you of that \u2014 or drive you crazy, especially if you don\u2019t know how to handle typos on a typewriter. There are black and white ribbons, with the white part being a white-out like substance. The white part may dry out, I tried using one, and found oiling the ribbon helped a bit with the dried-out error correction portion of the ribbon. I used to lug that typewriter everywhere I went for a while, I must have been a little stronger back then (2009\u20132011) because my typewriter was 10 pounds and I didn\u2019t drive. That\u2019s not really an advantage as much as a byproduct or side-effect. Another side-effect was regularly cutting my fingernails, I never really cared to trim them except for my typewriter and any keyboard instrument. I could give you several recommendations or warnings, get a basic one, the more fancy one with tab settings are more complicated and probably cost more to service or repair. Also, typewriter platens may have to be replaced, and might be hard to come by. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat are the advantages of a typewriter?\u201d Social Experiment. I\u2019m a writer, and I write my rough drafts on a typewriter. My reasons for doing so have to do with the inability to correct what I write, so I have to let go of my Inner Editor and just let the words flow onto the paper. That\u2019s the main advantage to me. The other advantages mentioned here are not that advantageous to me \u2014 I live in an area where we rarely have blackouts, and even then, I use a laptop so I don\u2019t lose anything if the power goes down. And I can still read anything I\u2019ve written on a computer, because I save stuff as .rtf, which can be read on any computer. Typewriting in public can be a social experiment, though. For two consecutive days I went to coffeehouses (like Starbucks), where people gather with their laptops to work and socialize. The first day, I took my 1938 Erika S and some paper and started writing by the window, getting both amused/interested glances from outside and inside. A few people came over to comment on my lovely typewriter.  The second day I took another typewriter, this time my 1963 Olympia SM7, which is a much more silent and serious piece of equipment:  This time, people sometimes looked at me from a distance, but nobody approached me for a chat, probably looked like I was hard at work instead of tooling around on what looked to be an interesting toy. At least that\u2019s what I assume, as I did get a few respectful nods when I packed up the machine again to leave. Or maybe they were just relieved that I fucked off with my click-clacking machine.
