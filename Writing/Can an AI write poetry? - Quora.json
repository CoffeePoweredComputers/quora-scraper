All this to eschew plagiarism litigation. That's the last thing that pobot will want for his or her life. And no, AI can't write poetry because they need algorithms for everything. But sometimes CSS or jquery codes look like poems. Kind of. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, YES! AI bots are writing poetry. Why unfortunate? Humans use art to express emotions and thoughts. Why should a machine be producing creative outcomes based on data? What good will this do for us? Questions aside, AI bots are able to write poetry based on algorithms, and matching words that complement one another. Although unnecessary, it is interesting and fascinating to see AI being applied to art forms.

Poem can't be produced. At times you might try for hours but couldn't write a single word and there are times words start flowing like unstoppable stream. It breaks all patterns and it reaches where no one has ever dreamt of. What more can I say- I don't write poetry, the poetry writes itself.\u2019 ",

To some extent poetry is not the text but a communication act born from an human experience. There is some intention you are looking for, an idea. I know, autorship goes a lot against modern literacy theory. If a machine create a text and you find poetry there, you as reader are the creator of that poetry (this do goes with moderno literacy theory, i guess), because you put the human dimension on that text.

Hard to say what is harder because some bad poems are a bit of gibberish that sounds fancy - but still they are called \u2018poems\u2019 and screenplay must make sense. I would say middle level poetry may be equally hard as screenplay. And with such base here is an article from The Huffington Post how it went. But TL;DR is: screenplay writers do not have to worry as of yet. So probably poets are also safe. ",
