            "answer_text": "It\u2019s all about genre, audience and purpose. You don\u2019t state that the letter you have in mind is a formal one - I\u2019ll presume it is. The register for all three of the genres you mention is necessarily formal; that means you use fully standard English lexis and grammar - no colloquialisms, contractions or elisions and definitely, no slang. But, a court order is going to be objective and contain \u2018legalese\u2019 - esoteric legal terminology pertinent to the area of law in which the Order is applicable. Its function is to enforce a legal procedure/requirement, regardless of the ability of the recipient to even read it (someone with limited English skills for any reason, would need help in deciphering the language and complying with Order) Indeed, there are very strict conventions and prescriptions regarding terminology use, when drafting a court order. Here are some guidelines to US Attorneys, for drafting a Bankruptcy Order: Proposed Orders Guidelines - US Bankruptcy Court Anyone with sufficient English skills can write a formal letter - as long as it observes the established conventions regarding register and style (detailed above), and adheres to the drafting structure, regarding place of sender and recipient addresses and date, and superscription/subscription traditions (Yours Sincerely for a named recipient, Yours Faithfully for a recipient whose title alone is used). Formal Letter Sample - Business English Writing Academic writing requires a formal register that presents research and analysis, and a definite argument, observing Standard English conventions and incorporating citation. There is much on Quora, an online, re the structure of such a piece (I\u2019ve written some Quora answers on essay/research paper structure recently). There is certainly room, however, for a writer to exhibit or develop his/her own style, within the restrictions of the genre; expressly, avoiding \u2018I\u2019 statements and remaining \u2018objective\u2019 in presenting evidence for an expert assessor. I suggest you read a few literary criticism pieces by reputable critics, to get the idea. This might help: Academic Writing in English In short, formal register for all, but the legal document is necessarily constructed and phrased by a trained lawyer. ",

            "answer_text": "While letter writing can be casual and unstructured, academic writing must be precise and follow clear structural conventions (I know nothing about court orders). While the basic advice of toastmasters applies to academic writing (tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them), and the norms of essay writing are also important (one topic per paragraph, lead with a topic sentence, present arguments, summarize with a closing sentence, segue to the next set of arguments), these are not enough for academic writing at the level of publishing research. Each field will have different conventions, as will each theoretical and methodological area within each field. It is critical to adhere to the conventions in the particular area in which you want to contribute, as your structure, and even a large portion of the individual words, are signals about your community and expected contribution. Using the wrong word or structure can signal ontological contradictions or require you to bring in a whole new literature to argue your points. Certain words become \u201cowned\u201d by particular communities and they become \u201claden with meaning\u201d based on prior use in the community. They have been defined and compared to other related ideas, with clear indications of what they are and are not. To present a compelling piece of research and argumentation that will survive the peer review process, you must signal from which community you want your reviewers to come with the words and the citations you are using, and you must use the words that precisely convey the concepts you are trying to convey. That is why academic writing appears so jargony to the outsider \u2014 using the wrong word will leave you open to critique for being fuzzy about your constructs, and so what would pass for synonyms in regular letter writing would be inexcusable in academic writing. We write very precisely, often about small things, with detailed argumentation and citations to prior work, in an effort to \u201cstand on the shoulders of those who have come before\u201d to build even more knowledge. Of course, I am describing the conventions of my field, organization theory (and not even all of that), and other fields will be somewhat different. ",
