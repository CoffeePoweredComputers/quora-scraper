            "answer_text": "Childhood Memories Childhood memory on June 5th, 2000 is when I entered this place that we call Earth. Childhood is the happiest time of the person life. Whenever we think back some of good and some of the not so good memories we recall. But still we say that we never feel older whenever recall our childhood memories. As the Tom Stoppard said, \"if you carry your childhood with you never become older\" When you're a child you don't have many responsibilities. Children depend their parents who make decision for them, and on adults we're packed with packages of problems and many other responsibilities. That's why when most of people think back to the time when they just have to think of school homework, put away their toys or if they will be invited to a birthday party or not, they remember that time of their life to be a very happy and unstressfull time. I still remember some of the wonderful memories when I was young. One of the most important thing I remember in my life was the everyday I played cricket with my neighborhood same age friends at our street or nearest ground. School has had to be the most boring time of our lives, but equally fun. One of the best memories was in Grade 11. We used to have two English periods back to back on Monday. The teacher used to forget her schedule and we would enjoy playing on school ground instead. Those were days ! enjoyed a lot and those become my one of the most wonderful memory of my childhood. In conclusion, I think childhood is the happiest time of my life. I wish I could turn back time.. ",
