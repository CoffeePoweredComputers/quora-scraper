Watashi wa __ desu.4) [(if the speaker wishes to be quite frank)] I am __. __desu.5) [(if it\u2019s very formal)] I am called __. [Watashi wa] (nihongo de*) __ to moushimasu.*Note: Nihongo de = \u201cin japanese-language\u201d (should you have a Japanese-specific name by-chance, as the wording of the question would imply.)Note: Watashi may be switched out where appropriate for other 1st-person pronouns. However watashi is more likely what you will be using for this kind of situation. Especially at an elementary level. Secondary note: there are some other niceties and formalities generally included in introductions. I would recommend eventually supplementing with these niceties as well. Supplemental phrases: Hajimemashite \u2014 \u201clet us begin\u201d - (said at a very first introduction)Yoroshiku [**onegaishimasu] \u2014 please treat me well [**added when formal]:) Hope this helps!

            "answer_text": "You don't need the 'Japanese' part, because context will imply that it's Japanese. Unlike Chinese, where you need to use hanzi for your name, Japanese has their own phonetics alphabet for foreign words (Katakana), so someone named Smith would be called \u30b9\u30df\u30b9(su-mi-su) in Japanese. If you have a bona fide Japanese name though, say that and explained that you are called differently at home.In increasing degree of politeness:Watashi no namae wa __ desu.Watashi wa __ to iimasu.Watashi wa __ to moushimasu. Never use -san with your own name. ",
