            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I am a freelance content writer since a year and a half. During my journey, I\u2019ve learnt several things. To become an established freelance writer, you need to- Write, write and writeIt may seem as a very lame suggestion and you may be like, duh I know. But believe me, to become an established freelance writer, the primary thing that you need, is to hone your writing skills. Practice writing as much as you can. 2. Read a lot Your writing skills will improve when you have a kack for reading a lot. It will not only increase your vocabulary but also will help you expand your horizon. 3. Learn new skills As much as quality content is preferred by clients, there are stuffs that you must keep in mind while writing for a them. When you become a freelance writer for a website, your client relies on you to write content that is good in quality and helps in ranking his website. Learn search engine optimization(SEO) basic html and wordpress. If you do not want to learn the languages, atleast learn SEO. After you\u2019ve aquired your skills and have decided that now you CAN write for clients, here\u2019s a list of things you need to do. Make a websiteA writer MUST have a website. If you do not, make one. You do not need to have advanced website making skills or learn a whole set of programming languages. All you need is just go to a free website maker like wix or wordpress and make one. 2. Write blogs Blog writing helps you hone your writing skills. And for your website visitors, this is the place where they\u2019d be entertained and spend the most of their visiting time. This will also become an area where your prospective clients will examine your skills and consider you for their project. But before starting to write blogs, you need to choose a writing niche. 3. Choose a niche A writing niche is a just like genres. There are many writing niches. You may be familiar with few, like, fashion, lifestyle, IT, sports, business, health, entertainment etc. Do not be tempted to say that you can write on virtually any topic because believe me, nobody can. Juggle your options and choose the right one. After you\u2019ve set up your website and have written few blogs, Start with writing internshipsClients will always want an experienced writer. They neither have time nor money to consider an unexperienced one. On the other hand, internships, though low paying, will consider you and give you projects to do. The end result would be an addition to your portfolio. There are many websites like internshala (many others are there, search them) where eminent companies register to offer internships. 2. Pitch on job boards Clients hang out on job boards to hire freelance writers. Here\u2019s where you\u2019ll meet prospective clients and get work. Before doing that, do not forget to add the links of your published works(from the internships)to your portfolio and provide a link to your portfolio and blog on your CV. 3. Register in freelance service providing website They are also a means to gain a clientele. Sites like fiverr, freelancer, truelancer etc provides opportunities for freelancers(not just writers) a platform to showcase their skills and get clients. On the other hand, there are websites like wittypen, iwriter, which are just for freelance writers. They will examine your skills before welcoming you onboard. 4. Make a professional twitter and linedin profile A professional twitter profile is very important. Twitter along with linkedin is a great place to expand your network. Do not just create a profile, add a profile picture and sit back. Follow people and in turn they will follow you back along with people who follow them. Tweet regularly (your can tweet about your work, your current project, about writing or promote your latest blog posts). I hope this answer was able to solve your query. You can personally contact me of you want to know anything else. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Content Writing as a career is a very creative field to choose. Content Writing can be summed up in 3P\u2019s. Processing, Planning and Producing. When people think of Content Writing, they usually confuse it with just writing articles. Content Writing is way more than that. It surely does involve writing articles, apart from that there are more things that you can do as content writers. These things are as followed: Video/Audio ScriptsNewslettersSpeechesSocial Media PostsPodcast titlesWeb page articlesVideo descriptionsWhite PapersLanding PagesIn short, anything that can be published comes under Content Writing. Freelancing or Freelancer is a term that is generally used for people who are self-employed. As a content writing, you can easily work as freelancer. I have shared a list of fields in which an aspiring Content Writer can work in. In all these fields, you can work as a freelancer as well. You do not have to commit your time to just one company. Important Skills that a Content Writer should have: Master different writing skills: Over the years of working as a content writer, one learns about different styles of writing. For example, news has an AP style, it needs to be informative. Blogs have to a little friendly and opinionated.Have good command on language: This is one of the skills that is a prerequisite for being a Content Writer. You need to know the grammar, vocabulary and you also need to have a style of writing in which you are going to express yourself in your work.Be careful about the subject: There are thousands of topics to produce content on. You need to find your audience. You cannot write or make a video about everything. There has to be something that you specialize in or is something that interests you. That is the area you need to work in.Be original: This is something that can break or make the Content Writer. There are so many artists who reached the peak of their careers and just because of one mistake, it all went down the drain. It is fine to refer to someone\u2019s work or take inspiration from it but do not just copy and paste it. Add something of yours to it. Or at least give that person some credit.Knowledge on SEO, HTML, CSS and WordPress: These are a few things that are going to make people see your content more. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a process that helps creators get more traffic on their content. The search engine algorithms change constantly. Content Writers need to keep up. HTML, CSS and WordPress are some terms used in website development. There are times when your content does not look the way you want to on the browsers. That is when you need to dig into these codes and change them a little according to your own needs.Be social media experts: Nowadays, social media plays a very important role. This is the way to share information and that how people communicate these days. Everything is on internet. Whenever we hear of something new, the first thing we do is search the internet. That is why, it is very important to know about the trends of social media. That is going to help you grow your content and make your visible.All these skills are necessary whether you work a content writer for someone else or yourself. Career Opportunities as a Content Writer Content Writer as a career is a great choice. You can grow in the field over the years. I am sharing with you various sections where you can work as a Content Writer: Corporate World: There are many opportunities for Content Writers in Corporate. You can work as the following:Copywriter: This is the job where you try to come up with content that convinces customers to buy a product. Writing style is usually simple, short and crisp.Business content writer: Many businesses conduct market research or have a website to maintain. That is when they hire Content Writers. You can be asked to do a market research, maintain a website content, create technical content etc.Blog Writing: This is the field I am currently working in. I am working with Exambazaar as an intern. My task to write blogs for Exambazaar on various topics like competitive exams and career opportunities. I am going to share more information about interning at Exambazaar and my experience at the end.Digital Market: This is the area where internet comes into picture. You can produce content for social media This can involve working with Instagram or working on a website. This is where your knowledge about SEO, HTML, CSS and Wordpress will come handy.Published Author: If like writing very much and you think that you can produce good book or some content, then you can always write a book. Your book can be about anything. Find something that interests you and start writing.Blogging: This is something very similar to writing a book, except it is all online. You can write about anything you like. And develop an audience for yourself.Advantages and Disadvantages of Freelancer Its always helpful to be well informed before making a decision. I am going to share with you both the pros and cons of freelancing below: Advantages Independence: You are free to do whatever you like whenever you like. You do not have to catch the 6:40 bus in order to reach work by 9. You can stay up at night for as long as you want and wake up whenever you like. You are your own boss.Flexibility: You do not have to work from 9 to 5. You can start working whenever you like. You can work whenever you are most creative.Free to decide: You can decide what you want to work on. If you are in an office, you will have to do what your boss tells you to do. But as a freelancer, you can pick projects that you want to work on.Work-Life Balance: There is no job other than a freelancer in which you can make time for yourself, your family, friends and everything else in life. Since you work whenever you like and on whatever you like, you can easily change your schedule to make some time for yourself, your family and friends.Disadvantages Consistency: There is no consistency of work. There can be days when you are loaded with work and there can be days where you have no reason to put pants in the morning. Due to such flexibility in the job, it also affects the money flow.YOU HAVE TO BE GOOD: As a freelancer, you have to convince clients that you are the best in what you are doing. There are MNC\u2019s for everything and they can easily take away your projects if you do not do your job perfectly.Less social interaction: Since you are home is your office, you do not have a reason to go out unless a specific plan. Therefore, there is very less social interaction and it can affect your interpersonal skills.My Experience and Exambazaar I have been working as an intern with Exambazaar for more than a month now. I write blogs about various topics involving my experiences as a student or helping students find a path. It is a great experience to have. I believe you just need to start somewhere. Find yourself an internship. Your first job will not be to check someone else\u2019s article, it is going to be something small, so go out there and start applying. You can always start your career by starting an internship with Exambazaar and you can easily apply to Exambazaar. Just go to Exambazaar\u2019s website and apply for it. Good luck!!! ",
