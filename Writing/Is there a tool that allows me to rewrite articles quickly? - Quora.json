It is based on big data algorithms and through the semantic training of a large number of articles, it can change the way of expression without changing the semantics of the article content, and achieve the purpose of rewriting the article without changing the meaning of the content. At the same time, it also provides a grammar correction function, which can find out the errors in the grammar and correct them. It is simple to use, without complicated operations. Just click on the content of the article you want to modify to automatically rewrite it. A large number of articles can be rewritten in a short period of time. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, are you just trying to replace words or sentences, or are you just trying to rewrite the whole passage? For the former, you just need to have a large vocabulary and grammar base. You can use synonyms also cut the sentence into parts and change the words. If it is the latter, some skill is required. Remember: copy your ideas, not your words, and don't be afraid to make a few changes and leave things as they are. Just keep your central idea in mind and express it in your own words. It's worth noting that you can end up proofreading your essay using Grammarly. Of course, your questions require 'quick' copying and you may not have time to understand the main idea of an entire article. As mentioned in your link, it is also a shortcut. Use artificial intelligence to automatically rotate, understand, and rewrite sentences and paragraphs to form unique articles. Finally, syntax correction can be done automatically. This method really saves a lot of time. To sum up, mastering technology requires not only excellent ability and practice but also skillful help from external forces. Have a nice day~ ",

            "answer_text": "How to re-write articles quickly = Have a look at JVZOO. There are a number of software packages that combine sentences to create an article. I feel, however, that it is better to have an article and then you rewrite it to your specifications. There are a number of private label rights (PLR) sites where you have access to hundreds of articles on different topics. You pay a small sum and then you own the material and many articles you can change as you wish. I use IDPLR and have been very happy with them but there are others. ",
