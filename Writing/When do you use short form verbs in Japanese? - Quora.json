            "answer_text": "You just have to learn from experience. It\u2019s always safer to use \u307e\u3059 and \u3067\u3059 at first. Sometimes, the other person will imply that you\u2019re too formal. For example: You: \u98df\u3079\u307e\u305b\u3093 Him: \u98df\u3079\u306a\u3044\uff1f Generally, I\u2019d just get a feel for the conversation. If you\u2019re in Kansai, it\u2019s much easier to just start using plain form. Personally, I usually err on the side of politeness. You can usually use the short form and maintain appropriate politeness by adding \u3067\u3059. For example: \u6c7a\u3081\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\u3002 \u6c7a\u3081\u305f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002 \u3044\u3044\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f \u306a\u3069\u306a\u3069\u3002 Often, in casual but polite speech, you\u2019ll hear something like this: \u3044\u3044\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304b -> \u3044\u3044\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3063\u3059\u304b\uff1f It\u2019s still polite, but it feels less stilted. If this doesn\u2019t feel natural, I wouldn\u2019t do it. ",
