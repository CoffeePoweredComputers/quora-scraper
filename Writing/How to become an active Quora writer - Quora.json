            "answer_text": "Just write one answer per day just like me, and you will not get bored doing this. If you write many answers daily you will somehow lose interest after sometime. Most importantly don't write for upvotes. Yes, upvotes do keep you motivated but that doesnot mean if you don't get upvote you are a bad writer or if you get many upvotes you are excellent writer. People only upvote when they relate themselves with the answer or are fully satisfied. Cheers!! ",

Be informative and thorough in your answers, don\u2019t use one-word answers, don\u2019t duplicate other answers, and use proper grammar. Be careful of the traps that people fall into - this is a site for information, your answer needs to add value to the site, you\u2019re not here to just comment, but you\u2019d be a contributor to the knowledge base.
