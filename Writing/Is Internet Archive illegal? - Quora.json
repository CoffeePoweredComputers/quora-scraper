            "answer_text": "Why would it be illegal? Although I guess you\u2019re thinking about copyright infringement. There are, no doubt, sites that don\u2019t want their content copied for posterity. I would imagine Disney would be one of those bearing in mind their harsh attitude to copyright protection. That being the case, I would be surprised if sites like that are ever copied. If the Archive makes a mistake and gets a request to remove copied data, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll comply. It\u2019s not worth their time or money fighting it. For sites that don\u2019t want to be archived, the simplest solution is to edit their \u201crobots.txt\u201d file to exclude the archive crawler, or all crawlers if that\u2019s their preference. The actual Internet Archive itself as an idea certainly isn\u2019t illegal, at least not in any Western country. China would doubtless find it unacceptable because they appear to like reinventing history, and you can\u2019t successfully do that if the past is available to everyone. Which suggests that authoritarian regimes in general won\u2019t be in favour. Mind you, there appear to be politicians in a lot of countries who don\u2019t like their past opinions or actions made public. ",
