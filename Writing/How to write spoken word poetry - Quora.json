            "answer_text": "The basic writing style works well enough until we start the real work, which is the editing stage. That requires reading the poetry again and again, hoping to spot ways to improve the text eg descriptive words or more apt phrases. Some letters in the English language can cause stumbling blocks as we read text as first written. Just because we admire our own work it doesn't mean that the work is a completed work in itself. I spot ideas that weren't even there at the beginning and I spot ways to enhance the descriptions and choose the phrases that help another part of the poetry work better than before. It isn't hard to overlook the use of I have and I would switching to I've and I'd later on in the poetry. It must be checked to find such switches, so as to correct these when possible. Spoken word poetry adds to the confusing of like sounded words or abbreviations, such as it's or its and we must check the written text to spot these errors, too. The use of a deliberate style eg 8, 8, 8, 6 syllables of a common metre hymn has helped me to write poetry, even though there are exceptions like Heaven as 2 syllables sometimes sounding or being used as 1 syllable eg Heav'n. We don't always keep to the rules. Sometimes a final line in a poem is switched from 6 syllables to 7 just because there's a better phrase acting as a dramatic conclusion. The performance of poetry can change over the years, as we lose lung capacity enough to say the longer lines. Singers sometimes phrase their compositions to suit their voices rather than how younger singers would express the lyrics. Some writers forget that the comma means to take a breath or a ... means an extra pause for reflection... We can help our poetry if we use text to speech PC programs, as I've downloaded and recommended before. Some are basic male and female voices and some are USA or UK voices. We can learn a little extra when voices recite poetry. We can change the voice pitch and speed and use extra ways to manage the pronunciation. I've done this because the original PC programs didn't always sound right. If you visit the YouTube website and study poetry reciting by the major celebrities, you can learn a few extra ways to phrase or use a dramatic voice change to portray surprise or a cynical or upbeat mood. But if you study the short poetry, then you should be able to match what's being portrayed and to gain more confidence for longer poetry. Spoken poetry is either meant to entertain, inform or impress us with the way that Danny Kaye could with his film portrayals of contrived lyrics meant just for his style or character. We imitate what impressionists imitate eg magician Tommy Cooper and so on. Having seen others do their thing, we can have the confidence to get the jist into a brand new representation of what Tommy Cooper would say and do. I do this with my own exploration of characters such as the popular Big Bang Theory and Sheldon Cooper. How would he argue something to win the argument or to impress others? Spoken poetry is sometimes used to convince others of a supported cause eg Ban the Bomb...  Does the poetry increase momentum if we speak faster or louder, or use the best vocabulary or diction? Do we slur some words eg loadsa money instead of loads of money?  While many poems rely on the vowel ending sounds like day, pay and he and she and my and I and low and know and do and you, we may also overuse love and above rhymes, but whatever fits well stays in, unless we feel we can try a different rhyme instead... Or someone offers us editing suggestions... My Stephen Gayford wildlife poems have sometimes consisted of 24 lines, yet not always as 3 of the 8-lined verses. Sometimes I create a different format, so I can read the text on the PC monitor, rather than scrolling down and having difficulty reading the last verse. The poemhunter-dot-com website actually allows us to create and upload our spoken text, yet it will create its own version, too, such that these may appear on the dailymotion-dot-com website as well. So if you visit these websites, you may or may not appreciate the spoken word presentations. If trying to record poetry, allow a few seconds of silence before and after, without actually moving the microphone or your own body. Rustling ruins many a reading. My first use of recordings had to be for my songs, as I had to get the tunes recorded based on my singing the lyrics. Songs include choruses being repeated, yet this isn't really used in spoken poetry. However, there can be a dramatic effect if the first verse gets repeated for a final verse as well. Some poets use a soft musical background hoping to enhance the reading, I prefer to hear every word the first time and every time. An audience gets the chance to lip read and that's a different situation in which the microphone is lower, or to the side of the mouth. I've used the Windows PCs to get recordings that way. The question then is whether the playback is really spot on or not and each word says it as it was meant to. If not, we must keep trying. ",
