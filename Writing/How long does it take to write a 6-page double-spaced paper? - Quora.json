            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, the exact answer to your question is that \u201cit depends\u201d. But the exact solution to your problem is \u201caverage 1 month\u201d assuming that 1) it is your own research you are writing about 2) most of the experimentations and findings are finalized 3) you have quite a few years experience into research such that you have a thorough literature knoledge for referencing 4) all your co authors and corresponding author are aware that you are writing an article and have allocated time for commenting, proof reading and organisational modification of the article. Let's say you are in your fourth year of research and have a significant finding in terms of current literature knowledge available, and that you have thouroughly tested to validate authenticity of your finding, and also that you are moderate to skilled in the native language you write in, it will take you one to three weeks to write 6 page article to proof it yourself for gramatical errors, modifications of writing style, arrangement of paragraphs and bibliography. Next one to four weeks would be required for your co authors to read comment, suggest, discuss and proof your manuscript till finalization. Hope it helps and good luck in writing! ",
