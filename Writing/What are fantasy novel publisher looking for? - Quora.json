            "answer_text": "Good question! I hope I can help from the publisher-perspective. There are some very good answers here, so do take them on board in addition to this\u2014especially Ms Lackey\u2019s response. Do not attempt to please a publisher by predicting what \u2018fad\u2019 they might, may, could possibly be interested in. Show the publisher what they never knew they wanted by finding your own, unique and powerful voice! Do, this by focusing on your audience\u2014your reader. Fix that one reader in your mind and tell them your story in a way that grips them; holds them tight and does not let them go (even when they have put the book down). Create something that is uniquely yours\u2014not a rehash of somebody else\u2019s work. Sure, you may use existing tropes, but makes these stand out in a way that intrigues and creates an unexpected journey. World-building is good. When the reader gets a sense of the world beyond the main narratives (without ever losing sight of clarity and focus), they will want to stay in your world. Think ecosystem/Universe, whilst honouring the intimacy of the moment (just you and your reader). Avoid \u2018telling your reader what is happening\u2019\u2014this is just information overload waiting to happen. Breadcrumb your story! Keep us guessing and sculpt the \u2018perfect\u2019 tempo of how each arc unfolds, evolves and ends. Guide your reader by employing emotional impact, curiosity and letting them use their own imagination. And, drive the story in ways that are natural\u2014a series of moments that are motivated by (and flow from), other moments. Remember to avoid the trap of the \u2018single story\u2019\u2014create contrast, diversity and polarity (tension) within the narrative. Maintain your creative-tension\u2014holding the vision of your book, without letting the \u2018reality\u2019 of the process cause you to \u2018dumb down\u2019 that overarching vision. Too many authors have great ideas, only to discard them when everyday critics say \u2018that will never work\u2019, \u2018this should happen next\u2026\u2019 or \u2018no publisher will touch that\u2019! Overall, do the work\u2014don\u2019t cut corners or skip important aspects of the authoring. Do the best you can, get it done and remember\u2014you are leaving a legacy. Reader\u2019s hundreds of years from now could be enjoying your words; inspired to recreate your world in their imaginations! ",

By the time an editor sees it, the \u201chot thing\u201d will be dead, and there will have been two new \u201chot things\u201d since then. Just write a damned good story. Make sure your grammar and spelling are correct. Don\u2019t try to recast your unsold SF story by taking out the \u201cblasters\u201d and substituting \u201cwands.\u201d Don\u2019t try to recast your unsold western by taking out the \u201cranches\u201d and substituting \u201ccastles.\u201d Make sure your characters are solid and believable. Your relationships should make sense. Your characters should never do something just because you want them to do that to drive the plot along. At no time in the history of the universe has anyone ever walked into an inn, looked at a group of people he knows nothing about and said \u201cGreetings travelers! You look trustworthy! Would you like to join my quest?\u201d And at no time in the history of the multiverse has anyone answered that question with \u201cWhy, of course!\u201d unless he or she intended to murder and rob the innocent dweeb who asked it. Never write up your Dungeons and Dragons (or any other game) adventure and think it will work as a book. If I can mentally hear dice rolling every time your character makes a decision, it\u2019s not a book, it\u2019s a D and D adventure written up as a book. Follow C.S. Friedman\u2019s advice. ",
