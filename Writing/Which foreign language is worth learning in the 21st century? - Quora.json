            "answer_text": "As a person who has had major success with languages in the field of marketing ,my take Is sure to raise some eye brows: Today the technology plays a big part in foreign languages . What use to take 45 mins to 1 hour in putting my thoughts into Italian and /or French ,abt 5 years back , today it takes 30 seconds. So i have a an email in Italian and it takes half a minute to get in English. Or Vice versa . Same is the case of spoken lingo: There is automatic translator that acts like a on line translator. So having worked in 2 languages of European languages and at home being fluent in 3 indian ,i feel that other soft skills like team player,honesty ,ability to take a long termish view And a hunger for solid info and above all Ready to work with different cultures ,and lastly not feigning of having understood .These are the qualities which would take you in Life . For all practical purposes , English is the lingua franca and there is a Globish ( globalised English) That would take care . Ganesh NARAYANAN ",

            "answer_text": "I personally think: Mandarin ChineseArabicOnly because these are widely spoken languages and they are always in need for people who can translate. A big chunk of the human population speaks these languages so it will be extremely beneficial. Chinese, Taiwanese, Singapore, many other places in Asia speak Mandarin Chinese. Trust me, it is not as hard as people say it is. The characters and like memorising pictures, yes the tones may be difficult but over time and practice, it becomes so natural. There is also no conjugating grammar. Every verb will forever stay like that. The grammar is super easy. Arabic on the other hand is hard but it's really fun to learn. North Africa, the Middle East, and some parts of Central Asia and Central Africa speak Arabic. I know a lady who learned Arabic and she always had a job because translating is in demand. A lot of people speak Arabic and it's a very useful language to know. You choose your pick :) these are my opinions. ",
