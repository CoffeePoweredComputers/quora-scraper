            "answer_text": "Q. How do I write the date format in 2020? A. YYYY MM DD is the Example 2020 10 21 is today\u2019s date. Where YYYY is year numbers, MM is month numbers, and DD is day numbers. The delimiter is a bit of a problem: space, slash, hyphen, or my favorite underscore. When Landru the computer does sorting, this format easily puts newest first or last and is monotonic, except for oopsies. That being said I sometimes write by hand DD spell three letter month abbreviation YYYY Example 21 oct 2020 this format helps the meat machines interpret correctly. Vote third party. If we all do it, it is done. Do not squeeze my face about spoiler aspect of third parties. I cannot figure how to squeeze back and enlighten people to stop thinking so small and hopeless. There have been other major parties in USA politics. The sooner the Democratic Party and the Republican Party join the Federalist and rep-dem and Whig parties in the dustbin of history, the better. Do not waste your time and mine, arguing about how much less bad your major party candidate is. They are both bad; and, they almost always are two long time career professional politicians aka hedonistic liars. Do not waste your time and mine pointing out how impossible it is to change. Look around you and see ubiquitous processes that were not here decades ago! Cell phones, internet, satellite tv, Uber, wastebook, other things I can\u2019t think of right now, were not in anyone\u2019s imagination just a few years ago. We can do this. Astoundingly, it is kind of like addiction. Once you know that it is not working, you must just stop it. The major parties and the mass media are not working to make our lives better. ",

            "answer_text": "There are various ways. There is year/month/day, day/month/year, year/day/month and month/day/year As it is 20 October 2020, I\u2019d write it: 20/10/20 (dd/mm/yy) although if I were filling out a form, as I\u2019m in Canada the form would probably use Canada\u2019s method of 2020/10/20 (year/month/day). The US generally writes it mm/dd/yy or 10/20/20. You can also write it yyyy/mm/dd or 2020/10/20 (which is another standard). The problem with using just numbers is that you don\u2019t know if 7/9/20 is July 9th 2020 as per the US or 07 Sept 2020 as per the other standard. So, depending upon the country you are in you can write it in one of several ways. Here\u2019s a list of countries and their standards: Date format by country - Wikipedia ",
