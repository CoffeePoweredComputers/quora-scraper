            "answer_text": "\u2022 Take situations that would usually appear in a serious drama, (a funeral, a cat dying, torture, suicide), and push them to an absurdist extreme or in an unexpected direction, (people keep falling into the grave, the cat\u2019s death scene is treated like a human\u2019s death scene in every possible way, the prisoner gargles the water and acts like they\u2019re having a good time, the person attempting suicide is also trying to do a comedy bit). \u2022 Use irony as much as possible. \u2022 Try to play the situations straight \u2014 the more realistic you can make them seem, the funnier it will be. \u2022 Gallows humor is delightful \u2014 and a staple of dark comedies. Remember that dark comedies are still comedies. Part of what makes them work is the sort of gleeful exuberance that they have about the macabre. Sometimes they can go overboard with just how sick it is, and make the audience feel depressed. That is not the goal of a good dark comedy film, IMO. I think this is why Death at a Funeral is more highly regarded by audiences than Sleeping Dogs Lie. Go forth and make that moving picture! ",
