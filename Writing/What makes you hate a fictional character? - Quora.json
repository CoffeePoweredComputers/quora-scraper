            "answer_text": "Why would I hate a fictional character? I would hate the real person.I do not like obsessive dominance, sadism, or a drive to control other people. I hate abusive qualities in real people, and I would despise fictional characters with those traits. Characters I felt a sense of real horror towards include Dolores Umbridge (from the Harry Potter series) and Bernardo Gui,* as presented in The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco. I could have mentioned I do not like characters when they are badly written, but that is not quite relevant to your question. More relevant to the question of Joffrey v. Joker: it's interesting to wonder why we do not hate Hannibal Lecter as much as we should. Dr. Lecter is charming, yes. He is also a murderer who can kill without the slightest twinge of conscience. He is brilliant, yes, and he is capable of psychologically torturing you. And yet, most of us find it hard to dislike him.Why that should be is hard to say. If Dr. Lecter were a real person, his likability is hardly a redeeming quality. No: it makes him the more dangerous. We should know this. But many of us like Dr. Lecter in spite of all that he is. Why is that? The answer may have something to do with why you find it harder to hate the Joker than Joffrey. A personal note: Wilbur Smith's novels The Burning Shore and The Power of the Sword told of two South African half-brothers: the British Shasa, and the Afrikaner Manfred. Although Manfred was a racist who admired Hitler (and in the novel told Hitler so to his face), I could not despise him as much as I should have. This was because I found his half-brother, the alleged hero of the novel, to be so arrogant and elitist that even a racist bigot seemed better in comparison.By the way, Shasa had wronged his half-brother, and  Shasa was equally racist. (We saw him treat his Afrikaner half-brother and a black man he had known from boyhood with equal condescension and contempt.) That helped make Manfred sympathetic to me, so that I ignored his obvious racism. Or to be exact: somehow I found him likable in spite of qualities I would not like at all in a real man.That reasoning was subjective on my part. Your reasoning is likely to be so as well. Only you can find out why you feel the way you do. Hoping to have helped. * Bernardo Gui is a real person visiting Eco's novel. I do not know if he was so despicable in real life, or if that was Eco taking liberties with the facts for the sake of art. ",

            "answer_text": "When they have no redeeming qualities, however you personally define them.  You don't usually hate a character as strongly if you find some trait you like about them. By contrast, with a character you absolutely despise, there's absolutely nothing you like about them. This is in no way restricted to villain characters and applies to any character.  This will vary from person to person. What I may consider a sufficiently redeeming quality for a character might be something that is the worst pet peeve of someone else. Then again, I might find a character despicable when someone else likes them for a particular reason.  And the same trait that is redeemable in one character can be make you hate another character even more because traits work differently with different characters in different mixes. A high intelligence level can be cool and interesting in a character like Sherlock Holmes but come off as smug and annoying in a villain. Writers are aware of this and choose particular cocktails of traits to try to get a reaction out of viewers/readers. I think this may be why you hate Joffrey but like the Joker. As far as I and many others are concerned, Joffrey simply has no redeeming qualities. He's petulant, bratty, sadistic, mean and so many other terrible traits. There are zero things I like about him.* The Joker, on the other hand, has traits I find redeemable. He's clever, funny at times, and entertaining. He complements Batman and balances him. For me, that makes him a character that I love to hate, instead of just plain hating. *Another good example of a character like this is Dolores Umbridge from Harry Potter. She's almost universally hated. ",
