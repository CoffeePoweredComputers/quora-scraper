            "answer_text": "If it\u2019s an opinion essay, then you really must include your opinion in the introduction (paragraph 1). This is because your entire essay body will be supporting that opinion. If the reader doesn\u2019t know your opinion from the start, how can they follow the logic of your supporting paragraphs? For Both Sides + Opinion, I teach (as many do) to keep your opinion OUT of the intro and the body paragraphs and to dedicate the final paragraph to your opinion instead. You want the examiner to know you can discuss, in a neutral way, the reasons that others believe in Side A/Side B. If the essay doesn't call for your opinion on a problem, it is best not to give it. Spend your time and effort answering the question called for. ",
