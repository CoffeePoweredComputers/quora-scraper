            "answer_text": "There are two things on which GS Mains paper can be predicted i.e. STATIC/UMBRELLA SUBJECTS and CURRENT HAPPENINGS There are issues which will always be relevant for UPSC Mains like women empowerment,globalisation,constitutional bodies,judiciary, Kashmir issue, health and education, poverty, agriculture, economy etc. Now the trend is ,actually, integrating these big issues with current happenings in India. UPSC focuses on recent happenings around these topic and it will frame questions accordingly. Let\u2019s see 2nd question from last year mains: GS 2- To what extent is article 370 of the Indian Constitution, bearing marginal note \u201cTemporary provision with respect to the State of Jammu and Kashmir\u201d,temporary? Discuss the future prospects of this provision in the context of Indian polity. Now if you understand this thing that no matter 50 years passes on and whichever government comes into power, Kashmir issue will be a major cause of concern for India. Because it has altogether separate constitution and there are social issues as well. And if you know then last year there was serious debate going on Article 370 of Indian constitution related to J&K. hence, the question came in the exam. Now you must be understanding there is interlinkage of static subjects with current happenings in the country. Even if you are excellent at predicting questions there will be questions which you\u2019ll think has been taken out from nowhere. For example: In 2016 in GS 1 there was a question related to King Krishnadevaraya of Hampi(Karnataka) and his works. Almost every student found it difficult to write an answer for this . But yes, with little wisdom you can attempt this question. For more clarity, analyse last 3 years question paper of all GS papers. You will, gradually, come to know how to predict questions. ATB ",
