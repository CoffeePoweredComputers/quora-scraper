            "answer_text": "The best format for this that I have seen is the \u201cwho, what, where, when, why, how\u201d. To break this down a bit, I will give examples \u201cWho\u201d- who are you welcoming? Are they guests? Family? Friends? Donors? Etc. \u201cWhat\u201d and \u201cwhere\u201d - what are they being welcomed to or for? Is this a special occasion? If so, what is it and what did they do to get here? \u201cWhen\u201d - this is a bit trickier one, but can be used to address the event itself as well. For example, \u201cthe third annual spring fundraiser\u201d or \u201cthe sesquicentennial ball\u201d. \u201cWhy\u201d - why are you glad they have come? Why are they here? Is it a celebration? A formal meeting? This can fit almost any situation. \u201cHow\u201d - how will the event proceed? This can be a variety of things, from giving the outline for a meeting, to introducing a speaker to the stage for the next part of an event. How the event is going to go is the likely the biggest part of your speech, as people appreciate knowing how things will play out. Overall, you have to fit your speech to whatever circumstances your event has. Be sure to welcome the people, tell them why you appreciate them coming, address the event, and elaborate on the schedule or upcoming thing. You are the face that they will remember at the start of this so it is your job to set the tone. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a few tips that I use when I want to write a great welcome speech keeping in mind that a welcome speech is a \u2018bridge\u2019 between the host (presumably you) and the person you are introducing. You know who is speaking but the audience may not. Your responsibility is getting the audience interested and excited about the speaker and providing them with enough background and information that they can do so. Understand the context and occasion - are you welcoming someone as part of a wedding, a keynote speaker to a conference or someone that is delivering a workshop - the context here is important in understanding how you will be welcoming the person (I\u2019m assuming here) and the tone and message you want to conveyBuilding on the answer from Sage - identify the who, what, where, when, why and how - however, I would simplify this into:Who is this person and what are they doingWhat is their credibility and expertise? What is their experience on the matter?Why should the audience listen to them? What is in it for the audience?A great question to ask if you are introducing a speaker: ask them how they would like to be introduced or ask them for an introduction. This gets rid of any confusion around building the introduction yourself and figuring out what to say.Hope that helps! ",
