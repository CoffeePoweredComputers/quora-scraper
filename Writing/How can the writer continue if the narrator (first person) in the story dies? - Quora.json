The second is a temporary switch to \u201cThe Second Person\u201d (still a first person perspective, but a different first person). Oh - I\u2019ve also seen it done when the entire story was told on line, so although the person died, it was just their avatar, and not really them. There are a lot of ways if you think about it :) ",

It was picked up by his closest person in the story That second person also made corrective notes the the first parts written in a few places. Though a touch confusing at first it was explained fully by the second person in a full narrative of after the funeral. ",
