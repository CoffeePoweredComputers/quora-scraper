            "answer_text": "Yes, I would think it is correct I have heard this expression or one like it on a number of occasions. It means that something is really hurting, really hurtful if taken figuratively; if the expression (sentence) is meant literally, then it means that the physical pain is a symptom of a condition that is truly bringing death. I think people use the expression mostly in a figurative manner, and this is what you have done because you admit that \u201chere pain means the sorrow of life.\u201d The context of your poem will assure readers that you mean a figurative interpretation. So yes, \u201cI am dying in pain\u201d is very appropriate. By the way, your use of the word \u201cdying\u201d is significant. It is actually what poets term hyperbole, great exaggeration to make a point dramatically. It is an effective poetic technique. ",
