The table of contents, if any, is a good starting point. Read the text through and notice what is interesting. Summarize from memory. Read again. Take notes. If the document is online, then link to the place. Once it is comprehended, decide what recommends it. Each format has its own types of prologues. The author may have addressed this a few times at the introduction, first chapter or section, end of each, or conclusion. There is usually a main idea overall, and then supporting ideas along with the optional examples. These are often comparing to the bibliography. Chart multiple authors like a discussion. A review would also be about style and how they should have made the case. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume the long text is one you did not write. If it is well written non-fiction, take the title into consideration and look for the thesis statement near the end of the introduction and near the beginning of the conclusion. Then pay attention to section headings, boldface and italics and paragraph openings. Synthesize this information into a smooth expository or narrative statement. ",
