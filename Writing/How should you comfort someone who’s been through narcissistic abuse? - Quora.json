            "answer_text": "I didn't have the internet or counselors who could help me with the cPTSD at the time. The bulk of my healing has resulted from this forum and YouTube videos. I can just share what was comforting to me so far. Realizing that I did a good thing for myself by leaving the narcissist. This was the begining of valuing myself. Reading about and talking to other narcisscistic abuse survivors and watching YouTube videos. This helped me depersonalize the narcs treatment of me. Realizing that the narcissist NEEDS to behave in this chaotic, abusive way in ALL their personal relationships. Which means that they will eventually treat the replacment they've been grooming during your discard phase, as cruelly as they treated you. This was the beginning of me unhooking myself from being uniquely responsible for their abuse. Realizing what gaslighting was. The narcissist insidiously erodes your sense of reality as a means to control you and keep you off balance. Meanwhile, telling you how crazy you are and how everyone else thinks you are crazy too. This was the begining of me recognizing I lost my sense of self somewhere. Realizing that it's more than likely that I'm a codependent and/or empath and what this means for me in my relationships. Most importantly, I recognized that being \u201cother centered\u201d, was just as dysfunctional and unhealthy as being \u201cself centered\u201d. I needed to realize that I was entitled to and worthy of unconditional love. That being \u201cother centered \u201c was a survival mechanism learned in childhood and will not serve me well in my adult life. I'm learning that self love is not selfish. I'm trying to figure out how to apply self love in my life. There is help out there and we can recover and thrive as many have done before us. The aftermath of narcissistic abuse is beyond horrendous, but there is hope. ",

            "answer_text": "Just help them to be themselves again little by little . And remind them of what they used like to do and go do it with them . Whatever they did before they met this abusive person is good place to start doing something with them so they find themselves and their spirit again . Once that happens they can move on by themselves quite quickly. Also remind them of no contact with their abuser . And don\u2019t worry about trying to understand why it can be difficult for someone who has been abused to be missing the abuser . They have been stripped of so much of themselves that they go back for their mirrored existence . and most of the time they have been isolated . So take this person out to do what they once enjoyed and keep them from seeing their abuser . Once you they break the addiction of their abuser they recover much faster . Also you might need to remind this person of their value and that they were misssed for who they were . Remind them that they will feel, whole once again with time and effort to start living the right life again and by not seeing the person who abused them . And keep the abused person around with you as much as you can to keep them from not going back and making contact . Go out together and be with them. Be patient and realize that they often going to have waves ebbs and flows of feeling the need to see their abuser . ",
