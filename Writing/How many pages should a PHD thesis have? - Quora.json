            "answer_text": "A PhD thesis should have as many pages as it takes to explain the problem, give adequate background, present the results and give adequate evidence of \"goodness\". The form the evidence takes can make a huge difference in length. I've seen theoretical theses well under 100 pages, because the evidence took the form of mathematical proofs. On the other hand, if the evidence involves extensive surveys, lab experiments or performance studies, then 300+ pages wouldn't be that unusual. ",
