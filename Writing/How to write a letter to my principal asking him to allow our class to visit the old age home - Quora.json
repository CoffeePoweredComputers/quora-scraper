            "answer_text": "I suspect you know how to write a letter. Ask your counselor or home room teacher or language arts teacher to assist you with requesting the school consider the idea. Outline some of your ideas, then work with one of the adults at the school to contact and discuss the idea with an old age home. In your letter to the school, detail why you think such a visit would be educational. List out some of the things you would expect your classmates to learn . Then, use that same list when you talk to the home - let them know why you want to come. Also, for both contacts (school and old age home) you need to be prepared to discuss what benefits there will be to the residents of the old age home. It isnt a zoo - they do not need people walking through the establishment staring at them. This is a good idea - just do some ground work up front to figure out the who, what, where, when, and why of the event and present it in a way that gives people an idea of the benefits to all. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear Principal ((Insert name)): Senior citizens are invisible in our society. We treat their old age as if it were an infectious disease. This is ridiculous. An old person cannot communicate his age or infirmity to me , but he or she can communicate his great experience and wisdom. Our class would like to visit the senior citizens\u2019 center so that we can show our local seniors that they are not forgotten and stuffed in a building like old, useless property. We want them to feel that are not forgotten, that they still have much of value to share. If nothing else, our visit to the senior citizens\u2019 center can be viewed as a class in oral history, because older people lived history and they can provide such authentic perspectives. Best, YOU ",
