            "answer_text": "I am not sure of the meaning perfect.  The perfection or absence of defects can be achieve after an infinite time. So, I think we must be way more modest, and think \"practice made it good\" or \"with practice you do it better.\" Anyway, the question of the 10,000 hours means that this is not easy to achieve in a sort period of... how much time?Let imagine a pianist that starts like Mozart at three years of age.  Assuming the child starts doing the first year only an average of 20 minutes in two sessions per day, (for the whole year)how much is it?  50 weeks (2 weeks vacation) by 6 days by 40 minutes, makes 400 hours.  Wow!  I was not expecting that much.  OkIn the second year, the average can be little higher. Let's imagine that is two sessions of 30 minutes.  Not exactly in a single jump, but slowly increasing a little bit each month.Then ins this case we have 600 hours.  In the third year, or six years of age, the child can work a little more. Like close to 1000 hours.  It seems a great jump.  The next question is... if it is possible to work more... like twice more Than I said for these first years.   I am not sure, for I had never been involved in teaching a child to play the piano, not I do know anyone that did. But theoretically is possible on condition of being a very reinforcing, and not applying ever \"any aversive control\".  This means, you never can tell the boy, this way not!  You had committed an error, etc. You must transmit the child the feeling that he is extraordinary, even genial.  Showering a lot of praises over the child for the work he is doing, the child wants more and more praises, and he only get them by practicing the damn piano.  Outside the piano playing, life is like everywhere, very little praises.   The same idea is valid for teaching elementary maths and elementary logic, since the child is 3 years old.  Even developing as well the mother language, and even a little also a foreign language. I think this works.  If there is not work done there are not results.  This must be some elemental paradigm.   As the pianist child has entered now in the fourth year learning to play the piano he has 7 years.  He has accumulated 400+600+1000=  2,000 hours.  Some young students of piano, had not made that much at age 12 or 14.  This difference can be noticeable.    The next year, the child could do as much 2,000 hours?  I am not sure.  Reality can tell you if the child can do so much work  or not.  Let's imagine that on average for this 4th  year he can do as much 1,500 hours.  And so the is increasing as the child is growing up. In fact, I had watched a video of some child pianist that worked as much  8 hours a day.   I am not sure if this is real or not.  I am a little skeptical.  They child had perhaps 7 or 8 years.   His mum said in some moment in the video, he never tires, and I have to work to make him to stop playing for it is time to go to bed.  I ignore if this testimony is true.  The boy is called Marc Yu.  Let me fetch his video in youtube.  Marc Yu - Born Genius    <   There are many videos about this boy. Well, I am only pretending to consider the question if the practice works.  For if we say, practice works but you need talent we are annulling the previous statement.   Then, practice works, but to work it is needed a lot of practice.  Not a sudden, \"My I am in a harry and have to practice a lot.\"  This does not work.     Nobody ever had learned to speak Chinese by magic.  Or this what I think.  It takes a lot to learn a little Chinese, but it takes many years  of work with the language and writing to enter examinations to become a Mandarin.  The early learning has some advantages.  The brain of the child is making privileged paths for the questions he is learning at an early age.  Another question is, the boy would not want to practice if you apply aversives to his work.  Ditto in other words.  If you tell a child often, this is bad, or this is wrong, or you are mistaken again, these are aversives.  And the child starts to hate this shit of a job.   No child love to do something you are telling him he is doing wrong. The rational against applying aversives to the child is that they take the place of praises.  All children love praises.  But if you are telling aversives this counter balance your praises, and makes the practice less rewarding.  Well, I wrote a book about this subject. Then, some co-worker I was explaining this question asked me, \"if you do not tell a boy about its errors, how he would know he is wrong?\" I told him, \"a child would know what is right because you are praising him too often.   The accumulation of things well done, make the boy to know when something was done wrong.  There is not any need to tell him.   Any normal child can commit errors, but he can do a lot of things right.   Summing up: if you rebuke the child for his errors, he began to think \"I am not very good doing this\".  He is then loosing his faith in his capacity for the matter in question.  And his interest start to wane.  Well, forgive for the extension.  I am very talkative.   There is another question I was about to miss.  If you start too late to learn something. you have not preferencial circuits in  your brain to learn this or that  with great effienciency.   I mean, the parths in your brain are very disperse into a miriade of different questions and the attention then is weaker and the available time has to be shared among a lot of different matters.  That was the  I said in other post \"less is more.\"  Less spread among different matters permit you to have more time to expend learning questions yiu think are more important.  For the balloon to go higher it is needed to throw ballast overboard.   The same in science,  you have to be a bad student in several matters to concentrate your time and attention on the matters of your preference.  And this is the meaning I pretended to transmite with phrase  \"less is more\".  I suppose this has a clear relation with intelligence. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. First off, Malcolm Galdwell is referencing the work pioneered by K. Anders Ericsson and his colleagues. You can read more on the topic on Quora here: How accurate is Malcolm Gladwell's argument that it takes around 10,000 hours of focused practice to develop a world-class skill? Since Mr. Gladwell wrote his book there has been much discussion about the \"10,000 hour rule\". One of the most interesting pieces I've seen so far is an excerpt on Salon.com from Tom Clynes book, \"\u201cTHE BOY WHO PLAYED WITH FUSION: Extreme Science, Extreme Parenting, and How to Make a Star\u201d. You can find the excerpt here: The \u201crage to master\u201d: What it takes for those scary-smart kids to succeed In short, he argues that 10,000 hours is only part of the equation to be on the \"prodigy\" level. Many other factors conspire, including having access to the right mentors, being in the right kind of environment to nurture your gifts, a great deal of luck, and a burning \"rage\" to master a particular domain.   (Of course one could argue that being \"world class\" and being a prodigy are two different things, but I think there are still some good applicable insights in the article.) ",
