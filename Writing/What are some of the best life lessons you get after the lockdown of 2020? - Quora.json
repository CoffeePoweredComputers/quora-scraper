            "answer_text": "The lockdown has taught me to evolve, upgrade, and be resilient to change and overcome the challenges. Not everyone is lucky enough to see another day nor will we get a chance like this to be at home with people we love. Life and its chapters will grow but we need to adapt to positive and lateral thinking to fit into the book. The choice of being bold, italics, or just normal is left to you. Mother Earth will survive with or without us. Some very interesting lessons learned in 2020, especially during this COVID Pandemic. 1. You can work from home and be productive in both professional life (work, attend video calls, attend meetings, etc.) as well as personal life (can handle workload along with your wife by dishwashing, cleaning, etc.) 2. You can save a lot of money by keeping yourself limited for everything starting from food ordering to groceries to shopping or grooming yourself or to spend on holidays or weekend getaways etc. 3. We are appreciating the birds and the bees. For many of us, hearing birds singing in the joys of spring from our open windows and balconies has been the uplifting sound we\u2019ve needed every day. 4. We have woken up to food waste. We throw away one-third of the food we produce that\u2019s almost 1.3 billion tonnes every year. And around 815 million people worldwide are hungry. For those of us that usually take a full cupboard for granted, this could be the wake-up call we need to understand what it's like for others and how we can do our bit in the future. 5. We have learned to love local. While big supermarkets struggle to cope with demand, many local shops have stayed well-stocked and have been going above and beyond to adapt to help their communities. 6. We are engaged and active. We have seen how coming together with the world over can effect real change, really quickly. When we have healed as a human population, we can turn our focus to the climate and our planet, with protests, petitions, movements, and action. 7. Quality time. Apart from doing our usual office work, we also had time to read books we wanted to read for a long time, update our skills, watch our favorite series, we can call our parents as many times as we want, we can cook our beloved one\u2019s favorite dish, etc. 8. And finally, we truly have the power to heal the planet. We might be in lockdown, but nature is not. During this time of human inactivity, we have seen swans and fresh fish return to the water of Venice. Rare wildflowers and declining bee populations could start to recover because many councils are leaving roadside verges uncut, according to Europe\u2019s biggest conservation charity for wild plants. And, due to the shutdown in industrial activity, satellite imagery from the European Space Agency shows that we have temporarily slashed air pollution levels around the world. Cheers,AA :) ",
