If modern day, talk to officiants and newly wedded couples. How did they feel during the ceremony? What moments was memorable, tender, emotional? Now write and do the re-write thing a few times and soon you\u2019ll have an awesome wedding ceremony and a terrific best seller. Please forward a copy of the ceremony or your novels title, so I too, may enjoy . . . Thanks ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A The best description comes from a wedding that you personally attended. The scenes turn out real, the feeling of a wedding is authentic, and the reader tends to be in on the scene. Anything else feels contrived. Of course, you can watch a movie and try describing that but it feels like second-hand and unreal. Good luck. Get yourself invited t a real wedding or just get married and describe it all firsthand. Haha Thanks for asking. ",
