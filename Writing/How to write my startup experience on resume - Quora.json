            "answer_text": "It should appear on your resume, much like any other position would but there are a few things I recommend paying attention to: In your summary, you should make clear if your desired position is in a larger, established company. When folks see that you work at a start-up, and specifically if you have worked at more than one, they will assume that you are looking for more of the same.Watch out for \u201cwe\u201d. Many people will focus on what \u201cwe\u201d accomplished, without clarity on their own contribution. You will want to make sure you are super clear on what you delivered. I would also recommend that you include results (by way of data, if you have it), not just activities.In that experience entry, you should describe the stage the start-up was/is in. Different stages can mean very different work environments and challenges to solve for. So you will want to add a few words on where the company is in its growth cycle.Don\u2019t assume that the person reading the resume is familiar with the company. You\u2019ll want to capture the essence of the company in a short sentence. Simon Sinek has a great TED Talk about finding your \u201cwhy\u201d. it gives some insights on how to talk about what you do and it works great for talking about a company\u2019s mission.I hope this was helpful!",

            "answer_text": "As always, the things you should highlight remain highly dependent on what your actual achievements during that time was. Writing about your startup experience on your resume is very much the same as writing about a normal experience (even if it was YOUR startup, the only thing that really changes would be that you\u2019d be putting \u201cFounder\u201d as your title). In terms of concerns about the startup being new and thus requiring some sort of introduction: I wouldn\u2019t recommend it unless you have the space to put it for every experience to maintain template consistency. Thing is, 99% of people have only heard of 1% of companies. This means that this problem applies to other companies that might not be new either, and yet that convention of needing to explain unknown smaller companies is not needed either. TLDR: Just treat it like any regular job experience. If you want to highlight the culture, do that through the achievement descriptions\u2014 not a marketing blurb for the company ",
