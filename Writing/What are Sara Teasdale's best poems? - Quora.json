            "answer_text": "So far, I really like I Am Not Yours, After Love, and The Falling Star, but I haven't explored nearly enough to have a comprehensive list. I Am Not Yours I am not yours, not lost in you, Not lost, although I long to be Lost as a candle lit at noon, Lost as a snowflake in the sea.   You love me, and I find you still A spirit beautiful and bright, Yet I am I, who long to be Lost as a light is lost in light.   Oh plunge me deep in love\u2014put out My senses, leave me deaf and blind, Swept by the tempest of your love, A taper in a rushing wind. After Love There is no magic any more,       We meet as other people do, You work no miracle for me Nor I for you.   You were the wind and I the sea\u2014There is no splendor any more, I have grown listless as the pool Beside the shore.   But though the pool is safe from stormAnd from the tide has found surcease, It grows more bitter than the sea,       For all its peace. The Falling Star I saw a star slide down the sky,  Blinding the north as it went by, Too burning and too quick to hold, Too lovely to be bought or sold, Good only to make wishes on And then forever to be gone.
