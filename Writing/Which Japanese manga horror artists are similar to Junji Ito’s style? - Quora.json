            "answer_text": "The only thing I saw that was at least remotely similar to Junji Ito\u2019s works is\u2026 Wakusei Closet by Tsubana.  It gets creepy and gives vibes similar to hellstar remina.  There\u2019s also Yajin by Okabe Uru.   Well, MAAAYBE Homunculus, but it was jsut odd and not creepy/scary. So it is one hell of a stretch. Some books try to get to the creepiness level of best Ito\u2019s stories, but they usually fail. So, aside Wakusei Closet it is hard to recommend anything similar. ITO is quite unique. ",
