            "answer_text": "Yes, tutoring, whether you did it privately or through a tutoring company is \u201cwork.\u201d So you are fee to include it on your resume. FYI, I\u2019ve done tutoring before working for companies and private tutoring. And yes, I will include my having done tutoring when it\u2019s relevant. Now because you say it\u2019s not relevant to the job, it comes down to whether that tutoring will add any value? If not, then you can leave it out and see if there something more important to include or expand upon. And if you do want to include it, instead of lumping it with your work history, you could just have a bulleted statement that says you\u2019ve done tutoring. This way, you get it across while keeping your work history limited to what\u2019s relevant. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely - and even if it is not directly relevant to the job you are applying for, please remember that all skills are transferable. Note - professional resume wording is more formal than everyday conversational speaking. For example, you might be applying for an engineering position but you offered private tutoring in mathematics so you could word your experience like this: \u201cServed in a mentoring and supervisory capacity for small groups of students or individuals with an emphasis on providing instruction on technical subjects in a non-technical and relatable manner.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, definitely it counts as an experience. But always remember something, it is through your CV you are going to sell yourself. And you just have around 10 seconds to make an impression on your hiring manager. So if it is not relevant better do not add it. But if you do not have any work experience, there is no harm in adding it. You can highlight your interpersonal skills in your tutoring experience in that case. Thank you. ",
