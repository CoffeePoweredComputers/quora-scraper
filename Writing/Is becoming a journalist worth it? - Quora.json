            "answer_text": "It is for some, it was for me, but I can't know if would be worth it for you. There's no \"answer these 10 questions and I can tell you if it's right for you\" sort of test. Over many decades as a newspaper reporter, then editor, then columnist I worked with all kinds of people. Some were naturals for the job. Some jumped ship as soon as they could changing careers to public relations or, often, some other job that was related to communications. And even looking back at all that I can't tell you what made those who ended up loving the work and finding really great fulfillment in it different from those who found out that they weren't suited for it. I can tell you some of the common ground that those who stayed and loved the work shared. Almost universally they were clever (being smart and clever aren't exactly the same thing - I can't define clever but this will have to do ... these people are good at figuring things out); and almost universally they felt challenged and driven to meet challenges rather than to give up. Heck, they welcomed challenges and were fueled by them. Some were good writers but I've also known some excellent newspapermen who were - at best - OK writers but terrific at reporting, at finding things out. I was good at, as an example, finding ways to get people to talk for publication even at times when that wasn't the smart move for them. A few that failed, that didn't fit in, treated minor stories with disdain and rushed through them without caring. They only tried when it was a big deal story. Most of them, by not being challenged by the basics didn't learn enough of the craft to succeed. Lazy people in general usually failed. I've done a lot of typing but - still - the honest answer from me is that I don't know if it will be worth it for you or if you'd be any good at it (it's a horrible way to make a living if you don't have a gift for it). I can\u2019t imagine - for myself - having done anything else. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. You\u2019ll work stupidly hard, but have a lot of fun. Its always been a rough and ready trade. It tends to attract the misfits, the uncool kids, and often those with drink problems.. As a journalist you\u2019re always on the outside looking in. You get to learn a little about a lot of different subjects. Journalists tend to be excellent in pub quizes.You may get to interview some really interesting people and get into some wonderful scrapes in foreign countries.There is competition between media outlets, but a bunch hacks on a press trip normally get on very well. There is a mutual understanding that is missing in lots of jobs..Journalists aren't in it for the money. If they were they would be accountants and be very boring\u2026Journalists are not doctors or paramedics - you don't go to work and save a life. But you still play an essential role in society. More so today when our \u2018leaders\u2019 are going bonkers..You may well become a political or cultural influencer. Your view matters, so you are often treated quite well for this reason (a lot of lunches). You get invited on TV to give your views..You\u2019ll ALWAYS have the best party stories to tell, easily beating your mate who works in IT (all be it, he\u2019ll be making 5 x your salary and drive \u2018a Range\u2019)Did I mention, you\u2019ll be paid to have a lot of fun and get to take the piss out of some very rich / famous / important people?
