            "answer_text": "First, I\u2019ll scope it down to academic books versus PhD theses. Then, lets look at it based on field. In the humanities, a PhD tends to be very similar to a monograph, with some important differences. In fact, may PhD students write their thesis with the intention of turning it into their \u201cfirst book\u201d on the way toward a tenure track job. And if it\u2019s a good thesis, it\u2019s very plausible to find an academic publisher and, with some revisions, publish it in the academic press. The phrase, \u201cwith some revisions,\u201d is key, however. A PhD thesis often differs from a publishable monograph in several ways. The PhD thesis will tend to spend much more time on a literature review, which is a demonstrative section used to illustrate that the student has spent time while studying to accumulate mastery over a field. This is important to convince the student\u2019s thesis committee that they\u2019ve formed the academic breadth necessary to become a professor capable of teaching and pursuing a range of problems in a field. By contrast, an academic monograph is designed to persuade a specialized sub-discipline of a novel argument. The important part is the original argument and line of reasoning, and readers are often field experts knowledgable of the relevant literature. So the lit review can be pared down. In other fields, the monograph is less important, so the thesis may be more like a collection of related journal articles. And when compared to nonacademic books, the thesis is very different as it serves a specific purpose \u2014 to persuade an academic committee that you have the ability to do original research in a subfield.

            "answer_text": "A2A. A thesis is a report on scholarly research conducted by the candidate alone and aimed at the level of his examination committee. A book does not necessarily meet any of these three criteria. Writing a book may therefore have a very different approach. For instance, I know an author who writes daily (by hand) on a terras in London and hopes that his assistent can edit and type it into pages. He confessed to me \u201cIf I produce via this method one page it is a very good Day!\u201d I know of another author who pays some other one to make his book. He only gives plots and ideas to his ghostwriter (who is paid). Concluding: writing a book is mostly widely different from writing a thesis: in procedure, effort, nr. of authors, etc. ",
