            "answer_text": "Not being a lawyer, I can only give an opinion that has no weight in law. If a person is considering claiming the book is in \u201cpublic domain\u201d because the author and translator are both dead, they may be disappointed. Despite the publishing house and the country of publication being currently nonexistent, the person hoping to make the claim will still have several barriers in the way. For one thing, translators do not hold copyright to the work because without the original text, they\u2019d have had nothing to translate. It is unlikely the publisher ever held copyright because, unless it was a \u201cwork for hire\u201d, copyright belongs to the author and may still be the property of heirs to the author or to anyone to whom that right might have been assigned. My contracts usually have the phrase \u201cheirs or assigns\u201d somewhere in them. As you say, this all took place in country that no longer exists, so you need to look to the laws that existed at the time, in that country, regarding the duration of copyright. Those laws may still hold in an international court, though they differ from country to country. In Canada, for instance, as of the signing of the trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the US (2018), the life of the copyright is the life of the author plus 70 years. Under the Berne Convention, UK copyright law is typically 70 years from the end of the calendar year in which the last remaining author of the work dies. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a tricky one. You might need a lawyer to untangle whether it\u2019s still under copyright. It might depend on the copyright laws that existed at the time it was published. Since Yugoslavia is now several different countries, the copyright laws in those places might apply, and if that\u2019s the case it might be in the public domain, or it might expire in 2049. If it is under copyright, that would belong to the author\u2019s heirs. Also, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re saying that the book was published in 1953, or the translation was. The translation would have its own copyright, so if the book was from 1953 and the translation was later, then it would depend on the laws in effect when that translation was published. Yup, this might require a bit of sleuthing. ",
