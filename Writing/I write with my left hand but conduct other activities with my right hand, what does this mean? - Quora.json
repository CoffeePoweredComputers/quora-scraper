I cannot write with my right hand. Not at all. I use a computer mouse with my right hand. I wipe my bum with my right hand. I play guitar, drums, and many other instruments in the right handed position. I hold my cutlery like a right handed person (with my fork in my left, which seems odd to me, because that\u2019s my good hand, but whatever, you right handed oddballs). It means nothing. To anyone. I don\u2019t even care which hand I use for stuff. ",
