            "answer_text": "I believe that heaven and hell are both real, but at the same time I also believe in rebirth, which is kind of the opposite, because you\u2019re reborn rather than spending the rest of your life in hell or heaven. I prefer that method more, because I can\u2019t comprehend or stand the fact that if there were rebirth, I could\u2019ve had infinite lives beforehand, but couldn\u2019t remember them. I\u2019d prefer to keep my memory, even if I had to go to hell. ",

            "answer_text": "Heaven and hell? Why would I believe in such concepts? There is no evidence to support such nonsense. Here is what we do know, all throughout human history cultures have made up many versions of some afterlife, these concepts are of the human imagination and nothing more, old stories and fables are just that, stories and fables. There is no evidence of an afterlife whatsoever. That is why I question such claims, until such claims meet the burden of proof I will remain skeptical. Wally ",

I believe it was due to the parochial school we attended and by the way, we were a charity case in case anybody wondered. It was important to our mother at that time especially to have our \u201cFirst Communion\u201d during those earlier years and to believe in the Catholic teachings especially \u201cThe Ten Commandments.\u201d A lof of what the bible preached gave the impression that those that don\u2019t honor the \u201cTen Commandments\u201d will surely die and go to hell. So as a child and didn\u2019t think I wasn\u2019t so obedient that I dreamed of hell a lot. ",

This is the second death.\" Romans 10:9 \u201cIf you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\u201d John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes on Him should not perish but have eternal life. Acts 6:31 \"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved\" ",
