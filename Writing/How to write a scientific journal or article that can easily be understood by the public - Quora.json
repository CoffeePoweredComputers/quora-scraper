            "answer_text": "What you\u2019re asking is the essence of Technical Writing; specifcially, to ensure that your audience understands concepts that may not be generally accessible by the layperson. The key to successful Technical Writing (or writing of any kind, really), is knowing who you\u2019re writing for, and then presenting the information in an accessible way to that audience. Will the information be read by someone who is well-versed in the basics or will this be brand new?What is the general education level and/or language aptitude of the audience?How much time will they likely be spending on reviewing the material?Will they be reading because they want to or is it required for school or work?Once you have these in hand, you\u2019ll have a good idea of what you need to present and in what order. Using plain language* is key when presenting technical ideas to less-technical people. Avoid industry jargon or acronyms unless you explain them up front. If you are the subject matter expert who is writing the article, have someone outside of your industry review the content and provide feedback on its readability. From there you can hone the language and/or accessibility to clarify any missteps. *What is Plain Language? ",
