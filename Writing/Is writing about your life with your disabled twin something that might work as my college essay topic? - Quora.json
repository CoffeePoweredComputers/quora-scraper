            "answer_text": "It gives you a unique perspective that could make a fine essay. One of my students told the story of how she was her brother\u2019s caretaker after school. She told of trying to teach her brother a small tune on the piano that she might have learned in a couple of hours and it took him the better part of two months to get right. The tune was something special for their mother because of how hard she worked to support both of them. It was a simple, yet very powerful essay and allowed the young lady to show how much she had to give up without appearing to be whiny about it. If you can tell a story, some small aspect of your experience, it can be very moving, very insightful and go a long way in telling the story of you. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure, that can be a fine topic. It would depend on what your point would be. Did growing up with your disabled twin make you more compassionate? Did your twin inspire you with his efforts to conquer his disability? Do you want to share what it\u2019s like to be fully abled when your other self is not? Or perhaps to just share what it\u2019s like to be a twin or the humorous or special moments of growing up? All of those would be fine. Writing \u201cI have a disabled twin, so I deserve to be in your college\u201d won\u2019t go over well, though. ",

You have to tread carefully a very fine line, perhaps a little subtle humor and at the same time with a level of seriousness the subject demands. If you want to take the plunge, my other advice is: write it, revise it a few days later, revise it again the third time, fourth time, read it aloud to yourself; read it aloud to your critics. Get their input. ",

If you can approach your topic in a way that shows sensitivity without becoming mawkish, the result could well be an impressive and \u201cdifferent\u201d essay. Reality always adds an extra dimension to a piece of writing. I\u2019d say do it; definitely do it, and let the topic speak for itself. ",
