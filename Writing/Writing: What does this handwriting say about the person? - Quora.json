            "answer_text": "CLAIMER: I am a director of a company whose business is biometric graphology (handwriting analysis for personality) worldwide. This answer provides a report from that company. If that disturbs you, please don't read on. Biometric graphology is an artful science that translates \"brain writing\" into indicators of individual traits of behavior. It requires the most sensitive and most skilled psychological insights and a high level of judgement in evaluations of handwriting that balance and counter-balance weak, neutral, and strong traits.  Our company usually charges money for an enhanced analysis, but in honor of National Handwriting Day we offer this example of what you may truly learn from an anonymous handwriting sample.  We have no idea who wrote the notes in the picture, or when.  But we can, with considerable confidence, capture a picture of his or her personality, a picture not tainted or tinted by skin color, national origin, gender, personal fashion, handedness, eye color, aroma, beauty or weirdness.  Handwriting quite marvelously, reveals none of those things. It is among the most pure and indiscriminate glimpses into the human psyche yet uncovered, and the ability to see accurately and understand what the possible personality connections are, is the result of much research and study. (Our data base contains the handwriting samples of more than 130,000 medical doctors worldwide.) On National Handwriting Day it is a pleasure to salute and honor the biometric graphologists worldwide who have pioneered for almost five centuries a way of distinguishing more precisely and usefully who is behind the mask behind the curtain.  Herewith is what expert graphologists at scanmyhandwriting see when they look at the submitted script.

Sheila Kurtz, MGA, CGA www.graphologyconsulting.com (212) 799-9296  COMMUNICATION  Poise and self-respect are evident in your handwriting. You comport yourself with balance, freedom from affectation and with good composure.  There are signs in your handwriting of steadfastness in your allegiance to ideals and to persons and institutions you believe in. It is wise for you to periodically re-examine your allegiances to be sure you are not blinded or misled by binding memories of a status quo that may no longer be real.  You can be direct and straight-forward in your communications and are able to come right to the point in a conversation. You are also concise in getting across to your listeners. Your approach will be free from extraneous details that can slow you down.  You may impress others as a stimulating, thought-provoking partner in conversation. If you are working, your approach to work will be uncomplicated.  You like to have the last word. You may demand, manipulate, and contend to get it. You are also capable of defending your point of view by marshaling \"facts\" rather than fancies.  You think and act in accord with your own beliefs regardless of the influence or persuasions of others. You are independent and make up your own mind. This trait is shown by the short t and d stems in your script. Your associates may consider you strong-willed. It would be a good thing for you to consider the needs of others in your dealings with them, although you should not compromise your own closely held principles.  You are sincere and forthright in your communications. There is not much that can cloud your thinking. People tend to respect your word because you say what you mean and mean what you say.  STRESS LEVEL  Your handwriting indicates varied responses to stress. Under certain situations you show resistance to stress and at other times stress will have a greater impact on you and its effects will last longer. You tend mostly to be balanced in stressful situations. Routine and recreational exercise will be a saving grace in your life.  THINKING PATTERNS  You have strong intuitive ability. You cannot always justify your conclusions, yet they are often on the mark as any \"thought out\" and \u201cconnect-all-the-dots\u201d conclusions may be. Your intuitive abilities speed up your thinking process. Experience will indicate how far to trust this \"gut\" ability and the insights it may provide to you about new people and situations.  The rounded arch formation of your m's and n's indicate your methodical, logical thinking. You build fact upon fact and then draw your conclusions. You ought not be rushed in the process. You build fact upon fact and then draw your conclusions. You ought not be rushed in the process. You may have difficulty in dealing with deadlines especially where you do not have enough time to follow your natural inclination to research and test every aspect of a situation.  The wedge formations in your m's and n's are a strong indication of your investigative thinking process. You enjoy searching for answers and are resourceful in gathering your own information. In handwriting, the larger wedge formations show a proportionately greater capacity to explore and investigate a situation. This ability will help you get to the root of a problem and make decisions based on the facts you uncover.  IMAGINATION  The pronounced lower loops in your writing indicate a vivid, active imagination. You have the ability to come up with original, innovative ideas. You are probably happiest when you can work in a creative way and you will likely achieve rather spectacular results if you can deal with the practical side of bringing your ideas to up to actuality. If you are not adept at the dirty details of creative ideas, you may succeed better by foraging a bond with people who excel at such matters.  GOALS  The placement of the t bars in your writing indicates ambitious goals. If the t bars are firm and strong it indicates that the inner drive is available to stretch for and to reach the goals set.  ACHIEVEMENT You are an organized person. You can plan a course of action, arrange the details in order of importance and pull the necessary materials together to perform the tasks. Your sense of organization makes it easier for you to ask others for help when you need it and to see a project through to the end.  Change and variety work well for you. You are happiest when your daily routine is filled with multiple tasks or events. In order to avoid becoming scattered, take one project at a time and finish it. Ordinary routine can quickly fatigue and bore you. In any work situation your tasks ought to be as dissimilar as possible. You enjoy travel for the change it brings to your life, as well as the new people you meet along the way.  The placement of i dots indicate you can work reasonably well with details without significant impatience or irritability. This trait contributes to your durable memory.  You have the valuable ability to concentrate your attention on one matter at a time. This trait intensifies every other trait in your personality. Concentration is indicated by the quite small writing in the sample. Amidst the tumult, you are able to block out distraction and sharpen your focus.  You are receptive to new ideas and broad-minded in your view of humanity, some of which a less open person may find distasteful. This trait will help you think in positive ways because it can free you from traditional constraints. Bigotry and egotism are not a part of your character and most people will see you as an interesting companion and a sympathetic friend.  There are indications in your script of manual dexterity. These present themselves in certain rounded m's and n's, or the flat-topped r. You have an aptitude for such pursuits as carpentry, surgery, sleight-of-hand, sculpture, massage, etcetera.  You have the ability to express yourself well in prose and poetry. There may also be forms in your handwriting called Greek e's (like a backward 3) and delta d's (the stem curves to the left). These indicate a predilection for literature and the classics.  EMOTIONAL STRUCTURE  The straight up and down slant of your letters indicate that you tend to be objective, composed and typically to think before you act. You are not easily swayed by your emotions and impulsiveness is not a significant part of your makeup.   ",

They have a particular pattern, when they are writing words like 't','i'.   They have particular confidence in that letters. When you are writing an examination, you make sure your letters are legible and you can't find that confident strokes in students writing. But the zillionaire who spend writing checks have a particular pattern when they write a letter to their loved ones or their partners.  This is Bruce Lee's. The fact is he achieved all the things, which he has mentioned in his Chief aim note.  They actually don't define personality, but they often define a lot about a particular person.
