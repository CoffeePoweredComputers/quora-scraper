            "answer_text": "Sensationalist headlines are shouting for clicks. The more people click on them, the more incentive they have to keep doing it. These stories are usually underwhelming, as they oversell what they have to say. The best way to treat them is simple: don\u2019t read them. If you read them, you gave them one more unit of what they want, clicks. If you share them, even if you do it to denounce their absurd, you\u2019ll give them some of your friends\u2019 clicks. So, don\u2019t click. Don\u2019t share. Don\u2019t play the game. They will only waste your time. And you\u2019ll be giving them exactly what they want. ",
