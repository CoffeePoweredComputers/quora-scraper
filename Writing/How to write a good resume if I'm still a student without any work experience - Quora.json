            "answer_text": "You have pages of job experience; you just aren't thinking of it in that way. Instead of job experience use the term experience doing a job, and you will see lots of experience appear. Whenever you helped clean anything, you were gaining such experence. When ever you watched a younger person, cared for a pet, visited your grandparents, or did anything at your church, you were gaining experience at a job. Did you ever volunteer to do anything? Help at the snack bar, or be a runner at a debate contest, or visit school on a vacation day to help a teacher? Ever helped your dad do household repairs or work on the car? All of these things are experience doing a job \u2014 job experience. Every year we had to remind students that when reporting service for Honor Society, chores around the house and any help they gave to others were, indeed, service \u2014 job experiences. Don't sell yourself short. Are you a scout? Ever set up camp \u2014 experience. Band? Ever help set up a trip or the band room? Experience. Ever help cleanup after a dance or decorate for an activity? Job experience. Ever done any stage craft \u2014 helped run lights or paint backdrops or care for costumes? Job experience. Ever help collect for a charity? Job experience. Here's a big one. Ever been a TA, a teacher's aide? Ever help tutor your brothers or sisters or friends? That is teaching experience. Ever helped out at a civic event? A city parade or a fireworks show or a concert? Ushered there or passed out programs or helped set up or take down chairs? Job experience. Sit down and think back. You must have given help thousands of times during your life. All of these times are job experiences. ",

What have you done that shows that attribute? If you cannot give much then use words like interested or like. Compare \u201cI am good at math\u201d with \u201cI really like math\u201d. A potential employer usually reacts well to someone who is interested in a work topic, and likes the kind of things you will have to do.Get the experience you can use to develop and demonstrate the attributes. Become a committee member of a student society - best of all, an officer at some point. Stand as class rep. Volunteer for charity: part-time in a charity shop, or collecting; help out in an old people\u2019s home, or soup kitchen. Organize a sports event. Get a group of students to do something interesting. Think about how you can use the experience. Did you work with people? Sometimes difficult ones? Were you trusted with money or some important organizational task? Did you have any actual responsibility? What did you learn? \u201cThis helped me to understand\u2026\u201d Did you deal with any difficult situations? (You can even learn from failures.)",

They are hiring someone right out of college to do something that doesn\u2019t require experience. Ignore the 2+ years experience requirement for entry level jobs. Apply anyway. What you should focus on is extra-curricular activity, networking, skills that match the job description. Also, a good cover letter and objective statement that matches the job description is a must for anyone right out of college applying to jobs for which there is any degree of competition. Connect with the people that you might be working with on Linkedin. Let them know you are interested in this position that was just posted and ask if they know anyone you can speak with. Larger company\u2019s HR departments don\u2019t like to be worked around, but let\u2019s face it, if you are competing with people that are just like you for a job then you need to find some advantage.
