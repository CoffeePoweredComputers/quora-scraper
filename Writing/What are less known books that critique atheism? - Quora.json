            "answer_text": "E. F. Schumacher - Wikipedia, author of the better-known Small Is Beautiful - Wikipedia, a study of people and the economic system, wrote a very heady treatise on his conversion from atheism to Christianity. A Guide for the Perplexed - Wikipedia is a critique of the scientism that dominates many atheist rejections of monotheistic faiths. In his view, it is arrogance for humans to believe that our ability to see, even with technology, all things as they are. Additionally Mr. Schumacher asserts that without the wisdom of the ages atheism devolves inevitably into moral relativism. I assert that both of these main premises are true \u2014 man cannot see all, and moral relativism drives much of the \u2018progressive\u2019 movement today. Schumacher\u2019s ultimate conclusion is that it\u2019s more logical to believe in the existence of God than it is to deny His existence. ",
