            "answer_text": "Not worth the hype. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really enjoyed watching season 2 but the problem was I had huge expectation from that after watching the season 1 so felt a little upset after finishing season 2. Anyways coming to the review \u2026. The first problem which I think was were some unnecessary scene that really didn\u2019t fit in. Like for example the scene of shooting a movie on gaitonde\u2019s life\u2026\u2026 I really felt it like a childish and cringeworthy scene. Secondly, I felt the major drawback of the whole series was that it never showed Gaitonde as a really influential or powerful personality \u2026\u2026he was more like a local goon rather than a kingpin which he was meant to be. Like if I compare him to Faisal Khan obviously we shouldn\u2019t have, but still Faisal competed in election \u2026\u2026he had proper bodyguards with him \u2026.like Gaitonde even falls shorter than Faisal khan \u2026what can i sayman\u2026 Thirdly, problem was that it was hell lot confusing \u2026. I mean I don\u2019t know if it was because of change in writer of the story or something else \u2026like season 1 was really straightforward something happen and rest of the events were just consequence of that former event \u2026\u2026but this time there was an added sense of unpredictability which made it hell lot confusing \u2026at times I even felt there was some kind of discontinuity in personality of some characters. Fourthly I also felt some scenes were long drawn I mean the interrogation scenes were really drawn long enough so much so that some us really were skipping those parts. Fifth and worst of all was the final twist\u2026. I mean I don\u2019t get this final twist these days \u2026i mean it just ruins everything and in most of the case this twist doesn\u2019t have correlation whatsoever with the main storyline\u2026.Game of throne made Bran the king and ruined pretty much everything\u2026.similarly here also Jojo\u2019s final confession ruined it for me\u2026.I mean there is just so much wrong to that like how did they manage to kill Gaitonde\u2019s lover at that same time when Isa was attacking without even communicating with Isa it just doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026. I mean I can go on and on about the sixth point like if it was such a big plan as if they were planning it for like 25 years before the main event\u2026 Anyways I didn\u2019t mention anything good in my answer as most of the other answers did really a good job doing that\u2026so please read those. About the rating from my side it will be Story -6/10 Acting 9.5/10 Thank you ",

            "answer_text": "Spoiler-free (Obviously) THE BACKGROUND Sacred Games was not just another Netflix series.  It was the first one with a native touch, needless to say, it was praised by the audiences for its uncensored and raw style of storytelling. The memes and discussions it spurred after it's release were definitely a part of every social media. Season 1 left us with a cliffhanger of what would be the fate of Bombay. The threat of nuclear catastrophe was hinted as we saw a Geiger counter lying beside a dying Trivedi whose survival was the main agenda of Gaitonde\u2019s monologues. With high expectations, I clicked off the first episode of Season 2. Much like Gaitonde who was stuck on a boat and had no clue, we had no clue of what to expect either\u2026 Just like season 1 and any other TV series I have ever watched, I binge-watched this one as well. There are a few series which live up to the fans expectation and surpass the previous season in terms of excellence. Sacred Games season 2 isn\u2019t one of them. Before analyzing it critically let\u2019s see what was good about it.  THE WHIPHANDS The acting. Oh Boy, are you kidding me? When you have Pankaj Tripathi and Nawazuddin Siddiqui it is obvious that stellar performances would be delivered. Nawaz was at his best. He is the only part of the series that keeps getting better as the series progresses. I liked the dialogues. The one-liners were quirky and well placed. There was never a moment when they appeared to be forced.Although you do feel the void created by the absence of Katekar, the new characters did their job well. The soundtrack was great. Always loved the opening theme!Bunty was lively as ever. I wanted to see more of him but he was given considerably lesser screen time.The dots were connected well and I liked a revelation which was poetically shocking towards the end of the series.It is always a great idea to keep an open ending and let the audience ponder and discuss over it even after they complete the series. THE STUMBLING BLOCKS A lot of sections in the story felt illogical something which generally doesn\u2019t occur in an Anurag Kashyap movie. I have been an avid fan of his realistic approach to storytelling. The series diverted and turned into a masala Bollywood movie on several occasions. That\u2019s the reason why I was left a bit disappointed. This wasn\u2019t the Sacred Games we had loved. This is why season 1 will always be considered better.The film had unnecessary sections without which the story could have progressed as well. (the ashram parts, behold the memes!) Those are some of the most cringe-worthy scenes I have ever seen.An unnecessary and biased jibe was taken on religion again\u2026Seems like Kashyap keeps letting his creativity get adulterated by his religious vendettas.Although the series was slow-paced initially, it seemed rushed at parts where they could have taken things slow.Illogical sections like a masala Bollywood movie. Oh wait, Am I mentioning it again? Yes, because it buggered me a lot coming from Kashyap. FINAL VERDICT They couldn\u2019t live up to the hype of season 1 and neither could they deliver a satisfying saga. The series could have been better if they edited out certain scenes and worked on the plotholes which generally showed Sartaj Singh as a superhuman who could do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted and never face repercussions of his action. Unlike many other fans who are awaiting another season of this series, I would be more than happy if this series ended right here. You don\u2019t need confirmation of what happened in the end. Why not just discuss and develop fan theories! They will have to go beyond the source material to create an additional season and you know what happens when you don\u2019t stick to the novel! *Cough* Game *cough* of Thrones The minimal damage that has been done will grow if they try harder. If you have scrolled down due to the length of the post then here\u2019s a short review for you, this is it! I watch Sacred games just for Nawazuddin. That guy acts in a state of trance. As if he is not self aware, and gives the control of his expression and body to someone divine. Other than that there is no coherence of story or logic in the show\u2014 Gabbbar (@GabbbarSingh) August 16, 2019\n Finally, like every professional reviewer which I am not, I would nevertheless rate it 7/10. PS: Enjoy the aftermath of the series, not the suspense of the open ending but the memes! \u201cArigatou\u201d ",
