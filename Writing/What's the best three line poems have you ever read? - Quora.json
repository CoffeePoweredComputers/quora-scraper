            "answer_text": "Usually I write with 8 syllables then 6 then 8 then 6 as for hymn verses, so I'm not accustomed to any 3 line poems that rhyme or don't rhyme, but the haiku poetry doesn't fascinate me at all. To me, poetry is an exercise in sharing, so 3 lines for poetry would seem to sabotage that. The only version that would make sense would be to split up what is called the 1 liner joke into 3 lines as poets often do with phrases. Even if creating a rhyming version, I still wouldn't feel as if I had achieved anything worth the effort or the reading. Even so, it is difficult to answer any QUORA question if it's phrased, What's the best.... As if any of us had God-like powers to know every single poem or poem style or story and could remember it word for word, punctuate it and present it here. I'm wondering if the 5 line limerick could be simply adapted as a 3 line presentation instead, so as to create a workaround... Funny Limericks A limerick is a five-line witty poem with a distinctive rhythm. The first, second and fifth lines, the longer lines, rhyme. The third and fourth shorter lines rhyme. (AABBA)  This five line poem also follows a syllable count.  Line 1: 7-10 syllables  Line 2: 7-10 syllables  Line 3: 5-7 syllables  Line 4: 5-7 syllables  Line 5: 7-10 syllables So adapt to 3 lines:  Line 1: 7-10 syllables plus 7-10 syllables  Line 2: 5-7 syllables plus 5-7 syllables  Line 3: 7-10 syllables  There's a girl called Megan Yu, asking questions to a few, When 3 replied, she sighed and sighed, For only 1 of these was true! ::::: Though possible as a variation style, it doesn't really satisfy us. I wrote this short piece of poetry and compress it now to just 3 lines as an example, though usually, I'd limit the line length to a maximum of 70 character spaces for websites like poemhunter-dot-com to help its layout. Love Is Like Sand...   Love is like sand, keep it in the palm of your hand and it blows away,  yet if you make a fist, it slips through your fingers, so cement it with tenderness,  water it with affection and build a house that will stand, for love is like sand...

            "answer_text": "Unless one counts every tercet of Dante's terza rima in The Divine Comedy (in the original!) as a discrete three-line poem-- which isn't really possible or justifiable, but which would mean that Dante wins over and over again, with a few great but lesser competitors using his rhyme scheme, such as Shelley in The Triumph of Life, giving him some earnest competition -- the best three-line poems I know are haiku. So I'd look to Bash\u014d and the like. In the West, Ezra Pound gave us this remarkable three-line poem, too. The title is also the first line. The influence of Dante is strong, too (the simile of the damned souls as leaves, itself borrowed from Vergil, is transmuted into a more apposite and haiku-like form to describe the modern Styx of the subway): IN A STATION OF THE METRO The apparition of these faces in the crowd Petals on a wet, black bough I have spent whole classes discussing these three lines. They are an instance of what is called \"imagism.\"  ",
