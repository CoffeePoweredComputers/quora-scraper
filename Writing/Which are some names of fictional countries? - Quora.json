            "answer_text": "Hmmm, that is actually a hard question because fictional country names come in multiple varieties. It\u2019s our world, but we have created a country with certain characteristics but drawn from various aspects of some real country.It\u2019s fantasy or sf, and as such the countries invented can be damned near anything.I usually prefer #1, and would choose \u201cRuritania.\u201d The name was invented by Anthony Hope for his books The Heart of Princess Osra and The Prisoner of Zenda, but it has since become a useful general term.

            "answer_text": "There are so many to choose from! From my own series The Masks of Llyra, I pick Wiriath (ancestral home of Shapers) and Cymmril (home of the Sisters of Xelos). While not a country (actually a part of the country of Torba), the island of Llyranar, home of the Sisters of Llyra is also a favorite. In fantasy and science fiction, I favor Le Guin\u2019s Orsinia and Atuan, Tolkien\u2019s Eriador, Asimov\u2019s Trantor and Aurora, Lem\u2019s Solaris, and Doctor Who\u2019s Gallifrey. From Marvel comics, Latveria (ruled by Dr Doom) has always had the resonance of a real Baltic nation. In DC comics, Markovia has similar verisimilitude in name. And two classics, although not countries per se: William Faulkner\u2019s Yoknapatawpha County, MS and Lewis Carroll\u2019s Wonderland. ",
