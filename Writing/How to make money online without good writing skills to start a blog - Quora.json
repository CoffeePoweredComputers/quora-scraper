Also, I\u2019ll show you 10 ways that I do not recommend for making money online. You don\u2019t need to buy any courses, or have any specific skills to get started. Additionally, you don't need to sell anyone anything! With that said, I\u2019ll list the categories below, then I\u2019ll attach a video to explain the categories broken down into 10 specific websites. Categories Print On-Demand: Creating simple, catchy, funny, or even text only, designs that are uploaded to websites that offer that design to be printed on clothing items and accessories. You create the designs (with design apps) and upload them to the big print on-demand websites, then they create virtual listings of your \u2018products\u2019, and market them for you. Then when someone order an item, the website prints the item with the design on it, ships it to the customer, and handles all customer service. They take a split of the profit, and you get the rest. Affiliate Marketing: Creating reviews, comparisons, articles, about products or services, then linking the reader/viewer to the product where they can purchase it, and the company who sells the product will give you a commission for referring the person. Information Products: Creating online courses, or ebooks, to share your knowledge on a specific topic, and selling it digitally around the world. You only have to create the online course, or ebook, one time and you can sell it time-and-time again digitally. Rather than writing a novel for you, here\u2019s a video to explain 10 best websites you can use to start making money online, without spending money.  Additionally, here\u2019s a similar video with the 10 ways that I do not recommend for making money online:  ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to perfect or to gain writing skills is by pretending you are talking to your friend, thinking that you are telling a story to a friend makes you relax and also your mind will get creative and before you know it, you have an article ready to post on your blog. With blogs or websites it really boils down to great content, traffic, and then you can make money by either monetizing by Google AdSense or Affiliate marketing or selling your own stuff. Another thing to keep in mind is that you should start a blog that is within a topic that you are passionate about, that way, you will always find new ideas to write about. And finally, when it comes to grammar, you can use a tool like Grammarly, which is very helpful with grammar and its free to use. ",
