            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Sean. You have to have your nonprofit in place before you write a grant for funding. You will have to incorporate as a nonprofit and get a 501c3 designation from the IRS. Then you can write grants for that nonprofit. You will need to look through available grants to see what is being offered. You should not try to make your nonprofit \u2018fit\u2019 a grant, the grant should fit the work you are already doing or planning to do. Here\u2019s more information from one of my other answers. There is a link in that answer to another answer I wrote as well. Judith Sharp's answer to How do I get a govt grant? ",

Then it\u2019s a good idea to take a class or workshop on how to research grants - your local library can help you find the nearest class, or use Google to search such using your city\u2019s name. ",
