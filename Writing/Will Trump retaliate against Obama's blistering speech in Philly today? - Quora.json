            "answer_text": "Obama gave that rockin' speech today in Philly (pop 1.5 million) after Trump spoke last night in Erie, PA (pop. 100k). That's called \u201cspitting in Trump's soup\u201d. It very well may have been a calculated psy-ops attack to cripple Trump's ability to debate tomorrow. Trump hates Barack Obama. 22 Oct. edit: AFTER OBAMA'S SPEECH, TRUMP'S STAFF TOOK THE OLD KOOK'S PHONE AWAY FROM HIM TO STOP HIM FROM TWEETING! And Obama\u2019s attack was ferocious. He made fun of Trump's Chinese bank account. He hit Trump's $750 tax payments, the Russian bounties scandal, and Trump's four year long government by Harebrained Stunt du jour. \u201cTrump's reality show ratings are down, and he hates that\u201d, Obama said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself .. .. [Trump is] incapable of taking the job seriously, \u201c Obama said. \u201cObama slammed Trump\u2019s cabinet as hacks and lobbyists. The Environmental Protection Agency that is supposed to protect air and water run by energy lobbyist, the Labor Department is run by corporate lobbyist gutting protections for workers, the Interior Department is run by an oil lobbyist determined to sell to the highest bidder and the Education Department is run by a billionaire who guts rules protecting students from for-profit colleges, Obama said.\u201d Obama says Trump couldn't 'protect himself' from COVID, has failed to protect the nation Trump already has his hands full tonight: obsessing about the Sixty Minutes fiasco (most campaigns would have buried that - not Hurt Feelings Trump),the Third Debate tomorrow (Trump claims he has scheduled \u201ctwo one hour\u201d debate prep sessions),today's bizarre \u201cProud Boys\u201d e-mail fiasco (something new to overload King Ding Dong's limited bandwidth.)So far, Trump's tweets have been temperate, and likely drafted by his staff. Perhaps tomorrow will reveal a fevered ALL CAPS stream of Trump's angry and insulting tweets. But the real effect of Obama's Trump roast may well pop up in Trump's debate performance tomorrow night. Trump's campaign staff has been promoting the image of a \u201creformed Trump\u201d we shall see on 10/22 - not an Angry Old Blowhard but a \u201cvisionary\u201d and \u201cHappy Bully\u201d America knows and loves so well. Now, what are the chances of that happening? The White House has leaked that Trump skipped all debate prep sessions. In these last weeks, Trump has shown an amusing tendency to spontaneously start \u201ccampaigning against whomever pisses him off\u201d: Leslie Stahl, Hunter Biden, AG Barr, Hillary (still!), Dr. Fauci, FBI Director Wray. It will be interesting to watch to see if Trump forgets he is debating Biden and flys off on a spiteful -rally style - tangent impugning Obama at the Third debate. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Of course not. Trump can\u2019t retaliate. He has no ammunition. Stupid, empty, meaningless spittle-spewing invective, even if repeated ad nauseum just no longer do it. Too expected. Too obvious. Too tiresome. \u201cImpeached. Infected. Incompetent.\u201d Those words were coined by PA State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta. Don\u2019t tell him. I stole them for your benefit. Tonight\u2019s so-called \u201cdebate\u201d will avail Trump nothing. He can call himself \u201cthe winner\u201d; Fox can proclaim his glory. But the cake is baked. No matter what Trump says from now on, during tonight\u2019s final debate until his last day, his words have no more meaning nor impact on me or my fellow travelers. We have done with him. We have turned our backs. Oh, I\u2019ll watch the debate tonight, for the shits & giggles, as I expect another car crash, Indy-sized, Trump\u2019s #2 car lit aflame, the driver still inside, not knowing which way out. Tomorrow, when Trump tries to repair his crushed and burned car, all of his horses and all of his men won\u2019t be able to do it. His race will have been over. He\u2019ll have lost. He\u2019ll be branded a Loser. And he should just get used to it. ",
