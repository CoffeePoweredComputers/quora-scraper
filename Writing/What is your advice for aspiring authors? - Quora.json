If you can\u2019t find time to write every day, try to get two-hour chunks several times a week and during those times, do not allow people to impinge on it. Go ahead and be an asshole. During your writing time, write! disable your internet, turn off your phone. Don\u2019t do reference reading. If there\u2019s something you need to find out, write it down and look it up later. If you\u2019re wondering how well something you wrote might read, read it aloud. That will tell you plenty. But when you write, WRITE! Do not rewrite, do not revise. Do that later. Your time is precious. This point is really important. I just wish I was better at following it. Keep writing and do not get discouraged. This is a long-haul proposition. The learning curve is very long and very hard. Most wanna-be writers never get far enough up it to ever be any good. It takes a very long time. Also, try not to talk about your writing. People mostly don\u2019t want to hear about it, and those that do should probably be avoided. ",

Some writers (plotters) need them, some (pantsers) don\u2019t. Find your own path. Don\u2019t publish your first completed book, keep writing. Go back to that first book to write the second draft. You\u2019ll both impress yourself with those moments of brilliance and find all those little mistakes.Write what moves you, write what makes your heart sing, write people - not characters - that you love, that you hate. It will show in your writing. Find your joy in telling the story of those people, those friends\u2026 ",
