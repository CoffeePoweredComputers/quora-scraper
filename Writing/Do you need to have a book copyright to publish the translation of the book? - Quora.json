            "answer_text": "The exact thing you need is to license the copyright to publish the version for the language you intend. The question is, who has the copyright for this? Foreign-language rights start with the copyright owner (typically, the author), but these are often included in the book contract with the publisher. At that point, the publisher has the copyrights for foreign-language versions. These copyrights can then be licensed to people, like yourself, to translate and publish in other languages. Since there\u2019s no public record you can look up about this, your best path is to contact the current publisher of the book. Ask if they have the right to publish in the language you intend. If they do, ask about their process for licensing that right. If the publisher did not license this right from the author, then ask if the publisher will connect you with the author to pursue it with her/him. Be aware, however, that if you have no experience in publishing this can all get very tricky. You need to understand what you\u2019re getting into legally, as this would be a proper contract. On top of that, you need to understand the business of publishing so that you can pursue this smartly and ultimately to reach your goals. If you have neither of these \u2014 let\u2019s say you just have a strong interest in translating this book into a new language \u2014 then I\u2019d first propose your idea to the existing publisher. Convey (1) your interest in this project, (2) your qualifications to translate the book, and (3) why you think this book would be successful in the translated language. To this last point, show any market research you can to demonstrate the realistic sales potential and why. It\u2019s also possible the publisher already has a foreign-rights partner it works with, which may preclude a contract with you (or would need to involve that partner). If the publisher is interested in your proposal, you could end up with a simple \u201cwork for hire\u201d agreement in which you would be paid a guaranteed fee to translate the book. This is far simpler and less risky than attempting to be the publisher of this book in the new language. However, being the publisher offers greater potential if there\u2019s a strong market for the book. You\u2019ll have to decide which path is best based on your interest, skills, and resources. But first things first\u2026 determine who holds the copyright for the language you want to publish in. And then go from there. Thanks for the A2A!
