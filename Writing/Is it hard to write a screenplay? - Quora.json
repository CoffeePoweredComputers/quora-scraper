            "answer_text": "If you are truly serious, it is very hard work. It requires patience, attention to detail, technical know-how relative to the conventions of screenplay construction, the ability to balance talk and action, the ability to have scenery, movement, and editing do the talking for the screenwriter. Among the other skills needed, the ability to write convincing dialog is inadequately stressed, and many films and TV shows suffer from stilted dialog that sounds more like a formal speech than two or three people conversing informally. I would urge anyone thinking of writing a screenplay who has any hopes of making money from it first take a good, hard look at the realities of that business, and recognize that the barriers to entry are formidable\u2014-even for those who live in Los Angeles and have been involved for many years in the film business as technicians, minor actors, second-unit directors and related capacities. It is said with only partial sarcasm that the cab driver who picks you up at the airport, the bellboy at your hotel, the waiter who brings you dinner all have one thing in common\u2014-THEY are writing or have written screenplays themselves! While the notion that in the U.S., anyone with enough ambition can be anything he or she wants, it is far more realistic to develop a personal success plan which, when followed by others, has brought favorable results. The very low ratio of Presidential aspirants to Presidents-elect is a microcosm of the entire structure of business in the world today. ",

            "answer_text": "Some compare it to pulling out your teeth with your own hands: slow, painful and miserable process. Citing Simon Kinberg \u201cthere\u2019s nothing scarier than that blinking cursor on the empty page\u201d. Writing is relatively easy process, but it takes a lot of work without reward in sight. If you start write out of the passion, how much do you think it will last for? Three pages? Five pages? Seven pages? Cold determination is writer\u2019s best friend. Cause you will find it often frustrating experience: you perfectly know how you want to tell some scene, you writing it and with each word your \u201cinspiration fuel\u201d runs out. All of a sudden you find yourself at the edge of the literary cliff - you went all the way there, but have no idea, what should be after. Some people call it writer\u2019s block. I just call it lack of the fuel, which is replenished with research and switching to other activities, which help you to give a break to that tiny part of brain, which already boiling from tension of trying to solve that problem. Cold determination helps you to go back to the ink and paper (your computer for that purpose) and keep going. Cause this, as any other skill, requires work. And like with the muscle - your first runs, would be short, sloppy and hard. But every time you practice, they will be longer and more productive. And more exciting. and joyful, when you\u2019ll eventually notice, that you like the story you wrote. And, since the best writing is never done from the first time, you start to rewrite. You point out weak spots, decisions, scenes. You rewriting them, until the story becomes coherent. When, finally, this is done, you can call yourself a writer rightfully.  P.S. How to recognize strong, coherent story (screenplay)? By analyzing your feelings after you read it. Do you have any feelings or it just passed by you? Were you felt compassion, fear, love, joy, anger, sadness for the character(s)? Did you liked them enough to wish for them to reach their goals (or on contrary, have you disliked them enough to wish them opposite, if story requires that)? Best way to find out, what I\u2019m talking about is to read screenplays, written by others. Check reddit or any other source for available black list scripts. Read them. Some will provoke really strong emotions. That\u2019s what good screenplay is all about. ",
