            "answer_text": "The most intuitive answer is that \"middle C\" (or C4 in scientific pitch notation) is in the middle of the great staff. It's also on the middle line of the alto clef.  And of course, it's the C key below the middle of a full 88-key keyboard.  In response to the extended question, \"middle\" may also be interpreted to the mean the \"middle\" of the human hearing and singing range. Two octaves below middle C is \"low C\" which is the defining pitch of a bass voice. Two octaves above middle C is \"top C\" the defining note of the soprano voice. So middle C is halfway between those extremes of human voice types. As to why musicians most commonly refer to the letter C, that's because C is the starting note of the major scale which has no sharps or flats. The diatonic major (or \"ionian\") scale is largely the most common and popular scale in western music, and the C major scale is its most easily learned and referenced form. And as for why the major scale itself starts on C and not A, that is a more historical question. Basically the major scale was not the most popular scale as letter notation was being solidified. The scale that starts on A with no sharps or flats is the natural minor (or \"aeolian\") scale. ",

It\u2019s one ledger line above and below the bass and treble clefs respectively. I\u2019ve seen some other answers saying that Middle C falls directly in the middle of the piano, but this is actually false. The exact middle of the piano is somewhere around F4/F#4 (F and F# above middle C). ",
