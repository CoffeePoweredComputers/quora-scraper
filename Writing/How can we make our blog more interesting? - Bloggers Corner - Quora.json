            "answer_text": "Before starting any blog, you need to understand how it works and what it takes to become a successful blogger. The first step before you start a blog is to select the niche of the blog. You need to finalize a genre or a domain about which you will be writing and sharing your thoughts with your audience. This genre should be something that you are an expert in so that you can share your knowledge and insight about the same. Once you select the niche of your blog, you need to work on your design of the blog. The design is one of the most important aspects of your blog as that creates a very first impression. Only with an engaging and appealing design, the user will stick to the blog and try to navigate and read more about the posts in your blog. After the finalization of your design, you need to work on the content. Content is the king and that is true in every which way. If your content is not good, a user won\u2019t stick to your website and that will lead to a bad impression about your blog. So work on your content majorly. Try to build content consistently. Create a plan and stick to the plan to create content nicely for your audience. Besides that, try to offer different giveaways, freebies with your blog, so that the user engagement increases to a much higher extent. To build a better audience, make use of different social media networks, and work on the marketing of your blog. Once you have a sufficient audience, unique and great content with an appealing design, your blog tends to become very interesting.
