I do not believe a person can give informed consent to end their own life, until such time as it can be proven their life would otherwise never end, causing unbearable suffering for all eternity. Please share your note with me, and let me try and offer you a constructive criticism of your writing and the note itself. If you swear I won\u2019t help, then I cannot. ",
