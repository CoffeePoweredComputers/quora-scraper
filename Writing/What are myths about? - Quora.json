            "answer_text": "What are myths about? Although I don't go by either of the two names; please allow me to be frank and 'ernest'; when I say that I don't like to look at other people's answers. So, I like to give my own raw opinion upon what I believe is the answer to a question. In doing so; I take upon the mere fact in learning and teaching. Hence the phrase: 'To learn is once and to teach is twice.' I believe that myths, rarely exist. Mostly due to the technological advances in modern day society. What was once called word of mouth, is now called the internet. And what was once called papyrus(paper)is now called cd/dvd. Boohoo for the cassette tapes. I loved those things. Anyways, Ask yourself if you believe that anyone coulda come up with half-man, half-horse? How about a Minotaur? Or better yet? A Sirena(see 'deh-nah)? That's spanish for a Siren; e.g., a mermaid(like the one in that mexican bingo game called Loteria!). All of those Mythological creatures really existed at one time and to be honest; there are still some that are still out there. However, if you were a unicorn; would you want to make yourself known to the public? I'd say you'd be stuffed and mounted by hunter and the talk of the town for about 15 minutes; later consumed or turned into glue...and then a myth. But an actual existing creature; nonetheless. There was a time when this earth was in chaos and all hell was breaking loose and there were three creatures who were given life to roam the earth: Like the elements, friend...One made of clay: Man/Woman...One made of Light: Angels...and One made of fire/molten metal: Jinn/genie. You'll find the jinn/genie in the book of Ezekiel[Chap.1:13].(note: Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, is very helpful; if you don't have wi-fi or internet access. Most libraries have them. Good to own because this book has every word in the bible and where each particular word can be found[like Matrix: [Exodus13:12,15;34:19; Numbers3:12; 18:15]; nephilim(the first bullies and offspring of the fallen angels[Genesis6 4, 6]; Born Again[book of John Chap. 3]; second death[Revelation Chap.2\u201311]). Anyways, you'll notice that each creature in mythology takes a side of good and evil. And they're all related to God, the devil, angels, demons and saints and sinners(man). The stories of their travels are one thing, friend. Although, the principle they carried before their passions are the extract of passion and zeal for life itself. In short, Myths are passed down from generation to generation in the same fashion as life's lessons or better yet; morals and immorality/cause and effect/truth and consequence. Consider reading Aesop's Fables. Good book. Hope this helps. Ciao. ",

            "answer_text": "Myths are stories told to elucidate deeper truth and explain \u201cwhy\u201d. They are all around us. They can be based on real events, but not necessarily. People tell myths because myths are essentially relational, while facts are not. This is not to say facts are bad, just that they\u2019re often not satisfying to human creatures who are deeply emotional and dramatic. So we could read a strictly factual text about the long history of immigration to North America, including Native Americans and the land bridge, and early Vikings, and some speculation about Irish Monks and even Chinese explorers, and that would be interesting\u2026. BUT the story we tell ourselves is that Christopher Columbus discovered the New World in 1492 (\u201cColumbus sailed the ocean blue / In fourteen hundred ninety-two\u201d \u2014 it rhymes so it must be true). He came on three ships. They landed at Plymouth Rock. The pilgrims came out of the ships and immediately began working. They were very good friends with the Native Americans who welcomed them whole-heartedly and taught them all they knew. Then they had a big meal together which we now call the Thanksgiving Holiday. Of course that story blends two stories \u2014 Columbus and the Pilgrims, the latter arriving much later in 1620. But this is a myth. It\u2019s an origin story that we tell because it tells us about ourselves. We believe we\u2019re descended from explorers. The three ships remind us, consciously or unconsciously of the Trinity. We like the story of our descendants being Pilgrims searching for a better, more godly land, because that\u2019s what we like to believe America is. We love the idea that they were industrious. That they were nice to the Indians. That the Indians were so impressed with our descendants that they gave everything they had, including knowledge. We like the idea that they were so blessed with abundance \u2014 as we continue to be \u2014 that they took a huge break and feasted together, thanking God. But all of the above is the stuff of myths. It\u2019s a super-compelling story. But almost none of it happened as described. Myths are tools of identity, explaining deep reasons for why things are they way they are. Many would say that myths are among the highest things human beings can do. They mix together all of our faculties, involving facts, creativity, meaning, spirit, purpose, communication, and culture. The problem comes when people confuse myths with facts. The one is not an equal trade for the other. Modern society, and especially cultural sensitivity, require us to stand both inside and outside of our myths, enjoying them for what they are while recognizing what they are not. ",
