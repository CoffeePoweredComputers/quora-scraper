            "answer_text": "I loved the Harry Potter series for several things. The story line appealed to my childhood love of magic and folklore. J.K. Rowling inserted some subtle cultural references that delighted me - clever, small items one might miss if unaware, but enriched the stories for those who were aware. I suspect she did it to make the books appeal to the adults who might be reading the stories to their children. The world was richly developed and internally consistent, and the characters were well-developed, the result of the years of planning and improving that Rowling had spent before the books found a publisher. Those are the reasons I think they are such good books. But the bottom line is that they were whacking good stories, complex enough to read over and over while always finding a new gem one had overlooked before. ",

            "answer_text": "The quality of the Harry Potter series isn't found in the texts themselves, but in the phenomenon they created internationally. Having read The Philosopher's Stone recently, it isn't a particularly good book. The writing isn't great, the characters aren't well fleshed out, and the plot is pretty unexceptional (though the world building is top notch, I'll give it that). Overall, it's not very impressive. But to the children who read it when it was released and then when the films came out, it was a masterpiece. Everyone was reading this book, for the first time in God knows how long, reading was \u201ccool\u201d. Having a book in your hand made you part of the in crowd, rather than an outsider, and was an instant conversation starter. The book worked as a gateway to other works, introducing kids to the world of literature. It turned many children into voracious readers, who continue to read today, and for that reason I think that it is an amazing book. ",
