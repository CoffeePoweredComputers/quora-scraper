            "answer_text": "When people appear to take life for granted, they actually aren't taking life at all. They are allowing life to take them. A descriptive term for the opposite is existential awareness. Cognitive maturation and the accumulation of life experience make existential awareness a potential around the age of 12. The physical development of the brain is completed around the age of 21. During this period, the ability to form generalizations from discrete experiences and to apply general principles to concrete and specific situations form rapidly for some and more slowly for others. Unfortunately, this capacity to think both inductively and deductively remains underdeveloped for many. This developmental stream is a function of the interaction of genetic factors and environmental support factors. Within the constraints of genetics, each generation gets what we train--where training includes physical and social support. So what does existential awareness mean? I am aware of A, B, & C, in myself and of X, Y, & Z, in my environment, and \"I\" am the one who is aware. Itis the discovery and ownership of Self. ",
