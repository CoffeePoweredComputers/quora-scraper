            "answer_text": "\u201cGenius\u201d can be such a blurby, crappy way of describing a writer, maybe it\u2019s important first to work on defining the word. \u201cGenius,\u201d despite its problematic connotation of high IQ, is a religious word. A genius is an \u201cattendant spirit\u201d\u2014a soul\u2014an intuitive force that unites perceived attributes and appears to exist within them\u2014a historical affect that colors thought\u2014a personality and mind, with which our own mind communes. From this perspective, everyone has genius\u2014and everything. Rocks and trees have genius. It\u2019s wrong to call a person \u201ca genius.\u201d It\u2019s more correct to speak of a person\u2019s genius; to say a person or thing manifests genius or possesses genius or is possessed by a genius. This ancient connotation is a richer, better, more humane way of thinking about intelligence, sometimes lost on modern people obsessed with objective measures of intelligence, like calculating ability and pattern recognition. If their sense of intelligence is limited by objective measures, they ought to focus the obsession on computers, who, despite their unconsciousness, would be the greatest of genius savants. Even so, the genius of a computer lies outside its memory, processing speed, depth of its programming or degree of consciousness. These things are just the attributes of the computer\u2019s genius we happen to value to value most. A computer\u2019s genius is instead the sum of its parts, plus its location, plus its work, and then incalculably more than this sum. For this reason, a Lenovo and Dell, with the same specs, have different geniuses; as do two same model Dells, with identical specs. Genius is the idiosyncratic nature expressed by a physical system occupying a certain time and space. Writing talent is a language genius that encompasses and communicates other geniuses. It shows up not in people so much as in their works. I think Hemingway\u2019s books have a powerful literary genius. Reading his writing is like taking a gut punch from the past. I think other writers in his generation imbue books with genius even more affecting and influential than his. But you would have to read Hemingway yourself to make up your mind as to Hemingway\u2019s genius. And you wouldn\u2019t know much about his genius until his writing awakes and disturbs your own genius. ",

            "answer_text": "If by \u201cgenius\u201d you mean someone with a very high IQ, I will say no. There are a great many great writers who clearly would not fall into that category. On the other hand, if you mean did he have a genius for writing, in the sense of an immense talent, he probably did. It takes enormous skill to write with his apparent simplicity. Personally, I don\u2019t like Hemingway at all. I\u2019d borrow a line from his contemporary Gertrude Stein and say, like Oakland, in Hemingway\u2019s work there\u2019s no there there. But that is a personal judgment, and I much prefer his contemporary and nemesis Fitzgerald. ",
