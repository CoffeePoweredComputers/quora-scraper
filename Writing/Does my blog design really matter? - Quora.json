            "answer_text": "It depends. Is it a brand new site just getting started and not for an already existing business? And you don\u2019t have any audience that you\u2019re bringing with you? Then I argue that no, your design doesn\u2019t matter much yet, because no one is reading your content! I usually tell new creators to focus on creating content (and therefore getting it indexed by search engines\u2026 age of content is currently a big part of being seen as an authority). Once you\u2019ve got a good base of 20 or so articles that you\u2019re proud of, you can focus on getting your design exactly how you want it. At minimum, just make sure your design is mobile friendly and doesn\u2019t have any horrible, glaring errors (like almost-white text on a white background). Other than that, worry about how it looks once there are actually people looking at it! I explain more in #5 here. Good luck! ",

Think of any time you\u2019ve gone to a store and found messy, cluttered aisles, unhelpful staff, and long lines. You left, right? Or just felt really frustrated shopping there? It\u2019s the same with your blog. Your blog design matters. ",
