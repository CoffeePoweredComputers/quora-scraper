            "answer_text": "It is a combination of pen, paper and ink. If the paper is bad, whatever you try, it will bleed through. Robert is right, the finer the nib, the better. You may also consider various inks. Water based inks will bleed the most, while oily ones, the ones that sit on the paper will bleed the least. My favourite is Montblanc\u2019s permanent blue. Even with a guzzler like Montblanc 149 EF nib, it is good enough to write on the cheapest recycled paper, like the one they use on invoices. Edelstein in the same 149 will bleed through standard 80g paper, so bad that one has trouble reading due to the bleeding from the other side. Platinum\u2019s DP-800S EF nib, with Platinum\u2019s Carbon Black is going to bleed through only the worse paper. However with Montblanc\u2019s permanent blue, it will write on napkins with very little bleeding. To find the best ink, one could go and try inks with a Preppy. Try a 0.3mm or 0.2mm nib, the finest they make. It is a 5$ pen and it does not clog. Caveat emptor! Montblanc\u2019s permanent blue and black, as well as Platinum\u2019s Carbon Black will clog your average pen. Modern cartridge fountainpens are not designed to accomodate pigmented inks. They are designed for dyes. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not the pen \u2014 it\u2019s the paper. It\u2019s the paper that allows the bleed-through or not. The pen is only a contributing factor. If you don\u2019t want to contribute to even more bleed-through, consider using a pencil or ballpoint pen. Their nature simply offers little or no bleeding. Rollerball and fountain pens have a higher tendency to result in bleeding because of the more liquid nature of their ink penetration. Use a finer nib size to reduce that. ",
