            "answer_text": "None of them are authentic English phraseology. All three versions are trying very hard to be descriptive but ended up being meaninglessly clever. Reasons:- Agonising over \"by,\" \"in\" or \"with\" is pointless because the bigger problem is the description -- it's driving around in circles to link the various elements of the scene. The boy and the woman are either sitting next to a table with a spread tablecloth or something else, not seated by a tablecloth (sentence 1) or wearing tablecloths (sentences 2 and 3). The man was dressed well like he's going to see someone important. Recommendation:- All three versions should be scrapped and restart, preferably in at least two sentences. Packing everything into a single sentence to save a few words is ultimately no saving at all. By the time the man came to them, the boy and the woman were already sitting at the table with a spread tablecloth. The man was in a three-piece suit and hat as if off to see someone important. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "None of them.  While one can be seated by the (or a) tablecloth, one is usually seated on a tablecloth.  Tablecloth (one word) should preceded by the article \"a\" or \"the\" tablecloth. A tablecloth is usually spread so the word \"spread\" is superfluous. If it were not spread, the use an adjective (e.g., \"folded\") to describe its state.  \"\u2026when the man came to them\" The word \"down\" is superfluous unless you want to emphasize from where the man came (e.g., down the hill, down the ladder). There should be a period following them, not a comma (which should have been FOLLOWED by a space).  The remainder of the sentence examples should actually be a second sentence, not a run on of the first sentence. Start that sentence of with \"He was\" as in \"He was dressed\u2026.\" ",
