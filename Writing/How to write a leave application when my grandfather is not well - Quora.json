            "answer_text": "If you are in the United States, there is a law granting family leave days to care for your immediate family. That includes, I believe, your mother, father, sister, brother, spouse and children. You are permitted to take off work, but you will usually not be paid while you are not working. I believe grandparents and aunts and uncles are excluded. You might petition for your employer to make an exception, but they aren't required to hold your job for you. I would recommend a face to face request as opposed to putting it in writing, unless you do not have a personal relationship with your supervisor. If you decide to write a request, include specifics such as estimated date of departure and length of time they can expect you to be gone. An estimated date of return might not be possible, but if you have any idea that would helpful. Also helpful would be to include why you need to be the caregiver. Are you the only capable grandchild? If possible, an indication of what his medical condition is would help your cause especially if he is terminally ill. God bless you on your pursuit and blessings on your grandfather's health, too. ",

Respected Sir, Hoping wellness at your perfect self from my side. It is for your information that I'm Vatsala Singh, an employee under your supervision in Costumer services department.
