            "answer_text": "Yor question has your answer. You said you read a lot. That's exactly what you have to stop doing. Simple as that. You see when you read a lot then you have a lot of information and you would wish to execute not one but all of them and that's where the issue is. You want to execute all of them and you read a lot. In psychology that's called information overload. I've been in your shoes back in 2014 when I started my entrepreneurial career and I read a lot, a lot of failure stories and a lot of everything and information over load happened. In order to avoid that what I did as per my mentor said is stop reading so much. I didn't read much. So say I was reading four books in a week before that and then it came to one book a week. Eventually one page a day. And in one page whatever I learnt I'm going to implement that. Unless I implement that I'm not going to read another page. Doing that way I started implementing that being overloaded by the information. You could do the same way or find a similar way of same kind so that it helps you up execute stuff than just reading it and doing nothing about it. Hope it helps mate. Cheers! Prabhu  ",

            "answer_text": "First you need a plan before jumping on execution part. So make a plan. This is what I usually do.  First set long term goal, something like \"I want to learn sketching like professionals do\".Set time duration for this goal. Se  time duration judiciously. One cannot become pro at something within few weeks, sometimes within few months.Then divide long term goal into short term small tasks like I will learn sketching faces or flowers or objects, etc.Assign time period for short term goals.Decide how much time you can give for this short term task on daily basis. For example you might be able to spend 2-4 hours on that task.Do not push yourself too hard. One cannot concentrate on work for more than an hour (now this time differs for everyone. Find out how much is yours. )Even if you fail to give time for one day or some days, do not get frustrated, bounce back and start again.Failing in execution is fine, nobody is going to hang you because you did not followed your plan but do not leave the plan because you failed. Keep trying again and again until you achieve your goal.Summary: create short tasks and follow time.",
