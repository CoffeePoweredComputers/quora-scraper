            "answer_text": "Hemingway said anybody can write a book in first person, so I wrote my first few novels in first person and it worked out fine. At some point I wanted to take on the challenge of more than one viewpoint so I tried third person with two POV characters, and that worked out fine as well. It's just a question of what you feel most comfortable with. First person can be more intimate, but it's also more limiting since you can only show the scenes your narrator appears in. Third person is more widely used and gives you more options, but it can be more challenging to get into the POV of more than one character. Experiment with both and see which one you like best. Once you know you can do it either way, decide which approach will best serve the story you want to tell. ",
