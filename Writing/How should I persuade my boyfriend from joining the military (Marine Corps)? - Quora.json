            "answer_text": "How should I persuade my boyfriend from joining the military (Marine Corps)? First, if he's sent on joining and you successfully dissuade him from joining, then when he's feeling trapped and miserable you will quickly become an ex girlfriend. Second, you fail to give any real information to provide a rational argument either way. Depending on his intentions behind joining, your strongarm attempts to dissuade him from joining could quickly make you an ex as well. If you want to have a rational discussion with him, you need to understand his mindset for joining. Only then can you lay out your argument and list the pros and cons of him joining. ",

If that is his goal or dream , and someone tried to talk me out of it, well either you would try to understand or you would have to go. I never wanted to look back and wonder what would have happened if I pursed my dreams. If you do talk him out of it later on he will regret it. And you will be the one he blames. ",
