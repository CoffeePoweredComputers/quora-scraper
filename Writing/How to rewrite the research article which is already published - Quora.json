            "answer_text": "Once I visited a very senior and retired professor. He was going through the research paper he was working on. On that particular day while he was going through his paper, I got to know he was revisiting his own work for the sixth time and he was planning to send his paper to one of the renowned international peer reviewed journals published from Canada. He had shared this paper with me and I had given my views and comments about the same, which he discussed in great details with me while I was with him. For me it was a mind blowing when it came to his devotion to the research work he was doing. In a tireless manner he was checking his own work in view of the feedback he received from four of his trusted acquaintances. In a nutshell, whenever a researcher sees a scope of improvement in his/her own work, whether it is already published or being published it should be done without any hesitation. Whether the publisher would publish it again or not is a matter of their discretion. Today there are many more opportunities for researchers to publish it online with appropriate comments. The more important part to my mind is willingness to acknowledge the fact that there is always scope to learn, gain new insights, notice errors in one\u2019s own work and one should do it continuously with utmost humility.
