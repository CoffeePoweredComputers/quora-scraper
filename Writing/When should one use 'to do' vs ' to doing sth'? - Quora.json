            "answer_text": "This is one that needs to be looked up in a grammar book or website, because it's way too broad a question. The infinitive and present participle both have a number of different uses. This might help, though: their functions overlap when they act as nouns. It's maybe most confusing when they are objects: why you can say both try to do and try doing but only have to do, not have doing, and only enjoy doing, not enjoy to do. There is no good answer. It's just a rule that some verbs need their verb-as-object to be in the infinitive, others need it to be in the participle. This is usually called verb patterns and you kind of have to memorize each one. ",

            "answer_text": "On a very basic level, \"to\" is part of the infinitive. This means you will never (as far as I know) see \"to doing\" or \"to reading\" or anything other than the infinitive (most plain) form of the verb. For -ing forms, a form of \"to be\" must occur first: \"am doing,\" \"were reading,\"  \"will be going,\" and so on. Forget all those examples above -- their right answers aren't always right -- and still to these basic rules I just mentioned. (There may be exceptions, but forget about those for now.) ",
