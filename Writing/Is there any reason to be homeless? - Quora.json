            "answer_text": "Generally and for the most part, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness and HUD, the lack of affordable decent/dignified housing has been the main reason why there is an increase in homelessness. People experiencing homelessness and poverty include children, the aging elderly, the disabled, and those who choose to be homeless (the lowest fraction of the population). Think about the more than half million people who were counted as homeless on the one night when volunteers go through a community to count people not living in shelters and the people who live in shelters (both sheltered and unsheltered are homeless). That count does not include the homeless who sleep in abandoned buildings or cars. Those who share a couch or a room with a friend on that Point-In-Time Count are not part of the count. Therefore, you can be correct if you say there are twice as many as half million people experiencing homelessness. Wherever the cost of housing is high, you can expect to see people living on the streets or in the nearby woods. The City of Los Angeles and the City of Honolulu have mutual problems that makes their homelessness count greater than the rest of the country. The mutual problem is: High Area Median Rent. In fact, latest research shows that minimum wage earners can only afford $500 per month or less in rent. Do you know where decent and dignified one-bedrooms can be rented for $500 per month including utilities? That is a fact realized by nearly every community in the United States. The next thing to think about is: Disasters. What do you suppose happens when a town is flooded or destroyed by fire? Fact is that in Chico, California, there were 40,000 displaced without a place to live because of the devastating wildfire in 2018. They are homeless, living in motels or shelters or camping. While we have facts that point to the serious lack of affordable housing, partly because older housing is deteriorating and are not being rehabilitated, land owners and developers and real estate brokers can charge as much rent as they want. High story buildings are very expensive and more costly than building single family small houses. I\u2019m against tiny houses because they are not made to last for a lifetime. I am for creative permanent essential houses that have bathrooms, good insulation, modern kitchen, living room and a spacious bedroom or two. It is what we\u2019ve designed for our development that we hope some day will be built in a village setting. Research shows that people do not like living in high rises, because there are too many people converged into the same space. In rural communities, the environment is cleaner because the population is lower than in cities. However, developers are not building for affordability. They are building for profit. It will take the political will to allow modifications to zoning and restrictions on land. In our region of southwestern Colorado, we have a serious problem with water. Drought has lowered the amount of water washed down after a dry winter with very little snowmelt. While there are many ranches and farms up for sale, their water source is scarce, and it costs millions of dollars to connect to City water and to dig deeper wells. At the same time, waste management is a huge problem for a development. Regulations and laws that restrict properties to be used for affordable housing is compounded by the Not-In-My-Back-Yard (NIMBY) attitudes. Unless civic leaders look at the housing problems differently, we may as well sit back and watch more homeless campsites popping up everywhere they should not be. One researcher says that in order to end homelessness, every State of the nation needs to build 150,000 units of housing in an overnight \u2014 and, every one of those units must be dedicated to the homeless. Wages are not increasing, and minimum wage is not the same as \u201cliving wage\u201d or \u201chousing wage\u201d. This is a worldwide problem. But, America needs to realize there is a drastic shift of wealth since President Trump and the Republicans gave tax breaks to the largest corporations \u2014 the ones who don\u2019t increase minimum wages \u2014 and the top 1% of the wealthy. The big question may be (in my humble opinion): When will a revolution take place by the growing population of the poor and the homeless? History says it will happen \u2014 but, when? We are as a nation on a brink of recession since the most recent drop in the stock market only a few days ago. Trump is threatened by the forecast of a bad economy. He is \u201conly worried about being re-elected\u201d. He has divided this country so deeply that this nation is vulnerable to economic disaster!! We could have another crash of the market. Trump has destroyed our relationships with countries that were our Allies. When America falls, our enemies will have the capacity to destroy us from within. That whole scenario is my greatest concern!! If you don\u2019t like homelessness populations now, wait until the next recession happens; you can expect more people losing homes and jobs. But there is hope! My hope is in the Lord God coming back to rule this earth. He is the only hope! ",

            "answer_text": "Major reasons for homelessness include:  Poor social and familial relationships - If you have very poor or non-existent relationships with your family then you have no one to provide you housing or loans to get you on your feet in troubled times. If you don't  have a partner or an SO, then you can also end up being homeless.Mental illness - If you are a mentally ill person who has an illness that is \"treatable\" on an outpatient basis, then you are likely to become homeless when/if you have personal or financial setbacks.Substance use/abuse - If you frequently overindulge in alcohol & illegal substances, unless you can also maintain employment, there's a strong likelihood that you will become homeless.Poor planning - You see this a great deal in \"boomtowns\". People frequently move to areas that they are unfamiliar with or simply know nothing about and expect to gain employment immediately. When this doesn't occur or when their employment has issues, they simply haven't planned for this, they haven't saved for this and as such end up being homeless.Lack of flexibility - Homeless people are often very inflexible. They want or need conditions to be in manners that are acceptable to them and will actually move out of situations (and back into homelessness) for reasons that could be altered by having a simple discussion or by compromising. There are many agencies willing to help people; but to do so they have to be flexible.While there are many more reasons that people become homeless, at least one or more of the above are root causes of their continued homelessness.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Here's the main causes of homelessness as I've observed from my years of homelessness. Choice. This is a big reason for the between 18 and 25 crowd you see drinking with friends all day. Though others choose to be homeless for many other reasons like a sense of adventure or in my case I just do better in the streets.Drug or alcohol addiction. This is fairly common (though nowhere near as common as most people believe). These folks either get clean, go to prison or die within a year of becoming homeless.Personal disaster. House fire, flood, loss of a job. These things can happen to anyone.Just got released from jail or prison.In the case of a buddy of mine, just stumbling through life with no plan or putting any effort in life. This is very rare.Physical or mental issues. This is pretty darn common. The homeless folks you see who look dirty as hell, wearing a coat that's filthy in summer, and smell like they haven't showered in a year? Yep. Those are the severally mentally ill. Believe it or not you can't tell most homeless people are homeless just by looking at them. You can stay reasonably clean (along with your seasonably appropriate clothing (most of the time)) and be on the streets. That's made much easier if you're a homeless person who stays in a shelter or couch surfs or van dwells. On the streets it's hard at times but not impossible.",

            "answer_text": "My rent went up until it was literally more than my average monthly wages. I had seen it coming and started looking for somewhere else to live, but there was a larger problem looming. You know how you\u2019ve always heard you should only pay 25% to 30% of your wages on housing? Well, in California that translates to \u201cyou must prove that you make three to four times the rent to \u2018qualify\u2019 to rent this apartment\u201d. The average rent for a modest one bedroom in Los Angeles is $2,200 per month. If you don\u2019t make *at least* $6,600 per month, you can\u2019t move in. San Francisco is even more hideously expensive. Sacramento, which I just visited for a week, is sitting right at about $1,200/month out in the suburbs. Do you make enough to not be homeless in California? Or will you rent half a bedroom with a total stranger for $700/month? That\u2019s reality here. HOW everyone ends up on the streets for the first time varies greatly. It can be anything from loss of a supporting partner or family member, loss of their good health, loss of a job, loss of a lot of things to just straight up being priced out of the only home they\u2019ve ever had and simply not \u2018qualifying\u2019 for any other housing, which is precisely what happened to me. What KEEPS people here homeless though is the very large difference between what they are paid and the cost of even entering housing. The systems put in place to help are so underfunded and overwhelmed that even after applying every single time the waiting list opened since the early 1990s, I\u2019ve still not had my name drawn to be put on the waiting list for Section 8. I am far from alone in that. We need to break down the barriers to housing, provide more very low income housing and increase access to and the amount of housing subsidies if we want to solve the problem. Anything else is the equivalent of shoving everything under your bed and calling your bedroom \u2018clean\u2019. Let\u2019s not do that. We\u2019re adults now, we can surely figure out it works best for all involved if we just suck it up and deal with the problem the *correct* way instead of trying to hide it - can\u2019t we? I hope so. There are a lot of very real people who need us all to get together and do that - and I just happen to be one of them. Again, I am far from alone in that. ",

            "answer_text": "One factor is the gap between the cost of living and the income of low-wage workers. In the 60's and 70's a year-round worker earning the minimum wage was paid enough to raise a family of three above the poverty line.  We didn't see much homelessness during this time because the cost of living was far less than what a minimum-wage worker would earn.  But starting from 1981, however, the minimum wage has only gone from $3.35/hr to $7.25/hr in 2007.  All the while, the cost of living has been increasing at a much faster rate.  The real value of minimum wage today is 26% less than in 1979[1].  As of 2009, a full-time minimum wage working year-round will earn a little more than $10,712/year this puts him nearly 40% below the poverty line[2]. Another is Job Security. In the previous decades, to the dismay of the workers, the US has faced a significant deterioration in job stability. The share of workers in \"long term jobs\" (those lasting more than 10 years) fell sharply between 1979 and 1996 [2].  There has been many cases where people have been forced on the streets due to involuntary job loss. A useful measure of the decline in job security is underemployment.  I think the NCH Fact Sheet[3] gives a pretty comprehensive summary of this: Unlike the unemployment rate, measure of underemployment reflect not only individuals who are unemployed, but also involuntary part-timers and those who want to work but have been discouraged by their lack of success.  In 2003 the underemployment rate stood at 10.1% , substantially higher than the 6.0% unemployment rate.  In 2006, it was somewhat lower at 8.4% but there is still a large gap between this rate and the unemployment rate which was 4.7% (The State of Working America, 2006).  One reason for the higher level of underemplyment is the increasing number of involuntary part-time workers--workers who want to work full time but have only been able to obtain part time work. You can see that for many Americans, work provides no escape from poverty.  The benefits of economic growth have not been equally distributed; instead, they've been concentrated at the top of income and wealth distributions.

I was in the hospital for severe anxiety and depression as I have no skills or tools on how to survive. I have a son who turned to drugs and another son who has not talked to me in years.I\u2019ve contacted social workers who gave me list after list of places to call. Many were waitlisted or expensive as all I had to live on was benefits. My step family refused to help me as being the black sheep they wanted me far far away. Cut to today. I have lived in a car, on floors and in tents still trying to locate housing. I am a college grad however jobs aren't available for Seniors who are homeless. The only thing which puts a smile on my face is from my four legged 10lb friend who keeps me going. Homeless can happen to anyone! I Never Ever thought I would be without the comforts of home and a job. I was the one who donated to programs for the homeless handing out food or blankets. Today I rent a bed for half my benefits where 90% of the renters indulge in Meth and I stand pretty much alone as I don't condone the use of drugs. (420) is ok. Ive tried and tried to get out of here but it's hard and now with the virus it has become even more difficult. Yet every day I call trying to locate a program or person who can lend a hand but very few doors are open. My son who lives in the same city has now decided not to speak to me. He is an adult, has a good job but I must put my energy into finding a forever home. I have learned that those who are homeless, don't have money or a support system are treated with distain and total disregard for the human race. It's sad as the homeless are not all alcoholics or drug addicts. We struggle daily to try and keep our pride as we put our hand out for a contribution. They have family to feed and the only job they are qualified for is panhandling hoping they can go back to their home on the street with a loaf of bread. I ",

            "answer_text": "If you look at the lists of things that other writers have said cause a person to be homeless, you will see a pattern. Many of the causes (mental health issues, addiction, rigid thinking) are linked to stigma and social exclusion. I have always said homelessness=exclusion. I believe that any behaviour or circumstance which impacts your reputation leads you one step closer to homelessness. When behaviours that lead to exclusion outweigh those that create inclusion, the walls begin to fall down around you. Nobody simply becomes homeless. They lose a relationship(often for questionable behaviour), which makes them fall into depression, maybe they develop an addiction, which makes them late with their rent, which impacts their tenancy, etc. Notice that some of these qualities are circumstances, and some are choices. But it's not just behaviours that can cause you to be excluded. You may be LGBT, or a person of colour, or the \u201cwrong\u201d religion. My point is, whatever causes exclusion causes homelessness. Whatever causes inclusion ends homelessness. EXPANSION: I thought I was rather brief there, and I want to detail what I mean by inclusion being the only viable weapon against homelessness. Some examples of inclusion would be healthcare programs that \u201cask no questions,\u201d or housing which opts not to run a credit check. Services which allow reconciliation policies, forgive past wrongs, these are all inclusive. If you look at inclusive programs, they create connections, and produce better results. The less you worry about the \u201crules,\u201d and the more you understand relationships, the more effective you will be in this work. ",

            "answer_text": "10 Causes of Homelessness 1. ADDICTION Probably the most common stereotype of chronically homeless people is that they are drug and alcohol addicts \u2014 with good reason. 68% of U.S. cities report that addiction is a their single largest cause of homelessness.* \u201cHousing First\u201d initiatives are well intentioned, but can be short-sighted. A formerly homeless addict is likely to return to homelessness unless they deal with the addiction. Treatment programs are needed that treat the root causes of addiction and help men and women find a way back home. (*Source: National Coalition for the Homeless \u2013 Substance Abuse.) 2. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE Nationally, 50% of homeless women and children are fleeing domestic violence.* When a woman is abused, she faces a crisis of safety. If she stays in the home, she\u2019ll be beaten again. If she leaves, she\u2019ll have little means of support. Either choice is a tremendous risk. Choosing homelessness over abuse is both a brave and frightening decision. (*Source: National Coalition for the Homeless \u2013 Domestic Violence.) 3. MENTAL ILLNESS 6% of the American population suffers from mental illness. In the homeless population, that number jumps to 20-25%.* Serious mental illnesses disrupt people\u2019s ability to carry out essential aspects of daily life, such as self care and household management. Without assistance, these men and women have little chance of gaining stability. (*Source: National Coalition for the Homeless \u2013 Mental Illness.) 4. JOB LOSS AND UNDEREMPLOYMENT The current downtown in the economy has many Americans barely getting by financially. Many are underemployed at wages that can\u2019t sustain them. Layoffs and job cuts leave individuals and families in desperate circumstances. Unemployment benefits and savings run out, leaving people homeless who never thought it could happen to them. (See: National Coalition for the Homeless \u2013 Employment.) 5. FORECLOSURE Even people who have jobs are finding themselves upside down with their mortgages. From 2008 to 2009, foreclosures jumped by 32%. A 2009 survey estimates that as many as 10% of people seeking help from homeless organizations do so due to foreclosure.* (*Source: National Coalition for the Homeless \u2013 Foreclosure.) 6. POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS One any given night, as many as 200,000 military veterans sleep on the street.* The percentage of veterans with post-traumatic stress is growing among those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Adapting to \u201cnormal life\u201d back in the U.S. is proving to be extremely difficult for the men and women who have served us. Unable to cope, some choose to leave homes, loved ones and jobs behind for homelessness and/or addiction. (*Source: National Coalition for the Homeless \u2013 Veterans.) 7. THROW AWAY TEENS Homeless teens often become so due to family conflicts. They\u2019re kicked out or choose to run away over issues of drug/alcohol addiction, physical abuse, sexual orientation or teen pregnancy. Mental illness can play a significant role in teen homelessness just as it does in adults. Teens in foster care often end up on the street after they \u201cage-out\u201d of the system at age 18, a sad situation in which many feel alone or abandoned. 8. RELATIONAL BROKENNESS A homeless person is most often a deeply hurting person. By the time they come to a homelessness organization for help, they\u2019ve burned through every supportive relationship possible. Friends and family are no longer able or willing to help, leaving the homeless man or woman very much alone. What relationships they have are usually predatory. In a sense, their situation is less about homelessness and more about unwantedness. A significant barrier to recovery often lies in the ability to restore trust and maintain healthy relationships. 9. GRIEF It\u2019s not uncommon to discover that the men and women in many shelters are burdened by grief. Unable to deal with the death of a loved one or other significant trauma, they numb their pain in addiction. Addiction and apathy lead to the loss of job and home. They simply stop caring if they live or die. Grief becomes a roadblock to living. 10. DESPAIR \u201cOnce you get down this low, it\u2019s hard to get back up,\u201d we often hear homeless men and women say. The longer they are homeless, the more difficult it becomes to combat the lies they hear in their heads. They believe there\u2019s no way out. They don\u2019t deserve another chance. They\u2019ll never break free from addiction. They\u2019ll always be a failure. More than anything, these men and women need hope. If you want to know more about this, then I suggest you check out this link Gift Card Project homeless charity. I hope it will help you to know more about helping homeless people with a gift card. ",

            "answer_text": "Long term homeless persons almost always have one of three problems. And many of the long term homeless have two or three of these problems. Mental illness, alcoholism and drug addiction are largely responsible for long term homelessness. And solving the homeless problem is largely the problem of solving those three problems. The next biggest problem among the long term homeless are those who aren't mentally ill, but who have found the regular working life too difficult to deal with and who have opted to drop out. And I have known graduates from ever major university who fit under this category. And if you meet them, you would never know they are homeless. The old time traditional hobo would also fit into this category. Lastly, there are those who have usually been homeless for under a year who lost a job or who were divorced and who commonly but not always, have few job skills. They also tend to be younger or older, are often women who suddenly found themselves abandoned or unemployed. They usually find themselves on the streets due to the ending of a relationship (including kids leaving their homes for a variety of reasons) and the ending of relationships is the leading cause in the increasing number of women who are homeless. And the decline in the number of children families are having, leaves many women with no other place to go. The only good news for this last group is, assuming these newly homeless do not develop any of the other problems, they are usually off the streets in less than a year. ",

            "answer_text": "Homelessness is basically disenfranchised for some and free living for a small percentage. In some parts of the world, they are called Gypsies, or nomads, or migrant workers, or lower caste, the poverty-struck, and even refugees of some political edict or natural disaster. Not being part of mainstream society, their presence interferes with the normal social order of the place they inhabit. Everyone mainstream has staked out areas in which to live and pay for the privilege of community. They don't impose on their neighbor and expect the same. They develop government along with a justice system to keep the status quo for as peaceful an existence as possible. The homeless are denied that for reasons ranging from political oppression, sickness leading to loss of income and loss of ability to pay for the privilege of maintaining the standard of living that one had, or needs to remain in that community. The sickness can be physical, emotional, and mental. The search to find food, can leave its own scars which can compound the problems. Living homeless can be like living tribal, in the sense that in order to exist, people loosely band together basically for protection and the sharing of information and helping-hand work to trade or aid one another. Mainstream people tend to view them as the Visigoths or the Vandals outside the city , ready to move in and cause a riot, by which to break-in and steal the established people's possessions. In that sense it is like a war between neighboring tribes, seeking to steal each other's stuff rather than find ways to work together. That is why in world history you have someone being given credit as the one who united the countries by usually conquering the local tribes and forming a crude start of a nation out of them. I'm trying to show that the problem of homelessness is worldwide and isn't a new phenomena - only the reasons are more varied today as how people become homeless or are relegated to being homeless. If you think about it, how many traveling salesmen or military, or instructors from big companies are on their multiple try at marriage because they are away from the home so long. They have multiple places to stay, but it isn't a home. Same for merchant marines, stewards and stewardesses, deep-sea fisherman, contract boat captains, and project engineers. Some are willing to give up a normal life to go it alone. As long as they can stay healthy, they can live remotely and alone, communing with nature in a perpetual camping trip. They can lose their 'people skills' after being isolated for so long and alone with their thoughts, not noticing how their reasoning may have drifted off course because there is no one at their side to point out discrepancies in thinking or reasoning. Mistrust on both sides, breeds contempt and fear which leads for a call of action to contain the supposed menace. Armed agents of the community enforce a perimeter to keep out those not of the community. It is historically a bad idea to have dissidents adjacent to you. Russia doesn't like missile bases so close to it's territory and the US didn't want missiles in Cuba. The point is that community governments grow in order to deal with the issue of non-compliant people trying to live in the same land as the compliant ones. The compliant homeless within, is one problem, and the non-compliant homeless at the border is another. They don't want peace they want 'a piece' as in, a piece of the good life, but they rarely want to cooperate and work for it, but rather take it away from someone else. The job of a compassionate government as opposed to a dictatorship is that they will try to help and re-integrate the homeless within, whereas a dictatorship sets edicts and punishes by putting people to hard labor, or making a sweep and locking up the non-compliant, and shooting the non-compliant. By ignoring the problem, it grows and can turn into something big and nasty, being led by the most treacherous, leading followers who get nothing except what their organized group can plan to take by force, and sell illegally on the black market.

The progressive viewpoint is that homelessness may not be the result of one\u2019s own actions, and continued homelessness is the direct result of systematic oppression. To some degrees, both viewpoints are correct - some people have become homeless because they made stupid decisions, while some people have become homeless because of situations or accidents happening that are not their fault. On the same token, continued homelessness may indeed be a person\u2019s own inaction, but it is extremely difficult to find a job as a homeless person - think about all of the hoops you have to jump through just to apply for a job. You need an address for filing taxes - which a homeless person won\u2019t have. You need your social security number, which I can guarantee most people don\u2019t even have memorized, much less homeless people having their cards on them. Etc. It\u2019s difficult to say if there is a solution to the problem because it involves people, and people are complex. There\u2019s no one correct image of all homeless people, and subsequently there cannot be a single correct solution to the problem. And anyone who\u2019s quick to either dismiss all homeless people or support all homeless people has a very narrow-minded view of a complex problem. ",

In the late 80s I boarded a twin engine plane with a native lady and escorted her with two police back to the mental health ward in Page Arizona. She had escaped about a year before and every attempt to get her back ended in disaster. Shortly after the above incident, the police brought me about a 40 year old woman. She had no memory didn't even know her name. After two weeks of trying to help her I found a combination of phone number in my notes which caused me to get in touch with her father. I carried a notepad and jotted down everything she said for 2 weeks. It turned out that her family including your husband had put her on the bus for treatment in San Francisco. They put her on the bus with her meds that kept her sane. Someone stole her purse, she lost her memory and got off the bus in Kingman. I drove one man from Kingman Arizona to El Paso Texas . I helped him take the plywood off the windows of his mansion. I took him back to his house a couple days shy of five years from the day he walked away. His wife died he boarded up the windows covered up all of his cars locked his gate and walked. Another time I drove a man from Joplin Missouri to Wichita Kansas . To the police station where he turned himself in so he could serve his sentence. Just six months ago I drove a woman from Portland Oregon to Tulsa Oklahoma. She had moved to Oregon so she could try treating her autism with marijuana, got caught up in meth, and lost her mind. I found her in Portland the day after she was to be in Corvallis at a hearing to determine if she was to be involuntarily committed. I found her outside a hospital just released. She couldn't speak a sentence that was it intelligible. But she did give me her mother's phone number. Mental Health Systems Act of 1980 (MHSA) was United States legislation signed by President Jimmy Carter which provided grants to community mental health centers. During the following Ronald Reaganadministration, the United States Congress repealed most of the law. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/1984/10/30/science/how-release-of-mental-patients-began.html&ved=2ahUKEwiI9M771Z3hAhVeHDQIHRxcBqoQFjAAegQIAhAB&usg=AOvVaw1E9aoRsVfklsVt7Owum6eJ ",

Most Section-8 have new cars, not limited to high-end European models. Yes, maybe more than one car. Most Section-8 have additional tenant that is not on the lease, meaning almost free rent from government plus additional rental income from roommate. Let me add a little more. You probably seen people bagging for money by the Freeway entrance or Stop sign? I saw this man on my way out of a shopping center. He had his back turn towards me. I drove around and could see what is going on? He was busy counting a pile of paper money about 3 inches thick. ",

If you do not believe in God and/or in Jesus, who people everyone here on Earth for a reason, then maybe you need to realize that even homeless people have had value (Veterans who fought for our country), and/or have future value that may or may not be known to you or me at the time we see them. Does the question truly beg, why do we, as a society, not have housing for each and every person by now? If we did, we would not have homeless people, would we. If a homeless person is not doing you harm and is only an eyesore to you (if that is your meaning), than walk or drive elsewhere. You can not know any man or woman until you have walked in their shoes, and most homeless people do not plan to be homeless forever. They do not wish to be homeless. They all want a home. Maybe they are special, more special than anyone else, sent down to us from the heavens to observe if we are good enough to go on? No one knows. I have known plenty of rich men in fancy suits that believe they are better than anyone because they sit at a fancy desk and make phone calls and tell their secretary to type pages they sign and send in the mail. Then, these rich men get in their fancy cars and drive home to their fancy houses, all because they are better than everyone, right? Well, I am of the mind that we are all equal, even if I do not believe in God and Jesus, which I clearly do. This question is seems irrelevant. Being homeless is not a crime. In fact, I am certain the man in the fancy suit does more in the life of crime than the homeless guy by cheating on his taxes whenever and wherever he can! We should have compassion for those less fortunate and not judge! Why should we have them is irrelevant, again. Its what can we do to help them that should be the question. ",

That started the systematic defunding of these mental hospitals. Kennedy was enraged because a relative was lobotomized and movies like One Flew over the cookoo\u2019s nest created a false understanding of what mental treatment is really like. When the hospitals shut down millions were released to the street and current chronic mentally ill were denied a place to go for treatment. 300,000 are currently in prison. The \u201chomeless\u201d were used to for political advantage and programs were created that paid a lot of people for literally doing nothing to solve the problem. Current law doesnt allow us to force treatment unless specific conditions are met and then its only for a week or 2 then they are released back on the street. When oyu see one of these people you are seeing schizophrenia, addiction, bi polar disorder, untreated PTSD, alcoholism, and brain damage caused by long term drug use. Allowing them to refuse treatment when they are so impaired is the ultimate in cruelty. ",

            "answer_text": "In terms of net gain (births minus deaths), we are adding over 200,000 people to this planet every day, or over 140 people every minute . That equals over 75 million more people every year, about the same as the combined populations of California and Canada. Frequently Asked Questions Housing supplies don't keep up with population growth is one reason. It's not merely a matter of building more homes, because there needs to be adequate infrastructure to accommodate the additional homes; water supply, sewers, electricity, schools, urban planning etc. There is often a mismatch between where available affordable housing is located, and where appropriate employment opportunities exist. There are economic factors that impact homelessness and make it very difficult to escape. In the US, we incarcerate a large portion of the population. Incarcerating parents plunges children into a cycle of poverty. There isn't a single cause of homelessness, there are multiple causes. A primary cause of the increased homelessness in the US is the fact that the minimum wage hasn't kept up with inflation, and rather than having an opportunity to get ahead, too many people are struggling to stay in place and are falling behind. Perhaps government leadership and the media might someday pay more attention to these issues than they do to polarizing issues like gun control and abortion, and the problem of homelessness can be addressed and alleviated. It's embarrassing to live in a country where such a large percentage of children live in poverty, are hungry and are homeless; especially when the resources exist to eliminate these things. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a range and combination of different things. First we must dissect your question. HOW do pepole become homeless. To ask how is to understand the actions as to which that person took to be in the situation that they are in. To understand how, we must understand why Which sounds a lot similar but why is to actually understand the reasoning behind something. So why are people homeless? The reasoning why someone's homeless is very rarely a reason of logic and or choice. so in any case answering why doesn't help us too much, which brings me on the main question and a well worded one at that. How do people become homeless? I was gonna base this on 4 main factors but typing this on my phone is a nightmare. So I shall keep this short and sweet. It stems from family breakdowns mostly. Relationship failures, mental health issues, financial turmoil, neglect from the council, criminality, being discharged from the army, live in employment issues, drug and substance abuse and most commonly domestic violence and abuse. People that are homeless aren't weak people. in fact in some cases they are stronger than us. What people need to understand is that in this modern society, a society where you need a ridiculous amount of money to live and have a roof, any set back has the potential to run your life. Everything is impermeable because we live our lives around something that doesn't exist in retrospect and that thing is money. The truth is anyone and I mean ANYONE can become homeless. If you have depression and stay in bed for weeks on end, you will lose your job, lose your money then result in losing your home. The actions people take to be homeless are rarely one of sensibility and courage but simply they don't have a choice. Those who have a choice should help those who don't. ",

I eventually lost aforementioned storage unit because I could not afford it along with all of the tools that I owned and most of my clothing. Throughout the last 10 months since February 2018 I have now lost everything including my 6 acres of land near Mount Rainier all of my tools work gear and possessions have been stolen from my truck or I've had to pawn them to pay bills in to eat. Although I have had a bit of challenges in life I never expected to find myself at age 46 sleeping in my truck eating one meal per day on a good day and losing the landscaping business that I so carefully cultivated and worked to build over the last 3 years. At times I've seriously contemplated suicide and ask myself why the hell do I even get up in the morning. This whole time my x it's nice and warm and dry in my old home with my beautiful dog and other pets that she no longer allows me to see. Now all of you are probably asking yourself if anyone is even reading this what horrible things I must have done to her to deserve this? Well in her eyes I was Spacey, forgettful and o lost things alot. there was a reason for this as I suffer from pretty bad ADHD and I can be a bit scattered as she would put it chaotic. Losing your wallet and your phone once or twice a year does not deserve divorce in my opinion but apparently it does in hers. I'm hoping as I sit here on New year's day 2019 that's 3 in the morning in my truck in Washington state that this year holds a little more promise then the last year for me. ",

I notice that out of 79 answers to this question not one of any of them has answered with the solution of one of the most vital elements which can and often does curtail the chances of becoming homeless. And that is the institution of marriage and the breakdown of the marital pact. Since the second wave of our social revolution has taken place, family values and namely loving, committed, monogamous relationships have eroded. Back only a few generations ago, marriage was considered a safety net and the only way your children and ensuing generations could expect to thrive. The sexual revolution, divorce rates steeply on the rise, recessions, double digit inflation, unemployment at record highs, tax breaks for the super rich, feminism, domestic violence and the acceptance of permissive lifestyles have irreversibly changed the social and economic climate of today\u2019s world. Where it was once expected that once you turned 18, you graduated high school, settled in a career path and planned on getting hooked up and moved out of the house before mom and dad retired and ultimately would pass away. There you would be all set for life, no worries, on your own, and then wash, rinse, and repeat, ready to pass it on all down to the next generation. Turned out this so called \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d hasn\u2019t worked for some of us. Unfortunately, I really don\u2019t know how to put this into words. But today\u2019s youth are very immature. How can you blame them though, when those who are responsible for their up keep and well-being can\u2019t even help themselves from becoming disenfranchised? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, of course. Homeless by definition to not have a permanent fixture to store your \u201cstuff\u201d and to come to at the end of a work day. So if you don\u2019t have stuff and you don\u2019t have to come to the same place every day then you really don\u2019t need a home. Throughout human history, there is this notion that in order for you to live your life, you must have a home and if you don\u2019t then you\u2019re called \u201chomeless\u201d. There is also a certain stigma associated with the word \u201chomeless\u201d as if it is a disease and in fact it is not. In a free world, such as in the US, people are free to make a choice. That\u2019s called individual liberty. If I don\u2019t have \u201cstuff\u201d and I can work any where with technology, in theory I don\u2019t really need to have a home. Unfortunately, the majority of humans in the world and particularly in America have been brain washed into thinking they must have a piece of the American dream AKA a house generations after generations that they can\u2019t challenge the status quo. Thus, nowadays when a kid is being born, immediately it has its own share of the national debt of $80K as of 6/2020 U.S. National Debt Clock : Real Time. Hmmm, as it grows up, it also learns to buy \u201cstuff\u201d such as toys, video games, computer games, clothes, nice shoes, materialistic things. On top of that, it also has a desire to eat nice food and expensive and healthy food such as steaks, sushi, sashimi, abalone. Eating home seems kind of boring so a few times a week it has to go out and get food from a store or candies from a store. The older it gets, the more \u201cstuff\u201d it consumes and buys. When it was a little infant, its room only has a crib. By the time it turns 5, its room is full with all the \u201cstuff\u201d it has bought for the past 5 years or should I say its parents \u201cthought\u201d it would need thus would buy those for it. First, it doesn\u2019t know in order for it to buy these things, its parents must work long hours to make the money to buy these things for it. Then it keeps asking itself why its mommy doesn\u2019t stay home to play with it. That\u2019s when it finds out its mommy has to go to work to buy the things that it wants. It\u2019s sad. But only for a few seconds. Then it forgets and it continues its habit of buying more \u201cstuff\u201d. Then it realizes that its friends actually have \u201cmore stuff\u201d than it does. Look at all those nice shoes they post on IG and Tiktok. Look at all that nice hair, nails, make ups (for females), designer shoes, ride, and girlfriends (for males) etc\u2026 It must show these bastards it can do better. So it tells itself when it grows up it will make a lot of money to show its friends it can beat them with \u201cthe most stuff\u201d. Then it goes to college. It realizes no one will teach it for free unlike K-12 education and gives it a degree so it can get a nice job paying a nice salary so it could buy \u201cthe most stuff\u201d so it borrows some money for college thinking that when it gets that nice job, it could then take a few years to pay that debt off. So after 5 years in college, it finds itself in the hole for $50K attending some local state college. Unfortunately for it, when it graduates from college COVID-19 hits so companies are not hiring. So instead of getting a job to pay off that $50K debt it\u2019s staying home playing video games waiting for the virus to go away and companies hire again. It manages to find a part-time job delivering people from place A to place B AKA Lyft or Uber job making just enough to pay its parents some rent money to stay with them, gas, and car loan. Its mom is still working. She\u2019s nice enough to feed it still without charging it groceries. The money it makes though is just not enough to pay down that student loan though as quickly as it had originally thought. Damn. Life keeps getting in the way. It looks around its room. It really doesn\u2019t have anything of value except the video console that its mommy bought for it years ago, a laptop, a bed to sleep on. All the \u201cstuff\u201d he had got since he was born can\u2019t no longer be used. It would be hilarious for a 20 year old to play a toy for a 3 year old. So it tries to sell these \u201cstuff\u201d on Ebay, Etsy, Amazon marketplace, Craigslist etc..To its surprise, all these stuff doesn\u2019t sell for as much money as when its parents or itself originally bought years ago. That\u2019s when it realizes the \u201cstuff\u201d it has has been depreciating AKA looses value over time. Damn. No one has told it that for the past 20+ years. Damn K-12, and college, damm the parents, damn FB, IG, Tiktok, YT. Why didn\u2019t they tell it from the beginning? It\u2019s becoming more depressed now. After living its life for 20+ years it has got \u201cstuff\u201d that has no values to human race except a degree for which no company is hiring. It reflects on one thought \u201cis there a reason to be homeless?\u201d. After all, it hates the parents for not preparing him for this hard life. They never spent that much time with him anyway. They keep asking when it is going to get a job and be independent like they don\u2019t want it to be in this nice home. Little did it know his parents just got laid off during this COVID 19. While the stimulus checks, unemployment checks come in to help them through hard time just a little bit, they won\u2019t be here forever so they have been behind on their mortgage for a few months. Fortunately for them, when they bought the house 2 decades ago when it was born, they\u2019re able to accumulate some equity inside the house so perhaps they could sell the house and move into a smaller apartment\u2026now the kid has grown up, it can be independent so the parents can downsize and not have to work as hard as before. They maybe able to retire even and that prospect of retiring early excites them. That\u2019s why they keep asking this poor human when it is going to move out and find its own place. By now, there is nothing more it hates than the school system that didn\u2019t teach it not to buy depreciating stuff in its life yet made it pay it back $50K student loan for a degree that can\u2019t help it get some money. So that day comes when its parents sells the house, moves into a 1 bedroom apartment hanging it dry. But it is not sad any more because it realizes it really doesn\u2019t need a nice bed to sleep on. It could actually sleep in a sleeping bag anywhere, on a grass, on a sidewalk, in its car etc... It could continue to drive Lyft and Uber to make some money while waiting for a job to come when this stubborn virus is going away. It could go to a lake nearby and take a dip for its weekly clean up. For food, it could buy some groceries for the day, go to a park, use their BBQ pit to set up a fire and do some veggie skewers. Being a vegan is in style nowadays so it doesn\u2019t mind cutting back on the meat at all. For entertainment it could go to various libraries to read books, watch stuff on the internet in the libraries. When it wants it could go take a swim in the ocean or hike in a park. Those don\u2019t cost it any money. As it looks up the stars and moon at night in its sleeping bag it realizes it really doesn\u2019t need a roof over its head. Not tonight at least because the sky is clear. Tomorrow maybe different but who cares. It may get hit by a car tomorrow anyway so let tomorrow worries belong to the future not now. But tonight, at this moment, its life seems perfect. Nothing to worry at all other than that horrible $50K loan hanging over its head. As the wind massages its hair and face, its eyes become heavier, heavier until they completely shut to bring it into another reality in which it is free to do whatever it wants, including a decision not to live in a conventional \u201chome\u201d. The sky and the dirt here are after all its home. It could leave and come any time it wants without any restrictions. Finally, it understands what freedom is and it is so glad it is \u201chomeless\u201d. ",

And continued to even while they were spending our money on the highest bonuses paid and having parties, and laughing at us. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Act was the first and remains the only Major legislative act in response to homelessness. But that act responds to its symptoms rather than the causes. God forbid a politician address\u2019s the real causes when running or when in office same as education. Politicians sicken me, unfortunately Ralph Nader wasn\u2019t good looking enough or rich enough to win the presidency, otherwise you would see a much more educated, prosperous America where the money big companies make stays in America less homelessness better and affordable housing higher minimum wages but they even blocked him from the debates both Democrats and Republicans because they were afraid as hell and this is America he should have been allowed in that debate his whole life was dedicated to the working people of America and consumer protections and Americans are not as educated as they should be when it comes to politics and politicians.

Look who\u2019s in office now, that result was purely from first time white Americans who couldn\u2019t tell you who the first President of the United States was. Homelessness is an epidemic that people while driving in their cars make fun of who have no idea the battles they fight daily to stay alive, be kind and write your council members and congress persons. Most Americans are a paycheck away from homelessness including me who has been on both sides. Vote for a politician who stands for education, social change, not fear, you may not find them. The American Dream is a hoax. Fight against the Ativan realities. And wake up in order to shake it up. ",

            "answer_text": "The whole question of homelessness is this: is it a choice? Does that person choose to live on the streets? If it\u2019s not a choice, the person truly had to accept that way of life, THAT is a problem. It is not fair when a person cannot find a better condition. Of course, things are relative, there are many unfair situations in life.  This question is nearly impossible to answer. If we could only know what CAUSES homelessness we would easily (I think) be able to eliminate the problem. Instead, we see events and certain behaviors associated with, sort of attached to, the homeless person. We can't say mental illness causes homelessness: I know, and you might know, a mentally ill person who is NOT homeless. Causation is like - I slap you in the face and you hurt; that hurting is caused by the slap. Nothing causes homelessness.  On the other hand being homeless comes with its own set of problems. It seems a whole bunch of things conspire, associated with that person's previous experience in life, when we meet a street person, to wonder about his or her condition, and to wonder what's KEEPING him on the street. There could be many associations, or a few. If the person is truly living on the streets and without a home, there is a statistical likelihood of depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, alcohol abuse (to blunt the pain perhaps) and drug use, disease (HIV/AIDs, HepB & C, tuberculosis).  We are so removed from homeless life that we can no longer compare single problems with their solutions, I believe. The longer a person stays on the streets the less likely (s)he will ever return to society a whole person. I don't think at this stage that regular people can offer much more than compassion, i.e., money doesn't work. This does not absolve us rich people of contributing - quite the contrary. As I have gotten older, I have learnt to resent the homeless less. If you talk to them sometimes they'll talk and you can figure out why they're on that path. Careful, though: a panhandler/scammer isn't necessarily homeless.  Lost contacts from fleeing some social pathology or pursuing some better opportunity - whether reasonable or not. Formal removal from a previous \"network\" of support is often the first stage of taking to the streets, at least that's what I've heard. A person loses the only contact he or she has, a friend or relative. Why this person allowed his contacts to dwindle to one or two people may be due to some personality disorder (let's face it), inability to take criticism, inability to assert himself, bad friends, doing what everyone else does, etc. (This is \"noticeable\" in any class-relative social construct, depending on how astute one is to cues, and how willing one is to consider the other person's .) An abusive father, a lost parent, etc.  None of those things caused a person to become homeless. It\u2019s no way to live, but it\u2019s a good way to die. We need to get people off the streets who really want to leave the streets. But once you're on the streets, a willingness to be there keeps you camping, and survival skills keep you alive. Or not. ",

            "answer_text": "The top 5 reasons for someone to be homeless are: (1) lack of affordable housing, (2) unemployment, (3) poverty, (4) mental illness and the lack of needed services, and (5) substance abuse and the lack of needed services. Now, what do you think happened to affordable housing? You cant build houses cheap enough anymore for a lot of reasons and banks and owners would prefer to let properties rot than to even consider a homeless person occupy it. Mostly because of the stigma against the homeless What happened to all the jobs? Most went out of the country, much of it handed over to automation (not a cheaper process by the way) And because the common folk need to work 2 jobs to come close to surviving, not enough. We dont teach well rounded skills in school so we import or export the rest of the jobs. Poverty? Well, this one is easy. Open your doors and windows and look around. Mental illness? Well, thanks to Reagan, support for mental illness went away for the most part which was about the time the homeless situation started to get worse. People do not choose to have mental illness, some develop some sort of illness later in life due to various forms of issues and trauma. I personally developed basic forms of mental illnesses but function well. Just my social skills tanked\u2026LOLOL\u2026. People really need to read up about mental illness. Its worth being educated about it. Substance abuse? Yeah, this is a hard issue. Even harder to deal with since society thinks substance abuse is the number one cause of homelessness. IT IS NOT. Some people made some poor choices, yes. Some knew nothing better and grew up with it. Some turned due to lack of hope. Some turned to substance abuse AFTER being homeless, again due to lack of hope. However, does that mean we turn our backs on them because they are homeless? Shame on society.. Shame\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": " The homeless people so often suffer with problems of drug addiction, especially meth and heroin. And alcoholism. If you\u2019ve seen them talking very loudly, to no one, they\u2019re schizophrenic. The SPD here doesn\u2019t arrest any vagrants. No misdemeanor charges are filed anymore, so there\u2019s no point. Seattle is referred to as the \u201cnanny state\u201d. Some people, homeless because they\u2019re in-between jobs, or they\u2019ve had a temporary setback, are in a different category. They\u2019re not stealing mail, prowling cars, and taking everything off your carport while you\u2019re sleeping. They might be homeless because of a big medical bill, or may be escaping someone\u2019s abuse; these people are usually couch-surfing at relatives\u2019 or friends\u2019 houses, until they get on their feet. The others, the now twelve thousand homeless, apparently hopeless people, living on the streets of Seattle can only be helped if they will accept help. The people flood into town to be in a city that takes care of then somewhat, with services. Services such as non-profits providing meals, mental health services, case management, and drop-in day centers, with shower and laundry facilities. Shelters, a ticket home to their families, drug counseling programs are offered; useful services. However, I don\u2019t mean onsite injection centers, when I mention useful services, which are only a way to help them get to the business of dying. I mean, by useful, helping them stop their drug and/or alcohol abuse. It would cost millions of dollars to house, feed, and pay the utility bills for all these people. A hundred twenty thousand dollars a day, three hundred sixty-five days a year. I\u2019m guessing. No one really knows. But they can\u2019t cope in normal society, the way they are now; they\u2019ve proven it. That\u2019s why they\u2019re where they are. And where are they? You\u2019ll find them, for instance, under a freeway overpass, living there so they can just feed their addictions, unmolested, using their social security checks. They\u2019re always staring off into space, appearing nearly lifeless. It\u2019s frightening. ",

But none of those things by themselves cause homelessness. Lack of money does, in all cases. Anyone who loses their housing for any reason can rent a hotel room if they have money. That isn\u2019t the same as being flat-out homeless. It\u2019s more like being in transition between homes. They might get a new apartment or even a house that same day or within a few days. Or they could just continue to live in a hotel, and some people do. So lack of money is it, the #1 cause of homelessness. Contributing factors? Lack of affordable housing. Landlords wanting pristine credit records. ",

            "answer_text": "There are long-term risk factors and short-term triggers. A long-term risk factor can be an illness, a lack of financial reserves, a lack of family support, a serious mortgage, a job where you are expendable, an addiction or tendency to get addicted easily,\u2026 It often takes a combination of these risk factors to be at serious risk for homelessness. A short-term trigger can be any sort of setback that pushes into these long-term risk factors. The loss of your job, combined with a hefty mortgage, could be enough if you don\u2019t have any financial reserves to cover your living expenses while you find new employment. If you then have a lack of family support, you\u2019re homeless, at least temporarily. Preventing homelessness is about reducing the long-term risk factors where possible. Ideally, save up enough money so that you can cover 6 months of unemployment. Maintain ties to your family if at all possible and healthy. Find employment where you\u2019re not easily expandable. Have a backup option in case you lose your house, for whatever reason. If you have a vehicle that you could sleep in, that\u2019s a major asset when you\u2019re temporarily homeless. To put it differently, there are barriers to homelessness. When these barriers break down and then you\u2019re pushed down the edge, you\u2019re homeless. Try to keep up as many of these barriers as possible. ",

I spent too much time recently working on options to spend the winter indoors. A room or a bed does nothing to accomplish my goals. I\u2019m told I have an illness that will kill me. I\u2019m weary talking about it. I can let people sleep in my van. I can hold the homeless, encourage them and find options for them to better their life conditions. No one is immortal. We have a brief time on this Earth. I may have fewer months to live than others so I must live every moment. I plan to serve those in need. I\u2019m a flawed normal man. I understand solving the homeless crisis will take will take more people and companies than me. I deal with reality as it is, not what I wish it would be. There is so much need here and too few people to help. Until there is no homeless problem here, I\u2019ll do what I can to help one person at a time. Most people never really sat down and got to know a homeless person, but every homeless person is just a real person that was created by God and it is the same kind of different as us; they just have a different story.

            "answer_text": "Many people in the United States are in denial about the sheer cost of housing as a contributing factor to homelessness. Let\u2019s be honest here: not just \u201cin denial,\u201d but hopelessly in denial. A young coworker once told me that he payed roughly $600 / month for his apartment (total cost, shared with a roommate). This works out roughly to about $20 / night. I asked this person, an astute young man, if he thought there was anything available, on the (Seattle area) rental market, for significantly less. He said \u201cno,\u201d and added that he felt lucky to have found an apartment, in \u201creasonable\u201d condition in a \u201creasonable\u201d neighborhood. There is virtually no short-term housing available, anywhere in the U.S., for \u201cas little\u201d as $20 / night. Things were not always \u201clike this,\u201d by any means. There once was a time when a variety of low-cost, short-term housing was available, but virtually all of this disappeared decades ago. There is next to nothing left, nor is there any discernible prospect of any of this coming back. That, I assert, is part of the problem. Suppose you would be willing to live in, say, dormitory-style accommodation with shared bath and cooking facilities. OK, this would not suit \u201ceveryone,\u201d but for the moment just \u201csuppose.\u201d Well, in the U.S., and probably also in Canada, there ain\u2019t no such thing. Homeless shelters are not truly \u201cpublic accommodations.\u201d Youth hostels are, but there are \u201ccatches:\u201d they are intended for travelers, impose time limits (typically two weeks per year, or less) and generally do not accept guests who cannot prove that they reside outside the area. By contrast, hostels are quite common in Europe and generally cost no more than $20 / night - or less. I\u2019ve seen a post on Quora where the writer expressed astonishment about how cheaply one can live \u201cas a tourist\u201d in France. This is not only true, but is by no means limited to France - and some countries are much cheaper (e.g. Ukraine). The \u201chostel scene\u201d varies between countries. For example, some hostels in at least one country (the UK) advertise \u201cmaximum\u201d age limits for guests (but do not always enforce this). Hostels are generally operated as for-profit businesses, but not always: some appear to operate as virtual charities. Suffice to say that not all hostel guests are young tourists: among the people I\u2019ve met are itinerant workers, buskers, and retired people who do not travel. In some countries, hostels accept volunteers who receive \u201cfree\u201d accommodations (and sometimes meals) in exchange for \u201chousekeeping\u201d work. Also suffice to say that hostel staff deals swiftly with disruptive or threatening conduct. I\u2019ve seen people kicked out of hostels and removed by local police, freezing weather notwithstanding. \u201cMixed\u201d dorms are not uncommon, and the women who use them do so with apparent peace of mind. Many Quorans who have written about homelessness in the U.S. have emphasized that some homeless people have personal problems such as mental illness and substance abuse, and are simply unable to get and keep employment. This must not be downplayed. However, it is also true that some homeless people do have jobs but simply do not earn enough to afford housing. In addition, there are people who live in vehicles (and even \u201con the streets\u201d) because they choose to, in order to avoid the high cost of housing. In Los Angeles, where I grew up, this trend dates back to the 1970s - at least. A well-known apocryph (attributed incorrectly to Churchill) holds that \u201cyou can depend on Americans to do the right thing when they have exhausted every other possibility.\u201d The problem of homelessness, as visible as it is today, will have to grow worse - much worse - before people accept that this is a long-term problem that cannot be mitigated without substantial long-term effort, expenditure - and a sea change in public attitudes. A fundamentally inhumane aspect of American society would become quickly apparent if anyone tried large-scale development of low-cost housing in \u201cestablished\u201d neighborhoods - especially housing of types that do not exist today. Skeptics are invited to consider, for example, the strident opposition to \u201cmicrohousing\u201d that Seattle has experienced. Whiners get what they deserve. Homelessness has been a visible problem in the U.S. for going on half a century by now, during which time society has done rather little. To reiterate: mitigating the problem will require substantial long-term effort, expenditure - and a sea change in public attitudes. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a number of reasons to be homeless. In some cases people have made some bad decisions which have left them addicted to drugs or alcohol to the point where they can not maintain a home, or they have been released from prison and they have no family connection to help them get back on their feet (often these two can be related). In other cases people have just had a run of bad luck - lost jobs followed by longer term unemployment and broken relationships that have left them with nowhere to go. Then there were veterans of long term enlistment in the armed forces, who had lost contact with any family they may have had in civvy street who just found it too hard to cope with the transition from having pretty much everything decided for them into being able to shift for themselves, when they reached then end of their service. Some of those might well have been suffering from PTSD as well. And of course some people who were suffering from mental illnesses or learning disabilities, who really needed some kind of sheltered accommodation where none could be found. Sadly sometimes people have just been horribly failed by the system, kids who had been in the care system pushed about from pillar to post with little chance of getting a good education and then cast adrift when they reached 18 with no skills for getting their lives together. Also the relatively young teens whose family connections had been severed by marital breakdown of their parents. The usual tale would be that they were living with their Mother who then found herself with a new chap. The kids acted out - as kids will - followed by the \u201cyou\u2019re not my real dad\u201d shouting matches which resulted in them marching or being kicked out. In other words there are many reasons why people can end up homeless and in all honesty I always felt it is something that could happen to almost anybody, and the real kicker is that once it has happened, it is a really hard task to climb out again.

You may come from a family that would never let a family member live on the street, but in reality there a people that just do not have the compassion or the desire to help, and people will fall into despair. Three. Universal Healthcare, addiction to drugs and alcohol are medical problems and should dealt with medically, also mental health runs deep into at least 10% of our population. Four. There are a few that are on the streets that are so stubborn they will live on the street before doing what someone tells them they should seek help, but that may fall back to mental health. Five. If you want to end homelessness, then support programs that house, give social support, classes to adapt to our ever changing world and quit complaining you taxes are too damn high and fixes this obvious problem.

There are more homeless people in major cities because (1.) there are more people in major cities and (2.) the rent is higher in major cities. Yes, many homeless people are mentally ill, addicted, physically and/or mentally disabled\u2026because having one (or more) of those conditions makes it harder to make money to afford shelter. I\u2019ve never seen a well off homeless person, but I\u2019ve seen a lot of well off mentally ill, addicted, and physically or mentally disabled people. No medical diagnostic manual will list homelessness as symptom of mental illness, addiction, or disability, because it\u2019s not. Mental and physical problems do not cause homelessness, they cause joblessness. Joblessness causes poverty. Poverty causes homelessness. The U.S. does not have a problem with homelessness, it has a problem with people being to poor to afford the rent the market sets. Other countries have a less of a problem with this because spent more effort helping the poor, which frees of more of the poors money for rent, and they have more active controls of the market. ",

Then there are those that wanted an adventure and hit the road with a back pack not realizing it takes a job and money to survive. That is usually where the drugs come into play and it only spirals down to having nothing but homelessness and drugs which leads into mental illness. There are Veterans with PTSD that need help and the V.A. will only give them meds and not a place to stay, eat and get their lives back together. Setting aside a barracks and mess hall would be wonderful and helpful. They need off the streets to change their lives. ",

The book \"Nickled and Dimed\" (written before the recession, when low-wage jobs were plentiful) explores this, showing many low-wage people (working 40 hours a week or more in some cases) are even forced to choose between living in cars (if they have them) or spending pretty much all their wages on either renting a room or motels (the latter, even though far more expensive, may be the only option for someone who hasn't got a months' rent and deposit up-front).

Leading to them losing out on their homes. Look how long it took for the country to start to come back from that\u2026 those people who couldn't find new jobs right away were kind of stuck. What is surprising to me was finding out that a main reason for people to file bankruptcy is Medical Bills. Now bankruptcy may not be a precursor for homelessness for everyone but it is still something to take into account. So because people had a medical emergency and their shitty insurance didn't cover enough and the amount of time they have to take off work- leads them to having no finances and ultimatey homeless is incredibly sad.

The problem there is that the rent so far outweighs even the salaries those with Masters and Doctorate degrees make Santa Monica has such a huge homeless population that they are finally trying to do something . Cal State one of California's biggest employers pays an analyst 19.00 an hour. It was shameless. to see the people on the street in camps right next to a luxury house probably one just like the one they lived in before going west . Koreatown has set up parking lots with wi fi and toilets so that people can sleep in their cars and be relatively safe. I know one thing . In California if you are a dog they will find you, shelter you and feed you. The people who most likely came to work with skills and education for climate and what they thought was going to be a better life wind up in a parking lot. It'so bad there I could not believe it. It made me mad and sad all at once . These people were homeless as they were shit on by LA county. ",

Substance abuse is often an underlying cause of homelessness, so those who choose that lifestyle will find few avenues for help other than expensive private treatment. Likewise people who have emotional or psychological problems will find little free help available until things have gone beyond crises level. Finally those who are unmotivated or unable to work to support themselves, and the skill or maturity to manage their finances, will also have no other assistance beside expensive private councilors. These people often find themselves without any resources to keep them sheltered and fed. They find little sympathy from the general public because their misfortune seems, and often is, entirely of their own making. In short there simply is little support for them for anything other than their making an extreme effort to get themselves out of their situation, or giving them a meal and a few nights in the shelter.

They\u2019re often hungry and ill. And they are often victims of street crime. The fear of running out of money is very great in the US.

And homeless people seen as mentally ill are often, in the United States anyway, put in jails and prisons.

And most Americans fall below the college and experience bar and require more income than just above minimum wage. And once you become homeless it's extraordinarily hard to get out of it. I've barely escaped homelessness with an 11.50$ full time job and working roommates, because rent and utilities are too much and wages too low. ",

Some are mentally ill, others are drug users, some are highly educated and have fallen on hard times. ",

There are MANY people who are homeless and you would never know it because they work and take care of themselves. Being homeless means usually that you have no bed or roof over your head. There are many reasons a person could find themselves in this position. Take me for example. I am a single mother of 2, receive no child support and only make $10/hr before taxes and $7.50 /hr after taxes. I technically do not even meet the qualifications to rent an apartment or house because my income is so low. I've been homeless and lived in a shelter twice in my life. All it has done to me is teach me some hard life lessons. I'm still healthy and no one ever knew that I was homeless. ",

If there is a medical emergency for a child, it is pay the hospital or pay rent. Expecting people to live off of $11 to $15 dollars an hour for experienced positions is ridiculous. And let me say this: this pay is higher than the average four years ago. Screenshots were here but it was reported as a violation of Quora policy. The pay rates were $11 to $15.

There are countless ways to go about this. One of the first points to look at is currency. As long as there is currency there will be homelessness. As long as there are people unable to work, there will be homelessness. As long as we leave mental illness addressed, there will be homelessness. You have to look at it with an unculturally biased scope, which is difficult for many without conscious thought. You have to remember not everyone has that value for home. There are individuals who prefer a nomadic lifestyle and just because it is not a norm does not give you the right to criticize. If you ask me, those individuals have a better sense of what life is about. On top of all of that you have to realize that our ways of life do not make it easy to escape homelessness that later becomes poverty. If someone does not have a job, how can one afford a house? If one does not have a house, how could one get a job? Do you understand the predicament? I am no doctor, I have no degree, I am just a human watching other humans. Just some food for thought. ",

A no credit check loan to cover education to anyone who wants it, maybe give 7 years tax free to our people or atleast 4. Legal immigrants get it why not us?

The storm began under President Ronald Reagan, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act repealed Carter's community health legislation and established block grants for the states, ending the federal government's role in providing services to the mentally ill. As the mentally ill began to flood the streets, the working class wages failed to keep up with skyrocketing inflation, which was the result of trickle down economics theories. A series of minor military conflicts didn't help, and actually raised prices and the burden fell again on the working poor. Joining the now massive ranks of mentally ill on the streets would be the newly addicted prescription drug users, many of whom quickly develop a penchant for harder street drugs like heroin. Obviously it's not that simple, but that provides a general outline for the beginning of the fall of western civilization as we knew it. ",

A city of 10,000 would have 50, etc. Los Angeles County has a population of 9.8 million people with a homeless population of 43,000. At 0.5% homeless rate there should be 49,000 homeless so either someone has under-counted the homeless population or LA County is doing slightly better than average at helping homeless people. The fact that there are more homeless seen in the cities is that with a large population they are much more visible than in smaller cities or rural areas. Homelessness takes many forms and can be virtually invisible in some small towns. It\u2019s still there though. ",
