            "answer_text": "You begin by doing preparation work before you ever start writing. Design your program or project as if you didn\u2019t need any funding. Answer these questions as if you are writing to a stranger who doesn\u2019t know anything about your organization. What is the program/project?What is your mission for the program/project?What is the specific problem you are solving?Why is this program important? What is the need and how do you know? (use statistics and data and qualitative evidence to prove your case)How will you solve it?What activities will you deliver to meet your goals?How much time do you need to solve it?Who are your clients?How much does it cost to deliver the program? (Get quotes to verify the cost)Why are you the best to deliver the program; how do you out-deliver the competition?Who is on your team to deliver the program/project? What are their bios?How will you evaluate the program/project?What will you do once you have achieved your goals with this program?Write answers that are 250 to 100 words. Once you have the design completed, you can share it with internal and external constituents to get their reaction. Sometimes you want the analysis to come from an outside expert who doesn\u2019t know anything about your program so you will get unbiased feedback. Good Luck, ",
