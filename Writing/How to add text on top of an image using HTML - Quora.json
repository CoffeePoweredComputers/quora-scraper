You would have to use something server-side to do that because these types of scripts create a new image on the disk. PHP includes a range of functions to do this: start with imagecreate(). ",

Mind how text wraps or lays next to image. Do you like it? Adjust margin and padding to fit your page container and preference. Check how each browser and a mobile phone (if desirable) sees it. MULTIPLE IMAGES/TEXT CAPTIONS ON ONE PAGE? If you want to add more images, study the \u201cclear-fix\u201d issue where it is hard to get images of various sizes to line up nice next to text captions on one page without resorting to multiple </br> tags. MORE ADVANCED METHODS If your images use a common theme or layout, use CSS to define your image and text blocks. ",
