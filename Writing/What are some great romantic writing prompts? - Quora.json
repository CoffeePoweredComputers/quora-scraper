            "answer_text": "Haven\u2019t watched an episode of Friends since it went off the air in 2004. In fact, some might consider me a staunch anti-rerunner. (An overwhelming number of new shows await me on a Netflix queue.) Yet, this past weekend I found myself in a strange location (yes, somewhere like another planet) where I couldn\u2019t locate the control panel on the TV. And the remote was mysteriously not-in-sight. And you guessed it- the channel was set on the episode of Friends. I got caught up in the scene where Ross becomes aware that Rachel has feelings for him. I was floored. It pressed the \u201chopeless romantic\u201d button on MY control panel. Thus, that pivotal millisecond when one is struck by the awareness of the romantic feelings of another is my winning romantic prompt of the day! ",
