It makes friendship. An interesting thing is that these friendship are often bases simply on who you are as a person rather than your income or physical appearance. It gives you and them an outlet.

I\u2019m careful with the females ones as they can cause friction with my wife if I\u2019m not very open and honest about them with my wife. She has full access to my social media accounts and email so she knows I\u2019m not doing anything I shouldn\u2019t. We\u2019ve never had a problem here but I believe in full transparency with all female friends. She does the same with male friends. ",
