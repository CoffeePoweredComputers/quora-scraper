            "answer_text": "Yes, you can write your own will. It really isn\u2019t that hard to make your own enforceable will. Some states barely require anything at all, even some words jotted on a napkin at a bar can be effective in some jurisdictions. There are very few laws governing what you can and cannot do in a will. There is some key language, which will vary from state to state, that you might need to use to accomplish certain things. There are some laws as far as spouses that can impact whether your will is ok, since in most states a current spouse has an entitlement to a certain percentage of your property. The average person isn\u2019t going to encounter too many laws they will run afoul of in their will. If you want to write your own will, the best thing to do is check on the requirements in your state for the will to be enforceable and to see if there are any quirky laws. That said, whether the will is the right one for you, for protecting your assets, for avoiding trouble after you pass, that is often the trick. This is the reason to use a lawyer, as much as anything. As well as to make sure you understand your obligation to your spouse (if you have one) and any specialized issues you might encounter. ",

            "answer_text": "You can always write your own will. The problem with writing your own will is that it\u2019s unlikely that you know and understand all the laws that govern wills and estates in your jurisdiction (unless you are a specialist in this area). So you might write a will you think sounds enforceable and legally binding, but the court may declare it invalid because you haven\u2019t completed it in accordance with the law. There is usually a requirement that your will is signed and witnessed correctly, for example. We see so many homemade wills that aren\u2019t witnessed in accordance with the law, making them invalid. You say you\u2019ll just add to it, but do you know who must witness it each time you do this? Using your own language rather than legal language can create ambiguity about what you actually meant Plus, you need to make arrangements for minor children, consider tax issues and provide asset protection. A simple DIY will cannot cope with this level of complexity. Is Doing an Online Will Wise? | Contesting A Will (Brisbane) ",
