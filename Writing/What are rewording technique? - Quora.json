            "answer_text": "Your question is unclear, but I suspect you\u2019re referring to something called \u201ccircumlocution,\u201d which is when you use more words than are necessary to say whatever it is that you want to say. The dictionary makes circumlocution sound like a bad thing, but it\u2019s actually a very useful process if you\u2019re trying to learn another language. I\u2019m in the process of learning Spanish myself, and sometimes I just don\u2019t have the right words (or know the exact conjugation ) to say what needs to be said. But, then again, maybe I *can* say what I need to say, if I use additional/other words in order to say it! For example, I want to call my Spanish-speaking wife and tell her \u201cI will be home in fifteen minutes.\u201d Hmm\u2026 I know I need to use the verb \u201cestar\u201d (to be) in this context, but maybe I don\u2019t know how to conjugate it into the future tense. So, instead of saying simply: Estar\u00e9 en casa en 15 minutos. I instead use a verbal phrase that I\u2019m very familiar with that means \u201cI am going to be\u201d _______. Voy a estar en casa en 15 minutos. Granted, there are only two additional words in the second sentence, but that is a short and sweet example of circumlocution. ",
