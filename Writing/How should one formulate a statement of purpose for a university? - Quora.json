            "answer_text": "Before Formulating a Statement you should consider the following things:- 1. Follow Directions It should go without saying that you should demonstrate to the admissions committee the same ability to follow directions that you would expect of your students. Demonstrate flair and originality, but do it while coloring inside the lines. Anything else is a high-risk strategy. 2. Consider Your Audience Admissions officers will read dozens, if not hundreds of statements of purpose during each application season. They can smell formulaic writing and insincerity from miles away, but they will also get genuinely excited when they read something truly unique. 3. Demonstrate Interest in the University If you\u2019re applying to multiple University, odds are that you\u2019ll draft a general statement of purpose and then modify it for each individual application. The key word in that sentence is modify. Do your homework on every institution you apply to. Make the admissions officers think fate has brought you to their doorstep, even if you\u2019re applying to ten other schools. 4. Write a Draft The best writing almost always comes from a lengthy process, rather than a moment of inspiration. Begin brainstorming ideas for your statement of purpose weeks before the application deadline (if possible), and write at least one rough draft. Don\u2019t worry if the writing feels raw while you\u2019re working out what you want to say. Let the first draft be exploratory. The second or third draft is the time to polish, perfect, and proofread. 5. Choose Your Angle Carefully Your goal in writing a statement of purpose is to present your path through life as a story, one that the admissions committee hasn\u2019t heard before. If you find yourself writing \u201cAs long as I can remember, I\u2019ve always wanted to be a teacher,\u201d it\u2019s time to revisit the drawing board. What will you bring to the classroom that no one else does? 6. Peel Back the Layers (find deeper meaning as you write) Maybe you don\u2019t know what your angle is. Maybe you\u2019ve been staring at a blank page for a while now, trying to figure out how to write a statement of purpose. Many people need to start writing (and keep writing) before knowing exactly what they want to write. Start putting your thoughts down on paper, and you may see patterns and deeper meaning begin to emerge. 7. Be Clear and Concise A statement of purpose is not the place to show off your academic writing chops. You\u2019re not writing long-winded literary fiction or a new philosophy of being. You\u2019re writing a letter to a stranger. You\u2019re trying to communicate a message, efficiently and effectively. 8. Revise The next step after drafting is revising. And revision means more than running spell check. Etymologically, the word revision means \u201cto see again,\u201d and ideally it is a process of more deeply understanding your own writing\u2014maybe even more deeply understanding your past, or your goals for the future. It helps to allow a week or two between drafts, so that you really have time to get some distance from your statement. 9. Proofread Once you\u2019ve written an exploratory draft and made the changes that meaningful revision calls for, it\u2019s time to turn your attention to the details. Admissions officers are unlikely to throw out your statement of purpose if you misspell a word or misplace a comma, but they certainly won\u2019t be impressed. 10. Have Someone Review It Once you feel like you\u2019ve written the best statement of purpose you can, it\u2019s time to get a second opinion. It\u2019s best to ask someone who has been through grad school or worked in the education field, as they\u2019ll have a sense of what you\u2019re going through, as well as what you\u2019re aiming for. An objective set of eyes can often alert you to details you might miss on your own. Even if your reviewer doesn\u2019t recommend any changes, his or her vote of confidence will help you feel better about the application process while you wait to hear back from schools. Regards. ",
