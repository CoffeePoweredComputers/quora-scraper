            "answer_text": "Thanks from A2A. Its a million dollar question!! As I am from GLIM, the answer would be skewed towards my institute. Better take the opinion of TAPMI student before deciding. Many of my batch mates converted both GLIM and TAPMI. The reason why they chose GLIM is because of following reasons. Strength: TAPMI has over 400 odd students for their 2 year program. Here, its 120. So, lower the strength better the resources/student ratio. This offers good opportunities to fewer students.Faculty: We literally have legends roaming around the campus. Just go through the faculty directory of GLIM and you would never want to miss an opportunity to meet them.Campus and facilities: Its a platinum rated Green Campus. You could just feel the peace and tranquility over here. Hostel and food are maintained by Sodexo. So there is never a problem.Opportunities for freshers: There is a cap of work experience of 2 years. So, you would be competing with the equals. Whereas in TAPMI your competitors can be anyone(say for ex, person with 4 years of work ex is preferred over a fresher).Finally, we have good summer internships from top notch companies. The results will be uploaded on the site soon ",
