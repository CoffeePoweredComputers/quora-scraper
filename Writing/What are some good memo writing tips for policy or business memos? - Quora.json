            "answer_text": "A memo is used for internal communications regarding procedures or official business within an organization. In order to write a well-written memo, you should follow certain criteria. Memos are characterized by being brief, direct, and easy to navigate. They are less formal than letters but should maintain a professional, succinct style. Often, the purpose of a business memo is twofold: to identify a problem and propose a solution. Other times, memos may provide or request factual information. ",
