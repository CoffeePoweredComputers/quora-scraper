            "answer_text": "It depends on what kind of poem, the purpose of the critique, and who you are critiquing it for. If it is a published poem you are critiquing for content, then treat it as prose, look at story line, conveyance of meaning, etc. If it is an unpublished poem you are critiquing for another writer, then you also might want to talk about form\u2026does the free verse flow, or does the rhyimg poem have a good rhythm and logical word order, etc. For example, in a rhyming verse, I might talk about extra syllables in a line, or near-rhymes. Or whether it tells a story, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "A few questions to keep in mind when reading poetry: How well does it convey emotion or provoke your thinking?Is it rich with metaphors, similes and other figurative language?How well does it flow? Is it confusing?Is there a theme or is it many ideas put together?When writing out your critique, make sure you are clear and detailed. Say exactly why it made you think or why it made you feel a certain emotion. And make sure to use examples from the poem to show what you mean. ",
