            "answer_text": "Writing a research proposal is not a 1 or 2-day task, it takes a lot of time, patience and focus. Before start writing a proposal, you need to do a list of things: 1. Develop Research ideas: Figure out which part of your subject you like the most and then do a lot of reading about it. There must be a lot of facts which are not known about the field, there would be a lot of questions not answered until now and by entering into the research field, you have a chance to answer them, to do some new inventions. Try to go deep into the topic, ask many questions like \u201cwhat\u201d \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d. When you will seriously ask these questions to yourself and to the scientific community, you will come up with a lot of questions and these questions are going to form the basis of your proposal. List out all these questions and simultaneously review the literature to make sure that these questions are not already answered by someone else. If it is so, do not get disappointed, a lot more is required to be done and you can surely give your contribution, you just have to \u201cthink more\u201d and \u201cthink smart\u201d. When you are done with reading a lot of research papers and articles related to your topic, you must be having a few questions in your hand that has not been answered until now and once answered, can revolutionize your field. 2. Research Output: The most important part of the research is the \u201coutput\u201d, what are you expecting out of this work. How can your research benefit the scientific community, industries, and common people? If you have a clear goal about why you want to do this and what change it can bring, trust me there is a high chance that you will get funds to accomplish your work. 3. Talk to your supervisor: If you are interested in the research field, you should have a mentor who can guide you with your work. If you still do not have found one, please look for someone who is doing good work in your field of interest and ask them to supervise you. Once you have a supervisor and research ideas with you, discuss them with your mentor, mentors usually feel very good when students come up with their own ideas and show interest in their work. Actually your supervisor will give a real picture of your ideas, sometimes we, as students think too broad which is usually not possible at the practical level with limited resources, so when you will tell your guide, you want to do this or that, they will be able to tell you if that would be possible or not. Do not get disappointed if your supervisor does not agree with you on your ideas, they obviously know better than you and would not like you to get stuck with your research in between. 4. Workout the methodology: A research is meant successful only when it is proved scientifically otherwise your ideas remain ideas. So, now when you have research questions in hand, try to figure out how can you answer them practically, which current methodology can you use to prove your point. For this, you can refer to already published research papers and can also discuss with your supervisor and seniors in the field. Once you have done this much of preliminary work, you are ready to give a written form to your ideas. Here\u2019s how you can write a formal research proposal: 1. Title: One of the most important decision-makers about your application is the \u201cTitle\u201d of your proposal. Ideally, it should be short (maximum 5-7 words), broad (not too specific), catchy and understandable to the layman. It should immediately catch the attention of the reviewers and they should get interested in reading your proposal further. It\u2019s good to think about the title when you are done with the rest of the writing. 2. Abstract: Try to write a very simple paragraph giving an overview of \u201cwhat this proposal is all about\u201d. Do not include all the technical details of your study in the abstract, try to make it as simple as possible, but at the same time do not forget to mention: 1. What this project is about 2. What is your objective 3. How this project is going to benefit the scientific community, industries and common people 3. Introduction and Problem Statement: Introduce your topic in simple terms and talk about the facts related to your project. Talk about what has been done and what needs to be taken into consideration now. Then talk about your aim related to the project, what is your main objective, what do you want to prove and how your study is exclusive, what makes it different from what others are doing, remember, the more you will be creative, the more you will gain. 4. Hypothesis and Objectives: In the research field, it is important to develop a hypothesis, it is nothing but your assumptions related to your work which you call \u201cHypothesis\u201d in scientific terms. It is important to mention in your proposal that what are you expecting out of this work, what could be the end result? Then, also talk about the objectives of your study, what are the questions you are going to answer in this project. It is good to describe the objectives briefly by giving a suitable heading. You can also add relevant data (some preliminary work) and pictures supporting your hypothesis. 5. Research Methodology: Again mention your objectives, this time talking about how are you going to answer these questions practically? Which research methodologies are you going to use and why? Which experiments are you going to conduct in order to prove your point? Do not make it too lengthy. Again, try to add some relevant data in the form of pictures, tables, figures, graphs, etc. 6. Expected results and output of the study: Mention, what are the possible outcomes of your study. Again, briefly highlight the main results you are expecting out of this study and how you study is special and can help in adding knowledge to the scientific world. 7. Bibliography: It is very important to give recognition to other\u2019s work. Add references using EndNote or manual method. Try to mention as many references as possible. It shows that you have done an extensive study before writing the project. Also, keep in mind the page limit and word limit. Most funding agencies need complete project in 6-10 pages. Write accordingly and also follow the format, if specified by them, otherwise, use the standard one. ",

            "answer_text": "A research proposal is generally seeking a grant or funds for carrying out a defined piece of work, which have a certain amount of research. Unlike commercial proposal where products or services are offered described stating everything about the offer, the legal terms, commercial terms and what is being offered and how it will be useful. Again, a large number of commercial proposals are in response to a request for a proposal or an invitation to bid or response to a tender released by the buyer. Research proposals are sometimes in response to encourage research or scholarly work, but more often seeking funds or support for continuing its work. The important components of a research proposal are: 1. Title (the title should be evocative, stating the work and why it is being presented. It should be brief, say in a maximum of 15 words, which is bigger than a commercial proposal) 2. Introduction (stating how this proposal came about, its need, the target industries/users/researchers and similar bodies who would like such a research and its findings, why this is chosen, mentioning the researcher\u2019s previous works connected to this work) 3. Literature Review (a detail of what is available and where it has been used and results as known by significant reports in journals and magazines, including patients if any; a list of possible users \u2013 individuals, groups, companies and governments may be mentioned) 4. Aims and Objectives (it\u2019s about benefits \u2013 who will benefit and why, include industries, representative companies or government; the researchers or the proposal caretakers interest, previous work done in this area, and how it could be commercialised; how will the outcomes be used or further researched and how commercial spinoffs, if any, handled) 5. Methodology (a brief description of the methodology proposed to be used; terms of reference) 6. Scope of Research (putting structures on research i.e. what is within and outside the scope of this research) 7. Outline and Timetable (describe each phase or part of work stating resources required, their acquisition and time period, It should fit with the terms of reference) 8. Funding (required and payments required along with amounts and time periods) Credentials (brief biodata of researchers or organization, emphasizing on previous researchers) Please use tables, charts, references, diagrams as and when possible. List the equipments you will use and access you have to some of these. Your guide etc. should be mentioned. Good luck, make one to suit your requirements. ",
