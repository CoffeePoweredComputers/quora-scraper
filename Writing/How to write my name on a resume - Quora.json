Companies want diversity and they want it now to stay relevant . So if your name is Jill great . If your name is LaTecia great as well . Using your own name can often help you stand out . But if you want to play it safe to get a call back try using your real name with a Capital before your preferred office or working name . Example Sample Name : Tyrell Winston Powers might become T. Winston Powers on his resume . It is for sure just fine to use your middle name as well. So step out with your name as you were named or use your middle name as an added twist ! ",
