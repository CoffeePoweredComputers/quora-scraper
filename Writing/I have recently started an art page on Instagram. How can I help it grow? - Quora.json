And now not difficult to grow up his work online coz many platforms are available in modern-day. So, I am answering this good question coz I have faced the same problem when I have started my channel on art. I researched social media sites after that I found some solutions or points to share with you. If you are talented no one can stop you but yes some hurdles are coming on the way to success.Never Give Up (keep fit them three words in your mind).Do regular artwork and post them to social media. Whatever the art you do.Don't go for shortcuts to achieve success. shortcuts give you some good luck but it's for a short time coz it's a shortcut.Hard work is the key to success But like-minded people always do smart work. So in this era be smart.Instagram is a good platform, follow these steps.when you post your pics keep thinks in mind the quality of pics should be great.The decent background should be used at the time pic click.write some relevant lines abt your pic to describe it.do quality #hashtag to your pics to approach peoples on Instagram.Finally, if someone has the interest to follow you then you should follow back.Hope it will help Follow me pls ",
