            "answer_text": "You sit in front of the computer and start. If you have a few ideas beforehand, that's great. If you don't, sit and wait. Most probably, ideas will come. The real proof will be when you write, \u2018The End'. If that never happens, probably you can't write a book. It requires stamina, determination and faith in yourself. Besides, you should love doing it. But books were born for so many reasons. If you want to do it, why not. Not for its own sake but because you want to tell something to people, you want to share joy, sadness, trauma, success. Something. Good luck. ",
