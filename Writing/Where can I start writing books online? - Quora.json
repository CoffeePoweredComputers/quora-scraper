            "answer_text": "That's a great idea. That way you'll get regular feedback from your readers and the accountability will make you write regularly. Start a Blog. You can very well start a Wordpress, Quora, Tumblr or Blogspot blog and start publishing your stories. But in this case, you'll have to work on the design(selecting a good theme etc), marketing, SEO etc. Specialized Platforms. A better way would be to choose from a bunch of platforms that are meant for writing fiction online. They already have a network of readers and writers interested in a specific form of writing and you'll also be able to get quality feedback from your peers. No fretting about the design or driving traffic to your stories. The sites best fitting your requirement are as follows -  Write On by Kindle - A social network of sorts that allows writers to share their finished or in-progress works with readers and solicit feedback on plots or ask for help with grammar or research. Tablo.io - Very similar to 'Write On' but looks better, and if you decide to publish your book to any ebook stores like Kindle, Apple Books etc, you can do that easily with tablo.Wattpad - Wattpad is also a community of readers and writers. It seems to be the most popular of the lot and the user engagement also seems better.Channillo - Specifically for writing serial stories. Unlike other options on this list Channillo requires you to purchase a subscription and you also need to get accepted as a writer to start publishing. You have to pitch them your series idea while applying to be a writer. Subscriptions start at $5/month. If your series gets accepted you're paid 80% of the revenue generated by your series.Inklewriter - This one lets you write interactive stories. As in, the story advances and changes based on user input. Example - http://writer.inklestudios.com/stories/musgraveritual Storybird - Storybird lets anyone make visual stories. They curate artwork from illustrators and animators around the world and writers use them in their stories. More suited if you want to write graphic novels or children's books.Figment - I loved the name of this one. Imaginative. It has the same core concept but is relatively less popular. A distinguishing feature is the frequent contests and the feedback on stories seems more in-depth.Medium - You probably already know this one. Its a publishing platform known for longform content. You could start writing your series as a Publication on Medium. Their collaboration and commenting systems[1] are outstanding. You have a better chance of getting widespread recognition here.Footnotes[1] Read Insightful Longform Articles On Medium | loggd.in",

            "answer_text": "I know of a couple of authors who basically wrote their book online. One author wrote a chapter at a time online and had readers give her feedback. Once she was finished, she had the book published. Her response to this process was that she would never write another book this way every again - and she hasn't. The comments and criticisms she received were non-professional, (negative criticisms of what she was writing, why she was writing it, what she should have been writing instead). She has since published a couple more books through the traditional publishing model. Other authors I know wrote blogs, on Wordpress or other platforms. They then took their most popular blog posts and turned them into popular, high-selling books. This process took a while to do, but as these authors were also online entrepreneurs, they were able to attract audiences for their blog, for their other products, as well as an audience for their book. So it is possible to write a book online as you suggest. ow you choose to write your book online, and where you choose to write your book online, will depend on why you want to write your book online. What outcome are you after by writing a book this way? ",
