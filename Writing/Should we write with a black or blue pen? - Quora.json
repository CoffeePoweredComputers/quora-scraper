            "answer_text": "No? I write almost exclusively with red pens. Specifically, the really cheap ones you can buy 12/$1 at Wal-Mart or the dollar store.  Behold the mighty Grader of Midterms! Behold!! One day in high school, I picked up a red pen from the sidewalk. That was how I \u201cbought\u201d pens in high school (and still, in college)- scavenging the ones that fall out of backpacks, or that people leave behind. Later that day, I found two more. I just kept them. They were free, and my black pens were all dried out, as were my two blue pens. Nobody said I couldn\u2019t write in red ink. At least, not often. So I just kept using them, and when they gave out/I inevitably lost them, I bought more. With money, this time. I\u2019m sure I caused some teachers (and am causing some professors) undue stress and headaches. But it certainly makes it easy for them to identify my papers at a glance (that and the abominable handwriting. The red ink is hardly noticeable compared to that) I like to think it\u2019s a bit of a trademark at this point. My Theory I/II professor hated it. She hated me using pens to begin with, and she hated that I didn\u2019t even use normal black ink. The nerve! I was a rebel. Eventually she gave up. They always do. I suppose when I don\u2019t have any red pens, or when I\u2019m drawing, I use black ink, though. Not so much blue, anymore, I stopped using them as much in middle school. EDIT: Actually, now that I remember this answer, it seems my pen color preference has shifted again. For the past year or so now, I\u2019ve been using almost exclusively pink pens, since sets of multi-colored pens are a few cents cheaper than sets of all red pens. And of the multi-colored pens, pink just looks the best. ",

            "answer_text": "I had this conundrum of the choice of the ink for a pen for a long time. When I was a kid, and was introduced to writing with a pen, I remember correctly I started off with blue ink. In fact, and this may seem hysterical, but the reason why blue ink was preferred by most of my classmates was that it was somewhat less expensive than it\u2019s black counterpart! Listen to this, During my middle school, while completing our homework, we used to write the things which require less ink with the black one (like questions, headings) and the details with the blue ink (I know! strange right..!). Now, being a thinker as I am, I deduced the logic for the above at that time to the following. Blue ink is generally made from indigo and the black one from charcoal (or what used to be the trend at that time) with the former being a renewable resource and the latter being a non-renewable one; leading to the increased cost of the black ink (Sweet!) However, with the introduction of mass production of ball point pen and the diminishing gap between the cost of the blue and the black ink, the choice of the ink became round-robin. Currently, I write in the black ink, majorly due to its increased contrast on white paper.
