            "answer_text": "I love numbers. I believe numbers guide the Universe, they measure the Universe in a comprehensible way for us, humans, to understand it all. See\u2026 There\u2019s ONE individual first. The Universe is one individual only. I am one individual other. Yeah, there is an infinite of individual others. So, one infinite from the first Foton drives itself in four directions horizontally adding one Foton at a time, infinite as the infinite number of integer numbers themselves. The same Foton drives itself in four other directions, adding one photon at a time, infinite as the infinite number of integer numbers themselves and vertically. There is another infinite between the eight encounters and they be counted as the infinite of prime numbers only, and they will be as same, as the infinities all, as well as we can understand that: The infinite numbers are equal to the infinite odd numbers and also equal to the sum of the infinite pairs to the infinite odds but we all know that the infinite of odd numbers is ONE number longer than the infinite of pairs, since the zero is not considered a real number. We may conclude, from the light of that infinities, that the infinite number of numbers is precisely the same as the infinite odd numbers as identical to the infinite of primes, but we have to agree that among all those four ways to measure the same line, the infinite number of primes have one only pair among them, and that suggesting that the infinite of odds is higher than the infinite primes by the same number of infinite pairs. With that in mind, I was able to convince myself that light draw a pyramid in the flat base, and it elevated itself on the dot, spot, photon, higher \u2026 So, because of this, there\u2019s light all over from all horizontal sides, and there is this light a lot higher, we have two eyes, to see wider, and one the only direction to move: straight and ahead, from birth to freedom\u2026 of our souls, indeed, from the matter. We are not the matter, we\u2019re light, power, flower, energy, moving our bodies. Four infinities persuaded me. Do they the same to you? Pleeeeeeaase\u2026.\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 ",
