            "answer_text": "If there was a universal line for every essay, the earth wouldn't need writers. If there were things as opening lines befitting every essay, the poets would find themselves robbed. Not only are there different types of essays but also topics mainstream and sub-stream to that essay so here goes- For a conversational essay - As long as I follow Amy's conversational leads, we are friends. She chats in her animated way about her life and petty grievances while I show concern, empathy and drop in helpful suggestions. But no sooner have I changed track she's fidgeting and her eyes keep flicking to her phone. Already her attention span has gone and I might as well be talking to the wall. My flow dies in my throat as I watch her face sag into boredom, then in the second that the air is empty she starts talking about her life again. By the end of her visit my thoughts and feelings are so compacted I feel like my chest will go super nova... For a descriptive essay- Upon newly green wings comes the season of spring, freed at last from winter's cocoon.To each great song are opening notes, signifying marvels to come for ears and soul. And so it the same with the season of spring, its greatness declared by the first glimmers of green. And so we enter the season of spring, when the earth opens up nature's treasure chest. The raindrops let the light of the sun pass through them and they reflect it too, yet on this rain-calmed day my imagination takes a leap further. What if the raindrops became the most perfect of greens? What if they could pause mid-flight, as if in a three dimensional photograph? What if in each one was perfectly reflected the creation that is all around? Would we then see the raindrops and nature as the marvel they are instead of as some background we ignore while contemplating things that really matter far less? For an argumentative essay- If a creative solution to integrate any two ideas is possible, then they are not mutually exclusive by definition and any argument treating them as opposing 'truths' is redundant. There comes a time when \"pushing\" one's ideas that could save our world becomes morally the right thing to do. And so, if you have the time, I urge you to \u2026 For a narrative essay- He had found it impossible to talk with Elizabeth in the way he had expected to talk to her, and he was so out of sorts that he could not talk to Miss Masters, though that maiden aristocrat of advancing years, strangely stimulated by his presence, seemed efficient enough to do all the talking herself. For a mystery /short story- From nowhere came the sound of an old fashioned telephone, so authentic that Livvy scanned the room for an antique, something that wouldn't look out of place in an old movie. She moved around the room, her quiet steps lost under the din. Behind her was a trail of disturbance in the dust; small plumes of particles erupting like mini mushroom clouds. After a few moments she stopped at the heavy wooden table and slid her hand underneath - there was something taped there in plastic. Livvy ducked down, peeling away fresh duct tape to release the package, still ringing. It was a cell phone, the latest model, the size and shape of an old fashioned credit card in the days before everything was put on the phones. She ripped the bag with her incisors and pulled it out. Like all phones now it was voice activated, in theory, there was no way it would respond to her. \"Hello,\" she said. The ringing stopped... ",

            "answer_text": "You seem to be looking for some formula. Sorry, there is no such thing. What\u2019s the essay about? Is there scope for humor? I believe most topics do offer some scope for humor, but discretion is the keyword. What is the point of the essay? What message is it trying to convey? Different contexts may necessitate different approaches. Whatever the answers to these questions, here is a recommended 3 step process for essays: tell your audience what you are going to tell them (introduction)tell your audience what you write the essay to tell them (meat of the matter)tell your audience what you told them (wrap up)Your question, of course, relates to the first part, the introduction. Tell your audience what you are going to write about. Give an inkling of what your particular slant on the topic is and why you think it is important. Even better, ask a (rhetorical) question that you will answer later. I repeat, humor helps. To what extent depends on the topic and the audience. ",
