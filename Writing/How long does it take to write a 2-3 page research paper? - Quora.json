            "answer_text": "after ten years of writing a back page humor column, i went from spending five evenings on it to sitting down with no topic and hitting \u201csend\u201d to an edited version one hour later. the column started out to be 1100 words, then shrank to 750 words because of changes in page graphics and layout. i had to write something topical about electronic communications\u2014and funny! if i would have had to research some subject and avoid humor, i probably would have spent an hour on research and another hour writing and editing. the main difference is that i had complete confidence in my ability. no agonizing, worrying. that is a huge advantage over a college student. of course, i didn\u2019t need citations, either. in the beginning, years before this column, i agonized, tried to be clever, edited before finishing, worried that my writing sucked (often, it did). this was before i had the marvelous ego boost of nailing a half-page humorous op-ed in a regional sunday paper. from then on, i had confidence. for the second ten years on that column, i kept to my one hour timeframe. i almost never had an idea what my topic would be. even when i approached the keyboard with an idea in my head, it still took an hour. i forget how many words fill 2\u20133 pages, double-spaced with margins. maybe a thousand. i normally wrote without concern over the length, and often wrote a thousand words and had to trim 250 words. it helped that i touch type at about 100 wpm on a computer keyboard. practice writing and editing until you are confident in your work. from there on in, it gets really easy.

            "answer_text": "Let me explain this giving an example, nay a story. Once there lived a poor man (scene set during British era in India). English were very keen on making Indians learn their language. One day, an Englishman asked the villagers to write an essay on Taj Mahal. They were told to include their name and how much time they took to complete it. People started getting frenzy; they just wanted to impress this Englishman, as his beloved was a lovely, pretty lady (men will be men). Some people submitted their essays quickly, just to impress this mylady, while others took their time, a alot of it. Some came with tens and tens of pages. Alas, all the villagers submitted their essays. The essays were read by the Englishman and his wife. The man and his wife read few and started getting irritated. There were patches of dung all over the page, sweat patches on every alternate paragraphs, and what not. After hours and hours of evaluating, they happened to read the shortest of all the essays. It was nothing more than a one-liner. It read: It's a mass of tears! The story goes on, but the point here is, it's about the content that you should be worried about, rather than getting all frenzy over how much time would it take for you to write x number of pages. Of course I could've just written the point straightaway, but, you see, I have had ample time to kill. And, yes, it depends upon the area of your study, your presentation, your rebuttal to contrasting aspects related to your study, etc. Point being, research a lot before actually getting down to write. Trust me, not only it will help you get a clear picture about your draft/manuscript, but it will also help you move quickly from one concept to another. ",
