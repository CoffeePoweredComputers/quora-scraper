            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a current senior at Phillips Exeter Academy. I\u2019m not sure if these pieces of advice would be relevant across the range of boarding schools, but this is the advice that I would give to someone coming into Exeter. Hopefully you could use it wherever you end up. Firstly, go to club night. At Exeter, there\u2019s a club night one of the first weekends of fall term. If you miss that, it\u2019s tough to know who to contact if you want to join clubs in the future, especially if you\u2019re new. I missed club night and it took me a week and a half to track down the names and emails of the co-heads of the clubs I wanted to join. Clubs are essential for not being bored out of your mind on the weekend and having several circles of friends with similar interests. Also, sign up for 15 clubs. Go to a bunch of first meetings, and then choose 3\u20134 that you want to dedicate your time too. Who knows, you might uncover a secret passion of yours. Secondly, go to the meet and greets. Exeter has several meet and greets for new studentsThey are essential for getting an initial group of acquaintances. When you\u2019re new, boarding school can be daunting. You\u2019ve got your roommate, the people in your dorm, and maybe the people in your classes or sports team. You might feel like you don\u2019t know anyone\u2026 because you don\u2019t. But that\u2019s fine. Clubs will help with that, but meet and greets are essential to getting those first few friends that you can recognize and sit with at the dining hall. Thirdly, stay up late. Maybe even pull a few all-nighters. I\u2019m serious. Learn how to stay up until 3 without falling asleep. Consistently. Obviously you shouldn\u2019t do it during the school week. You should go to bed at a decent time Monday-Thursday. Be healthy. But the weekend? You\u2019re free. Some of the greatest memories in my years of Exeter have been staying up untill 5:00 am on a Saturday morning with my best friends and then running to mcdonalds in the snow. Those are the moments that will make your time at boarding school worth it. Fourthly, on a more serious note, don\u2019t be afraid to go to people and ask for help. Boarding school can be tough. There will be times that you\u2019ll be stressed out, homesick, heartbroken, and depressed. It happens. It\u2019s high school. And if you don\u2019t have your family or friends from home to support you, it can be very difficult. Although going to a teacher or counselor might be intimidating, it\u2019s vital to find a friend to go to in times of need. It could be your roommate or someone in your dorm or someone on your sports team, but whoever it is, it\u2019s crucial that you find a crutch to lean on. What\u2019s comforting is that they\u2019re most likely suffering from the same stuff that you might be dealing with, so you and that close friend could help each other through the tough times of a boarding school life. Boarding school was the greatest decision of my life so far. Whether it\u2019s building a six-foot tall snowman in the dead of winter or losing our dorm stove privileges because we burnt some ramen and caused a fire alarm at 2 am on a school night, I\u2019ll carry with me those friendships and memories for the rest of my life. You\u2019re about to engage in a fantastic adventure. You\u2019re going to grow so much and learn so much, so live in the moment, make some great friendships, join some great clubs and learn learn learn learn. These are the days that we\u2019re both going to look back on and say, \u201cThose were the good old days.\u201d Don\u2019t let them slip away. Good Luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the best suggestion is to keep being you! I started attending a boarding school at the age of 16. At first, I had problems fitting in. The most popular people treat people most badly. Without parents constraining them (In most cases without knowing their behaviors at school), the students gain popularity by drinking alcohol and taking drugs. I\u2019ve seen some people changed. In order to fit in. they buy replica shoes and puke (because of alcohol) as much as they can as if it is the only criterion to integrate into this society. But eventually, they\u2019ll get nothing except falling notes and bad reputations. I\u2019ve also got to know some interesting people in the school, though they are not the so-called mainstream, I had a happy time with them! ",

            "answer_text": "These 5 things: 1. Be grateful. Many students wish they had the resources to be at a boarding school. It is an impossibility for most. You are lucky. Remember that. 2. Remember that you become like the 5 people with whom you spend most of your time. Choose wisely. 3. Keep in touch with your family and share your ups and downs as often as possible. Don\u2019t isolate yourself; they love you. Keep in touch with school counselors, too. The academic pressure is very real; don\u2019t be self-conscious about having a regular sit-down with professionals at the school in order to decompress. 4. Get involved. Find your people - the other students with whom you have things in common. Join stuff. Look into the faces of the other students and smile and say hello each day. 5. Have fun. These should be the best years of your life. Don\u2019t miss chances to make memories, so take those weekend trips! ",

Obviously, you can\u2019t do everything but you can do a lot! Clubs, sports, organizations \u2014 boarding school gives you the unique opportunity to explore a tremendous range of interests that can help guide you in your next steps in life, especially if you\u2019re going to college.
