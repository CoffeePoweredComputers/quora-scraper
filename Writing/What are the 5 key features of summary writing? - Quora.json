            "answer_text": "SIUC Writing Center developed a great cheat sheet. I've read it for you and here is briefly what's there. When you summarize something, you are not merely translating it word for word using synonyms and a thesaurus, but rather reworking the text into a condensed form for later reference. The five key features of summary writing are: Use summaries to communicate the main points of a text. In order to identify the main points, think of your summary as the lead paragraph in a newspaper article: it ought to answer the questions who, what, where, when, why, and how in a general way.Use your own words. Quotations should be employed sparingly, and only in instances where you need to communicate specific phrases used in the original.Keep it short.Write objectively. Summaries should not report your opinion on the matter, but should accurately reflect the author\u2019s ideas and style.Document the publishing information for later reference. You will need it if you wish to cite your summarized research in papers.",
