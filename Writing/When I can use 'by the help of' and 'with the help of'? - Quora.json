            "answer_text": "When I can use \"by the help of\" and \"with the help of\"? It depends on the degree of help you received. When something is done by the help of someone or something else, it implies that you were not able to carry out the task apart from that help. The help is the instrument by which the task was done. On the other hand when something is done with the help of someone or something else, it does not imply that you were incapable of carrying out the task, but that you were assisted in some way; so, perhaps, you acknowledge that you would have found the task a lot harder or been unable to complete it as quickly, or may have lacked the knowledge to do the task well had you not had that assistance. It is assistance given, rather than the instrument by which the task was done. Dative rather than instrumental, if that means anything. ",

It\u2019s similar to a prayer. The task can\u2019t be completed by just anyone and ultimately you are the inferior to this entity. \u2018By the\u2019 is most often used when speaking of the power of a god, the divine authority thought to be given to kings and queens, or the authority bestowed on a holy person by their deity. With the help of means a collaboration by a person of similar standing where by you don\u2019t need to display deference to them, and the task will be easier to accomplish. You still need help, but it\u2019s not moving a mountain, it might be hanging a large awkward picture or moving furniture. ",
