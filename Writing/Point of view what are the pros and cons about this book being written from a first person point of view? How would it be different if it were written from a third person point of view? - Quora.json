            "answer_text": "Starting with the cons of writing from the first person POV, readers feel more connected with and relate themselves to the character. Writing from the first person POV can be a challenge since you have to bring all the characters to life and develop them all through the veiwpoint of just one character. It will be effective if you want a clear hero for your story.But it limits the way your other characters can be understood and perceived. while in the third person POV we get an interesting insight into the thoughts and perceptions of different characters. Third person POV, thus, can provide an additional insight into the story itself. Here the challenge would be to write convincingly about different characters with different and contrasting viewpoints. But that challenge will be advantageous. It helps you transport the reader to another setting and thought perspective. It helps you to provide the readers some information that the main character might not know.What is more important than the POV is how you narrate the story and bring all your characters to life, whether it is through the mind of one character or more than one.
