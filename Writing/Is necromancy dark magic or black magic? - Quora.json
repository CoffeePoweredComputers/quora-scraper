            "answer_text": "I have to agree with Taisiya Summerfield - after reading Harry Potter, and a few other more recent stories, I tend to think of all \u201cnegative magic\u201d as dark magic, rather than \u201cblack magic\u201d Whether it is because I am falling foul of the evil cult of political correctness, or just because the two terms have become synonymous in my mind, I don\u2019t know, but I rarely think of \u201cblack magic\u201d any more (except when I am buying chocolates of course). However - to answer the original question - raising the dead is most definitely dark magic. There are no good reasons for doing it and every instance of it I have seen in books, films and TV shows is generally for dark and evil purposes. ",

            "answer_text": "Neither. Necromancy is actually calling on the spirits of the dead to tell fortunes, to scry the future. Similar to vivimancy, pyromancy, geomancy, hydromancy, chiromancy, etc., all systems for fortune telling. You see necromancy (sort of, apart from TV spiritualists and clairvoyants being almost exclusively bogus) every time a TV clairvoyant goes 'I'm getting a Doris, she passed in the war\u2019, and similar vein. All that raise the dead crap is not necromancy, it is dark magic that has been conflated with necromancy. ",
