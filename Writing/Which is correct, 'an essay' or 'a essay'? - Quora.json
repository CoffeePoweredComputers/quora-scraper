            "answer_text": "The correct answer is \u201can essay\u201d. The reason for using the article \u201can\u201d is that the word starts with a vowel (a,e,i,o,u) so in such cases \u201can\u201d is used in front of the word. We use \u201ca\u201d when the first letter is not a vowel and the pronunciation of the word does not begin with a vowel. ",
