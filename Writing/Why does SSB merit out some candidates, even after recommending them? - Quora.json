            "answer_text": "BECAUSE -SSB recommends everyone they find to be fit to serve defence forces and getting recommended from SSB doesn\u2019t mean you will make it to merit list for sure. There are 2 possible cases bu which you have got call for SSB- If you gave SSB interview after clearing a written examination .In this case, your marks for SSB and your marks for written exam (in ratio of about 60:40, but i am not sure of this ratio) are considered for preparing the final merit list .If you were given a call for SSB Interview on the basis of marks of class 12th/JEE MAINS/B.Tech. ,then, only your SSB marks are considered for preparation of final merit list and merit list is prepared subject to the no. of vacancies available at that particular time and marks of the recommended candidate been put in descending order .There is a difference between getting marks more than passing marks and being amongst the top rankers of the examination which is analogous to RECOMMENDED by SSB and getting your name in the merit list finalised by military HQ (depends truly on the total no. of vacancies available) respectively. RECOMMENDED means you have been found to be fit to serve defence forces (i.e. you passed with certain marks ) and Getting your name on the merit list means you were among the top scorers in SSB(in terms of marks you got in SSB interview) for the particular no. of vacancies available for that entry .

            "answer_text": "You need to first of all understand the selection process. You get SSB either after clearing written exam or direct SSB(for some entries). Now when candidates report at any selcetion broad, SSB tests their abilities and then recommends the ones they think are fit for respective forces. However the board is not responsible for any other process than recommendation (and documentation). After recommendation a candidate has to go through medical board i.e. special, appeal and review as per the need. Now only after medicals, merit is prepared by recruitment branch of that force. The merit is prepared considering the written score(for written exam enteries), SSB score and *most importantly* vacancies. One may even find names of candidates declared unfit at any medical board but Joining Letters are issue to only those candidates, as per vacancies, who were declared fit and have submitted all required documents. So, all in all, SSB doesn't have a say in getting candidates merit out, it only recommends candidates. ",
