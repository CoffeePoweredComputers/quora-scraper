            "answer_text": "Neutrality (the opposite of bias) should be defined first. A media platform is not \u201cneutral\u201d because you can post anything you want. That would qualify Facebook, Google and YouTube as \u201cneutral\u201d. We are aware how these companies rank, recommend and hide your post is a far more important indicator of neutrality; then secondarily the community\u2019s reaction, likes and upvotes contribute to the perception of neutrality, too. No one informed believes these companies are neutral anymore. Facebook\u2019s own founder Mark Zuckerberg admitted to bias and censorship among tech giants before Congress on April 10, 2018, \u201cI understand where that concern is coming from because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an extremely left-leaning place.\u201d Silicon Valley is the ideological ground zero of the most left-leaning state in America. Medium-com is headquartered in Mountain View, the birthplace of the term \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d and Google\u2019s HQ. To avoid guilt by association, I did some test searches on Medium-com. The two main areas of bias for which to test are political and religious. Here are my results. When I search \u201cWhite House\u201d, the top result is \u201cThe Obama White House\u201d. There is no current \u201cWhite House\u201d account such as you would find on Instagram and even Flickr, a relatively small social media. The current administration has no presence on Medium at all. Odd for the most active Presidency on social media.When I search \u201cDonald Trump\u201d, the top 4 suggested accounts are: The Economist, The Washington Post, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and an account with a swear word I\u2019ll omit here. Neutral? Not by a long shot. To my recollection, The Economist has not featured a positive article about Trump since he has been elected. The Washington Post, the media arm of Jeff Besoz\u2019 empire, is Trump\u2019s archenemy, right next to The \u201cFailing\u201d New York Times (as Trump likes to call it). As for Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton being recommended when one searches for \u201cTrump\u201d, well, let\u2019s call it a serious error in algorithm. There seems to be a lack of pro-Trump/ conservative accounts on Medium, or else they don\u2019t show up on search results. Either way is an indication of bias. The above is my search result. What does Medium recommend I read about Trump? I am a Christian evangelical - Medium seems to know that. So here is my suggested reading: The first post is a hit piece on evangelicals dumb enough to support Trump. The third is a promotion of \u201cNon-Trump Evangelicals\u201d. Given a higher percentage of evangelicals voted for Trump than any other Republican President before (some estimate as high as 80%), this promoted post is obviously a minority view, leaning towards anti-Trump, anti-conservative and anti-evangelical. Next, I wanted to look for some good Christian content, as I can easily find by searching on YouTube and Twitter. Here is my recommended reading list from Medium: Needless to say, promoting sexual lifestyles like \u201ctransgenderism\u201d and \u201csapiosexualism\u201d are hallmarks of the radical left. I have no interest in reading about other people\u2019s sex life. You don\u2019t have to be Christian to share my view. Millions of Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and traditionalists find it offensive to have sexualized content publicly pushed by a media platform. On what basis is Medium recommending this to us? I decided to go to the home page of Medium on my mobile phone. Here is the recommended reading list: The top recommended is a post attacking men, another characteristic of left-leaning \u201cconversations\u201d. Imagine an anti-feminist/ pro-masculine post being top of the recommended reading on Medium? No, I cannot either. The next recommended reading is a post normalizing swearing by a \u201cyoung minister\u201d. Whether it\u2019s \u201cradical\u201d or not is for you to decide, but this is leaning anti-conservative and anti-traditional. I know non-religious, conservative people who would never swear in private, much less in church. The third article Medium recommended to a Christian based on his \u201creading history\u201d (I read nothing to indicate I want to be recommended this tripe) is about \u201cavoiding the either/or trap: lessons learned losing my religion\u201d. As someone who came from a family of Buddhists, Catholics, Methodists and Muslims (see my book \u201cFrom Buddha to Jesus\u201d), I find another post about \u201crelativism\u201d boring and the title provocative only to be clickbait. There\u2019s nothing new, fresh or interesting about a Westerner promoting \u201crelativistic\u201d values. It\u2019s the group think, dominant culture. You would have to have a wider frame of reference, a greater grasp of absolutist value systems as believed and practiced worldwide, before you can make an interesting claim of having \u201clost\u201d something opposite to greyish relativism. When I accepted Jesus for whom He says He is, I did not lose any of my family or religious background, I gained personal forgiveness of sins and a relationship with the Creator who is both absolutist sometimes and relativist sometimes. This surrender to His ways, not my own opinions, is the beginning of being Christian. Medium does not pass the test of neutrality in my limited search for political and religious content. When a company ranks and recommends one political or religious ideology consistently above another, it is biased. Yes, you can post anything you want about Donald Trump and Christianity, but the staff of Medium will rarely recommend a traditional viewpoint and the reaction of the community will not be many \u201cclaps\u201d (Medium\u2019s version of likes or upvotes).  You can find me contributing alternative views to the recommended reading on Medium, on NewsWars, and on my personal blog. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is what Media Bias/Fact Check - Search and Learn the Bias of News Media has to say about them: LEFT-CENTER BIAS These media sources have a slight to moderate liberal bias. They often publish factual information that utilizes loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes) to favor liberal causes. These sources are generally trustworthy for information, but may require further investigation. See all Left-Center sources. Overall, we rate Medium Left-Center biased based on story selection that moderately favors the left and Mixed for factual reporting due to a lack of sourcing and some articles that promote conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. Detailed Report Factual Reporting: MIXED Country: USA World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180 History Founded in 2012, Medium is an online publishing platform developed by Twitter co-founder Evan Williams. Medium considers their platform as social journalism, having a hybrid collection of amateur and professional people and publications, or exclusive blogs or publishers. Basically, they are a blog host. Funded by / Ownership Medium is owned by the A Medium Corporation. Funding is derived from users subscriptions for a monthly or yearly fee of $5 or $50, respectively. Analysis / Bias In review, Medium has a variety of writers from many different political perspectives. Therefore, the only way to check for bias is by sampling a variety of recently published articles. We chose the politics category as our gauge for bias. We sampled 25 top stories in their political section and found that 19 out of 25 or 76% leaned left. That doesn\u2019t mean it represents the entirety of the site, but does indicate that more stories come from a left leaning perspective. We also searched for stories that promote conspiracy theories and pseudoscience. We found most were scientifically sound, however their were some that presented anti-vaccination and GMO positions as well as human influenced climate change denial, geoengineering via chemtrails and false flag operations. Lastly, because Medium publishes a wide variety of sources, there are times that they fail fact checks. Again, this is not Medium\u2019s fault. They simply are the \u201cmedium\u201d for a variety of sources, some of which may not be factual. In general, Medium provides a mixed bag of stories that lean left, with some that lack evidence and sourcing. Overall, we rate Medium Left-Center biased based on story selection that moderately favors the left and Mixed for factual reporting due to a lack of sourcing and some articles that promote conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
