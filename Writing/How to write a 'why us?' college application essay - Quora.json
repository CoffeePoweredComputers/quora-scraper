            "answer_text": "Find out what it is that the particular college is offering by way of courses of study in the major sequence you wish to pursue. What do that offer that makes you want to study there? Do they have a particular focus that attracts you to them? Do they have a history or reputation for excellence in your chosen field of study? What is the culture of the college? How do they present themselves to the public? What have their contributions to industry, research, education, and society been? How have they earned their reputation? Why does it matter to you? How do you expect that people who learn that you attended that college will react to the news that you were a student there? Will they think you must have worked hard to earn your degree? Will they want to hire you? Will they expect you to know things that make a difference to them? If you are applying to colleges and thinking about writing your essays for them, you should stop to consider the value of doing this research as much as you would commit the time and energy to any other research that you would do in order to write a good essay. Read the college\u2019s website. Look at student comments and look for the student section for indications of social and cultural climates. Look at their awards and the recognition they have received. Look at what they brag about and what makes them proud of who and what they are. These things will tell you if you want to be one of them. Also, consider what you will bring to being a student at that college and include that in your essay. Failing to mention that will hurt your chances of being accepted by them. What contributions will you make to their programs other than to take up space as another body? Will you bring your sports background to their teams, your academic achievements to their research, your social concerns to their programs, or what? If a college is only interested in your potential to pay your tuition, there is not much to tell them. If they really want to know why you chose them, it should be because they have something specific that you want out of the experience of attending that college and they cannot guess what that is unless you tell them about it. Remember that there is life after college. How will your history of having been a student there influence the quality of your life after you leave? They want to know that you perceive a difference and that is why you applied to them. ",

            "answer_text": "The trick is, you don\u2019t write about the school. You write about yourself. You\u2019re not going to \u201cshow you\u2019ve done your research\u201d by regurgitating boring stuff they already know about their small class sizes and overseas studies opportunities. You\u2019re just going to put them to sleep. Instead, think of the amazing things about you that they don\u2019t already know from your personal statement, then connect that to the school you\u2019re applying to. For example, here\u2019s a sample essay from How to Write Your Supplemental Essay About Brown's Open Curriculum\u201d \u201cEva, you\u2019d make the best surgeon! I can always see your tips!\u201d Only the rarest compliment makes me blush\u2014but coming from Dr. Moranto, a retired physician whose insights about Medicare, bioethics, and preventative medicine keep me lingering in his classroom long after AP Biology ends, my cheeks vasodilate the color of the liver I just excised. Moving to the gizzard, I ask about cross-species virus transmission\u2014which extends into lunch, and ends with a surprising declaration: \u201cMore than anything else, human history has been shaped by mosquitoes.\u201d I rejected this, so he recommended some extracurricular reading: The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator. Despite the word \u201cHistory\u201d in the title, I assumed the book was scientific\u2014it\u2019s about Culicidae, after all, and was recommended by a biologist. And yet\u2026 the book was about every class I\u2019ve taken. Learning how classicists collaborated with pathophysiologists to uncover malaria in ancient texts\u2014how Alexander the Great was posthumously diagnosed\u2014I saw new usefulness in the \u201cdead\u201d languages I study. Seeing how mosquitoes shaped Judaism, early Christianity, and the spread of Islam, I had to rethink everything I thought I learned in Old Testament. Mapping outbreaks to trade routes and commerce, I saw my cost-benefit analyses from Business Principles through a new lens. Understanding how hurricanes cause explosions in pest populations, I realized how farmers continue struggling long after initial storm damage\u2014suddenly, AP Economics felt wildly oversimplified. These conversations. This book. That is why I crave Brown\u2019s Open Curriculum: not only to actively design my course, but also to learn from students and professors in completely different fields. I want to collaborate in ways I can\u2019t currently imagine, with people whose only shared trait with me is our deadliest predator. This is way better than an essay that basically says: I am eager to attend Brown because I want the freedom and flexibility to explore my true passions. Open Curriculum lets students chart their own course and follow their interests, and I am looking forward to the chance to take classes in different departments, from Professor Blablabla\u2019s Applied Mathematics to Professor BlaBla\u2019s Criminal Justice in the Digital Era. See how the one is interesting and the other is boring? ",
