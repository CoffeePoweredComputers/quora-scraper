            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve only written about 255 business plans so I may not be as qualified as some others. When someone tells you they are going to write you a plan for $799, you are getting a 7\u201311 plan, with gas pumps (without is $599) written overseas, modified to suit your business. So you may have a child care business, but the cost of a Twinkie may still accidentally show up in your plan. To do a decent job, I estimate one hour per page of text (~350 words) plus 2 to 4 hours per page of financials, depending upon the business model. I do a lot of subscription business work, so I know how long this will take. At $60 to $70/hr. plus research time, you can figure $2600 to $4000 for most custom written plans. There\u2019s always the 7\u201311 plan for those looking for useless but cheap. BTW - Some guy advertised on Craigslist the other day he needed a restaurant plan in New York City but would only pay $300 for the plan. So he\u2019s going to spend $200,000 to maybe $750,000 or more to build a restaurant and he\u2019s only capable of paying $300. I wonder what he\u2019s planning to use that plan for? ",

            "answer_text": "I've written business plans for a range of businesses, including an organic grocer looking to expand, a construction company apartment project, a medical device start up, a veterinary medical imaging center, etc  The time required to write a business plan varies widely with the type of business, the industry, and the purpose of the plan (raising initial capital, special projects, restructuring, etc).  The first thing a business plan writer is going to want to do before quoting you a price is to estimate the time required to research the industry, market, competition, and do the actual writing ( it's 80% research/ 20% writing).  However, it is impossible to do so given the limited information in your original question.  If you would like, you can PM me with more details and I should be able to give you a ball-park range.

Having someone write it for you is creating some distance, however small, between what is in your head and what lands on the page. As a business consultant, if someone tells me that it was written for them, I have immediate pause. You need to be \u201call in\u201d from the start. ",
