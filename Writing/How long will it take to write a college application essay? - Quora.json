            "answer_text": "About five drafts if you are shooting for an outstanding essay. Be sure to tell a story about your life, or dreams, or goals, or whatever prompt you are asked to address. No cliches. No essays about Eagle Scouts (sorry!), summer camp, etc. These aren\u2019t bad topics, just done so often no one really wants to read another essay about student council or having been elected class president. And above all, watch your tone. No bragging! Expose your human side. Try to come up with an off-beat topic. Good luck! ",
