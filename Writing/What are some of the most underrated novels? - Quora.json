            "answer_text": "Marcel Proust - In Search Of Lost TimeA 7 volume novel, considered the most prominent work of the talented French writer. Spanning 4,215 pages (1,267,069 words), many do not tackle it purely because of the sheer length (which could probably earn several others works such as Tolstoy\u2019s War & Peace a spot on this list too). \"Oh if I could write like that!\" marveled Virginia Woolf in 1922. Literary critic Harold Bloom wrote that In Search of Lost Time is now \"widely recognized as the major novel of the twentieth century\". Vladimir Nabokov, in a 1965 interview, named the greatest prose works of the 20th century as, in order, \"Joyce's Ulysses, Kafka's The Metamorphosis, Bely's Petersburg, and the first half of Proust's fairy tale In Search of Lost Time\". Despite such glowing praise and wide acclaim as a defining piece of literature, you will find many modern readers have never even heard of it, let alone read it. For this reason I would consider it hugely underrated and highly recommend it. 2. Fyodor Dosteyevsky - Notes from Underground Not as well known as his 2 major and more celebrated works (Crime & Punishment, Brothers Karazamov). A shorter book, considered a novella rather than a novel, one of the first existential novels, it is broken into 2 parts. The first is the ramblings of the narrator, or Underground Man, to the reader, encompassing many topics but mainly revealing the strange and negative personality of the narrator. The second is an actual story involving the Underground Man, I won\u2019t reveal too much but it is interesting and gripping to see how someone capable of writing everything in the first part interacts with other humans. \u201cTo love is to suffer and there can be no love otherwise.\u201d \u201cI swear to you gentlemen, that to be overly conscious is a sickness, a real, thorough sickness.\u201d \u201cI say let the world go to hell, but I should always have my tea.\u201d \u201cI've never been a coward at heart, although I've always been a coward in action;\u201d \u201cHow can a man of consciousness have the slightest respect for himself\u201d \u201can intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is only the fool who becomes anything.\u201d \u201cThe best definition of man is: a being that goes on two legs and is ungrateful.\u201d These are some of the more memorable quotes that give an idea of the general tone and atmosphere of the book. 3. F. Scott Fitzgerald - Tender is the Night When people think or hear \u201cF. Scott Fitzgerald\u201d they immediately think Great Gatsby, studied widely in schools and remade into movies starring Leonardo DiCaprio\u2026.. And this is the reason why Tender is the Night is so underrated, his last novel and by his own admission, his best. \u201cFitzgerald wrote the final version of Tender Is the Night in 1932 and 1933, while renting the La Paix estate from Baltimore architect Bayard Turnbull. He salvaged almost everything he had written for the Melarkey draft of the novel in some form or other and also borrowed ideas, images, and phrases from many short stories he had written in the years since completing The Great Gatsby. Ultimately, he poured everything he had into Tender \u2013 his feelings about his own wasted talent and (self-perceived) professional failure and stagnation; his feelings about his parents (who on a symbolic level provided much of the inspiration for Dick and Nicole Diver); about his marriage, and Zelda's illness, and psychiatry (about which he had learned a great deal during her treatment); about his affair with Lois Moran, and Zelda's with the French aviator Edouard Jozan (paralleled in the relationship between Nicole Diver and Tommy Barban).\u201d ^Source It opened to a rather tepid reception, though since his death it has grown and many critics now consider it to have eclipsed the Great Gatsby in quality. 4. Franz Kafka - The Trial Overshadowed by The Metamorphosis and perhaps not celebrated as much it deserves, partly due to being unfinished like his other novels, it is still an incredible book that embodies the whole Kafkaesque style. The opening line perfectly sets the scene. \u201cSomeone must have been telling lies about Josef K., he knew he had done nothing wrong but, one morning, he was arrested.\u201d After that the book only delves deeper into the mindbending atmosphere and intensity seemingly only Kafka is able to create. 5. Charlotte Bronte - Villette Again a common theme here, more known for Jane Eyre, a classic in it\u2019s own right, this obviously gives less attention to other works. Some, like the great George Eliot, believes it surpasses Jane Eyre, Eliot once said - \"Villette is a still more wonderful book than Jane Eyre. There is something almost preternatural in its power.\" And another female literary powerhouse felt similarly, Virginia Woolf - \"It is her finest novel. All her force, and it is the more tremendous for being constricted, goes into the assertion, 'I love. I hate. I suffer.'\" I don\u2019t think I could add to what they have said, so I instead implore you to listen to their recommendation. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the best books I\u2019ve ever read that most people are unfamiliar with is \u201cParachute Infantry\u201d, by David Kenyon Webster. Webster was a U.S. paratrooper during World War II, a member of E Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) of the 101st Airborne Division - the so-called \u201cBand of Brothers.\u201d He was born in Bronxville, New York, to a prominent family, and was an aspiring writer who had been studying English Lit at Harvard before the war\u2026 and he was an exceptionally gifted writer. What makes the memoir unique (other than having been written by a veteran who just happened to also be a writer) is that it is made up of writings of his from during and directly after the war - Webster (who, postwar, would write for the Wall Street Journal and Saturday Evening Post, and also publish a book about sharks) was lost at sea and presumed dead while fishing at the age of 39. His widow had his writings published in 1994, 33 years after his death, but it was actually written while all the experiences were fresh in the author\u2019s mind. As I said, he was a gifted writer, and it\u2019s a stunning book. Eloquent and exceptionally evocative, while also being very frank and honest (and not always flattering to the author); you\u2019re reading a fresh-in-the-memory, factual, first-person account of combat by a soldier who happens to also be a very gifted wordsmith. So it goes down like great fiction while nonetheless never ringing false or sounding made up. If you like good writing, even if combat memoirs are not your thing - they were never mine before I read this book - it\u2019s worth checking out. \u201cArtillery takes the joy out of life.\u201d -David Webster ",
