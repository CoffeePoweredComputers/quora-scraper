            "answer_text": "I do have to curb my desire to jump in conversations where I know I can try to help the parties problem solve. Just recently it was two people discussing how to get roommates to move out the the apartment. I was trained as an art director and my job was to problem solve for my clients in a graphic nature. I have since started my information research company and I certainly could help others especially if it may be information they may find handy. I have learned to curb this desire to jump in since I became a mediator. In mediation you learn how to listen and let the parties solve their dispute. The parties have to solve their problem. I have done eviction mediation and could certainly could butt in and offer my assistance. I did not. Why? Because I sensed more of what was going on with their dialogue. Lots of drama and emotions that came close to the surface. I know that if I interrupted, one of the parties would have turned on me. I chose wisely. Rox of Spazhouse Intuitive Research ",

If I\u2019m in a public space and I overhear someone very confused or having leisurely conversation, like a grocery store, train station or airport. I will jump in to pass time or whatever. If it\u2019s something really important and/or burn-bookesque I will just listen, and tell everyone about it later. ",
