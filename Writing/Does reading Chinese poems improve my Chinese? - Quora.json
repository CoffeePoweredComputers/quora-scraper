            "answer_text": "The short answer; No, reading Chinese poems will do little to improve your Chinese. (I recently wrote a blog post about this Will Reading Chinese Poems Improve my Chinese? ) The truth of the matter is that Chinese poetry can be very beautiful. Diligent students of hanzi know that many Chinese characters are full of meaning and nuance. When written as prose, the characters combined with words and context weave a story of deeper meaning, insight, and reflection. I must confess there have been occasions after reading, pondering, and ultimately comprehending a poem, it was as if I had uncovered a hidden treasure that brought not only peaceful satisfaction but seemed to convey wisdom of the ages. With that in mind, it may be no wonder that some instructors with advanced Chinese levels may extol the virtues of Chinese poetry and even require their students to become diligent pupils of the classics. While the rewards can be sweet, reading Chinese poetry is not an optimal way to improve your Chinese. For a very SIMPLE (and I emphasize simple) example, consider the following poem that is included in the first semester Chinese text books for 1st graders in Shanghai.  \u300a\u753b\u300b \u8fdc\u770b\u5c71\u6709\u8272\uff0c \u8fd1\u542c\u6c34\u65e0\u58f0\u3002 \u6625\u53bb\u82b1\u8fd8\u5728\uff0c \u4eba\u6765\u9e1f\u4e0d\u60ca\u3002    If you could read this, congratulations! It\u2019s a nice poem isn\u2019t it? It causes you to stop for a moment and reflect on the beauty and tranquility of the scene with beautiful, colorful mountains, quiet streams, spring flowers still in bloom, and birds unfrightened by the approach of people. Amazingly, it is also one of the most simple poems in existence. Of the 20 characters in the poem, 18 are found within HSK level 3 while the other 2 are at HSK level 4 (\u65e0 and \u60ca). Despite the simplicity of this poem, here is why it it\u2019s not very helpful to learning Chinese. It\u2019s too short. By nature poems are short and are intended to be slowly chewed and digested. Poems are not designed to be long, however reading longer texts greatly aide in language acquisition because there is greater repetition, leading to the next reason\u2026.No repetition. Research suggests that it requires 10-20 encounters with a word before they are truly learned and much more to learn how it is used with different word pairs and in different contexts. Poems cannot offer this type of repetition.It does not reflect how people talk or communicate in daily life. Do we speak English the same way poems are written in English? Not unless your name is Longfellow. The same goes for Chinese. It\u2019s rich and beautiful, but people do not speak like this in everyday life.Low context. Usually there is little context given within the poem or the context is vague. As result, it becomes unclear if or how the words/characters/phrases are used in everyday life.Frequent use of obscure characters. This is more common when reading classical poetry. Characters arise that refer to very specific parts of a soldiers weapon or perhaps you\u2019ll learn the very specific character for duckweed: \u201c\u840d\u201d (both true stories). The only time you will run across some of these characters is when you are reading \u201cRomance of the Three Kingdoms\u201d or\u2026 classical poetry. You frequently will spend more time with a dictionary and translating in order to comprehend the passage. In the end you may understand what you read, but you\u2019ll likely forget the characters you were exposed to.Being able to read Chinese poetry is wonderful! However instead of looking at Chinese poetry as a step to better Chinese, it would be better viewed as a reward for hard work. ",

He liked to eat lions, and vowed to eat ten lions. Therefore Mr. Shi would usually visit the market to look for lions. At 10 o\u2019clock exactly ten lions just arrived at the market. At that very moment, Mr.Shi shot a few arrows from his bow and killed those ten lions. Mr. Shi then brought the ten dead lions back to his stone den. Because the den might be too wet to store the lions. So he ordered his servant to clean and dry the den. After the den was cleaned, Mr.Shi started to try to eat those ten lions.

            "answer_text": "Yes of course it will! Poetry is a vital expression of any major language, and it\u2019s always worth exploring as an approach to the culture it represents, while also indicating the characteristics of a language. \u2018Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? . . .\u2019 (Shakespeare)\u2018Kennst du das Land wo die Zitronen bl\u00fchen . . .\u2019 (Goethe)\u2018Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita . . . \u2019 (Dante) etc etc An intermediate level student should be able to handle a little poetry, even if it's only two or three verses. Sensible study of a few significant poems will always be beneficial. This is true of Chinese as well as most other languages.  Chinese poetry has arguably the longish continuous development and technical complexity of any Asian art form \u2014 making it almost comparable to, say, western music. That in itself makes it interesting, in showing off what the Chinese language is capable of accomplishing, however I think the main practical benefit of reading poetry, especially for a non-tonal native speaker, is to try to get to grips with the problems of the sound of Chinese.  Chinese poetry not only has rhyme, but in the case of \u2018regulated verse' it also has internal tone patterns. Listening to a native speaker read Chinese poetry and then  attempting to imitate the cadences for many students of Chinese will bring them closer to the essential sound of the language. (While the phonology of the verse has obviously changed since the Tang, or whenever, sufficient remains for the poetry to still \u2018work\u2019 in modern Chinese.) The 5-syllable jueju, for example by Li Bai and Wang Wei, are minimal in length and easy enough for everybody to appreciate. ",

            "answer_text": "Not so sure about the modern poems, but if you meant ancient poems, IMHO the answer is yes, but in the long run. It could be beneficial from the following aspects: Poems help you understand the mindset of Chinese culture. Since our culture is rather continuous, a lot of philosophy, or value, is still valid, cherished and advocated in modern days. Most ancient poems have a clear but delicately put implications, e.g. patriotic, nostalgic, romantic feelings and ambition of serving the country or self-accomplishment, etc. Some feelings are shared across cultures.From the aesthetic point of view, reading, or rather appreciating, poems could lure you more to Chinese, which is so beautifully written in those poems. When I read poems by W.B. Yeats, it was like a complete strange person across the globe, across time, conveyed his idea in those beautiful words, and yet can be share with and appreciated by you.As for the everyday Chinese conversation, ancient poems may not be really helpful directly since modern Chinese is different, but with a quotation from ancient poems, you could be considered as a more native Chinese speaker. We like quoting ancient things, even in daily lives.",

That being said, reading Chinese poetry might generally make you a deeper person, perhaps even calmer. You will also gain an interesting perspective into concepts like metaphor, rhythm, rhyme, etc.  through a very different cultural lens. ",

Of course the further you want to go, the tougher the challenges you will go through. It`s a quite hard process. Even many Chinese people can hardly understand those poems.
