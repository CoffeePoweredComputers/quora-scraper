            "answer_text": "What I tell people is that if you can't visualize a famous event taking place in a painfully boring manner, then you don't really understand what happened. Take the signing of the Declaration of Independence. It's a stormy July night and the room is dank with humidity and sweat. A bunch of insufferably pompous white dudes are loosing their vests and tunics after two days of bickering over grammar and punctuation. Finally the come to agreement and are all glad to be done with it. Since not a whole lot of people are around, it probably wasn't even signed until a month later in a separate meeting the public entirely forgot about. Take that mental image and stretch it out over the previous two days, with recesses for sleep, bathroom breaks, and boredom. That's what we're really celebrating with fireworks, barbecues, and dubious Mel Gibson movies. An accurate understand of America's birthday would look like the set of the show Matlock during awkward pauses between takes. Instead, we're conditioned to imagine it being something more like this:  The same even goes for battle. All the great wartime events were hours of nerve-wracking anxiety punctuated by horrendous events that would instill a lifetime's worth of emotional trauma. John Williams wasn't there to inform you with a key change and accelerando that something awesome was about to happen or that your friend was going to get blown up. They just happened and you just dealt with it, and any historical significance probably wasn't realized until years later until old men were writing their memoirs. So, why does making everything boring make me like studying history better? Because that makes it useful. Instead of being a still gallery of things that are supposed to be important to us, it's an ongoing investigation into real people with real faults who didn't have a damn clue what they were doing, yet they did amazing things. This mentality blurs the lines between \"history\" and \"news\" because it leads to everything existing on the same continuum of cause and effect. We're the same species as our ancestors and forefathers. Most people treat history as an antique that obfuscates this reality. It's like comparing a teenager having a poster on his wall of a beautiful exotic car, versus having an actual clunker that's not much to look at but is real enough to drive around in to make use of it and have fun. I like history because it's tangible. Most people don't see history that way, so I can understand why they don't enjoy it. ",

            "answer_text": "EDIT: I realized that I interpreted the question narrowly. Basically, I just answered the question - why do people study history during undergrad? Others can speak to reasons why people study history more generally.  History is probably one of the more misunderstood liberal arts majors. People have accused me of being everything from boring to outright useless. If you don't mind, allow me to defend my chosen major as relevant and even (gasp) important.  Some context here. I began college as a biochem major, but I realized that I liked the ideas and concepts of science. Applications? Nah. I hated labs and dissections. That, and I wasn't terribly good at science.  So, I tried economics and government. Snooze-town. These disciplines were all theory, no people. I finally chose history because of the stories and the people. History was vibrant and insightful. (This is what I thought at 18, so take my conclusions with a grain of salt.) Despite what many think, history isn't about memorizing events and dates. (I have no idea when the Civil War started...1866?). History is about critical thinking. You are forced to think about the whys, hows, whos, whats and wheres.  Some of the key skills that I've picked up along the way are: Analyzing Cause and Effect - at the most elemental level, history is about how one event leads to another event. Oh gee, Hitler invaded Poland? Enter the Allies! This skill is crucial for critical thinking. So many people confuse correlation and causation. History majors don'tmake that mistake (well, the good ones don't).Understanding Our Modern World - it's truly incredible to think about how our past affects today's society. When I studied Religion and History in Latin America, it was fascinating to see how the Catholic Church's influence still lingers in Brazilian politics. To understand today, you need to look backwards.Appreciating the Details - history is a surprisingly detail-oriented discipline. A single person, event or even animal can alter history's course. An eye for the detail isn't all -- a good historian must separate the wheat from the chaff. In other words, you learn how to unyoke the important from the useless.Reading and Writing  - as a history major, your bookshelves sag under the weight of your numerous heavy books. You become a pro at speedreading and recalling a sentence on page 55 about rice paddies in 1950s Vietnam. If you take seminars, like I did, you write endless 20-page papers on estoric topics like modernist architecture and Brazilian politics. Reading and writing skills are still very desirable skills to have, even in our text-speak society.Even though I had to go to law school to monetize my degree, I'm thankful for the skills and insights that my history degree gave me. Just don't ask me when the Civil War started. ",
