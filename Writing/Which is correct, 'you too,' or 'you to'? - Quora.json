            "answer_text": "Focus on \"too\" first. \"Too\" is used less frequently than \"to,\" so if you know what \"too\" means, then you can use it just for those specific meanings. You can feel confident that when \"too\" is not appropriate, \"to\" is the right choice. Try stressing (emphasizing) \"too\" when spoken, to help yourself assess whether it is the correct word. If the word is meant to be \"to,\" it will sound odd if stressed. \"Too\" can be emphasized without sounding unusual.Learn the meanings for \"too\". The first meaning is \"also\" or \"besides\"; the second meaning is \"excessively\" or \"extra\". In addition, some people use it to mean \"very\".Think of too as being relevant when there is an increase in something, such as temperature, difficulty, etc.; for example, \"too hot\", \"too challenging\", or \"too soft\". Choose the word \"too\" when it can be substituted for the word \"also.\"For example: \"She felt awful too (also)\" or \"I can see you too (also)\". Use \"too\" to modify or emphasize a word.For example: \"The weather is too (excessively) hot\", \"I've eaten too (excessively) much\", or \"The package is too (excessively/extra) big\".\"He wasn't too (very) interested in my book.\"Learn the role of \"to.\" \"To\" is a preposition Use \"to\" for expressing direction, place, or position.\"To\" can be used when going towards something.\"I am going to the store\" or \"Will you just go to bed please!\"\"To\" can be used when you're doing something in the direction of something or someone, such as: \"I am speaking to your friend\", or \"I am looking to the right\".Understand that \"to\" is also used when you\u2019re using a verb in the infinitive.For example: \"To go home\", \"to catch a mouse\", or \"to open the door.\"practice telling \"to\" and \"too\" apart. Here are a few examples to test yourself with (answers in \"Tips\" below):She's coming [to/too] your party [to/too].I'm [to/too] hot [to/too] help you carry [to/too/two] suitcases [to/too] the bus station.We are hoping [to/too] be near the festival [to/too].It's [to/too] early [to/too] be asking me questions about where I am headed [to/too].I hate [to/too] disturb your thoughts but are you ready [to/too] help us with our homework [to/too]?",

            "answer_text": "That would depend on the context. \u201cTo\u201d is a used mainly to describe an action, movement, or link. If you were directing somebody somewhere, it would be \u201cto\u201d. IE: Let\u2019s say you\u2019re directing a person to a place, you could look or point at them, and say \u201cYou to there\u201d, and point at a location. In almost all other instances, \u201ctoo\u201d is used. Essentially, if you\u2019re indicating motion/action, or movement, it\u2019s \u201cto\u201d, otherwise you may use \u201ctoo\u201d. Example: \u201cPerson A, I want you to head over to that door over there, and to hold your position once you get there. Yes, good luck to you too\u201d \u201chead over to that door\u201d = Moving to the door (An action) \u201cto hold you position\u201d = Telling them to wait (An action) \u201cgood luck to you\u201d = Linking \u201cgood luck\u201d to \u201cyou\u201d (Person A) \u201cyou too\u201d = assigning luck to an individual (Giving somebody a wish/property. Emphasis here is on the person, not the action/movement.) ",
