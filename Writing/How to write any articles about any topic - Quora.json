            "answer_text": "Writing articles for some people is difficult. For others, it comes naturally. Now, if you fall into the natural category, the moment you pick up a pen and a book or any other writing material, the ideas just flows freely from your mind to your note. However, if you are a newbie and wish to learn how to write about any topic, you need to first have the distinct topic in mind. Choose a topic that interests you enough to focus on it for at least a week or two. If your topic is broad, narrow it. Instead of writing about how to decorate your home, try covering how to decorate your home in country style on a shoestring budget. That\u2019s more specific and, as such, easier to tackle. Try starting out with a rough draft and let the ideas flow as you write. Afterwards, go back to your rough draft. Switch gears and imagine you\u2019re the reader of this article. Ask yourself the category of readers you intend to write for (e.g., professionals, single men). As this reader, what questions would you like answered? You might not know the answers yet, but list the questions anyway; you\u2019ll find answers in the next step. These questions would generate more ideas to put down into your writing. Also, try to do some research as you write, so your writing has some facts in it. At the end of the writing, try to brush up what you\u2019ve written, check for correlation and flow of ideas from the introduction to the conclusion. Check for grammar and typo errors, check your sentences, etc. Read through and through as though you were the audience and ensure that you have fully justified the topic. You can ask someone else to read your work, so you can appreciate their feedback on what you\u2019ve written.

            "answer_text": "You are willing to write an article about a topic. For that you need to have a clear understanding on who will be reading the article. Targeted readers can give you some specific guideline about what is to be included in the article. Like an article for kids should not include any adult content in it. Once you are done with knowing your targeted readers, now sit down with your laptop and draw an outline of the topic. Like, for a football match, you can broadly think about few bullet points- details of venue, participants, match for which league or cup, important players and their pre and post match expressions, the match description, important hi-lows, the supporter\u2019s reaction etc. Now, you start writing to elaborate each point. Make sure that the length should not be too big. Sequencing of the paragraphs is an important part. Your writing should create a climax in your reader\u2019s mind such that he/ she should continue reading. Sequencing helps a lot in creating this climax. At the end you should edit it properly for grammatical mistakes and consistency of your thought. You can refer to my another answer (link given below) related to your question. Thanks for your question. Barun Mitra's answer to How can I write about me? ",
