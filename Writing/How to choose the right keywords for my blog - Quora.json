            "answer_text": "There are two ways you can choose keywords for your blog. i) First, you can do it by guessing, in which case there will be 100% chance for you to pick up wrong keywords with no values and substantial search volumes. ii) Or you can choose keywords by doing a through research to be sure of the quality of your chosen keywords. So, to chose the RIGHT keywords for your blog, you have to opt for the second option, which is conducting a through Keyword Research. Keyword Research means searching web for popular keywords that have high CPC values and often searched by your target audience. So it\u2019s basically a research to find out profitable keywords that get you tons of traffic for your blog, and of course, help you make more money off of Adsense. Now, How to Do Keyword Research? Doing an effective keyword research is way easier than it was ever before. There are now tons of Keyword Research websites and many of them are absolutely free to use. So what you do is that you visit one of those sites, [let\u2019s say KWFinder] and you simply type in a keyword in their search bar. Their search engines will automatically find tons of similar keywords and share a through report on them. You can then easily check out how popular a keyword is, how many people are searching for it, which sites are currently dominating that keyword, what is the CPC value, and so on.  So Keyword Research will help you get a measurable report or status of a keyword and it\u2019s competition rate. If it has low competition, you can then use it to quickly rank your blog. But if there are cut-throat competition and big-guns are already holding the top position, then it would be better to skip it for another popular keyword. So, with keyword research, you can project the possible ranking for your blog even before you write a post. And that will help you to choose and focus on more effective and profitable keywords. So do a keyword research to choose the keywords for your blog.

            "answer_text": "How do I choose the right keywords for my blog? First, prepare your keyword research tool (neilpatel.com, Google Keyword Planner, Wordtracker, keywordtool.io) and list your website niche, products, services, target areas, and your top competitors. You can use these to give you an idea what keywords you\u2019ll need to use for your blogs or which keywords will give you quality traffic. Let say your website or business is all about safes and your target areas are Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, Melbourne and Queensland or Australia wide. For instance, we will use Neil Patel: Helping You Succeed Through Online Marketing! as our keyword research tool. Let\u2019s start by typing the word safes and set it in Australia Country and click Search.  Now, scroll down and find \u201cKeyword Ideas\u201d. You will see that there is a huge amount of volume searches per month for the keyword \u201cSafes\u201d in Australia and it will give you a hint that you will be facing a great competition for that keyword. Next, click the \u201cView All Keywords Ideas.\u201d  You can use the keyword \u201cSafes\u201d for your blogs but I suggest that you add LSI. Now, let\u2019s not start with high competitive keywords. Let\u2019s use the other keywords with average volume at least your blog will still gain traffic from those keywords. Also, try using your other products or services, like vaults or keys, locks etc.  Your next step, is to investigate your competitors\u2019 keywords so you will have an idea what keywords are giving them quality traffic. Here\u2019s an example, on the right side, you will see your competitors from a specific keyword like \u201csafes\u201d.  For instance, click the first competitor, with that you can see their competitor\u2019s keywords, volume, and estimated visits. (Sorry I need to crash out the website)  Now, you can see and use their keywords too for your blogs. There are many ways to grow your website traffic and optimise your blogs using powerful seo tips and guides. Remember content is king, and Google loves content. ",
