            "answer_text": "This is a hard question to answer without more context. I get the feeling this, as written, is implicitly begging for a list of simple bullet-points. But I want to have more fun with it. For some contrast, the most common narratives are necessarily banal and have very simple structure. Stories that begin with \"a funny thing happened at work today,\" or \"I heard something really juicy about cousin Joan\". These usually have a single punch-line, in common with classes of another short form narrative: the joke. To reduce my driveling, I'll restrict the following to narrative structures that lend themselves to film/television/theatre. There is an Imperial infinitude of narrative structures that are little used, because they don't really 'work' with modern cultural expectations\u2014especially when it comes to mass consumption. There's a good reason the three-act arch-plot structure seen in most block-buster (pejoratively referred to as 'Hollywood') movies is so common. The structure enables stories that are easy to consume over ninety minutes, are most often stand-alone and generally have a canonical resolution. It's a convenient vehicle to slip in a handful of themes or morals. It's a convenient format for those of us who just want to 'check out' for a couple of hours, with our 2.5 kids, after a long hard day at the coal mine. Of course, not all popular movies follow this structure. The focus could easily be on multiple protagonists. Popular examples of these multi-plot features: Pulp Fiction (1994), White Christmas (Black Mirror) (2014) or Four Rooms (1995). These all happen to feature character arcs and something of a resolution. You can retain this classic structure, but, if you want to make audiences work for it, you can present it in non-linear time, such as in Citizen Kane (1941), 12 Monkeys (1995), Memento (2000) or Donnie Darko (2001). Sometimes characters don't change much at all. The literature version is called 'slice of life,' and such movies can be great to watch... when done well (some slices are best left on the plate). Examples of this are Dazed & Confused (1993) or Clerks (1994) or a lot of Wim Wenders' films. Sometimes stuff definitely transforms the characters, although it's not clear there's an 'arc,' at least one with a direction. These can really fry the ol\u2019 noggin if you try to discern a classical plot structure. Examples include many of David Lynch's films (Eraserhead (1977), Lost Highway (1997), Mulholland Drive (2001) ), some of David Cronenberg's work (Naked Lunch (1991)) and a lot of Monty Python. If you\u2019re interested in reading more about the theory of narrative structures in film, I recommend Bob McKee\u2019s Story (1997). Here\u2019s an utterly unauthorized representation of one of the figures in the book:  There are many narrative structures that were popular, but have fallen out of vogue. For example many dramatic structures from Ancient Greece were relatively strict. A tragedy usually featured a spoken prologue, then the chorus turned up to sing, then a spoken section followed by a singing and dancing section. Rinse and repeat. A popular narrative device was the Deus ex machina, where the story-teller could get away with painting the characters into a corner, only having them rescued by some lightning-flinging philanderer. In this case, the plot device in question was literally a mechanical device (see: Mechane )! Personally I'm looking forward to what narrative structures we'll have in the future, largely opened up by technological innovation, such as Hyperlink cinema and interactive narratives enabled by computer games.
