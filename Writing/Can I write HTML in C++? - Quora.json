Here is a C++ program which not only generate large HTML webpages but also edits them and replace different values inside the html file Download : SMBS.exe How to generate HTML file with c++: Create HTML webpage using drag&drop applications like \u201cAdobe Muse\u201d.Open HTML file with notepad++.Press ctrl+F and click on replace.Make sure that search mode is \u201cNormal\u201dType \u201c\\\u201d in \u201cFind what\u201d field and \u201c\\\\\u201d in \u201cReplace with\u201d field.Click on \u201cReplace all\u201d Repeat same procedure for single quotation mark (\u201c) in \u201cFind what\u201d field and a back slash followed by quotation (\\\u201d) mark in \u201cReplace with field\u201d. Now, change Search mode to Regular expression and replace ^ with file<<\u201dReplace All with Regular expression.It will put file<<\u201d before every html line. Repeat with dollar sign in Find what field $ and \u201c; in Replace with field.Replace All with Regular expression.It will put \u201c; on end of every line Now copy complete code from Notepad++Open c++ IDE (Dev-C++ Recommended) and type following code.#include<iostream>\u00a0#include<conio.h>\u00a0#include<fstream>\u00a0using namespace std;\u00a0int main()\u00a0{\u00a0\tofstream file(MyWebpage.html);\u00a0Paste above copied code here and continue typing following lines file.close();\u00a0ShellExecute(NULL,MyWebpage.html,str,NULL,NULL,SW_SHOW);\u00a0return 0;\u00a0}\u00a0Done!

            "answer_text": "Long before fancy server packages like AngularJS came into existence, CGI was extensively used. Even today, it\u2019s in use, though it has lost popularity now. The basic idea behind CGI is you run a native executable from server (it executes on the server itself) and you get the text output. Technically, how difficult it is to print an html page from c++ program? Even dynamic?! All you need is some way to translate the ?arg1=val1&arg2=val2 part of the url to proper args passed to the executable (args to main function). And there are ways to do that. :) So, answer is, Yes But that might not be the best way. Most modern servers prefer more \u201cmanaged\u201d kind of applications rather than as native as CGI. You might not get to put and run a CGI script on shared hosting, for instance :)  P.S. Technically, how difficult it is to print an html page from c++ program? This is not \u201crendering actual html in all it\u2019s colors\u201d. Something like #include <iostream>\u00a0using namespace std;\u00a0 \u00a0int main () {\u00a0    \u00a0   cout << \"Content-type:text/html\\r\\n\\r\\n\";\u00a0   cout << \"<html>\\n\";\u00a0   cout << \"<head>\\n\";\u00a0   cout << \"<title>Hello World - First CGI Program</title>\\n\";\u00a0   cout << \"</head>\\n\";\u00a0   cout << \"<body>\\n\";\u00a0   cout << \"<h2>Hello World! This is my first CGI program</h2>\\n\";\u00a0   cout << \"</body>\\n\";\u00a0   cout << \"</html>\\n\";\u00a0   \u00a0   return 0;\u00a0}\u00a0:) Happy coding ",
