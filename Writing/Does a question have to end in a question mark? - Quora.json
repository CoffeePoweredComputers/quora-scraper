            "answer_text": "Technically no. Depends a bit on what you put in a \u201cquestion\u201d. \u201cI want to know the difference between apples and oranges\u201d is asking something, but it doesn\u2019t directly pose itself at someone. It\u2019s an implied question. \u201cI wonder what time it is.\u201d does a similar thing. In order to ask someone to give an answer, you need the question mark to show the sentence has an upwards tilt in tone, indicating there\u2019s a request of an answer (this can also be seen from word placement, but without the question mark it could turn into a rhetorical that isn\u2019t supposed to be answered). \u201cWhat time is it.\u201d doesn\u2019t give the right vibe. Word order would suggest it\u2019s asking the time, as would \u201cwhat\u201d, but it could also be what time (vaguely nonsensical without context, but we have to look at all the options available to us beyond the possiblity of an accidentally omitted question mark). Similarly a question mark could question the sincerity of a statement. \u201cIt is her time to shine?\u201d is a perfectly viable statement on its own, but when ended in a question mark it asks for confirmation. Is it her time to shine? Perhaps so, perhaps not. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "In written english, yes. See the spoken language can use pauses, heightened or lowered emphasis or tone to tell the intent of a sentence or statement. Punctuation serves that purpose in the written form. Now, in spite of what some here on Quora think, not every statement becomes a question by adding a ? to the end, but a statement that can go either way by wording is then defined by its punctuation. It\u2019s actually amazing when you think about it. A two word sentence spoken by a man to his wife can be completely different. You\u2019re pregnant.You\u2019re Pregnant?You\u2019re Pregnant!The first sounds almost bored, the second is definitely a question, the third, well there is some emotion there. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, if you want the sentence to be structurally accurate it needs the question mark. This is one way to instantly tell that a sentence is a question. Not all punctuation is that way. An exclamation point is often optional, but the emphasis it provides may be needed. It would be a little odd to say \u201cYour house is on fire.\u201d With no exclamation point, it sounds like the speaker is unalarmed and not taking it seriously.  An exception might be that the owner already knows his house is on fire and you are repeating this for some reason. You may not need the exclamation. It\u2019s no longer a surprise. Question marks are different. If a sentence is asking a question, use one. ",
