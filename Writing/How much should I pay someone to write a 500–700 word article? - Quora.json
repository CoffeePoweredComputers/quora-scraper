            "answer_text": "Some charges $10 a word, some charges $1 a word while others may charge $0.10 a word. Yes we have seen many price range on the web. Just take a look at Upwork Top rated Writers, most charge at average of $30\u201350 usd per hour.  So how long does it take for them to come up with 500\u2013700 words. It depends largely on the amount of time for research. You need to understand the context before you attempt writing. Sounds simple. But I am pretty sure if you attempt to open your Microsoft Doc, you will face the issue of mental block, which more than likely you will be stuck thinking whole day on what to write. Rapport between you and the writer is very important. Take the chance to see if they are the one to go for long term working relationship. After evaluating, you will be the best person to see if how much you should pay for their writing. Check out our article relating to this topic.  ",

            "answer_text": "As a former copywriter, I would run a mile from anyone with your attitude to writing. Great writing is always \u201ctechnical\u201d, whether it\u2019s 10 word microcopy or a 50,000 word whitepaper on quantum mechanics. Your list needs to be: Valuable. List articles are dime a dozen, so why should readers give a damn about yours? What\u2019s in it for them?Engaging. Does it hook your reader\u2019s attention, and hold it?Believable. Is your article informative and credible, or just another sensationalist piece of clickbait?Purposeful. Does your article achieve its purpose? Does it generate leads and entertain its readers?So how much should you pay someone for your article? Easy: nothing. If \u201canyone can write\u201d your article, do it yourself. You\u2019ll have no problem crafting a beautiful piece of compelling copy, and best of all, it won\u2019t cost you a cent. But if it\u2019s harder than you think, maybe you\u2019ll realise that great copy (and great copywriters) are worth their weight in gold - and even list articles require skill to execute properly. ",
