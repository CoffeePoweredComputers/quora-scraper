            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a famous (or infamous) example of a poem of three stanzas. This Be The Verse BY PHILIP LARKIN They fuck you up, your mum and dad.  They may not mean to, but they do. They fill you with the faults they had And add some extra, just for you. But they were fucked up in their turn By fools in old-style hats and coats, Who half the time were soppy-stern And half at one another\u2019s throats. Man hands on misery to man. It deepens like a coastal shelf.Get out as early as you can, And don\u2019t have any kids yourself. This is from his short collection High Windows published by Faber & Faber in 1974. There must be many examples of 3-stanza poems. It\u2019s early in the morning and this is the first that came to mind. Perhaps because I know it by heart and have done ever since I first came across it when I first got interested in poetry (reading it and writing it) in the early 1990s Sonnets (14 lines of iambic pentameters, usually) are occasionally laid out in 3 stanzas. Here\u2019s one by James Turner, from A Chance of Love: Sonnets of Two Decades, published by Oversteps Books in 2015. Autumn Wednesday I\u2019m older than I\u2019ve ever been before. As each day dawns I\u2019m older by a day. The grub that gobbled Tuesday\u2019s wanting more.It\u2019s name is time, and time is here to stay. It\u2019s chomping started back when I did. Then,it scared the child I was and made him ill,though once or twice before the age of tenit stopped, a glimpse of calm that haunts me still. Time\u2019s not a problem these days anyhow,It\u2019s speed cannot be slowed, and I don\u2019t try,for now will always go on being nowthough day may follow day until I die.That falling leaf. Those unseen running feet.The soft light on that roof across the street. ",
