            "answer_text": "While no, I would not consider him ill, I do think there are/ there could be reasons for him being in a mental hospital. After his run in with Sunny and Maurice, he mentions wanting to jump out of a window and kill himself. If I were his therapist, I probably would have diagnosed him as having Borderline Personality disorder due to his suicidal thoughts, unstable relationships, unhealthy habits, and so on. Yes, he is depressed over the loss of his brother, however, tragic events like that can trigger a personality disorder and actions like this. I am not here to \u2018put a label on\u2019 a fictional character, I am just here to say Holden shows symptoms of being borderline We, as readers, do not know what happened in between Holden getting placed in the mental hospital and what events led to it, we know what is said. Because he is a fictional character, we will never know other than what is written down. ",

            "answer_text": "Holden Caulfield feels like a misfit, he feels like he is very different from everyone else he knows, and he is right. In my opinion, Holden was depressed. He had depression over the loss of his brother, which is a perfectly natural and understandable thing. He says so throughout the book, and he exhibits symptoms of depression, such as an inability to concentrate and anhedonia, a lack of interest in just about anything. Holden criticizes and philosophizes about people who are boring, people who are insecure, and, above all, people who are \u201cphony.\u201d While Holden uses the label \u201cphony\u201d to imply that such people are superficial, his use of the term actually indicates that his own perceptions of other people are superficial. In almost every case, he rejects more complex judgments in favor of simple categorical ones.  If you found this answer helpful, please leave an upvote. ",
