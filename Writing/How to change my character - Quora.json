            "answer_text": "Feels like I have dated someone exactly like you .  I cannot say what your boyfriend feels now, but I had become really frustated with coping up with the lies. Trust is the most important pillar of a relationship. You expect your counterpart to be there with you, for you when the time comes . By lying, you shatter the very base of the relationship, slowly but relationships eventually die a very painful death.  What I expected- Just tell the ***king truth . If I judge you, not support you then you should try to find someone else. I might get angry a little, but believe me it will really strengthen the relationship from other/my side.  You do realise making errs is being human, but lying is different sin all together.Your partners know more about you than you think. So it would be really hard to lie to them, unless you are an expert :p . In my case, I used to ignore most of her insignificant lies just to emphasize that I did trust her , but it wasn't possible always.  What you can do - After a lot of introspection, I felt that things were getting bitter day by day so I asked her to promise that no more lies would be spoken from now on. Everything in the past would be left behind and we would have made a fresh start in this particular area. Something else happened and we got separated. BTW this is my untried experiment, which I would have done incase things had turned the other way.  Btw it ended badly for me .Took some time but recovered. The whole experience made me more judgy to the lying side of people and I think I should start accepting it as a natural behaviour of a human being, but still I would still seek for someone trustworthy when I decide to get adventurous again :pBTW All the best . DO SAVE your relationship if you feel like and Please come clean, talk to your partner about this habbit and stop procrastinating- start acting- stop lying.Lying is all about false hopes and promises. Truth sounds more like the Original.Thanks for the A2A. I feel much lighter now :p ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine had it been a reverse case how would you dealt with such guy? This answer is under the assumption that what you are telling me here is all truth: 1. A lie may make some one happy for a day or a week, but sad for the lifetime. The truth may make some one sad for a day or week but happy for lifetime. You also have mentioned that your lie gets caught, so when you know that your lie gets caught think of why do you say it in first place. It also appears to me that you are suffering from inferiority complex and there is not much focus in your life on any thing (I maybe wrong on this part, this is a experienced based deduction). A character of a person is built from what he does in his life, such as education, work, family values he/she inculcated in past, what he/she is doing presently and in what manner that is being done.  Woman, you are talking about character! Character is a very strong word and a very vital part of a person's identity. You cannot change it unless you have the will power and determination stronger than your character to do so. You should live in present moment. Losing him or not is not in your hands. Do the things which are in your control. Just focus on things which you can give effort to. Accept people and situation as they are. Don't be football of other's opinion. I also anticipate that your present relationship might not have chance to sustain because the time you got into relationship and time now you are different. If you guy accepts that, it would mean, he loves you too much to let go and your relation will survive but if he doesn't (and its NOT wrong if he doesn't, he is not bound to as well). First start loving your own self, more importantly start respecting your own-self by speaking truth. Rest things will fall their place. ",
