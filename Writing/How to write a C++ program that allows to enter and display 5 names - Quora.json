For the actual how, I used vim inside an xterm window, and a keyboard to type it in. I then copied and pasted it here after testing it. You do test your code, right?  P.S. If you think this answer is overly literal, just wait until you\u2019ve dealt with the computer one-on-one. It has no sense of humor, and takes your input extremely literally. ",
