            "answer_text": "In my experience, most introductory Chinese textbooks will give you an entirely Pinyin dialogue beside the Chinese character dialogue, and reading practice may also give you interlinear pinyin above the characters or between the character lines. That said, you really should learn characters. Even if you\u2019re 100% sure you just want to learn to speak, you\u2019re going to be utterly lost in pretty much every situation where you\u2019d regularly be speaking Chinese (say, in China!) because you don\u2019t understand the characters. They look daunting, but they\u2019re really not a big deal once you get used to them. If you can learn to recognize the patterns between them and their components, it really is little different from running into a new vocab word while reading in French or German, except that it\u2019s arranged somewhat differently. Improving your reading will also reflect on your speaking, as well. It\u2019s a holistic thing and, beyond a certain point, speaking skills in another language aren't just about grammar and vocab, they're also about cultural knowledge. And Chinese culture is heavily literary. Again, it\u2019s not going to affect you much on a day-to-day basis or when you\u2019re beginning, but eventually you\u2019re probably going to want to actually read things in the language and carry that over to your speaking.
