            "answer_text": "A book is like a cassette that records moments. And I think Life is the best analogy to books . Subtle words, stories, unexpected inspirations, downfalls, priviledges, love, the magic, lessons and disasters. Life records all these moments. Moments that are apparently insignificant and would turn to dust once you reach your final destination: the grave. I am a girl born to middle class bengali (Indian) parents and to a sister who is affected with down's syndrome. Since time immemorial, specially abled children have been onky sympathised with. I bet not a very large number of you, readers, have paid much attention to the Journey of a specially abled child towards a life devoid of stigma. The struggle, failure, disappointed, rejections, ridicule, inability, demeaned self respect due to comparisons with other priviledged human beings, intolerance towards mistakes.But never quitting and finally acheiving success\u2026 \u2026And I as a bystander to this will be the plot of my book. It's amazing how a single person's disability can affect the whole family. Let me tell you that there are no reservations in India with regard to educational opportunities or job opportunities. But my sister never stopped fighting. At 9, doctors had said that she won't be able to study beyond class 5 and her retardation would make affect her speech, motor skills. She would forever need the assistance of another to travel as she cannot remember roads and has a very weak memory. TODAY, SHE IS A FINE 25 YEAR OLD WOMAN WITH HER BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND SHE HAS COMPLETED ADVANCED SENIOR DEGREE COURSE IN TWO OF THE SEVEN INDIAN CLASSICAL DANCES. SHE HAS WON DRAWING CONTESTS, HANDWRITING CONTESTS AND IS PURSUING COURSES IN COMPUTER APPLICATIONS SO THAT SHE CAN APPLY FOR JOBS. The journey was not a cakewalk. But we persevered through it all and we will in the future. My book, if I ever write it, will be to convey this message to the common normal priviledged people to be compassionate, indiscriminate and patient towards specially abled children. They are already struggling in their lives. Don't make it harder. Because kindness costs nothing. The book will be appropriately titled \u2018The Other Sister\u2019 [math]\\huge\\color{red}{\\ddot\\smile}[/math] ",

            "answer_text": "I do try to write books. Although i have been getting fail every time till now. Now i am thinking of writing the book on that particular topic which creating an obstacle every time i try to do it. So, the title may be- ''How i made it done''. Now, the content will tell u what inside me or in my surrounding makes me to left so many tasks without making it happen. That's the little topic have a major role in every one's any task. I think that there are few small decisions made by us which lead us to bigger success or a painful failure experiences. So, that's what i will talk about in my book. Hence, the conclusion is, my book will tell everyone on how to deal with your emotions, not every but negative emotions which make us weak and creates an obstacle everytime you have a task. One line will integrate everything which i will tell in my book- \u201cIt's your thinking or mentality which make it done or loose\u201d. ",
