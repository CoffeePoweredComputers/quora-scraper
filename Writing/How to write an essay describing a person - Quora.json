            "answer_text": "You cannot write a character sketch about anyone you do not know intimately. This person can be a member of your family, a close friend, or even a main character in a novel or movie if you loved it so much you read or saw it many times. You can select a totally fictitious person, of course, but it is probably wise to make the person at least a combination of people you know, so that your description \u201csounds\u201d authentic to a reader. Most fiction writers admit that their major characters are a bit autobiographical or combinations of people they know, because they are just more believable. Also it will help you to get more ideas about what to write and you won\u2019t get lost. If you want you may even have some sort of an interview with the person you are writing about in order to know more about them. Thus you will present them in a way more realistic and truthful way.

            "answer_text": "Essays take a few different forms, and those who have already answered have gone into the technical aspects of how to construct such things. I prefer to formulate this kind of writing by having a conversational tone, as if you were simply talking to someone in a coffee shop. Each style can be applied many ways, and there is no right/wrong way-only poor communication/communicators. \ud83d\ude42 Try using the recorder on your cell phone and imagining that the cell phone is a good friend of yours who you can let your guard down with, and tell them the story of the essay. You don't have to worry about it being in chronological order, or missing any parts, so relax and tell someone who you know really cares about what you're going to tell them an interesting and engaging story. Let's face it; We learn not to be boring and put people to sleep as a part of our naturally fitting in socially. Take a conversational tone, one with a friendly informative feeling, and not only will you have tons of content to edit and move around, but it will be a work that you were personally attached to, not one that you are impartial and separated from. If you play this back, and some recorders let you play back at slower speeds, you can then start to write the skeleton or framework of how you want that story to be laid out, understanding that when you recorded it you were talking to someone whom you have a good relationship with, but the potential reader could be someone out of the blue who doesn't know anything at all. So you will find yourself explaining things in an essay that you wouldn't have explained where you having that chat over a cup of coffee. So just relax, and have a conversation with your recording device, imagining them to be someone in your life or not, and sit back, even close your eyes, and focus on telling a compelling and complete story. You might just astonish yourself, if you're not careful. ",

            "answer_text": "Elements of a Character Sketch 1. The subject: The subject may be real or imaginary. There should be some outstanding quality, feature, accomplishment, or trait that will make the subject interesting to the reader. 2. The Point of View: You may write from your own point of view, or if you have an active imagination, write from a fictional point of view, e.g., that of a close friend, a son or daughter or even a pet dog. You may also write from the third person point of view, or you may assume a \"personae\", i.e., a voice other than your own. 3. The Method: Choose a method parallel to the way you want to build up character, or parallel to the way impressions of characters are made. a. let the characters reveal themselves b. let other characters shed light on the main character c. show the way the writers themselves perceive the characters d. describe a setting in which the character appears e. give the character a name that will reveal something to the reader f. relate the character to a symbolic object or action g. present a series of scenes that reveals some change in the character.

When you describe something, you need to understand your feelings about the subject and write all essay in either negative or positive style ( the reader should have the same feeling at the end of reading). Don\u2019t mix physical and ethical qualities, they need to be apart and could be with the different feelings (ugly man with a good heart). In the end, you should write how you actually feel about this man (I love ugly with a good heart, for example). ",
