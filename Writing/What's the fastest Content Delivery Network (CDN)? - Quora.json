            "answer_text": "Our business uses many CDNs to deliver content and no one beats all the rest. It also depends on what you consider to be the measure of fast: do you mean latency or bandwidth? Sometimes the latency of a connection is more important than simple throughput. Also it depends on what time you are delivering your services, because some CDNs can be busier at certain peak times but blazing fast off-peak. Critically, most traffic to users doesn't have to go via public internet connectivity, a good CDN and a good ISP will have peering arrangements which mean that traffic is not subject to the same congestion as general traffic. We use various tools to measure the CDNs and we use a CDN switching service to balance the traffic between different providers. There are also CDN aggregation companies who make it easier to use multiple CDNs. I can certainly recommend Cedexis for a good balancing/measurement tool, Cedexis Radar is also free. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. There is no singular, \u2018best\u2019, CDN (though certain providers may claim so). However, there are some timeless considerations that may help to narrow down what may be the best CDN for you. Here are the top 3 considerations we discuss with our clients in their process of selecting a CDN. Location - Are certain markets more important for you? For example, in China - Chinese CDNs outperform Western CDNs. Do you need a Multi-CDN solution if you need to consider both Global and China?Use-Case - What is your performance threshold? Of course faster is better, but your needs as a video-streaming platform vs. average e-commerce store vs. informational site will differ. Ask yourself, what loading time is and cost makes sense to you for your company right now?Ease of Set-Up - How many resources are at your disposal/or do you want to put into improving performance? Certain CDNs charge a minimum usage fee per month. Does that make sense for you now? Do you have the internal resources to set up, track performance, and do this right?When thinking about overall performance, it\u2019s important to recognise that CDNs are not the be-all-end-all because there\u2019s more to performance, than speed. Take for example, companies that use Notey\u2019s SaaS performance solution for China. A mix of enterprises, SMEs, and e-commerce businesses use Chinafy because they end up getting a CDN that works well for everywhere, but China. As a result, to address overall performance - they ask the broader questions, \u201cWhat gaps are there right now in my user experience?\u201d, \u201cWhat feedback are my visitors giving me?\u201d \u201cIs speed the only issue I need to address?\u201d.
