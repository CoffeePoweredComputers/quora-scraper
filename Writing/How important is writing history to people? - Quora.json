            "answer_text": "Time is an historical phenomenon, a mentality, and a way of apprehending a changing world. It is the understanding of historical time, where time becomes concrete in the form of narratives and artifacts, which gives coherence to the individual events from the past. Understanding chronology is basic to visualizing the past and to making comparisons between historical eras and the present with regard to change and continuity. The widening gap between past and present often results in a new sensibility of time. Thinking about history and thinking historically are quite different things. Although most people think of history\u2014and learn it\u2014as a conglomeration of facts, dates, and key figures, for professional historians historical thinking is a way of knowing, a method for developing and understanding the relationships of peoples and events in the past. German historian of the late 19th century, Wilhelm Dilthey wrote, \u201cWe are historical beings first, before we are observers of history, and only because we are the former do we become the latter.\u201d Dilthey's research interests revolved around questions of scientific methodology, historical evidence, and history's status as a science. He understood that the process of interpretive inquiry is not described in terms of an object or event of the past, but as a series of worldviews. [i] Academic scholarship seems particularly unable to depart from \u201cpresent-mindedness\u201d in writing histories filled with negative stereotypes relevant to contemporary paradigms and passing fancies of correctness. It is a bit unfair to hold persons from the past to modern standards of behavior and appropriate patterns of thought. The spans of time in human history are so vast when compared to the span of a lifetime and of recent history that it\u2019s almost impossible to get a handle on it.

In fact the biggest losers seem to have the biggest audience, a disease of the present, history will look back and laugh at all of that. Not many other disciplines can teach a geopolitical grounding like history and apply it to the going ons today. Everything is linked or a cycle in a passage of time, girls will wear doc martins now, but in 10/15 years when they\u2019re seen as the attire of skinheads and racists, the girls will turn to moon boots and reebok classics. Shitty modern culture repeats itself more than we like to admit, ",
