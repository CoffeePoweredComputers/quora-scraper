            "answer_text": "A chapter is comprised of one or more scenes; usually several. A scene is a unit of action that (usually) takes place in a single setting. A scene has a cast of characters; some come, and some leave, during the scene. Scenes are vague and make it difficult to understand the basic building blocks of the story.Each scene has three essential parts: beginning (hook); middle (development); and end (climax). And then there are goals, conflicts, and disasters. and sequels, and plot goals, scene goals, shared goals,Confusing, right? It was for me, too. And then I found an excellent book, \"Structuring your Novel' by K.M. Weiland; and then another book by Weiland: Creating Character Arcs.I quickly learned that one cannot possibly be a good writer without learning the basics of writing, which includes understanding the structure of the scenes that make up the backbone of your story. Unless you don't care that your book will be ranked down in the Amazon swamp with several million other swamp dwellers, I highly recommend you take some writing classes, AND, or buy some books about how to structure a story. And constantly seek answers from writer's websites, such as Writer's Digest dot com.Writing is fun, but it can also become an unpleasant task if you find yourself halfway through your novel and realize you don't know what you are doing.Been there; done that.

            "answer_text": "I'm going to answer for outlining a chapter in a novel. You can't go wrong with the formula I learned from Aaron Sorkin: Intention + Obstacle = Conflict. This formula works on the meta level for the novel as a whole, and also works for each individual scene or chapter. A character has an intention (wants or needs something). There is an obstacle in the way of achieving that intention. The action of the chapter is based on what the character does to overcome the obstacle. Either he beats the obstacle BUT there is a new obstacle that grows out of his efforts, or he doesn't beat the obstacle and THEREFORE has to find a new way to achieve his intention. This is a two-stroke engine that can drive the whole story as well as its parts. Important to remember: things need to be different at the end of the chapter than they were at the beginning, so ask yourself -- what changes in this chapter? Good to remember: at the beginning of the chapter, ask yourself -- How can I make things worse? ",
