            "answer_text": "Do you want to know the secret behind building a blog that gets backlinks, ranks for important keywords and receives tons of organic traffic over time? Two words: evergreen content. These two words are the backbone of our strategy here at Ahrefs. It\u2019s how we\u2019ve grown our blog from 15,000 visitors/month to >200,000 visitors/month:  Why is evergreen content important? When Donald Trump won the election in 2016, the New York Times reported it.  Because they were one of the first few to break the news, their site saw a massive spike in traffic. But that only lasted for a couple of months. As people started coming to terms with Donald Trump\u2019s win, they were no longer interested in the topic of \u201cDonald Trump winning the election.\u201d As such, traffic to that article plummeted. Every time you publish this kind of post, and it gets widely shared, you get an initial burst of traffic. We call that the \u201cspike of hope.\u201d Over time, as interest wanes, this quickly degenerates into a \u201cflatline of nope.\u201d  This puts you on the hamster wheel of content creation. You have to keep publishing. Once you stop, your traffic will drop. And that\u2019s precisely why you should create evergreen content around evergreen topics. It helps you: Do less work. You don\u2019t have to change or update the content often, which saves time.Get regular organic traffic. Google\u2019s job is to provide answers to people\u2019s queries. If the content is out\u2010of\u2010date, it won\u2019t rank. Creating evergreen content is your best bet if you want to attract organic traffic to your post month after month, year after year, and not see a decline in traffic after a month or two.This is what we do at Ahrefs. We never cover news, fads or controversial issues that people won\u2019t care about next week. We only target evergreen topics and do everything in our power to create content that is as evergreen as possible. Learn how to create evergreen content in this post here. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a great question. One I think many bloggers and marketers alike don\u2019t consider enough. But I don\u2019t think the answer is as simple to answer using one or the other. Instead you have to look at all the factors before making a decision. The first factor being your budget. Currently, about 29% of marketing budgets are used for content marketing. This means if a businesses budget is $10,000 then they are spending $2,900 on content marketing. You can see the graph below to see how this breaks down even more for B2B.  Is your budget the average? Can you spend more? Or do you need to allocate less to marketing? Knowing where you stand will help you determine how much content you can comfortably put out each week, month, year etc. Once you know that you need to consider your audience. You will know best what articles are working for your audience. If you don\u2019t look to your analytics to see the articles that are getting the most views. If you are a very new business and don\u2019t have this data look to the data from others. There is a graphic from Ascend2, which I find very useful. It breaks down the most effective vs. most difficult kind of content. Allowing you to see where you should spend most of your time.  If you notice that your most popular articles are those that are timely in nature, focus on that. If you see evergreen content being the top choice go that direction. But if you have the budget, I find there is value in both types of content. My website focuses on putting out both evergreen and timely content, to help meet the needs of our consumers as a whole. Of course that isn\u2019t possible for every company. But if you take my advice to heart you should be able to discover which will work best for your business. I hope I helped answer your question!

            "answer_text": "I use both evergreen and timely content, but the publishing channel makes a difference. Time-sensitive material is best distributed through email or social media. If my client is exhibiting at a trade show, for instance, we\u2019ll produce content for eNewsletters, direct mail, email blasts, Twitter, or LinkedIn related to the products they will exhibit at the event. A call to action for this messaging might be scheduling personal product demonstrations at the show. We use social media to publish and promote evergreen content as well. Repeat promotional posts for eBooks, guides, online calculators, or customer case studies regularly, perhaps changing headlines or graphics. I advise my clients to avoid posting time-sensitive content to their web sites, unless included as a live Twitter feed or similar method. Website maintenance is a task frequently postponed, and timely content doesn\u2019t get deleted or updated as it should. Displaying old information makes a poor impression on the visitors clients have worked hard to attract. Many of my clients are in the mailing business so we recommend they refer to customer benefits such as postage savings as percentages rather than dollars. Otherwise, their web sites are immediately out of date when postage rates change. ",

            "answer_text": "When comparing timely content vs evergreen content it\u2019s like you\u2019re putting a sprint and a marathon face to face. It\u2019s not about which types of evergreen content or topical info is good and which is bad, but it\u2019s a matter of merging. Give yourself the treat of short-term buzz and long-term outcome, both promising to provide conversions and hype. Experiment with both, check out the ideas and examples tackled above, and see how each one works for you in terms of results (which one drives traffic for you). And don\u2019t forget: if you\u2019re after more consistent posting and bringing in followers back to your site, use topical content, and if you seek to build up the pillars that give you better SEO results and a chance to reach out to new readers, also use evergreen blog posts. Opt for a hybrid model: get the best of both worlds and include evergreen and seasonal content in your digital marketing strategy. Also, never forget that content, be it evergreen, topical or timely, must be promoted properly! Share your content on social media and even promote it with ads. Most of the times, it\u2019s not enough to just write content and publish it. ",

That way, you get the best of both - content that has the potential to become hot, but won\u2019t die down once the fuss is over. Have a look at this article: 6 marketing lessons. In honor of Steve Jobs. It takes a timely matter (Steve Job\u2019s death) and wraps it in an evergreen value (marketing lessons). ",
