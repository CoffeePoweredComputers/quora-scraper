            "answer_text": "No. It is not too tall for age 13. I grew several inches between age 12 and 13, and was about 5\u20326\u2033 at 13. This was what was known as a growth spurt. I continued to grow taller after that but not anywhere near as quickly as I did during that growth spurt. Height will vary from person to person, but this is certainly in a normal range for your age. I might add that I developed on the outside but my internal organs were not fully developed yet at that early age, which is also normal. Be sure that people do not mistakenly think just because you are 5\u20326\u2033 , that you may be a woman internally. In your early to mid-teens especially, your outward appearance can be ahead of your internal physical development. At 13 you still have much internal development ahead of you. ",

As I recall, going back to that age, 5\u20326\u2033 was just a little bit on the tall side for 13, but by no means too tall. You might even grow another inch or so before it stops. If this is concerning, I would seek out a pediatrician and discuss it with them. There were a few girls when I was in Junior High who were around 5\u203210\u2033 and my ex was 6\u2032 tall without heels. ",
