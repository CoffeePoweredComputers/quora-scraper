Only when I make it as perfect as possibly do I give it to her. Then she goes through, finds all my mistakes, and I spend another month making it as perfect as possible \u2026 again. And it\u2019s only then that anyone outside the house sees it. That being the case, I have several \u201ctrunk novels\u201d from years ago that no one but me has ever seen, and I hope it stays that way. ",

It's dated, filled with descriptions of people and productions that are of no interest to anyone. As a novel, it has real potential. A lawyer has a midlife crisis and goes to film school. Unfortunately, he makes the worst student film in the world and has to use his legal skills to graduate\u2026 If you are talking about published works, I have nonfiction, that I hide in the closet.

Some 5,000 copies were sent to him by the disgusted book seller. \u2026 Some time later, Oscar was overheard mentioning that he had a 6,000 volume library, 5,000 of which he had actually written himself.  In my case, well, check out this listing on AMAZON: Defining and compiling terminfo definitions for the UNICOS operating systems: David Ecale If you are interested in buying a copy, I have the only three extant copies in existence.
