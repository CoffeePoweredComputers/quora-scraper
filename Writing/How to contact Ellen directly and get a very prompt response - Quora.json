            "answer_text": "I have tried writing to you a couple times on your webpage, I can't figure out how to download a pic of myself, as I have plenty. I have 51 years old, living in Oklahoma City. There are numerous things going on with me right now. I believe it all started though, in 1998 when I left my soulmate, the father of my two children. And then I made another stupid decision in 2006, to leave them, and move to North Carolina with a man who I thought deeply cared about me. He accused me of cheating on him a few years later and just left me in the dirt. I have been staying with family and friends since. I am in Oklahoma living with a man who I thought also cared deeply for me. Turns out he doesn't. I cannot work right now due to having gallstones, recently just covering that my entire family has OCD, sinus problems and I have recently broke out in a rash on most of my body. I really need your help in getting back to Florida to my auntie and uncle :-) I need a vehicle which I don't have my license right now due to not showing up for a court appointment in Wisconsin when I lived in Florida last year. I also have a warrant out for my arrest for that. I have recently discovered the collagen from nativepath, has helped me in so many ways. It has given me the strength to figure out what is wrong with my family and myself as far as having OCD. I quit my job on December 7th, 2018. Cannot afford to purchase any more of this grass-fed collagen. I feel like I am slowly dying, and do not want to be on your show right now. But I really need your help Ellen. Also, for my sister, Brenda, who has been addicted to crack for 10 years or more, has OD'd twice, and I haven't talked to her in days. Also, my brother, Charles, is a alcoholic. he pretty much keeps to himself when he is drinking and knows he has a problem oh, I don't know if he wants help or not. I have been to the ER twice since October, I have called everywhere in Oklahoma City to get insurance, medical, and for various reasons can't. I even emailed our new governor Kevin stitt. I have a $2,800 emergency room bill from October. That was a 45-minute visit. They told me I could have the flu bug and sent me home. I went to a different ER 3 days ago and found out it is not my appendix or my cyst on my right ovary. It is probably gallstones and I am treating it with lemon juice, peppermint tea, peppermint Lifesavers, acetaminophen. As I said before, I feel as if I am slowly dying. And do not want to die here. Please help me. My phone number is 608 422 9671. Ty ",
