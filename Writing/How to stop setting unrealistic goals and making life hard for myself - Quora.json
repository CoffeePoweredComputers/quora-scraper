            "answer_text": "Do we really need to have specific goals at all times? I want to lose 15 pounds in a month. I want to crack the toughest exam in my country this year. I want to have a million dollars before I turn 30. I want to score 90% is my upcoming exam. Can you spot any pattern between the statements? Let me help you. They are all goals. Whatever criteria you use from simple SMART technique to more sophisticated forms, they\u2019re goals and you could easily tell at any point in time whether you succeeded or failed. It\u2019s largely binary. Now let\u2019s look it the other way. Losing 15 pounds in 30 days is a goal. But would anyone be able to sustain it once they reach their goal if they revert to their old patterns? They probably won\u2019t until and unless they keep on setting newer and newer goals. Likewise, it initially amazed me when people had single academic goals. They would set a target entrance examination and revolve their entire life around it. Rather than just setting goals and then feeling the thrill for a time, why not resort to a long-lasting method of studying regularly and setting up a real insane work ethic that would aid you more than thousands of temporary goals you set. I was short for words to describe the technique though that was exactly what I was drawn into for the most part of my adult life. A part of the contribution was from most self-help gurus who argue that without specific goals your life is utterly worthless. Then things changed when I read \u201cHow to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big\u201d by Scott Adams which dedicated an entire chapter explaining goals vs systems. I would highly recommend the book for anyone wanting practical wisdom in their lives. In the author\u2019s own words: \u201cA goal is a specific objective that you either achieve or don\u2019t sometime in the future. A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of success in the long run. If you do something regularly, it\u2019s a system. If you\u2019re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it\u2019s a goal. Goals are a reach-it-and-be-done situation, whereas a system is something you do on a regular basis with a reasonable expectation that doing so will get you to a better place in your life. Systems have no deadlines, and on any given day you probably can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re moving you in the right direction.\u201d There is definitely a significant degree of overlap between the two terms. Every system has a goal however vague and every goal need a system for a time being. And I am not at all against goal setting. They are incredible at many times but for a more lasting change, you must follow a system. Scott explained it splendidly. For example, if your goal is to lose ten pounds, you will spend every moment until you reach the goal\u2014if you reach it at all\u2014feeling as if you were short of your goal. In other words, hardcore goal-oriented people exist in a state of nearly continuous failure that they hope will be temporary. That feeling wears on you. In time, it becomes heavy and uncomfortable. It might even drive you out of the game. If you achieve your goal, you celebrate and feel terrific, but only until you realize you just lost the thing that gave you purpose and direction. Your options are to feel empty and useless, perhaps enjoying the spoils of your success until they bore you, or set new goals and reenter the cycle of permanent pre-success failure. Eating healthy is a system. You can expect to have a positive impact on the system in your life. Losing 15 pounds in 30 days is a goal. Once you get there the goal doesn\u2019t exist. After that you have two choices: 1. Revert to the system of eating healthy 2. Set a new weight loss goal and repeat the cycle Systems are liberating. If you have to do it every single day of your life, you would adapt to it much faster than when you convince yourself to do it for the next thirty days. If your only aim is to work insanely hard till you get into the top university, you would start having issues with your work ethic once you get into college if the external pressures are not sufficient to make you work hard. Bottom line: Goals are very important but having an important system is priceless. ",

            "answer_text": "When you set an \u201cunrealistic\u201d goal for yourself most often than not your goal setting is being influenced by certain personalities who have attained immense success, name & fame, which you wanted to emulate/ replicate in your life. Though on face of it, it looks \u2018good\u2019 for you to set high goals and work towards them, however \u201cpurely on a pragmatic level\u201d many of us at the end of the day, find ourselves getting disappointed of not being able to achieve those goals which are not \u201crealistic\u201d considering our life situation. Why it is so? It is so because, as each success story is unique to each of the individuals involved and particular to the circumstances that he/she had faced which may not be feasible to our life situation. Thus have a broader goal which you aim to achieve and be flexible enough to make necessary course corrections to modify your goal based on the lessons you are learning in the process of pursuing your long term goal. The beauty of our life journey is such that you cannot predict how your life trajectory pans out, that being so it is always prudent to adopt flexible approach then maintaining rigidity by harping on some unrealistic yardstick which if not achieved would tend to demoralize you, by making you to think that you have failed to achieve aim/ goal set as bench-mark.

            "answer_text": "There were 200 warriors guarding a fort. All their army was killed by the 20,000 fighters of enemy. Surrendering was the only practical option. The goal to protect their fort, their pride and self esteem was quite unrealistic. Death was almost certain unless they picked up the white flag and bowed down to enemy. But none of them thought about loss, death or martyrdom. They set a goal to fight till their last breathe. Finally, the enemy broke the main gate of the fort early morning next day. They jumped in the war of death with excitement and pride. Enemy was surprised to see the magnificient skills and determination of the handful of soldiers. Finally all of them were martyred. They died like winners because they achieved their goal. None of them took their last breath with regret.  Nothing unique about this story. We must have heard such stories before and watched them in movies as well. But the important point to be noted is that the brave soldiers didn't set a target to win. If they would have, they may have lost their strength and will power because expectations would have made their shoulders weak. Probability and chances of failure would have created a mountain of fear.  Moral of the story- Winning may be an unrealistic goal. Trying with dedication and determination isn't!  One free tip- Focus on doing more than thinking and evaluating. ",

If you have never taken a psychometric tests before, go to www. 123test_strengths and http://weaknesses.com Find out what work opportunities should you pursue for maximum success. Additionally, go and study The Color Code by Taylor Hartman. You will discover what is your dominant motivation - whether it is power, intimacy, peace, or fun. Then follow up by pursuing a path of spiritual growth by developing the 7 habits of highly effective people by Stephen Covey. Additionally, improve your productivity and decision-making by studying Six Thinking Hats by Edward de Bono. Achieve corporate success by studying Maximum Success by James Waldroop & Timothy Butler. Achieve financial security by emulating Warren Buffet in his biography: The Snowball: Warren Buffet and the Business of Life by Alice Schroeder. This holistic approach is far more effective then simply setting goals suggested by other people. ",

Is it that they don\u2019t support what you want and told you your goals were unrealistic, and that it couldn\u2019t happen for you? If this is what you are dealing with, you need to understand something. Just because other people don\u2019t understand or believe in your goals, does not mean your goals are unrealistic and unattainable. The first thing you need to do is BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. Despite what anyone else believes about you, YOU have to believe in YOU. If you have a lot of people around you who continue to cause you to second-guess yourself, stop telling them what your plans are. Sometimes, it\u2019s even better to just remove certain people from your circle. You will have to take a look at those around you and figure out who is a benefit to your life and what you aspire to do and who is a detraction. Anyone who is not there to assist, encourage, or cheer you on, you need to cut them loose because they will keep you from your goals. I don\u2019t know if you have ever heard the story about the wagon and the rope. It\u2019s basically a scenario of a climb to success. You are carrying this heavy, thick rope over your bare shoulder and you are pulling this rusty heavy wagon up a hill the entire time. The hill represents the journey to your goals. The wagon represents the steps necessary to reach your goals. Well, along the way, you have people around you, because in order to reach your goals, you do need support. These people represent your friends, coworkers, business partners, even family. You have to be careful, because as they are around you, their job is to assist in getting that wagon up the hill. They are moving obstacles out of the way, pushing while you pull. What happens is \u2014 when you have people who are not for you, who don\u2019t want to push, they will just jump on the wagon and ride, making your assent up that hill even harder. You have to get them off that wagon because they will make your climb agonizing. You will start to doubt yourself if you allow them to continue to hang on while you climb, carrying them on top of the weight of the wagon. This is a scenario that was told by Steve Harvey by someone he knew when he was on his own climb to success. So, I don\u2019t know if you actually believe your goals are unrealistic, or if you are buying into what you have been told. Goals are attainable but the biggest and best ones are the hardest. So if you have set goals for yourself and you feel that they are too big and too hard to accomplish, those are usually the best goals. If it\u2019s too easy, it\u2019s not big enough. I believe you have been fed the wrong information. Just because it\u2019s difficult doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s unattainable. Start believing in yourself and in what you aspire for your future. Do your homework to see what or who in your life you need to put some distance between. Once you know what you want and believe in it just as passionately as you want it, the sky is the limit. But, it won\u2019t happen if you don\u2019t believe it yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "I would start by making a list of the things that just make me super happy that I cannot even explain. Then I would stare at that list and then look at the unrealistic / stressful goals list and compare and question myself. Is it worth it? Every moment, day, week, month, year that passes by is not coming back. What would I rather do? The answer should be simple. The other aspect here is going to the root cause of why you are being hard on yourself. Almost always there is a reason, you are not forgiving yourself for something or for someone in the past. Reflect on it , make peace with it and let it go. Whatever it is, its not worth hanging on to. The last but not the least is, we get addicted to the rush of the stress and do it deliberately. It is self destructive. Shift your focus to something that's positive, easy, and give yourself permission to love and pamper yourself. You are worth it. Always. Hope this helps. This is all from my own experience. ",

Try to have more than half of the sub goals be short term (< 1 month). Attaining these shorter term goals will provide you with some short-term positive reinforcement. The next 25.% of the sub goals should be attainable with 2 months and the final 25% within 3 months. If the larger goals require a longer period to attain, move them down the list. You want to focus on goals and sub goals that are realistically attainable within 3 months at the longest. As you increase your focus, and attain more goals, you should get better at setting more realistic and attainable goals. Good luck. ",

Life, in general, is not easy, but each of us has the ability to make a difference in the quality of life, for ourselves, and our loved ones. I say set you goals, as usual, but break the path up into stages. Be patient. As you conquer each stage, recommit to attaining the end result, but only go to work to get to the next stage. This way you are always making progress, and you are not feeling any disappointment for not reaching the final stage. Believe me, it is a lifelong process, and you have nothing to gain but complete fulfillment. ",
