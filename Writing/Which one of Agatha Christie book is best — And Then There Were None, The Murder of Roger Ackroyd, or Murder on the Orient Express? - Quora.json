            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t read Murder of Roger Ackroyd yet\u2026 * Highlight \u201c\u2018yet\u2019\u201d * But when it comes down to , \u201cMURDER ON ORIENT EXPRESS\u201d or \u201cAND THEN THERE WERE NONE\u201d., I\u2019d choose the latter. After all, it is \u2018THE WORLD\u2019S BEST SELLING MYSTERY\u2019\u2026 However, \u201cMurder on Orient express\u201d is also pretty interesting too. A person who loves reading (like me)-specially mystery- would love these two books. For those who aren\u2019t much into reading detective stories , would probably prefer to just skim through \u201cmurder on orient express\u201d. But will never, I mean ever, prefer to skip any part of \u2018And Then There Were None\u2019. On a scale of 1\u201310., I\u2019d give Murder On Orient Express \u2014\u2014\u2014 9.5 And Then There Were None \u2014\u2014\u2014 10+++ * I know, I know, 10 is the maximum\u2026but sorry, it deserves a 10+* P.S. : If you haven\u2019t read these two yet, I\u2019d like to mention something. Don\u2019t just strain your brain while reading them, your theory is most likely to go wrong. Then again, you can\u2019t stop your brain. After all., that is the pleasure of reading a mystery novel. P.P.S.: I\u2019m definitely diving into The Murder of Roger Ackroyd after submitting this answer. EDIT: Completed The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd\u2026 Well, First of all, It was Good\u2026 (Obviously\u2026Duh!) On a scale of 1\u201310., To be honest\u2026 I couldn\u2019t decide if it was an 8 or a 9\u2026 Ok\u2026 8 it is\u2026 It usually goes this way- you start reading it\u2026you formulate your own theories but ultimately Hercule Poirot proves them wrong and gives his own peculiar yet interesting solution\u2026 so, for a change, half way through the book, I thought, \u201cWho is the most unlikely person to be proved guilty? \u201d I used my little grey cells and guess what, I stumbled upon a character but dismissed that thought and went on with my reading\u2026 Guess what happened? Yep\u2026you\u2019re right\u2026 I guessed it correctly even though I couldn\u2019t -for the life of me- comprehend its possibility\u2026 However, Hercule Poirot vividly explained everything\u2026 And I\u2019m HAPPY\u2026 Yay!!! \u201cIt is not easy to hide things from Hercule Poirot. He has knack of finding out\u201d \u201cThe truth, however ugly in itself, is always curious and beautiful to the seeker after it\u201d Increasing heart rate and sparkling eyes with anticipation of the moment of truth are common in the last 10-20% of every book.

            "answer_text": "Agatha Christie is a spin master (or mistress!). She had the admirable ability to take a formula (which I shall call her whodunit formula) and then add her own individual twist on that formula to create mysteries that were both surprising and refreshing. The 3 you have asked about are all in that special \"twisted\" formula category. You did not mention if you have read any of these 3 books. As such, I will not include any spoilers in this answer. Since it is a Christie novel, they all deal with murder. All of them deal with expression and suppression. What the individuals in the novels express and what they suppress are very often clues to their own character and also in the solution of the mystery. In addition, they are all \"fair\" stories like almost all of Agatha Christie's novels were - i.e. a person who reads the stories with attention can logically solve the mystery. She was fair to her readers that way. What is different about them? 2 of them are in the \"locked room\" variety of mystery stories, while one literally had a locked room in the story. The 3 of them played with the idea and identity of the murderer in very creative ways. The clue here would be me, all or none! The mood and language used in the stories reflected the time of Agatha's life. Roger Ackroyd (1926) was narrated, Orient Express (1934) was full of activity and movement and None (1940) was mysterious and dark. They are all 3 very fine specimens of a body of work (forgive the pun!) that is exceptional! Don't miss any of them! ",
