            "answer_text": "A2a, thanks Matt.  Montblanc is best for showing off,  Visconti for design and innovation,  Aurora for understated practicability,  Sailor for workmanship and writing. From a personal perspective of collecting and writing, using very little pressure, I've made the following shortlist. Best major German brands: Pelikan, Diplomat, Lamy, Montblanc. Best major originally US brands: Sheaffer, Waterman, Parker. Best major Iltalian brands: Stipula, Delta, Montegrappa, Visconti. Best major Japanese brands: Sailor, Pilot, Platinum. I admire Visconti enormously for having built its brand in less than 30 years to where it is now. Beautiful pens in magnificent colors and materials, innovative ink filling systems. Still, nothing compares to the beauty of a Stipula Etruria. Preferably the 991. That's a limited edition in celluloid. But there are many regular Etruria's or more recent limited editions that share the same design and in all respects but material, are just as fine.  About half my little Etruria collection with four 991 I have many hundreds of fountain pens. With any of these brands and many more smaller brands you can have a magnificent writer straight out of the box. On the other hand, all sell also pens that will give you trouble. Due to the quality control of Sailor, the risk that you buy one that doesn't write well straight out of the box is significantly below average. Sailor also makes great nibs. If you buy your pen from a penshop where an expert can adjust nibs and feeds to your liking, your choice is virtually unlimited. Even pens as cheap as a few dollars can be made to provide you with years and years of writing pleasure. ",

            "answer_text": "Got to understand this from the outset\u2026there have been literal physical confrontations over this question. Emotions can run quite high when the word \u201cbest\u201d is with regards to ANY subjectively evaluated item. So, with that disclaimer\u2014 Of the four mentioned in the question, I\u2019d rank them Visconti, Sailor, and Aurora a distant third. Mont Blanc doesn\u2019t even register on my pen scale. Advertising gimmicks are rarely worth serious considering\u2014IMHO and YMMV regarding the German wannabe. NOW\u2014as Julianne pointed out, there is a whole passel of other marques that are solid \u201cbest contenders\u201d. And know well each person answering your question is gonna have a \u201cbest list\u201d. My list?
