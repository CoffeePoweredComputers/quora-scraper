            "answer_text": "As we all know there are many great tech company's like ASUS ,Samsung etc .who are very much interested to promote their products to the normal consumers like us so that we will buy it and they could make profits by selling more no of their products.but the problem is that still most of the people don't know much about these products as they don't advertise each and every details about their product on ads ( sure it won't affect u much if you are watching a boring program on your tv unless you are watching a super cool Hollywood movie ,you know because ,think like this, okay ,there are a minimum of 50 ads each ad running for minimum 10 minutes and maximum up to 90 minutes which is for sure gonna make you go crazy ,so the next thing you will be doing for sure is either throw the tv out of the house or just break it into pieces and then burn it under a fire with a monstrous smile or laugh to support that entire scene ) so they will mostly not buy it because they don't know much about it detaily whether it's a great product or not . This is where the influential tech channels like Linus tech tips , marquees brownlee , unbox therapy, etc , come under action ,as they are mostly famous,because of which company start to give them products freely for promotion purposes so that people around the world will come to know more about their products hence giving them profits, not only that most of the tech YouTubers like them ( by them I actually mean the YouTube channels and their hosts mentioned above )are very much educated and have their own community forums where lots of normal people like us could discuss the problems and give them some suggestions about a particular product , which is then brought under consideration by these YouTubers to these company's ,which uses these valuable information about what people want next and what they don't want etc, to make the next product better than previous one . Long story short ,they get it for free from the particular company and some times they will have to buy it under rare circumstances where the product might not have been given to them for reviewing but still their subscribers might force them to do review on a particular product which might be made by a local Chinese company Hope u have found the answer for your question it might not be explained much but still you should get an idea for what you wanted to know See you later mate ",
