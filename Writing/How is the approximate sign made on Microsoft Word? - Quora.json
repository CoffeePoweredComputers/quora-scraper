            "answer_text": "There are several ways to make special symbols in Microsoft Word. The easiest way among them is to use the Unicode for the symbol. Of course you need to know the Unicode value corresponding to particular symbol. There are several lists available on internet, just give it a Google search. I'll keep the answer short now, the easiest way you can achieve making approximate symbol in word is by holding the Alt key and typing the Unicode value for approximate symbol while your num lock is ON. ALT+8776 will make \u2248 symbol. Edit: If for some reason the above method doesn't displays the symbol properly there is an alternative for that and is also very simple. Simply type the Unicode value for the character and press Alt+x. That's it. Eg: Type 2248(Unicode hex value) and press Alt+x. Note: For the first method to work find the Unicode (dec) value and for second method to work find Unicode (hex) value. The latter one is easier to find and is more convenient in my opinion. However, it depends on your personal choice as both does the job well. ",

            "answer_text": "As usual, there's about four ways to go about this, but the simplest for me is to use the Unicode character. 1. Type \"2248\" (without the quotes, of course).2. Hold down the ALT key, and press \"X\" (without the quotes). I've got a paper copy of the codes that I printed off about a coon's age ago, but just Google \"Word Unicode list\". or see Wikipedia for an exhaustive list (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters). Depending on the particular character, you may need to change your font(http://www.techonthenet.com/word/questions/unicode_2267.php). I think it's somewhere in the Symbols font, too. ",
