            "answer_text": "To create a blog you can use blogging services like Blogger, Tumblr, Medium, WordPress, Wix, Ghost, and Weebly. If you are serious about blogging, and making an income from it you can self host your own blog, but when just starting out I do not recommend blowing cash on a self hosted platform. You'll be paying monthly fees or one big overall fee for a certain amount of years and then the price increases after the promotion ends. Only once you have a stable audience, good traffic, and are blogging regularly should you invest yourself in self hosting with WordPress or any other self hosted blogging platform or else you'll waste your money on a blog you may soon abandon if it doesn't work out for you. I recommend going for a free Blogger blog first if you would like to spend little to no money, and test the waters. If you don't like Blogger\u2019s default templates then you could try these free responsive blogger templates that are easy to upload, and install. There are even more available through sites like themexpose, soratemplates, etc. The only thing I suggest investing in is a domain name. A domain name is your website\u2019s web address such as: www. example domain . com This could stick with you forever so please choose one you truly believe represents your brand or overall content. Feel free to get a bit creative with it also. Domain names are paid once a year and fall between $10 -$15 per year. You can use domain name registrars like Namecheap. I don't like recommending Godaddy as they can randomly repossess your domain name at any time without contacting you, and you'll lose access to it. Tumblr is mostly for mini blogs or micro blogging. Medium is great for those who don't want to own their own domain, but want to blog in an already established community. ",
