            "answer_text": "Yes you can prepare for it in two weeks, but whether that is enough time for you depends on what your current level of English is. If let\u2019s say you are quite good at English already, you can write an essay now with only a few errors, you are pretty good at speaking etc and you need a band 7, then you may be ok. In 15 days, if you have enough time, you can go through practice tests for all the modules and pick up a lot of the tips and strategies required to get a high score. However, if you have issues with your grammar, and other skills, for example reading and writing as you say (maybe you are currently around a band 5.5 or 6) and you need to get up to a 7, that is going to be highly unlikely. It takes a considerable amount of time to go up a band, even half a band, if you are needing to improve your English in order to do that, and not just learn tips. So if you have 15 days to prepare for IELTS, find some practice tests online and do as many as you can and go to a website and pick up as many tips as you can plus do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for the test. You\u2019ll also want to practice writing essays and graphs / letters under timed conditions as even with good English skills it can be difficult to write both tasks in one hour. Good luck IELTS buddy ",
