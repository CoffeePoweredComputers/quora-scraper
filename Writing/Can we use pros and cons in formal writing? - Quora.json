The latter phrase is the Latin for \u201cfor and against.\u201d The English rendering\u2014pro and con\u2014is standard. The phrase may function as a noun <the pros and cons>, as an adverb <people argued pro and con>, or as an adjective <arguments pro and con>.\u201d \u201cPro and con has also been used as a verb phrase <to pro-and-con the issue>, and although today this use sounds somewhat odd, it has the sanction of long standing: the OED dates it from 1694. The OED also records the phrase as a preposition <arguments pro and con the proposal>, but for and against would be better. Current ratio: 320:1\u201d Excerpt From: Bryan Garner. \u201cGarner's Modern English Usage.\u201d iBooks. \u200eGarner's Modern English Usage **** The Google Ngram Viewer shows a recent uptick of \u201cpros and cons\u201d in books, but check out the date on the last data. More than a decade ago.  ",

I prefer the more formal words, \u2018advantages and disadvantages\u2019. If the writing is for an essay or other assignment that will be graded, then it would be best to check with the teacher/lecturer/professor concerned to see what words and phrases they consider too informal.
