            "answer_text": "Not very serious. No sorts of disciplinary action will ever be done, formal or informal, and the worst of it is they will not be able to renew their temple recommend unless they choose to stop. Further, it's not an eternal law. When the Word of Wisdom (the health code that among other things states that \u201chot drinks are not for the body or the belly\u201d) was first introduced, it was \u201cnot by way of commandment\u201d but rather guidelines for those attending the school of the prophets, and it was in response to so much tobacco being stuck to the floors. Coffee was among the Mormon pioneers\u2019 rations as they made the long journey from the Midwest to the Rocky Mountains. It was elevated to a \u201ccommandment\u201d later on, some time after the Saints had settled in the valleys of Utah. If you're a member of the church who has tried coffee and wondering how much trouble you're in\u2026 don't stress. You're not in trouble. If you're a member who drinks coffee\u2026 consider whether or not the drink is important enough to you too let it keep you from the blessings of the temple. It isn't for me. (Actually I have plenty of my own reasons not to drink coffee outside the religious reasons). If you're not a member and you're wondering just how much of a \u201cJack Mormon\u201d (member who doesn't follow the Church's teachings) your coffee drinking Mormon buddy is\u2026 don't use coffee as the measure of his righteousness. Heck, there was an apostle who drank coffee and would even swear at the pulpit (my favorite quote from him is \u201cah, hell, Heber, I can't read this!\u201d). If you're not a member and are pressuring a member to drink coffee\u2026 don't feel offended when they say no, and don't apply more pressure. Think of it like getting jabbed in the finger with a pin. You're used to the jabs, they're harmless and even stimulating and even enjoyable, but this guy wants no part of jabbing himself with a pin. Don't make him jab himself just because you like it. ",

            "answer_text": "This is actually an interesting question. A few weeks ago I was going through my grandmothers Book of Remembrance and I found an old Relief Society printed graphic from the late 1950\u2019s-early 1960\u2019s. It was a flow chart outlining the plan of salvation and it had three lines drawn between the earth and the Celestial, Terrestrial and Telestial kingdoms. Line 1 to the Celestial had a drawing of the temple, line 2 to the Terrestrial had a cup of coffee and a cigarette, line 3 to the Telestial had bottles of booze. Pretty cut and dried. I don\u2019t think the modern Church would be quite so dogmatic. Most LDS would say \u201cit\u2019s not that bad a sin, but you shouldn\u2019t do it\u201d\u2026 especially when being asked by an outsider, or in a publicly visible forum such as Quora. But it\u2019s a \u201chighly visible sin\u201d with which Mormons are heavily invested. They focus on it a lot, far more than worrying about if bilking their neighbors with their latest MLM scheme is a moral or honest thing to do. Mormons look down upon those who drink coffee or tea, as if they are physiologically or morally weak. They don\u2019t see that from a gentile perspective the prohibition seems arbitrary and absurd, therefore it need not be respected. This absurdity was only accentuated when the Church legalized caffeinated soft drinks due to Thomas Monson\u2019s love of Pepsi. Drinking coffee won\u2019t get you disfellowshipped or excommunicated and it\u2019s not as bad as smoking or drinking alcohol or doing drugs, but it will get you booted from BYU and keep you from getting a temple recommend if you do it regularly and it will damn sure bring down the unspoken condemnation of your LDS neighbors if they see your Keurig on your countertop. The drinking of it has become somewhat more complicated and morally amibiguous in the Post-Monson era after caffeine was undemonized. Now the LDS can\u2019t point to an addictive drug as the reason for ban (although Mr. Kimmons doesn\u2019t seem to have gotten the memo), they have to say it\u2019s limited to coffee and tea \u201cjust because\u201d the prophets say no coffee and no tea.

            "answer_text": "Exactly 5 Hail Marys and 7 Our Fathers. All kidding aside, it's probably not going to matter much. It's like skipping out on brushing your teeth one morning. Your teeth won't fall out. In fact, the effect of brushing your teeth on any single day is basically zero. The same goes for exercising at the gym. Working out for 20 minutes once gives next to no results. The results are more easily seen in the consistency of the activity.  (Honey Boo Boo knows the struggle.) The point of the Word of Wisdom is to be a personal health code and not just a list of \"thou shalt not\"s. It's an aid to know how to care for your body. Although other statements by other past Presidents of the Church have named coffee and tea as against the Word of Wisdom, this list is obviously not exhaustive. We currently face a lot of things that we already know should not regularly consume or even ingest. You don't need the Word of Wisdom to tell people not to eat Tide Pods.  (Maybe some of us need to be commanded in all things.) As far as why coffee and tea specifically have been prohibited by the Word of Wisdom, it\u2019s probably because of its caffeine content. I have never heard this said directly by anyone in conferences or read this in print except in passing in the following anecdotal story of President David O. McKay: \"During a visit with the queen of the Netherlands in 1952, President and Sister McKay had an interesting experience. The queen had scheduled 30 minutes for a visit with them. President McKay carefully watched the time, and when the half hour was up, he politely thanked the queen and began to leave. 'Mr. McKay,' she said, 'sit down! I have enjoyed this thirty minutes more than I have enjoyed any thirty minutes in a long time. I just wish you would extend our visit a little longer.' He sat down again. Then a coffee table was brought in, and the queen poured three cups of tea, giving one to President McKay, one to Sister McKay, and keeping one for herself. When the queen noticed that neither of her guests drank the tea, she asked, 'Won\u2019t you have a little tea with the Queen?' President McKay explained, 'I must tell you that our people do not believe in drinking stimulants, and we think tea is a stimulant.' She said, 'I am the Queen of the Netherlands. Do you mean to tell me you won\u2019t have a little drink of tea, even with the Queen of the Netherlands?' President McKay responded, 'Would the Queen of the Netherlands ask the leader of a million, three hundred thousand people to do something that he teaches his people not to do?' 'You are a great man, President McKay,' she said. 'I wouldn\u2019t ask you to do that.'\" Teachings of the Presidents of the Church: David O. McKay, p. 103 (emphasis added) But is caffeine really so bad? Depends on your viewpoint. We regularly see adults showing signs of a general caffeine addiction. Lots of kids are overdosing on energy drinks and crashing hard without them. There are even memes of people not being able to function without their coffee:     Is it really such a stretch to think that we\u2019d be better off without it? Now, I drink caffeinated sodas and sometimes energy drinks. I\u2019m not claiming I\u2019m caffeine-free, but I am starting to think that I might be better off without stimulants. So, to go back to the question: how much of a sin is a single cup of coffee? It might not be more than just the breaking of our personal promise not to consume it, but it might impair us from serving the Lord to our best ability. We\u2019re creating an \u201cenergy debt\u201d, borrowing from our future to use in the present, and binding ourselves to a substance to do it. How precisely much of a sin is it for a Mormon to drink a cup of coffee? ",

            "answer_text": "At one point, my sister was in the hospital more than an hour away from where we lived, and my dad was trying to balance visiting her with going to work. This meant commuting between without sleep. So he drank some coffe to get some caffeine him so he would not die at the wheel. That is the only time I have known him to drink coffee. And I do not think God cared. When God told the people of ancient Israel not to eat pork, there was a practical basis for it, as, in those times, pork tended to have many parasites. Despite that, the main reason seems to have been to teach the people discipline and make them distinct. I see the commandment against coffee as pretty much the same. Caffeine really is bad for you, especially if you consume it habitually. But the real reason is a spiritual one. On the one hand, deciding to disregard the injunction to not drink coffee is not intrinsically a terribly harmful thing. On the other hand, if you have covenanted with God not to do it but then decide to do it anyway, in a way, that is actually more serious than many more harmful sins, as God will always judge us based on the difficulty of our circumstances, and following this injunction is ridiculously easy. Anyway, God measures the severity of sin based on the specific situation, so there is no \u201cprecisely\u201d about this. ",

I personally believe that God has told us not to drink coffee in part because it is ridiculously easy to avoid drinking coffee. Name a single religion on the planet that does not ask its adherents to forgo certain natural proclivities? In comparison, avoiding coffee is really not much to ask. How can we expect ourselves to make promises with God and avoid something that can be difficult to control, such as pride and lust, if we can't even give up something as easy as coffee? That being said, if a person drinks coffee to help them survive, as some people do, such as to help them avoid falling asleep on the wheel, I don't think that's a sin. When I was born, I had to be given caffeine just to keep me breathing. Did my parents sin? No, I don't think so. ",

People who like to \u201crank\u201d sins, I find, don\u2019t grasp the concept of \u201csin.\u201d Any disobedience to God\u2019s laws is a sin. There\u2019s no \u201csmall\u201d sin or \u201cbig\u201d sin. It\u2019s just sin. Sin is not a measurable element. It is a boolean variable. Repentance, on the other hand, is measurable, and I think that when we\u2019re talking about these kinds of ranks, what we really should be asking is \u201cHow easy is it to repent of this sin?\u201d Murder, for instance, is quite hard, because we lack the ability to restore someone to life. Ditto for sexual sins and various forms of physical abuse. We can\u2019t \u201cundo\u201d those acts. But while I can\u2019t \u201cundo\u201d a drink of coffee, it\u2019s not hard\u2014and in fact, is very easy for me\u2014to never take another drink of coffee again, so long as I live, thank you very much. Since repentance involves confession and forsaking of the sin, and forsaking is easy to do here, all else involved is similarly easy. But I do have friends who can\u2019t function in their day without their cuppa. For them, it might be a much more difficult process indeed, and thus, a \u201cbigger\u201d sin problem to have than I.

Some high up Mormon decided you shouldn\u2019t drink coffee because it has caffine. Most likely that particular Mormon just didn\u2019t like coffee, so decided it should be a rule. Same thing with beards. It\u2019s only a rule because some guy made it up. Same with the thing about Mormons have bad hair cuts. Some high up Mormon decided if he has a hair cut that looks like he went into a 1950s\u2019 Alabama barber shop,, then all Mormons should look as equally ridiculous. You can spot a Mormon a mile away. Short hair cut.. parted on one side and combed over the top. Just go into a barbershop in Utah and say \u201cGive me the standard Mormon, and you\u2019ll come out looking like the hick from the diner scene in Easy Rider. ",

Attempting to do so is missing the point. There are plenty of things that are obviously worse in all circumstances, but just how bad this particular thing is will depend on the person and their circumstances and their intent. As Mark Blanchard explained, it\u2019s probably not going to get you disfellowshipped, probably not even formally disciplined in most circumstances\u2026 but if you were to, say, be in a temple recommend interview, get to the point where you are asked whether you keep the Word of Wisdom, and respond by pulling out a thermos and a mug and pouring yourself a steaming cup of coffee right there on the Stake President\u2019s desk and chug it down while daring him to say something about it with your eyes\u2026 well, there might be consequences for that. Although, technically, the official reason for any ensuing discipline probably would not cite \u201cviolating the Word of Wisdom\u201d as the core issue. ",

If you told her you'd be there you probably would be careful to do it even though she would understand if you couldn't make it. Some things don't make sense though. Why would you fail to keep your promise and start gulping down coffee if you said you wouldn't do it? ",
