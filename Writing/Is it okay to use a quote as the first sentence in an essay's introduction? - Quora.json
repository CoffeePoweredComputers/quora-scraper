            "answer_text": "If you're going to use a quote that is basically a cliche, then it's shrewd to introduce the quote or to attribute the quote to someone specific. For example, don't start out your essay with the sentence: \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\"  It shows an uncultured essay-writer and reflects lazy writing. Instead, find a quote that is attributed to someone specific that closely resembles the quote you like.  For example, you could start your essay with the following sentence: \"English poet and hymnodist William Cowper exclaimed that 'absence from whom we love is worse than death.' \"  Then you would either agree or disagree with his superlative comparison of \"absence\" vs \"death\" and then support your argument with textual evidence throughout the essay.   Or you could start your essay with \"French maxim-writer Francois de la Rochefoucauld exclaimed that 'absence diminishes mediocre passions and increases great ones.' \"  Then you would either agree or disagree with his analysis that basically claims that if you don't really love someone that much, then absence will make you forget about them, but if you really love someone, then absence will make you crave them a lot!  Then you would support your argument with textual evidence throughout the essay. Please don't use a cliche or a popular quote as a stand-alone to open a research essay.  It's bad form and most readers/educators don't like to read essays that start out in this fashion.  Think, think, think!  And then come up with something that will at least be a bit more nuanced and thoughtful and that might intrigue the reader to do what you want him/her to do with your essay: Keep reading it! Hope this helps. ",

It can be an epigraph.\u00b9____________\u00b9 Epigraph (literature) - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigraph_(literature) In literature, an epigraph is a phrase, quotation, or poem that is set at the beginning of a document or component. The epigraph may serve as a preface, as a summary, as a counter-example, or to link the work to a wider literary canon, either to invite comparison or to enlist a conventional context. Epigraph (literature) - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigraph_(literature) J. K. Rowling's novels frequently begin with epigraphs relating to the themes explored; Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows features a quotation from Aeschylus' tragedy, The Libation Bearers. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man What\u2019s Up With the Epigraph?https://www.shmoop.com/portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-man/epigraph.html Epigraphs are like little appetizers to the great entrance of a story.

An essay is not someone else\u2019s opinion. It is your thoughts, research and arguments. A quote is very much in place in the later structure, possibly even in the thesis, but not as your introductory statement. ",

Citations, such as astounding realities, are successful for drawing in your peruser with the subject of your contention, and cause the peruser to feel like they've been dropped directly into a discussion about the point. Utilizing citations additionally supports your believability since you are refering to an external source to help demonstrate your proposition.
