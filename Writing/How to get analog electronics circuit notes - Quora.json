            "answer_text": "Nice to see your interest in Electronics... As you are looking for electronics notes and hopefully you already have some notes from possible resources. I have some suggestion for you...please please please if you have time then refer any fundamental book of electronics and make own handwritten notes. It will not only help you in understanding of basics but also this process gives you a gut feeling about electronics.# One of the most unique advantages of any subject's notes is...It is to the point resource means less time consuming. But one of the major disadvantage of these notes are...They are not able to speak about the related very elementary concepts (because its totally depends on the writer choice and the way of writing) means not always user friendly. I have providing some link from where you can collect some standard lectures as well as notes...1. NPTEL Video/Audio/Text lectures (Regulated by IIT's )2. Right Click (fb page)3. Neso Academy * Here, I am suggesting some most preferred electronics book.If possible must go through them...a.EDC by- Boylestadb. Microelectronics by- Razavi c. Microelectronics by- Sedra Smith All the Best !!! ",
