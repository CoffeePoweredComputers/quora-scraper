            "answer_text": " New to the work-from-home world? Are you worried about taking the leap to working at home because you\u2019re afraid you have to spend money to make money? You can relax! The truth is that there are plenty of ways to earn an income from home \u2013 a full-time income, no less \u2013 that don\u2019t require any financial investment. I\u2019m going to break down the main types of remote work for you, share legitimate work-at-home opportunities, and even show you how to avoid scams. Let\u2019s dive right in. Employee Work One of the holy grails of work-from-home jobs is landing an employee position with a company online. In these positions, you are not an independent contractor or a freelancer. You are a bona fide employee, and you get all the perks that entails \u2013 from your employer handling your taxes to a host of benefits, like health coverage and PTO and holiday pay. You may also enjoy a greater sense of security, since you\u2019re traditionally employed and not worrying about the end of the project or contract you were hired to complete. Since finding employee work is just like landing a traditional job, you should never have to pay anything to land one. You just apply! There may be some companies who require background checks, and those you\u2019ll have to pay for \u2013 but that\u2019s the only legitimate expense that may be required of you. Here are some employee jobs for your consideration: Alorica at Home \u2013 Alorica provides outsourced communication solutions, and is a popular choice due to their flexible scheduling as demonstrated through their hiring of students and retirees, among others.American Express \u2013 American Express hires both customer service representatives and travel agents to work for them from home \u2013 they pride themselves on their 24-hour concierge service for their members.Hilton@Home \u2013 Hilton hires both sales specialists and customer care reps, so you can find the role that best fits you \u2013 both involve helping folks with their hotel reservations.Sitel Work at Home \u2013 Sitel offers more in the way of customer service work \u2013 just like Alorica, they\u2019re an outsourced customer service solutions company \u2013 though they only hire from certain states.SYKES \u2013 SYKES also hires customer service agents to take inbound calls and help their customers and, like the above companies, they also offer paid training.Independent Contractor Work You\u2019ll find that the most prevalent remote job offers online set you up as an independent contractor \u2013 they pay you an agreed-upon amount for a project or contract, and that\u2019s it. They don\u2019t handle your taxes \u2013 you have to keep track of that. You don\u2019t get any benefits. Often, however, you do get an incredible amount of control over your schedule, making freelancing a very robust option for those with only small, nonconsecutive windows of time to work (stay-at-home moms) or those who keep unconventional hours (night owls!). Not only should you never have to pay anything for independent contractor work \u2013 unless you choose to get yourself a certification to open up your job options \u2013 but you should never give away any work for free when bidding on a job or pursuing a contract. Don\u2019t work on spec \u2013 meaning, don\u2019t create a finished piece of work before the client formally agrees to pay you. Writers and artists, especially don\u2019t write or design for someone who promises you great exposure and nothing else \u2013 remember, exposure is something that people die from. Here are some independent contractor jobs for your consideration: Freelance Writing \u2013 You can write anywhere, anytime \u2013 find paying jobs by working through a service (like BKA Content or Scripted) or by checking job boards (like ProBlogger).Transcription \u2013 There are many companies out there hiring transcriptionists \u2013 check out 23 companies here that welcome beginners \u2013 and this is one gig you can grow into a career by specializing into medical or legal transcription (which involves certification).User Testing \u2013 You won\u2019t make a living wage this way, but it\u2019s good side gig money \u2013 especially if you fall into the most targeted demographics and can land a lot of tests. $10 for 20 minutes of your time isn\u2019t a bad ratio.Teaching English \u2013 This industry is growing fast \u2013 every time I turn around, I seem to find another English as a Second Language tutoring company; most have relaxed requirements (you just need to be a native English speaker), but many also require a college degree.Moderation \u2013 There are so many unruly communities on the Internet \u2013 from social media to message boards to comments sections \u2013 that many big companies need help moderating those spaces and ensuring community guidelines are being followed. Check out companies like ModSquad and ICUC for open positions.Watch Out for Scams Have you ever heard the phrase, \u201cthere\u2019s a sucker born every minute?\u201d Unfortunately, there are many unscrupulous people out there in the world that have heard the same. While the Internet has been a great equalizer in making remote work available to more people, it\u2019s also made it easier for scammers to prey on people. Here\u2019s a good rule of thumb to follow: if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Start Your Own Business There are exceptions to every rule, of course, and some types of work-from-home jobs do require an upfront investment. But that investment should be in yourself \u2013 like buying a headset to perform customer service work, or purchasing materials to craft jewelry that you plan to sell in an online shop. Or formally starting your own business \u2013 or increasing your marketable skills through courses and certifications. There\u2019s still plenty you can do without spending any money upfront, of course \u2013 you just may need to put in a bit of sweat equity! Doing business as yourself, build your brand, your portfolio, your reputation and earn an income. Here are a few businesses you can start today: Social Media Manager \u2013 Build a basic website for free at WordPress.com and start looking for customers; curate your own social media professionally until you build a portfolio and testimonials.Graphic Designer \u2013 If you\u2019ve got the design skills, flaunt them! Build a free website to host your portfolio, and hustle through various job boards (like Authentic Jobs) for clients until you build your rep.Freelance Writer \u2013 A lot of the jobs mentioned above can be done with you as the boss as well! Freelance writing is one of my favorite remote opportunities for those looking for a flexible schedule and great earnings potential. Learn more here.Virtual Assistant \u2013 If you come from an administrative or customer service background. Virtual assisting may be for you. Small \u2013 and large \u2013 businesses worldwide are outsourcing their office tasks these days. Turn your skills into cash. Learn more here and here.Transcription \u2013 If you have excellent typing and listening skills, you can start a transcription business. This industry isn't for everyone, however. This free 7-day course can help you determine whether it would be a good fit for you.Proofreading \u2013 Maybe you love grammar, but aren't interested in becoming a writer. There's also a large demand for online proofreaders. This is definitely one you will need the skills for, however.Ready to start that work-from-home career now? That\u2019s what I thought! There\u2019s no money required, so get out there and get started. ",

            "answer_text": "How to Make Money Online Without Investment (The Top 10 Ways) If you think about \u2018how to make money online without investment\u2019 long enough, you will see that earning money in some cases is quite a paradox. Everyone wants to make money online, but few people are waiting to put a lot of time or money into it. Time will always have to stop you, so many people try to find jobs where you have to put in as little money as possible. Before I go any further, it is important to say that no job requires no money at all. In principle you will always have to submit something. But below I have outlined 9 ways in which you have virtually nothing to spend and still make money. Moreover, you can almost all of them from home, so that is included Make Money Online Way 1 \u2013 Blogging  the most popular and well-known form to earn without investment. Moreover, if you get well, you can write about blogs you like, so the work is fun to do. You can get your own section on existing websites or blogs, or start your own blog website. It is useful not to start all the way right for yourself, because then you can sometimes have difficulty attracting the public. When you are familiar with a certain audience, you can make the switch (or start) with your own blog. Payment via the existing websites is per blog, and the blogs of your own page can be paid so that people have to deposit a small amount to read them. But the best way, and you\u2019re probably going to see that again here, is to place ads on your blogs. Every time people click on those ads, you get paid for it. Make Money Online Way 2 \u2013 Freelancing  Something you can do is freelancing. Where you write about things you like when blogging, you make your profession when freelancing. Web design, advice, photography, making videos, you name it. You work according to your own schedule and you are doing what you are good at (and hopefully what you like). You get paid by the customer through that work. These customers are usually temporary, so you are not connected to anything. Incidentally, it is important to emphasize that you therefore need some skill before you get started. Nice to say that you are a master in web design while you are already struggling to make your Word document fun, you are not going to bring anything. Make Money Online Way 3 \u2013 Online Writing  Many websites often require new posts to be written to keep the site up-to-date and to keep attracting people. But many companies also specialize in writing pieces of text for websites and regularly search for new staff. With the pieces of text you can think of an informative article, or advertising texts. So just make sure that you are a bit skilled in writing, so that companies or websites want you. If you do not have that, of course that is not a disaster. You can often simply go to the internet for no money and search for useful tips and tricks to write a beautiful piece. Informative blogs are often a good starting point. Make Money Online Way 4 \u2013 Affiliate Marketing  Affiliate marketing mean that you will promote a certain brand, be it on your own website or at other sites. The brands you promote pay you per sale that comes through your promotion. So if you\u2019re persuading people to buy Gillette\u2019s new blades for a brand like Gillette on your own site or a site about shaving. They\u2019ll pay you for those people who have persuaded you. Of course that does not mean that you just have to advertise Gillette on every website, because 9 times out of 10 there is an affiliate program that you have to sign up for. When you have registered for it, you can start right away. Make Money Online Way 5: Trial shopper  This is a somewhat less known and less accessible job, but some chains or stores want to know first if their product is good or works. That is why they often first search for test subjects to test these products. They can do that at panels, but there are also online groups that offer this kind of work. So you can join one of those groups or panels, and become a trial shopper. You will usually receive the product at home, after which you will be asked to try it out for a certain period of time. Then they ask for your opinion and you are paid for your services. To be more detailed: no, you do not have to pay those products yourself first. Often they are not completely finished, so you are a kind of beta tester. Sometimes it can mean that you have to go somewhere to test the product. It may even be the case that you have to check the rooms for a hotel chain. Then you have to be there of course. But I have to say once again that this is often a market where the supply of testers is often larger than the demand for it. So it is an area that is difficult to enter, but it is an area that rewards. Make money alongside other jobs The following tips are often ways in which you have to do very little per day, but of course you will not get paid much for it. From now on, you should not really see it as a job, but as a kind of mini-job job where you fill in, read, or view quickly and earn some money quickly. So you can earn a nice pocket money here alongside other ways to make money, and they can also be combined perfectly. All the following ways you can easily do from behind your computer, so convenience is also a nice extra. For example, every day for 10 minutes doing some tasks, and you have earned some money again. Make Money Online Way 6 \u2013 Read Ads  You can specify at different website where you are paid to read advertisements. It is a great way, if you set aside 10 to 20 minutes a day, to earn some money quickly and easily. You will then receive an account with those websites, and if you are logged in you will see a list of advertisements from which you can choose. Sometimes you are paid by advertisement, but often you must have read a minimum number of advertisements before you are paid. But still, for about fifteen minutes of work that does not matter that much? Make Money Online Way 7: Micro jobs  In addition to reading ads, you can also register to do a small task daily or several times a week. Think of sharing a link, posting a comment, or watching a video. So you get paid. Depending on your job and which website you are enrolled in, you can spend a bit more time per day. Then think about maybe an hour or two. Of course you get paid more for this than reading ads, but again: you are more involved with it. Make Money Online Way 8: Surveys  One of the most well-known ways to earn some pocket money quickly is to fill in surveys where you fill in a single or a number of questionnaire (s) per day (or a number of days) where your opinion is asked. Look here, however, well with it, because because it is just so known many websites are eager to lift people here. So look carefully before you get started. Make Money Online Way 9: Solve Captcha  In addition to surveys, advertisements, and micro jobs, you can also register with websites where you solve captchas and get paid for it. If you have forgotten what a captcha is, below is a picture. Often when you download things or create an account, you have to solve them. Especially creating an account is sometimes an annoyance for companies. They often want to create large numbers of accounts on different websites, which they do through specialized software. But a captcha has just been made to keep computers out and \u2018prove that you are a real person\u2019. That\u2019s why they often hire people who solve the captcha\u2019s. Make Money Online way 10: YouTube  Just like with the Proefshopper, this is also a bit of a long shot . But that does not mean that you can earn a little pocket money with YouTube depending on how many times your videos are watched. If you want to Make Money Online through YouTube, you have to remember and apply a number of things. Firstly, it will probably take a while before you earn enough money with it. It is not that you earn $ 0.50 per person who watched your video. The \u2018big\u2019 money will eventually come through advertising that you allow on your channel and movies. You can set up your channel that, for example, can place Google commercials with your videos, and then you get paid for the people you send through your videos. You can also ensure that you are connected to a brand and promote it in your videos. In fact, that is also a sort of affiliate job that way. Still a few tips. First, use clickbait. Clickbait is when you change the title of your video and the thumbnail (picture that you see next to the title that indicates your movie) so that people feel attracted to the video. There are a lot of different blogs, videos, etc. to find where you can learn to apply this. Secondly, it makes sense to let your videos last more than 10 minutes. From 10 minutes you can place more ads on your video that increases your income. Now only get the views. Do anyone know more ideas or have any doubt regarding the article please comment below ",
