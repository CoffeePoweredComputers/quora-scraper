            "answer_text": "I think I am pretty good! However, people usually specialize in specific genres of photography and tend to excel in one or two genres. Such as wedding, fashion, wildlife, etc. People who are very good in one genre may not necessarily be equal good with another genre. I practice travel and nature photography, and also work on commissioned assignments for real-estate / hospitality firms. I have had the good fortune to bag a few national and international awards.

            "answer_text": "To be honest, I\u2019m still an amateur. The quest for learning is never ending and when I look at the work of some photographers and their skills involved, it always amazes me how creativity and imagination can be taken to a different level altogether. How some of them are able to see beauty in the most unexpected places and capture that beauty in a photograph. I feel happy to share some of my work, with a bunch of like minded folks. A Teary face  Nothing in this world is more contagious than a genuine smile \u2764\ufe0f  Beautiful & Messy!  Someday's you never want the Road to end!  Bond of sisters!
