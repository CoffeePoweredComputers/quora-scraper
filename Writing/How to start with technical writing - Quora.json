            "answer_text": "Nowadays it\u2019s extremely easy to get started building up a useful resum\u00e9, even if you have no prior experience. It\u2019s never been important to have a degree in technical communications, or even a certificate of any kind. In fact, a college degree in any other field would probably impress potential employers more. During my technical writing career, I saw physicists, computer scientists, midwives, and any number of others getting hired and doing great work as technical writers. An easy way to start racking up resum\u00e9 credit is go head over to github.com, pick a project or two, and start contributing to the documentation. Contribute a lot! But make sure people like your work. It\u2019s no good to contribute if people don\u2019t think your contribution is valuable. Take the time and put in the effort to make your contributions really stellar. Once you\u2019ve cemented yourself as a valuable contributor, just go ahead and contribute so much that you become the defacto documentation maintainer. Whenever anyone offers suggestions or corrections, always respond promptly and usefully. Pretty soon you\u2019ll have a solid set of docs to show any potential employer. Always make use of spell checkers and grammar checkers. And read up on the rules of grammar yourself. No one will hire you if you make a lot of typos in communications during the hiring process. Write a book! There is always a demand for books on the latest versions of open source projects. Aim for a project that is far enough along to be useful, but still new enough to not have tons and tons of books already available. A lot of technical books are highly formulaic, and you can get tons of perfectly workable ideas from perusing the tables of contents of any of them. The best part is, if you don\u2019t find a publisher, you can release the book in open source form and become a total folk hero! Here\u2019s an example to get started: At the time of this writing, no big publisher carries a book about the Plover open source stenographic typing system. You could corner that market! So yeah. Those are some ideas for how to get started. Enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": " Most people are already technical writers but they are not even aware of it. For example, have you ever written a shopping list?
