            "answer_text": "There are not probably but undisputed many.. But there was something about William Faulkner\u2019s these lines from one of his most iconic novel, \u201cThe Sound and the Fury\u201d. \u201cI give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire...I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all of your breath trying to conquer it. Because no battle is ever won he said. They are not even fought. The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools.\u201d \u201cWonder. Go on and wonder.\u201d \u201cClocks slay time... time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels; only when the clock stops does time come to life.\u201d \u201cA man is the sum of his misfortunes. One day you'd think misfortune would get tired but then time is your misfortune\u201d \u201cI'd have wasted a lot of time and trouble before I learned that the best way to take all people, black or white, is to take them for what they think they are, then leave them alone.\u201d Now to some these lines may seem depressing and very philosophical but that is the very purpose of literature, to grab one\u2019s arm and bring him to the light, even the hold is too arid or agonizing.. Great writers never bother about the hurt their words can inflict to people\u2019s hearts, they write for the sake of it and its a sort of responsibility too.., to make people aware of the truth of human plight, the decadence of its very state.. and great writers never shy away from presenting it through their words.. Although a lot many out there prefer only those who write what people want.. But honestly that\u2019s not literature, that\u2019s Business by the way! ",

            "answer_text": "At first it seemed like a frivolous exercise\u2014a parlor game\u2014to select one sentence or passage out of the canon of world literature and call it \u201cthe greatest.\u201d Yet I could not resist glancing at quotes others provided. One half of me wondered if I shared others\u2019 preferences, while the other half\u2014my better half\u2014was curious to learn new lines I had not read or heard before. Bonding with the familiar and discovery of the unknown\u2014two forces in constant conflict and equipoise, like Jacob and the angel. When I scrolled down the document of favorite lines, I found a basket brimming with lines I knew and loved and others I was delighted to learn. The sum of so many favorite lines produces a verbal mosaic, inducing a mesmeric effect. Each person\u2019s contribution is like a Rorschach or a fingerprint\u2014it tells you something about an individual that sets him or her apart from others. Reading great lines provided by complete strangers was like watching people jump into a pool of cool water on a dog day. How could I resist joining in? Yet no sooner did I resolve to provide the greatest literary line according to me, then all of the great lines, having heard the news, crowded my consciousness like holiday shoppers waiting for a door buster sale to begin. Lines of Shakespeare, Coleridge, Whitman, Tennyson, Dickinson, Ginsberg and Eliot barked and whispered in my head. There were Tolstoy openers and Babel closers. \u201cWhat is once well done is done forever!\u201d Thoreau cried out. \u201cI must create a system or be enslaved by another man\u2019s; I will not reason and compare: my business is to create,\u201d William Blake shouted over him.  I admired them all, but soon realized that deciding which was the greatest of the great would be an invidious process of vagary and attrition producing a random, yet calculated result. In other words, it would resemble a literary contest, in which a committee in my head hashed out a winner after hours of tedious argument. Yet despite the hardship it imposed, collecting and sorting out seemed the safe and superficial way of determining my greatest literary line\u2014it was more like settling on it than finding it. To arrive at my greatest literary line, I needed to travel back to a time when words held most power over me, to excavate phrases so deeply rooted in my mind that I live by them without thinking about them. I needed to revisit my personal sacred text, the foundational document that called to me when I needed guidance or amusement. I returned to Kohelet, known to many as Ecclesiastes, a short part of the Hebrew Bible or Tanach. Kohelet is believed to have been written by King Solomon, but this is a mythical attribution, not a historical one. Even so, Solomon was the builder of the Holy Temple, husband to the Queen of Sheba, a wise monarch who ruled in peace and was as close to an Epicurean as any Israelite ever was or could be. For these reasons he seemed a likely candidate to have written Kohelet. Kohelet is not a novel, a story, or even a book of poetry\u2014it is more like a quarry of thought. It could easily provide proverbs for a theme calendar on a kitchen wall. Yet this short work is full of powerful statements, blunt and skeptical, poetic and incantatory. Here are my nominees for favorite lines of literature from one of my personal sacred texts. 12:8 Vanity of vanities, says the preacher; all is vanity. (Whenever I take things too seriously, which is most of the time, I remember the line above. In the here and now, each thing we do has importance to ourselves and others, but in the long view, it has no importance whatsoever\u2014a bewildering paradox.) 2:11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done, and on the labor that I had labored to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun. (The author has taken the core insight that \u201call is vanity\u201d and applied it to himself. \u201cAll is vanity\u201d is no longer a flippant throwaway line, but a heavy load, a life sentence. It is personal and painful and the author makes me feel the weight of it.) 1:18 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow. (In a time ruled by reason, science and technology, this line is counter-intuitive. Many believe that knowledge is power, and the more we know, the better off we are. This line reminds us of the prohibitive price knowledge charges us. See Pandora\u2019s box, fossil fuels, nuclear fission\u2026) 11:1 Cast your bread upon the waters: for you will find it after many days. (No effort is wasted. Everything we do has consequences. I want to believe this, yet I\u2019m not sure it is true. And maybe not knowing if it is true makes it even better because it calls upon me to have faith.) 10:8 He who digs a pit will fall in it; and whoever breaks a hedge, a snake will bite him. (It is a bitter consolation that the bad things people do are often as ineffectual and self-defeating as their virtuous acts. Even so, I want to believe that \u201cwhat goes around, comes around.\u201d) 7:20 For there is not a just man upon earth, that does good, and sins not. (This is good to remember when I become self-righteous, or conversely, when I torment myself relentlessly for making a mistake. As a human being, I am doomed to imperfection\u2014which doesn\u2019t excuse me from trying to improve.) 9:11 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happens to them all. (Life is arbitrary, despite our wish to have it make sense.) 9:16 Then I said, \u201cWisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.\u201d (It is painful, but true, at least in America, that \u201cmoney talks.\u201d We equate wisdom with wealth. As the saying goes, \u201cIf you\u2019re smart, why aren\u2019t you rich?\u201d) 9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know nothing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. (Knowing I will die is hard to bear, but living with death is better than being dead. Until I hear reports to the contrary, I will rejoice in my life and try to make the most of each moment.) 1:3 What profit has a man of all his labor which he takes under the sun? 1:4 One generation passes away, and another generation comes: but the earth abides forever. (This idea is universal to all faiths. It reminds us that individual existence is small and finite, but the life force and the cosmos are eternal. This is no doubt the basis of all faith\u2014the acknowledgement that we are part of something infinite and timeless.) What do you know? I started by scoffing at this \u201cparlor game\u201d of greatest literary lines and I ended up giving a Sunday School lesson that no one asked for\u2014Me, an agnostic! ",
