            "answer_text": "I have several go to exercises. I\u2019ve been doing them a long time. This is a variation on one I was taught by Noreen Stone who was my first screenwriting instructor. I like to sit in a public place, a cafe, a train station, an airport, and pick people out. It might be a couple at a table, it might be two people arguing across the street - it doesn\u2019t matter, your eye will guide you. Then, I write a story about them. I use the real details I\u2019m seeing (he\u2019s wearing his best suit, but it doesn\u2019t fit as well as it used to) (She\u2019s deliberately dressed down, trying hard not to send the wrong signals\u2026) their shoes, how close they sit, the gestures they make, and I invent an entire story around them. Why are they there, whats the core drama? You find so much in these little details, and they, in themselves, inform the drama a little further. What does this teach us as writers in fiction? Details matter. What details you choose to give your reader change their perception, and deepen their sense of connection to the reality of your story. In training yourself to see these details in others, you learn to see them in your own fictional characters. Just don\u2019t stare too hard, or you\u2019ll creep them out. The moment they\u2019re aware of the observation, you\u2019ve altered the experiment forever. ",
