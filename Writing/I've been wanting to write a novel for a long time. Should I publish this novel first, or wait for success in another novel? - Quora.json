            "answer_text": "I think you're jumping the gun a little. Firstly you need to write the thing before you start thinking about whether it should be published. With that being said, I've written multiple novels and I have decided not to get them published because 1. I thought I could do better 2. I want my debut novel to be the best that it can be.  What does that mean? I simply recognized that the novels that I wrote were created merely for experimentation and a desire to write, not out of a desire to tell anyone a particular story. I honestly think most of the novels I've ever written are pure trash.  I'd suggest writing your novel and then seeing if: It has a message in it you think is worth sharing.It is something you're comfortable showing to other people. If you write something very personal, you might find that you don't want thousands of other people to read what you've written.You're ok with the level of writing it is at, and understand that your debut novel is also the first representation of yourself as a writer you will be putting out there publicly. 20 years down the road, will you be comfortable with your employers reading that book? -- Are you 100% comfortable with possibly type-casting yourself as writer into that genre? If there is an audience for your book in the first place. If there isn't a different book you've written, that you are more proud and/or that you like more.But again, before you even ask yourself these questions, I'd recommend writing the book first.  Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "For the love of... Look, every single novel ever written is pretty much a story the writer has WANTED to tell. Frankly, if you want to write your novel, JUST WRITE IT!!! Don't wait for success with another novel first. It will most likely NEVER go into print if you do. Indeed, there's a pretty good chance of you NEVER being printed if that's what you intend to do.  Now I have a book in the works. I have other books that I want to write, BUT I want to write the one that I'm writing AS WELL.  Besides which, if you write without the desire to write the book you're writing, chances are that you will NEVER put enough into it. Do you even HAVE a second book in mind? Does the story compel you to write it? If the answers to these questions is no, then really, don't bother with them. Write the book you're talking about and take the damn leap. For better or worse, that's what you need to do. ",

            "answer_text": "Your description of your situation isn't very clear. If you've long wanted to write a novel, have you started writing it? Indeed, have you finished writing one? If not either, it's a moot point. Get started on that first. Everything else is just a detail at this point. If you do have a finished manuscript, my advice is to get that published first and get started on your second novel. The reason is simple. You can't sit around and wait for 'success' in another novel because you don't know when that time will come. It might never come. You don't want to leave things too late. If the first novel doesn't pan out, then at least you'll have the second one for another crack at the game. ",

            "answer_text": "I wrote my first novel with a lot of inexperience and a severe lack of planning and clear direction. It has been 13 months since I finished. I did a small series of edits, before I realized that the project was to jagged to piece together into anything coherent. I started writing my second novel and it has gone a lot smoother. I have done a lot more planning and have solidified my ideas and themes before I finished. I\u2019m not sure if you have already written your first novel or not, but if you already have, I suggest re-reading and decide whether you can edit it into something publishable. If the answer is no, then begin another novel and focus on making that one better from the start by using the experience you gained from the first novel. If you haven\u2019t written one yet, then I would suggest writing all the way through and just seeing how it turns out. Some writers have success with their first novels. ",
