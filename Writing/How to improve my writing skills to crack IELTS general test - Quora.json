            "answer_text": "1. Question Analysis You must first understand the question to know exactly what the examiner is looking for. One of the biggest mistakes students make is not answering the question properly. If you do not answer the question fully, you can\u2019t score higher than a Band 5. In order to do this, you must first identify the question type, then identify the keywords in the question and finally identify the instructions words in order to find out what the examiner wants you to do with the question. We will look at these skills in more detail below. 2. Planning The students who get the highest marks plan before they write and they often plan for up to 10 minutes. Planning helps you organise your ideas and structure before you write, saving you time and helping you write a clear essay. 3. Introduction The introduction should tell the examiner what the rest of the essay is about and also answer the question directly. This tells the examiner that you know what you are doing straight away and helps you write your main body paragraphs. 4. Main Body Paragraphs This is where you give the examiner more detail. You do this by stating your main points and supporting these with explanations and relevant examples. 5. Conclusion Here you provide a summary of what you have already said in the rest of the essay. That\u2019s it you\u2019re done! See below for articles on the specific skills you need to do this and full lessons on each different question type. IELTS Writing Task 2 Essential Information Below are 10 essential facts about Task 2. Many students worry about these small details instead of focusing on what really matters- improving your performance. These facts will help you understand what the test is and how it is scored so that you can move on to improving your performance. You must write an essay in response to a question.It is important that you write 250 words or more.You should spend around 40 minutes on this part of the test.Task 2 is worth 2/3 of your total mark on the Writing test.General Training and Academic are essentially the same for Task 2, but different for Task 1.There are certain types of questions you will be asked, such as opinion, discussion etc. See below for more detail on these.You will be assessed in four areas:Task Achievement (25%)Coherence and Cohesion (25%)Lexical Resource (25%)Grammatical Range and Accuracy (25%)The questions will be about common topics that most people in the world should be aware of.The most important thing is that you can demonstrate that you can clearly communicate in English.The key to doing well is to know exactly what the examiners want and giving it to them.IELTS Writing Task 2 Preparation Many people know that they need to improve their writing, but have no idea how to do that. Below is the methodology that I use with all of my successful students.  Understand You must first understand what the IELTS Writing Task 2 is, what the examiners expect you to do and how to give the examiners what they want. This is the first stage and one that is often overlooked. There are a huge number of online resources, often with conflicting and poor quality information, so finding a reliable source of information is key. Identify If your car broke down, you would try and identify which part caused the problem. If you are sick, your doctor will run tests to find out the exact cause of your symptoms. Task 2 is exactly the same. We must first identify WHY you are not getting the score you need before we can move to the next stage. However, be very careful! You wouldn\u2019t ask the average man on the street for medical advice, so make sure you find someone who actually knows what they are doing to help you with this. Fix Now that we know what the problems are we must fix these problems. If your grammar needs work, fix those issues. If your vocabulary is lacking, work on fixing this issue. Just like a good doctor will be able to help you fix a medical issue, a good IELTS teacher will be able to help you fix your particular issues. Practice and Feedback Practice alone is not going to help you. It is an essential part of your preparation, but you must also get feedback on your work if you are really going to improve. You wouldn\u2019t try to teach yourself how to drive without an instructor, would you? Find someone who will give you accurate and helpful feedback on your work. If you don\u2019t, you will not be able to move to the last stage. Improvement Now that you understand what you need to do, you\u2019ve identified the exact areas you need to work on, you\u2019ve improved those areas and got feedback on your work, you are ready to improve and get the score you need. You are not ready to get the IELTS Writing Task 2 score you deserve. ",

            "answer_text": "Improving on your writing skills: well, it will depend on what your level is at present. To do well in Writing, you need to ensure that you do not repeat expressions, words, points and even sentence structures in the course of your writing. You don\u2019t have to write very difficult words or expressions at all. But avoid slangs and make sure that they are appropriate for the situation. The paragraphs need to be balanced, and well-developed. Each paragraph must have a topic sentence followed by elaboration. And possibly a closing sentence. The topics will never be difficult ones but they will require you to give your response clearly in your essay. A regular practice of writing - one every 2/3 days should help you stay in touch. Don\u2019t burn yourself out but don\u2019t allow you to get rusty either. It is nice if you can get your writings checked out by a friend/colleague who can provide you some constructive feedback. Remember, you don\u2019t need to be a scholar to crack IELTS Writing ! Samit Sengupta www.english-academy.in ",
