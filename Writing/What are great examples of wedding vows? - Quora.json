            "answer_text": "A few years ago, I was getting ready for a wedding I was scheduled to officiate for that afternoon. A couple of hours before the wedding, I picked up my Bible and looked on my desk for the small notebook with the wedding vows I've used for the last 30 years. With increasing anxiety, I discovered my wedding vows notebook was missing. I had apparently misplaced it after another ceremony I had done a few weeks earlier. Sadly, that faithful notebook was gone, vanished, and nowhere to be found. I went online and tried to find suitable wedding vows, but nothing seemed to work. With less than an hour to spare, I sat down and wrote from memory a version of the vows I've used all those years. Here is what I wrote: The Promise of Marriage: Dan, do you take Andrea, to be your wedded wife, to live together in marriage? Do you promise to love her, comfort her, honor her, and forsaking all others, be faithful to her, for as long as you both shall live? (Bride repeat) Exchanging of vows: I Dan, take you Andrea, to be my lawfully wedded wife. To have and to hold, from this day forward, in sickness and in health, for better for worse, for richer or poorer, for all of our lives. I promise, before God and these witnesses, to be your loving and faithful husband, until death parts us, I ask God's help in keeping this solemn vow. (Bride repeat) The Ring Ceremony: The ring is a symbol of Eternity. It has no end and no beginning. The gold has been proven true having been forged and tested in fire. May your love also be true and eternal as you live your lives together. (Placing the ring on the third finger of his / her left hand, repeat after me) With this ring, I give to you, all that I am, and all that I have, in token and pledge, of our constant faith, and abiding Love, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. After pronouncing the couple husband and wife, I read a verse from the Bible, Ruth 1:16, 17 (I know this is Ruth speaking to her mother-in-law, Naomi, but it always seems perfect for a wedding ceremony). This passage chokes me up every time: And Ruth said, \"Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.\" I never found my old wedding vows and I've been using these ever since. Should you decide to use these or any form of them for your wedding, please do as I would be honored. Please let me know if you do. Best wishes for the perfect wedding.
