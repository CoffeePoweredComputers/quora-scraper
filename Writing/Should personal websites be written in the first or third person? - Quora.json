            "answer_text": "How formal do you need to be for your audiences? I don't think there is a set style, either way.   I run a site for an independent retailer with a strong owner who has specific points of view that he likes to express.  That means the business site has lot of first person writing on it -- which has gleaned a lot of positive feedback from customers. It's part of the storytelling nature of the company owner. The approach builds a community and it creates a stronger bond with audiences. The building of personal brands and expert profile online -- like what we do on Quora -- requires first person accountability. So, a blog on your site could have a lot of \"I think\" \"I said\" \"I know\" commentary. It's how we draw a line in the sand and invite feedback. It demonstrates \"how\" we think along with \"what\" we know. Lawyers, doctors and other professionals from more conservative sectors might need to take a more third-person approach to content to maintain the boundaries required for their services. And certainly, a straight ahead credentials page, outlining services and other offerings, might be best in a third-person voice. Not sure that answers your question, but in my experience  web culture invites a personal POV through content -- and the opinions, commentary and rhetoric are what connect best with readers, or at least your fans who want to listen (agreeing or disagreeing) to your POV.  You can maintain a professional demeanor and still speak in a first-person voice. You can be provocative and still not alienate customers who are not aligned 100% with your thinking.  Just think three-dimensionally about what you are putting out there and remember what you audience needs and expects. ",

            "answer_text": "There are three choices for this, first person singular (\"I\"), first person plural (\"we\") and third person (\"they\"). In making this decision ask yourself:   What is our brand?Who are our clients/customers?Who in our company represents us publicly?What do we want clients and prospect to think about when they contemplate doing business with us?In a sole proprietorship style professional services company, first person is the best approach. In this case your company (which might consist of one person) has a single, highly visible, respected authority figure, such as a lawyer or accountant, as its leader and spokesperson. People are paying for this person's expertise and counsel. Clients are often unable to distinguish between the firm and the leader, which is as it should be in this setting. By using first person singular, you begin the one-on-one conversations with prospects who will eventually become clients. If the clients you typically target expect a larger organization with more resources than a sole proprietorship, you could use first person plural. Statements using this voice reflect teamwork and collaboration, and an ownership and pride in the business. When you write \"We manufacture the industry's only molecular stamping devices,\" customers immediately envision the people in the company and the products.  If your target customers are conservative in nature, and/or your company is in a traditional or formal business, third person is worth consideration. Third person is often considered journalistic style. You are reporting on the company just as a journalist reports on a story or a novelist might write a narrative. For this reason, third person often seems the most credible to people, since it has an objective arms-length aspect to it. A company in the pharmaceutical business, or one that prepares transcripts of legal proceedings, might choose third person to convey formality and objectivity. ",
