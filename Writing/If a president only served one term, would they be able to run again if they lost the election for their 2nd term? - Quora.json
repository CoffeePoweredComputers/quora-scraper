            "answer_text": "The 22nd Amendment prevents a U.S. president from subsequent reelection once he or she has served two terms. If a vice president succeeds to the presidency because the sitting president dies or resigns, then they are considered to have \u201cserved\u201d a term if they are in office for more than half of the original president\u2019s term. So, Lyndon Johnson was eligible to run for a third term in 1968 because his first term was really just the last 14 months of John F. Kennedy\u2019s original term. Conversely, had Gerald Ford been reelected in 1976, he would have been term limited in 1980 because he had served the final two and a half years of Richard Nixon\u2019s term. In other words, we think of a two-term limit as just meaning eight years, but it is possible for a president to serve anywhere between six years and one day and nine years and 364 days before the 22nd Amendment would actually apply. However, there is no limit on how many times a person can run for president, provided they have not set served. A president who loses their reelection bid after one term is still free to do what Grover Cleveland did in the pre-22nd Amendment era and return to seek the presidency later. Jimmy Carter would be eligible to run for president in 2020 if he wanted to. And if Donald Trump is defeated in 2020, he would be constitutionally eligible to try to run again in 2024 - and I would bet that if he does lose in 2020, there will quickly be speculation that he might try to do just that.

            "answer_text": "Oh yes, the 22nd amendment says nothing about presidents service two non-consecutive terms. And don\u2019t think for a second that Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to consider running again if he loses\u2026  For much of his life, Donald Trump has tried to be the centre of attention. As a businessman he: In the 1980s he built this shockingly golden lobby:  In the 1990s he started to appear in pop culture:  In the 2000s he did ridiculous publicity stunts:  In the 2010s he did serious publicity stunts:  He did all of these things for two reasons: he loved the attention, and he wanted the job which would put him figuratively at the centre of the universe \u2014 the presidency. Do you really think he could just concede the election and retire from public life? Hell no! While there is a chance he could be forcibly routed from the party if his base turns against him, he currently has almost total control of the GOP. If he is forced out in 2020, I am sure he will do everything in his power to be back in the centre of attention once more. Also, his base these days is pretty solid. There is always a chance we could see Trump 2020, Trump 2024, Trump 2028, Trump 2032\u2026\u2026. ",
