They're really looking for organization of thoughts in the essay \u2014 content is only marginally important if that. Same with the SAT/ACT essay. The emphasis is usually flipped in an introductory English college course where writing essays is the main point of interest. I\u2019d see if I could skip English writing courses at all costs in college. As a Philosophy major they would've driven me up the wall, and I like writing. I got a 5 in AP Lang and a 4 in AP Lit, and never had to take an English course in college. Thank god. I had other projects to focus on. My best friend, an engineer, comes to mind. Sometimes her writing is hilariously bad. She hated her technical writing course (yes, the one made for engineers) with a passion, but she also didn't try terribly much. Point being \u2014 the course was annoying to juggle with her lab work. ",
