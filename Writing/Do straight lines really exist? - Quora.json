            "answer_text": "Of course, they do! I see several on the page I\u2019m looking at. Carpenters, machinists, draftsmen, artists, construction workers and others have created and used straight lines countless times and for several millennia. People who deny straight lines exist simply don\u2019t know what \u201cstraight\u201d means. Or, they\u2019re trying to adjudicate for the rest of us some private philosophical meaning where molecules, atoms, or smaller particles no one can even see are perfectly aligned. But who says we\u2019re bound to these private definitions? When most people say something is straight, they know\u2014and the people concerned with whatever it is they need to adjudge to be \u201cstraight\u201d know\u2014that they mean straight to the extent any of them can perceive or measure, and as is suitable for a practical purpose. They don\u2019t mean to some humanly-impossible, microscopic standard. But some people have nothing better to do than to argue over unrealistic\u2014and impractical\u2014definitions. In fact, what they are doing is destroying definition, because to define is to restrict criteria\u2014not to extend them to absurd and useless levels. I look around me in this room and see straight lines everywhere. Or, at least things that could not have been usefully built without straight lines achieved through mechanical or electronic means. It\u2019s interesting to note that\u2014without fail\u2014these \u201cDoes/Do X(s) exist?\u201d questions are found under topics that contain the word \u201cPhilosophy.\u201d Their sole purpose is not to generate answers but rather aimless debate and denial of things all of us know by common use and ordinary meanings.  straight (Source: Merriam-Webster) : free from curves, bends, angles, or irregularities : generated by a point moving continuously in the same direction and expressed by a linear equation : plumb, vertical These all have real, practical meanings honest individuals use without confusion.

            "answer_text": "Not being silly at all.It's a popular question that has people arguing and theorising for hours sometimes. No straight line exists anywhere in the universe, ever. what Joel V Benjamin said. Theoretically as said by User-11990154866902071077 lasers are as close as we can get, but even then, they're not. As light is affected by gravity. So although to all intents and purposes, laser light looks utterly straight, it cannot be. You'd have to go down to quantum levels to record this though. Wherever you are in the universe, there is gravity, even in the lonely far out bits. So it doesn't matter where you are, there is a force acting on your line. You can draw it on paper or any material, with phenomenally precise ink tip, or laser jet printer bubble printer, etching point, laser etching, doesn't matter, the surface on which the line is drawn is not perfect, and therefore the line isn't either. It's fun philosophy. It's also a fundamental impossibility, because even if it was a line drawn of atoms, one atom wide, it is just a bunch of dots when you look close enough at it, looks more like a chain than a smooth line. edit;- quite apart from the apparent curvature of space\u2026 end edit. I love this question, because it's one of those that keeps you up at night trying to find scenarios as to where it could be possible. It's one of the much pondered so imponderable. ",
