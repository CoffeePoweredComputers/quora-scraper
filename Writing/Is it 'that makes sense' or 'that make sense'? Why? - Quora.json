            "answer_text": "The answer depends on what comes before these clauses. If nothing, then the correct answer is \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d \u201cThat\u201d is singular and therefore the verb is in the third person singular \u201cmakes.\u201d However, if the examples are used as relative clauses inside a sentence then it depends on what the relative pronoun \u201cthat\u201d refers to. Some examples: \u201cHere are some examples that make sense.\u201d In this case the verb \u201cmake\u201d agrees with \u201cexamples.\u201d \u201cHere is an example that makes sense.\u201d This time the verb is singular to agree with the singular \u201cexample.\u201d More examples: \u201cHe provided numerous arguments that make sense.\u201d \u201cHe only provided one argument that makes sense.\u201d ",

They\u2019re crooks. is correct, because \u201cthat\u201d at the beginning of the second utterance refers to \u201cthe state of affairs that you\u2019ve described\u201d. It\u2019s a single thing, so it\u2019s followed by a singular verb. The following utterance: Sid: I\u2019m fed up with films that I can\u2019t understand. Show me a film that makes sense. is correct, because \u201cthat\u201d in the second sentence refers to \u201ca film\u201d. It\u2019s a single thing, so it\u2019s followed by a singular verb. The following utterance: Sid: I\u2019m fed up with films that I can\u2019t understand. Show me two films that make sense. is correct, because \u201cthat\u201d in the second sentence refers to \u201ctwo films\u201d. It\u2019s a multiple, so it\u2019s followed by a plural verb. ",
