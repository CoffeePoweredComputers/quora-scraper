Note it\u2019s \u5e78\u904b and not \u3054\u5e78\u904b which makes it far more relaxed. ",

If the person had passed the common phrase is, \u5fc3\u3088\u308a\u3001\u3054\u51a5\u798f\u3092\u304a\u7948\u308a\u7533\u3057\u4e0a\u3052\u307e\u3059\u3002which literally means, \"I sincerely pray blessings for the life after.\" (You're not supposed to use this for Christians and certain Buddhist sects who don't believe in reincarnation, I vaguely remember hearing). Otherwise, in any other situation, what Hide Izumi wrote would be best, and if written for a solemn occasion, the most formal would probably be the most appropriate. ",
