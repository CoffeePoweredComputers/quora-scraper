            "answer_text": "Of all the books written by Brandon Sanderson, which one was the best, in your opinion? Thanks for the A2A! I may have said this before, but I always have to admit my favorite book by Brandon when I get a chance. I should also specify that the question mentions \u201cBook\u201d here which is an important distinction. Because my favorite book by him is actually NOT a novel. It\u2019s a novella! Namely, The Emperor\u2019s Soul.  There\u2019s a NUMBER of reasons this book tops all his others for me. Here\u2019s a bunch: It\u2019s SHORT. In a world where there seems to be this absurd idea that longer and bigger is better (spoiler alert: they aren\u2019t), this sucker is just 175 pages.It\u2019s EFFICIENTThe Emperor\u2019s Soul feels almost as impactful as most of Brandon\u2019s larger and longer novels. I often feel like this book has more to it than any of his Stormlight Archive novels\u2014which just drag and have to include a million unnecessary things. This book? EVERY word counts.It\u2019s magic system is AWESOMEI know this may not appear to be saying much, as magic systems are what Brandon is known for. But this system allows for MORE than just physical changes here. It makes things into other things, and I\u2019ll elaborate on how it does more in a second.It still has Brandon\u2019s trademark SECRETSHoid is in this book. It takes place in the Elantris world (Brandon\u2019s first published work) and while Elantris is usually a lesser favorite for most readers, he makes it interesting again here. There are concepts here that are fascinating when considered against the backdrop of his Larger Cosmere world.It\u2019s AWARD winning!Brandon\u2019s won a number of awards, but this is one of his biggest. It\u2019s a Hugo winner, for pete\u2019s sake. And it deserves it. (Incidentally, I AM a bit more subjectively fond of this book because I was AT the awards ceremony. So I have a bit more of a personal connection to it.)It\u2019s possibly more thematic and meaningful than ANY of his other worksSure, his other stories are epic and grand, and he has more diverse characters in his other works. They\u2019re more intertwined, and there\u2019s more Shakespearean drama. Stormlight Archives has its whole \u201cShort story\u201d sections, and artwork sections, and flashback sections (which I hate, but hey, they do add a bit to the depth and artistry of the stories.)But THIS story? It SAYS something. This story is about who WE are as individuals. And what we\u2019re capable of becoming. And WHY. And it extends that metaphor into NON-LIVING things. One section of the book involves a character discussing how a shabby cell window COULD be a beautiful window. Stained glass. Artwork. Something MORE than what we see in it. Because, you see, the characters, the setting, the theme, and the magic system are ALL intertwined and about this EXACT philosophical thought.That, above anything else, is why I love this book. It manages to be entertaining, full of great characters, an interesting plot, with a cool magic system, while STILL having action packed-sequences as well as more studious exploratory moments . . . and yet without losing any of that, it explores a more beautiful concept and theme more efficiently and more deeply than some of the greatest Fantasy works anyone knows. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Now . . . will you enjoy it as much as I do? Maybe not. Some readers love action, or characters, or grand epic stories, or finding all the secrets. This book? Well it may not have enough of what you love to make you as much of a fan of it as I am . . . But this book DOES have ALL of those things, deftly woven, and so efficiently you could read it in a single evening.",
