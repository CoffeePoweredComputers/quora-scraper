You don\u2019t need to be a Shakespeare to be able to write blog posts. But what you have to be able to do is communicate clearly, with correct spelling and good grammar and show a bit of personality and flare. I consider these points when writing Tell it like it is \u2013 straight & to the pointNo fake business etiquetteLike I\u2019m talking to a friend in the pubNo more than 3 sentences in a paragraphShort & punchyKeep it simpleSo with those steps your blog is now set up, so I will leave you with a few tips\u2026. 1.

Forget the money for now! I see it time and time again, people learn how to start a blog and make money and after a couple of months when there is no money \u2013 they quit. So whatever your reasons for starting your blog, forget about the money and focus on helping other people that share your passion. The rest will come later 6. Always have a thought out plan of attack and keep it simple. 7. Make friends! These friends will make your life a lot easier when you launch your post, as their shares and links will get you traffic. Don\u2019t forget to do the same for them, it works both ways and when you write your content do it with these people in mind. ",

            "answer_text": "well! let\u2019s devide your question into pieces because it has more than one piece within a single piece. How can I start a blog? this is a question you will find any forum or any goup dealing with making money online. there is no denying to the fact that blogging is a very wonderful place where one can have the total and absolute freedom to express h/herself. you are not obliged to say what you are complled to say but to say what your mind produces and your hearts feels happy with. coming back to your questio. I think that to set up a blog where to write and share thought with people about niche you love, you need to think about which platform fits your goals and purposes from blogging. there are many platforms on internet that can help you have your own blog or website. I will walk you through two main wonderful platforms i have experiences with. these platforms are: Blogger: blogger is a free platform for creating blogs to share contents. You will need to pay no cent if you are just looking for a free blog. all you will have to do is to check Blogger.com - Create a unique and beautiful blog. It\u2019s easy and free. then click on \u2018\u2019create your blog\u2019\u2019 and start filling out your information. what you should know about blogger? you should know that using blogger, it can be a kind of risking of your contents. if you are aiming to set up a long life blog i advise you to not use it. WHY? Because blogger has the total power over your blog and it has the right to shut it down at any time without giving any reason. There are many peple who have lost their blogs for no reason. Wordpress: wordpress; my favorite platform, is one of the most fomus platforms on internet. A lot of people are using it from all over the world. it is very easy to handle. it has so many features to use. it is free for those who want free blogs. If you want to set up a business blog then you will have to pay for that. you can check WordPress.com: Create a website or blog and see the pricess. the best thing about wordpress is that you dont have to stress about your blog being shut down someday like in blogger. your blog is very safe and you have controle over you blog. What does it require to blog? honstly, i started blogging without having any professional skills. I believe that if you are engaged in blogging, you will learn how to do and handle things automatically. Here are some few things you need to keep in mind since blogging is concerned: Love: bear in mind that you will never do good in something you do not love. you will need to feel happy in doing something in order to do it well and succeed in it. So, you should choose a niche that you love a lot and in which you find your comfort when you are writing about. Love gives passion.Work: if you wanna get good fruits from blog, believe me, you will have to give it enought time and take anything you do in it very seriously. the more you give enough time to something, the more it takes you seriously and pay you back with satisfied results.Be Unique: \u2018be unique even if you are alone\u2019\u2019. your success depends on your contents; on what you write. it is not always about quantity, but about quality. do not worry about how long your post should be or how short, but how heavy it is: how informative it is. short and informative is better than long and makes no sense.I guess these are the main things you need to know as a biginner. I hope this help and Best of Luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I found that easy enough. I register to get gmail emails and then register with blogger-dot-com. I register a blog web site title name and from this I get notified of the email address to send my emailed text to. The blog gets the email for the first piece of text, perhaps a blog intro. The blogger web site means I must log in again to get access to the content received there. The dashboard helps me see the various emails from the blogger web site and from my email account or accounts. The blog itself offers me a choice of web site page layouts and colours. The HTML text version of my text is slightly different and has extra HTML commands I may edit e.g. the font and its size and color code or name. I may also add the extra HTML command to create bold text instead and in size 4. The strong code works well for different web browsers to view the blog\u2019s content. Later on, the off switch for the strong code is used as /strong and so it goes on in regard to testing the layout or template options. Eventually, I chose a yellow background to the black text. The blog began and I added more emailed content, seeking to display it in a central column, which suited my poems for the Stephen Gayford wildlife art poetry blog. I\u2019ve got about 700 poems on this blog. I couldn\u2019t use copyrighted images like others may use freely for different images e.g. unsplash-dot-com and pixabay-dot-com offer us to use and even to edit. denis-martindaleWriter's Blog...Stephen Gayford Poetry The URL is a blogspot-dot-com style.
