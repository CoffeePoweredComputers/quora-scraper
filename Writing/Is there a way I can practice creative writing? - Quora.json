            "answer_text": "Yes! Keep writing. It's that simple. Keep a journal for ideas and for writing little stories about what happened that day. Include how you felt and anything someone said. If you witnessed or heard the end of or the result of a situation, speculate how it started. My biggest problem when I first started writing was dialogue. English is my 2nd language, so many idioms I did not understand. On that issue, I would suggest that at first, do not use idioms or colloquialisms. Save that for when you know how to craft your characters. Descriptions are important. Notice the details, the little things that make up a character, like how they dress, facial expressions, what their room looks like, what they do. If you write in omniscient persona (all knowing, you know the characters\u2019 thoughts), then write what they are thinking. First person would be \u201cI was thinking about\u2026 \u201c as opposed to \u201cshe thought about\u2026 \u201c when you describe thoughts. For poetry, it is all about concrete images, analogies, metaphors, and similes. Of course, use these techniques in prose, but these are more important in poetry. In both poetry and prose, do not forget to include the senses, how things smelled, felt, or looked like. Besides getting a BA in English, with a Creative Writing Emphasis, I started writing on my own at age 11 and never stopped. I am now 67 and have published small time, not professionally, in anthologies since the 1970s. Both prose and poetry have been published. Please take speech classes so that you can read your poetry well, with emotion, proper enunciation, and elocution. Above all, READ. You need to know what was written before, so that what you write does not become trite: It has been said before. What you are looking for is a new way of saying what has already been said. Also, other writers will inspire you to write, and to become a better writer yourself. I hope this helps. Many of my teachers\u2019 advice and critiques are included, here. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are strictly trying to exercise your creative muscles so to speak, there are several things you can do. I would recommend writing sprints to start really pushing your writing. Set a timer and do short sprints to start. Do 15 minute sprints where you bear down and write for that period of time. If that gets too easy start doing 20 and 30 minute sprints. Don\u2019t write with an agenda. Pants it now, edit and tweak later. Let the words happen and don\u2019t judge them. If you are bouncing on multiple ideas and you can\u2019t stay focused on one for more than a 15 minute sprint, that\u2019s fine. Eventually an idea will stick with you and allow itself to be fleshed out. Don\u2019t force it. If you have to force it, it will not feel complete and it will not feel natural. Whether you are typing or writing by hand, the word count shouldn\u2019t matter and the content should not matter, as long as you are freely expressing yourself. When you find a project that speaks to you and begs to be written, listen to it, and let it write itself. I promise the words will come when you are ready to hear them and put ink to paper. ",

            "answer_text": "Look at writing short scenes to start. They\u2019re short, manageable, and can be topical. It\u2019s a good way to get some practice. I don\u2019t know if you're talking about writing about your life, autobiographical topics, or fiction. For all of these however, keeping a journal of morning pages is a good start as well. Google \u2018morning pages\u2019 for more info. ",

I recommend writing every morning and night, keep a journal on you they will be very helpful. Like, if you get inspired by something, get out the journal and end up writing about it in it. If you continue to do this, you\u2019ll have it finished in no time. Once you can be patient and can focus on writing then what you should do is plan a longer story. This takes a long time so undoubtedly, you have to be patient. Even if you dislike that. Hope I helped, have a good day! ",

Now, I know some writers that know from beginning to end how their story is going to go. Some use storyboards to make sure the novel goes along at exactly the pace they want. But that never worked for me. I just start writing, and let the story tell itself. My best advice is to just start writing. Let the words flow. Do some free-writing to start if that helps. Pick three words at random and make a short story out of using them. And if writing poetry gets you in the mood, then do that. The thing is, whatever you put on paper first is not going to be perfect. You can always edit later. Just write! Good luck! ",
