            "answer_text": "There are multiple ways to use the apostrophe( ' ). There are two distinct uses, which the OP seems to be confused about. 1. To show possession. For a singular noun, add an apostrophe followed by the letter s.Eg.This is Abhijith's question.That is Juliet's shrine. If the noun ends with an s, a single apostrophe, with no s following it. (Some writers add an s after the apostrophe. This is not very common, though.)Eg.The class' responsibility.Mr. Jones' calculator.Mr. Jones's calendar. (rare) If the noun is a plural and the plural form ends with the letter s, a single apostrophe is added at the end.Eg.Guys' night out.Girl's night out. (Incorrect. It implies only one girl)Girls' night out.A childrens' park. (Incorrect. Childrens is not a word!)A children's park. (Plural. Not ending with s. Add apostrophe and s.) 2. For contractions. Apostrophes are added where letters are removed.Eg. can't [ can not ]won't [will not ]I've [ I have] The confusion occurs when words like has, is, was are contracted. They are contracted to just the letter s. He's [He is / He was / He has] .. DOES NOT mean, belonging to him. Further confusion occurs when we use proper nouns. The meaning of the 's depends on the context. Let me illustrate. Abhijith's the one who asked this question.[ Abhijith is the one ... ] The 's here expands to is (or was), and does not mean belonging to.  This is Abhijith's question.The 's here means 'belonging to Abhijith'. Extra tip:Don't use 's to form plurals.Chip's doesn't mean many chips.Upvote's doesn't mean multiple upvotes. Further reading:A very common mistake that people make is between its and it's. The grammar nazis on the Internet do not spare anybody that makes this mistake (guilty!). You could read an excellent answer by User here Meenakshi Nandhini's answer to What's the difference between \"its\", \"it's\" and \"its'\"? Can anyone explain with proper examples? ",

Then add the \u2018s or just the apostrophe to make it possessive. Mistakes usually arise when trying to make a word possessive before first deciding whether it needs to be singular or plural. ",
