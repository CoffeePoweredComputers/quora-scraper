            "answer_text": "Yes, you can. The real question is should you rely on them? Well, it depends. Writing services vary in type and quality. As others have mentioned there are many services out there that claim to create resumes automatically. The questions everyone wants to know are: Do they do this to an acceptable level of quality?Do the resumes they create get results?So far, I have not seen any reports that these auto-writing services produce the quality needed. That\u2019s not to say that they may not, just that I haven\u2019t seen it YET. Secondly, are the people using these services getting results? Again, I have not heard of anyone achieving stellar results with these services. Typically the people who get the best results from their resumes have either: Become great resume writers themselves through lots of practice, study, and superior marketing skills;Know someone who is a great resume writer who helps them for free, either a family member, friend, mentor, or school related service; orPay for professional resume writing help (this is common among busy executives and high performers).Your resume is a long term investment in your career. Having a good resume not only increases your chances of being called in for an interview it is also excellent interview prep and can smooth the path of your salary negotiation. Whether you choose to invest your own time, someone else donates their experience to you, or pay a professional to write it, this is not an area that you typically get best results by cutting corners. I hope that helps! Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, we can rely on writing services for a resume. But it depends on the type and quality of service provider you opt. I also hire a writing service provider to built my resume. They did their work very professionally and built an eye-catching resume for me. From the day I published my resume I got interview calls regularly. So, according to my experience with the writing service provider (1300 resume), we can rely on writing service for resume. ",

            "answer_text": "The good resume is short, targeted, to-the-point. And here is the problem with writing services, they might create a good resume, but it is definitely not going to be targeted and short at the same time. Instead I would use some specialized services like jobscan or Hack your resume with the superpower of AI ",
