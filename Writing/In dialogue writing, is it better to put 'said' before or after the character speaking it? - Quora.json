The truth is, there is no rule about where to use \u201csaid.\u201d Before or after and even during an action is unimportant. What is important is the rhythm of your work, the pacing of your dialogue. Changing from one to the other can make your dialogue sound more lifelike. John said, \u201cThat\u2019s my coat.\u201d Jack said, \u201cNo it\u2019s not. Pete said, \u201cWhat are you arguing about?\u201dJane said, \u201cShut up. I\u2019m trying to study.\u201d Now, let\u2019s do that one all over again: Jack took a coat off the pile on the floor and shoved his left arm into a sleeve. \u201cHey,\u201d John said. \u201cThat\u2019s my coat.\u201dJack stared at him. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. See? This is the one with the torn pocket.\u201dJohn snatched the collar of the coat and pulled it off Jack\u2019s arm. \u201cI tore that pocket six months ago. It\u2019s my coat.\u201d\u201cIt not!\u201d \u201cIs so!\u201d\u201cWhat,\u201d Pete demanded, glaring at the two boys, \u201care you guys arguing about?\u201dJane looked up from her textbook. \u201cShut up, all of you. I\u2019m trying to study.\u201d I used \u201csaid\u201d once, yet any reader could figure out who was talking whether I\u2019d used the word before or after the quote. As above, it\u2019s the pacing and rhythm of the dialogue that really matters, not the placement of the word \u201csaid.\u201d Use dialogue to create mental pictures in the readers\u2019 minds so they can both see and hear what\u2019s going on.

            "answer_text": "For me, it\u2019s a sense of rhythm, but also needs to clarify who is speaking when there might be some doubt. So, I suggest writing it both ways to see which works better in a given instance. Use it to introduce two characters speaking and eliminate it thereafter unless needed to keep it clear who is speaking. Also, keep in mind that each character should have a distinctive voice that helps us know who is speaking. Anytime you write dialogue, read through it without the character designations to see if you can tell who\u2019s speaking. If both characters sound the same then you need to do more work on them to find their individual voices. ",
