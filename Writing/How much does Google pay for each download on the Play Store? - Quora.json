But here are rough estimates for the $ per download rate for some hypothetical apps: Free: $0Freemium app that users uninstall quickly: $0.01 - $0.10Freemium game average*: $1.59 (source)Freemium exceptional app: Probably lots of $$$Paid: ~70% the listed price per install. Less if you do sales & free promotions. More if you have additional monetization in your paid app.These are rough estimates that I\u2019ve made partly based on my experience as a freelance mobile app developer, and from my own experience developing Android apps such as Indefinite: Interrogation Game. *Note that the average may be unrealistically high due to the top performing games skewing the data.
