            "answer_text": "Not sure which two stories you are referring to. I assume you are comparing two book. A general introduction to a compare and contrast essay is to introduce both stories along with their authors. If you like, include when they were written too. This serves as a background of what you are discussing about. Then, talk about what you are comparing between them (the purpose of the essay). Is it the moral of the story, theme, voice, point of view, setting, etc. Finally, your last sentence should be the thesis. An easy way of interpreting the thesis is to think of it as the title of your essay, but with more details. What this means is that every paragraph you write after the introduction can be summarized in this thesis. It can also be a sentence that states which story is better. ",
