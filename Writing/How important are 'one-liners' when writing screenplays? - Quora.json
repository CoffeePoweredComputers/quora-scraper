Not to avoid the question, but here is some helpful and more general advice. Learn to appreciate the value of brevity. The skill set to write a great one-liner overlaps with the ability to not waste words and boil something down to its essence. You can appreciate how much better \u201cI\u2019ll be back\u201d is compared to \u201cI am going to go do (fill in the blank), which should take 24-36 hours. So I will see you when I am done.\u201d Or think about the pithy lines in Casablanca that capture the subtext of \u201cI love you\u201d: \u201cHere\u2019s looking at you, kid,\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019ll always have Paris.\u201d Brevity, succinctness, and specificity -- not exactly sexy topics -- allow you to get to the essence of something. This is a great skill and can be used in many ways...

            "answer_text": "How important are \"one-liners\" when writing screenplays? Perhaps Oscar Wilde answered this question best. He once stated that if he could write four new epigrams they were sufficient for him to write a new play. In my opinion, humour is important in almost any screenplay, if only for a change of pace. One of the best quips I heard was in the stage production of Shirley Valentine. The movie was somewhat different and, inexplicably, they left this bit out. Shirley had been talking to the wall\u2014as she did throughout the entire play. She was thinking about sex and how women just had to close their eyes and \u201cthink of England\u201d. Then, one day, somebody went out on a voyage of discovery\u2014just like Christopher Columbus\u2014and discovered the clitoris. Suddenly sex was enjoyable. In Act 2, (in real time, about 40 minutes after that clitoris comment) Shirley had left home and gone to the Greek Islands. She was sitting by the waterfront, this time talking to the seawall, telling it about her life. \u201cI met a fisherman the other day and he took me out on his boat. His name was Kostos but I call him Christopher.\u201d Nobody noticed, and then one man near the back let out a guffaw of laughter and we all realised what she had just said. It brought the house down. Not quite in line with that, but for those who haven\u2019t met Shirley, I thought you might enjoy this conversation in an English pub.  ",
