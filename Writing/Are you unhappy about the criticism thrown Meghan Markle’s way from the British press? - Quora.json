If they bang on about perceived shortfalls in the private lives of irrelevant toffs, then the media outlet is mainly going to be producing a toxic mixture of half-truths and bullying gossip in all of its output. If they stopped writing shit about Meghan they would just have to write equally stupid nonsense about someone else. Stop consuming that product. It is bad for you. ",

Actually, it\u2019s more than being unhappy - I am disgusted by this sort of behaviour. Where I grew up it\u2019s called bullying and shaming someone. It\u2019s ugly, classless and I wish it was only the British press at it - but the reality is that it\u2019s the American press, the Australian press and a very very large number of Quora users. I think it\u2019s shameful behaviour. ",

Nobody likes criticism but people are smart. They\u2019re not going to shut up and take everything you say as the law of the land. Obviously wrong actions will be questioned! ",

Oh, MAYBE it's because all you people painting her in such a negative light are nothing more than jealous, bitter, pathetic people with nothing better to do with their time than to bash someone online who wouldn't know you from a hole in the wall. Seriously, enough. She got married to a Prince, Harry is no longer a bachelor, they have a kid and they're in love. Be pathetic somewhere else. Or maybe get a life. And don't believe everything that comes out of tabloids and magazines. ",
