            "answer_text": "We already know about the problem. It has been studied for nearly 100 years now. At this point action to solve the problem is more important than studying it. The major remedies are stop dumping anything into the water that isn't a naturally occurring substance, above a naturally occurring level (ppm), or should not be there at any level, and find natural replacements for the toxic substances or eliminate the use of them entirely. We need to reduce our ecological footprint and drop using money as the measure of success of a system. We still need to monitor the toxin levels to see progress from the actions taken. The allowable level fallacy only works until you realize, that substances concentrate in living organisms using the polluted substance (water, air, food, land, or whatever else), and that the total volume of water on the planet is relatively a fixed amount (the occasional bit comes from or escapes into space, and most combustion produces some water as a byproduct). Once the toxins are in the food chain and the water cycle they affect everything. ",

            "answer_text": "Because we have a limited amount of it; and once it is polluted, it takes a lot of time and money to clean it up. Water also soaks into the ground and can pollute the ground, and evaporates into the air and can pollute the air. Just go by the sewage pond and take a deep breath if you don\u2019t believe what I said about air pollution by water. Without water, most everything cannot exist. How would your food get to the rest of your body for energy or to plants to grow? The Earth has a limited amount of water. ",
