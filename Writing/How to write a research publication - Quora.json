            "answer_text": "Salvaging your CV by writing a research paper probably is not a realistic plan. First off, what are your standardized test scores?  If they aren't in the range of your target university then nobody is going to look at your paper.  (If they are in range, that repairs most of the damage from the poor grades.)  I can't emphasize this enough.  If you're scoring in the 70th percentile and your target university accepts from the 95th percentile and up, don't bother starting a paper. As to the paper-writing process:  if you were in my field (systems), it might take two years of research, experiments and writing before you got your first paper accepted, and that's with the expert help of a PhD advisor guiding you through the process.  Without a PhD advisor there are thousands of little mistakes you can make that will cause your paper to be rejected, and your reviewers are not obligated to point out what the mistakes are.  (An MS student might get a first-author publication based in part on a larger research program led by a PhD student.) Before you get to the point of writing you need to be able to read the peer-reviewed literature.  To say it is highly stylized is an understatement.  If you weren't doing this as an undergrad, plan on a few hundred hours learning how to do this (and without a PhD advisor, who is going to be teaching you?). All that said, can you get a paper published in the next six months or so?  Sure!  There's an entire ecosystem of (effectively) scam conferences and journals that will  accept just about anything.  But the people who are reviewing your application know those are scams and that the work in them is useless, and will count that against you. But don't take my word for this.  Google Scholar will have a huge catalog of papers in your field, and many of them will be downloadable for free.  Read them.  That's the quality of work you'll need to meet. ",
