            "answer_text": "Heaven exist. Hell doesn\u2019t. Hell is a false religious teaching not found in the scriptures. Hell is not earth, hell is not The Lake of Fire for the Bible says that Death and Hades are thrown or pitched into the Lake of Fire. Revelation 20:13. Hell is a translation for the word Hades, which is simply The Grave. The Lake of Fire is symbolic for destroying things that plague mankind. Wicked ones and even Death itself. Simply put, it is the end of those things. They are symbolically destroyed forever day and night in the Lake of Fire. Death itself is thrown there. Death can\u2019t actually burn for hell cant be thrown literally into hell. In the Bible, Heaven is used in three different ways. it describes the realm where Jehovah and all spirit creatures dwell.The physical universe.Symbolic for governments of the earth. Heaven is used symbolically to represent authority. 2 Peter 3:13 says that there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting. Here, heavens represents earthly governments sooner to be replaced by God\u2019s Kingdom, a real heavenly government that Jesus is currently ruling. A new earth represent a new society of people that will survive Armageddon or are resurrected after Armageddon is fought and won by Jesus Christ of God\u2019s Kingdom.True, some do go to Heaven. Revelation 14:1, there we learn 144000 go to heaven. Why? They are anointed and chosen strictly by Jehovah himself. From the year 33CE when Holy Spirit was poured out on the first century Christian congregation, ones were selected to rule with Christ as Kings and Priest in God\u2019s Kingdom. They are corulers with Christ and they rule over the earth of obedient mankind after Armageddon. Jehovah does not burn people in hellfire. Jeremiah 19:5. Jehovah there talked about how people sacrificed their actual children to false gods and the idea of doing something remotely like that never came into his heart. The Bible teaches that when a person dies they are simply dead. No afterlife, no ghost or spirits, just dead. However Jesus taught in the future billions would be resurrected. Both of these are proven in these two scriptures. Ecclesiastes 9:5 and John 5:28, 29 Satan uses false religion to mislead billions into believing things that confuse people to the identity of God, the condition of the dead and hope for the future. The Bible teaches the truth about these subjects. Not false religion, or Satan the devil because Satan himself knows the truth but distorts it so people lose hope for everlasting life in God\u2019s new world. ",

            "answer_text": "Reincarnation happens after death , philosophical or religious concept that an aspect of a living being starts a new life in a different physical body or form after each biological death. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra doctrine of cyclic existence.   *the only way to escape from this cycle is called moksha , nirvana and enlightenment it has more names .   HELL AND HEAVEN  actually there is no hell or heaven its just our piece of mind our thought . our spirit enters higher dimension while experiencing death , astral projection , near death experience . in that dimension things happen according to your thought . like negative thoughts appears to be hell and positive thought as heaven .  Why is There a Hell? With our free will we are able to carry any thought and believe any idea whether it be fear-based or love/unity-based. In the spirit world, if there was an individual with vicious thoughts, the grossness of his/her unloving thoughts would manifest instantly. So if you were an arachnophobic , and you kept that fear while journeying to the higher planes, giant spiders with mandibles would manifest and chase you causing havoc to the spiritual world. So, we are training our consciousness in the physical third dimension enough so that when we arrive in the spiritual world, we would only manifest harmonious and compassionate thoughts. Heaven The astral realm lies on the upper part of the fourth dimension. Heaven extends from the fourth to the ninth dimension. In the fourth, there are many kinds of sentient beings. Here, spirits get used to being of a spiritual nature without physical bodies. As spiritual awareness develops you would be able to widen your prospects to the past, present and future. Dimensions and Consciousness Dimensions are a means of organizing different planes of existence according to their vibratory rate. Each dimension has certain sets of laws and principles that are specific to the frequency of that dimension. Our consciousness is our awareness. This is important to understand. If you inhabit a certain dimension, it is because your consciousness vibrates in resonance with the frequency of that dimension. _/\\_ thank you for reading :) ",

            "answer_text": "As a born-again Christian I have had an experience with Christ right after I opened my heart and asked Jesus into my life. It doesn't matter that very few, if any would believe that Jesus came to me 41 years ago. I couldn't see him, but my calling one day was to become a Christian evangelist and I needed prayer in order to answer that calling. That's why Jesus came to pray over me. My encounter with Christ took place because I didn't want to one day become a Christian evangelist. I had a lot of fear in my heart as to getting rejection from non-believers. Well, through the years God strengthened me by the power of his Holy Spirit ( 3rd Person of the Triune God.) During that encounter Jesus had prayed over me. The Lead Singer in the Christian band New Song saw Jesus praying over the assembled crowd who I was among. If God can create the Universe he can change a person. If you want to see God the Father, forget it. You would be atomized. No one can look upon God and live. Jesus is the 2nd Person of the Trinity. You get to see God's nature by looking at Jesus. When Moses was on Mount Sinai, the Israelites knew that God was at the top of Mount Sinai and they wanted to see God with their own eyes. God quickly told Moses, \u201cKeep the people from coming up the mountain. If they look upon me they will perish!\u201d God had kept himself behind the mountain where Moses was safe and didn't die from looking upon God. What Moses did see was God's AFTER-GLOW. Somehow Moses had prevented the Israelites from looking at God. Atheists want proof that God exists. About the strongest proof that can be offered to an Atheist is \u201cProphecy.\u201d God knows the future before the future takes place, so you have to read the Old Testament prophecies and see how they were fulfilled from the dotting of the (i) to the crossing of the (t). I won't go into those prophecies. They can be found in the back of a King James bible. I also own a New Living Translation version and there isn't a Prophecy Page. After reading Daniel's \u201canswer\u201d I took notice to the fact that what Daniel shared about the Muslims is true. The Muslims say there are 7 Levels of Hell or punishment, and I do not know how many Levels of Hell there are, but people who have had Near Death Experiences and were allowed to see Hell claimed that there were many Levels of \u201cpunishment\u201d in Hell. One person said that they were allowed to see Muhammad. That person said that Muhammad was in the \u201cWorst\u201d Level of Hell and Muhammad was screaming out of how sorry he was for having misled millions upon millions of Muslims who were headed for HELL. These U-Tube videos are \u201cWarnings\u201d to non-Christians, and they describe Hell as a place where non-Christians are not partying, but are deeply depressed because they know that they will spend \u201cEternity\u201d there in Hell and they know that whatever chance they had had to become a Christian while they were on Earth has come and gone. These U-Tube videos are much like the Parable Jesus told about THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS. The Rich Man and Lazarus were divided by a \u201cGreat Chasm.\u201d The Rich Man was in Hell, and he could see Lazarus who was with Father Abraham on the other side. The Rich Man asked Father Abraham to send Lazarus to the Earth at his Father's home so Lazarus could warn the Rich Man's 5 brothers about Hell and how they could avoid ending up in torment by being cast into Hell. Abraham said that if those 5 brothers wouldn't listen to the writings of Moses and the prophets, they wouldn't listen to Lazarus even if he were to rise from the dead and warn them about Hell. That's exactly how it is today with non-Christians. The dead can be revived in a hospital, or someone might give that person CPR ( Cardio Pulminary Resesitation ) and if that person was allowed by God to see what Hell was like and they tried to tell non-Christians about their experience in the \u201cGreat Beyond,\u201d no one would believe them just as Jesus said in the PARABLE OF THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS. Many ATHEISTS have had NDE ( Near Death Experiences ) and had become Christians after they saw Hell. The Apostle Thomas, who is known as DOUBTING THOMAS didn't believe that Jesus rose from the grave on the 3rd day. He was told by the other Apostles and Mary Magdalene that they had seen Jesus, but Thomas said \u201c I will only believe that Jesus rose from the grave if I can put my finger in his wounds \u201c Well Jesus appeared to Thomas and Thomas became a Believer. Most people are like Doubting Thomas: They won't believe until they see something supernatural with their own eyes. Non-Christians aren't aware that there is a \u201cSpiritual Realm.\u201d That Spiritual Realm is referred to as a \u201cHigher Dimension.\u201d Heaven and Hell exist in a HIGHER DIMENSION. Many non-Christians view Christian Churches as being SOCIAL CLUBS filled with people who believe in God. Being I am a pianist and a Church musician and a Member of my Church Worship Group, I attend Church Music Rehearsals on Saturdays. A while back on Saint Patrick's Day, I had pulled up along the curb behind the Church. I stepped out of my SUV to grab my portable piano. As I looked over at the sidewalk, I saw a guy and a girl walking down the sidewalk in my direction. The guy stepped over next to my SUV and said \u201cGood morning. Happy Saint Patrick's Day.\u201d I didn't want to appear rude by telling this guy that because I was a non-drinker I didn't celebrate Saint Patrick's Day, so I answered and said, \u201cHappy Saint Patrick's Day.\u201d The guy then said, \u201cDo your Church Members drink Green Beer on Saint Patrick's Day?\u201d I was floored by this guy's question. I suddenly realized that a lot of non-Christians assume that Christian Churches are nothing more than Social Clubs. Some non-Christians believe in God and some are Evolutionists and don't believe that the Universe was created but instead believe in the Big Bang. There are also Atheists who want proof that God exists in order for them to believe in a Creator. They would have to lean towards Evolution if they haven't been convinced that there is a Creator. Some non-Christians may believe in God but their beliefs are entirely different from the beliefs of Christians. Most non-Christians believe that a LOVING GOD will allow everyone to enter Heaven, but as for the really evil people like Hitler, child molestors, and mass Murderers, they are probably convinced that those people won't make Heaven. The reason non-Christians don't think God will cast good people into Hell is because non-Christians think that God thinks the way they think. They are wrong to assume that God thinks the way they think. The Bible says in the Book of Isaiah that God's thoughts are not our thoughts, and his ways are not our ways. By looking at the stars in the \u201cnight sky,\u201d we can see that a Creator created those stars. By looking at God's creation, deep in our souls we know that there is a Creator. A person who is blind would eventually believe in God if someone read the Bible to them. \u201cFaith comes by hearing the word of God,\u201d just as the Bible says. This guy that asked me whether or not the parishioners in my Church were planning on drinking Green Beer on Saint Patrick's Day may have concluded that in Ireland the Christians who might be beer drinkers most likely drank Green Beer on Saint Patrick's Day right inside their Churches in Ireland. This guy may have assumed that Americans carried on the same \u201ctradition\u201d as the Irish did. Either way, this guy had to be a non-Christian because if he were a Church-Going Christian, he would know that Christians don't go to Church to drink alchohol. They go to Church to worship Jesus who was crucified for the World's sins. Non-Christians don't see themselves as SINNERS. They don't realize that God needs to forgive them of their sins through a Personal Relationship with Jesus which takes place when a Non-Christian asks Jesus to come into their life. Every Non-Christian who has lived and died, or is alive today has asked that question: IS THERE A HEAVEN AND A HELL? It takes FAITH to pray and ask Jesus to become one's Lord and Saviour. There's no getting around it: You have to be ready and willing to repent of your sins if you want to spend eternity in Heaven. Once a person prays the Salvation Prayer, they will finally know for themselves that there is a Heaven and a Hell. Burt Mottola, Christian evangelist ",

            "answer_text": "This is a question that will remain as long as there is intelligence around to ask that question. The answer will remain illusive as long as there is intelligence around to ponder the question and the reason lies in our own \u2018being\u2019. We need intelligence (consciousness) in order to come to the conclusion that we actually \u2018do\u2019 exist. We recognise our own existence in the contemplation of our own thoughts. Coming to that realisation we recognise that the only thing we really experience is our own thinking\u2026.. Everyone knows this consciously or un-consciously as all our entertainment industry is based on this fact that we can experience a story by simply thinking about it or watching it\u2026.. If that is basis of our life experience we cannot elude the fact that we have a choice to which story we treat ourselves and therefor have power over our life experience\u2026. Now let\u2019s investigate of how our consciousness is actually accomplishing this creative feat and the best way to understand this is by finding an analogy in nature. The phenomenon we are looking for is called a dual-unity\u2026..We basically need one power in dual contemplation but that does not exclude any side and both are limitless in totality\u2026.. Nature is giving us a perfect working of this phenomenon right before our eyes. In order for a tree to grow, the seed needs to fall into the earth in order for the earth to nourish the seed and bring forth the tree\u2026. The fundamental principle behind this is that the \u2018Earth\u2019 having infinite power to nourish any and every seed (particular single information) that surrenders itself to it by being buried into it. The one thing this infinit power is lacking, is \u2018CHOICE\u2019 due to its infinite power, it has to accept the seed that is surrendered to it. The seed on the other hand is the totality of \u2018CHOICE\u2019 expressed through \u2018INFORMATION\u2019 of a particular. The apple tree carries the infinite matrix of the perfect apple tree within itself. Continuously urged on to express greater and greater perfection of that which itself knows of \u2018BEING\u2019\u2026..but it lacks the power to express itself. An apple seed outside the earth will never express itself\u2026. Again we have an INFINITE POWER without choice, and an infinite PERFECT IDEA as choice but without power. Both of them are infinite and part of each other but only in a perfect harmonious ONE, experience is possible\u2026.. Now we as \u2018human\u2019 consciousness have come to a height, where we can contemplate different thoughts (information), an apple tree seed has no choice but to express the consciousness of being an apple tree\u2026.. The creative dual-unity in us is the infinite consciousness of \u2018I AM\u2019, I can strip myself of any consciousness of what I believe TO BE but I simply cannot strip myself of the consciousness that I AM \u2026\u2026My \u2018chosen\u2019 thought is the infinite perfect CHOICE and always has to come after my acknowledgment of the infinite potential within the I AMness. e.g. I can only know that I AM alive, if I accept my own \u2018BEINGNESS\u2019 through the thought (CHOICE) I add to the I AM\u2026..\u2019I AM alive\u2019 and find myself with the concept of BEING a human\u2026..I can never experience anything different from that which I accept of BEING but with the potential of being anything\u2026.. All this brings me to the realisation that I AM never STARTED BEING and can therefor never STOP BEING\u2026..The moment I drop the identification with the concept of a human which I AM conscious of, the moment I become conscious of something else but to the rest of IDEAS (other I AM states) around me, I \u2018died\u2019, as I stop exchanging information (thoughts) with them but I still and must continue to express my own consciousness of being\u2026.I AM could never know I AM NOT as the NOT has to assume first that I AM and therefor I AM undeniably I AM without cause . I have to repeat myself as this is absolutely crucial to grasp that we create life within ourselves through the universal principal of this dual-unity of \u2018infinite power without choice and infinite particular choice (information) but no power\u2019\u2026\u2026the union brings forth \u2018Form\u2019 or experience (life)\u2026.. Therefor all creation is represented through a TRINITY of 1) INFINITE POWER2) INFINITE PARTICULAR (idea, choice, thought)3) SPIRIT (casting its shadow as matter) The spirit of BEING is the I AM becoming THAT I AM It is so simple that eludes the intellect or \u2018the world\u2019 which is based on rational thinking which in turn is based on the assumption of PAST thoughts and therefor creates its own limitation of what it previously assumed as TRUE and not realising that we ourselves are the power that we are looking for\u2026.. In that ignorance I experience my own limitation, which is is HELL and the perfect realisation of I AM THAT I AM is the discovery of HEAVEN\u2026.unlimited potential and expression without limitation as there is only ONE.

            "answer_text": "Hi Virginia, Yes We can only understand the reality of these 2 destinations by acknowledging - critically - the existence of an immaterial spiritual realm spoken about within the biblical scriptures. The text says that the spiritual realm consists of both good - God and the holy angels - and evil - satan and his demons. Demons are likely to be fallen angels who rebelled against God and were thrown out of heaven. The Bible also says that humans were created by God in His image, which means we have a spiritual component. Therefore, we are more than just physical & mental entities - we possess a soul/spirit destined for eternity. Clearly, the spiritual realm is invisible to the physical eye. But we are still connected to it, and what goes on in the spiritual realm directly affects our physical world. The best, and most prevalent evidence available proving that there is a spiritual realm is testimonial experiential evidence. We can look at the sheer number of religions around the world and the billions of people who focus their lives on the spiritual realm. Is it reasonable to assume that so many of these people would report real encounters with the spiritual realm and all be fabricating it? Unlikely. The best historical, testimonial evidence for the spiritual realm is the Bible itself. Historians, both Christian and non-Christian, agree that the historical authenticity of the Bible is strong. Jesus stepped out of heaven on a rescue mission & into our history some 2,000 years ago. The Bible then recounts numerous examples of people having encounters with the spiritual realm in the company of Christ. According to the Bible, heaven & hell are real, immaterial destinations that exist in the spiritual realm. Let's hope we all end up in the place where we're hoping to go :) Much respect.

John Lennox 14 March 2015. YouTube. P.S. The scientific empirical evidence for a spiritual realm remains controversial. It comes down to which studies one choses to believe. Hence, I have not included the nuts & bolts of these studies in my answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's try heaven. This is the supposed afterlife where everyone gets what they want for eternity.But what if you want your wife for eternity, you die, she re-marries and wants to spend eternity with hubby number two? What if she loves your mother-in-law and you hate the old bat? What if the person you want to spend eternity with did something wrong and ended up in Hell?The heaven concept doesn't work. I know different people see it differently (the most boring I have seen yet is one where we eternally bask in God's love), but I have yet to find one without paradox.  So, now we have ruled out heaven, let's look at the concept of Hell. Now, I like the idea of murderers and rapists going through eternal torture. But how do you really judge this. Paedophilia is pretty evil. But it is also a mental disorder, very often due to the perpetrator having been through similar experiences themselves. In fact the only other ways one becomes seemingly of 'non-normal' sexual behaviour is either through long deprivation from the opposite sex (eg prison or long navy tours), or through enforced sexual abstinence due to pathetic religious ruling (priesthood). So I would not actually condemn a paedophile to eternal torture if their condition was psychological. You might think differently. You might think have different views on murder. Is accidental murder through something like drink driving worthy of eternal torture just as much as deliberately flying a plane into a building? So this is where Hell falls down. One size does not fit all. In my novel, Psychic Warrior, I imagine an afterlife where our own 'souls' first punish us for all the bad we have done in mortal life and then reward us for the good, so it becomes a self-inflicted Hell followed by self-rewarding heaven. It has advantages. Innocent children can bypass Hell and go straight to reward, without the need of baptism or other religious ceremony. It also has drawn backs. A religious zealot who has harmed no one might inflict immense torture upon himself for a moment of weakness, whereas Hitler might only give himself a 'short' Hell period because he believed what he was doing wasn't evil. There's more to it than that, but although it's fiction, it's a lot more thought out than the current concept and it didn't take long to do. So I have to answer a resounding no to whether or not there is a heaven and hell. I have seen no evidence to support an afterlife, yet a tiny bit of me wants my version (mainly because I know the rest of the story) and that is why religion thrives. Before I was atheist, I subscribed to an afterlife. Without any evidence. Losing faith in a god is easy. Losing the hope of something after our short time on this planet is a lot harder. That's why religion uses hope as its ultimate con to keep us coming to the sermons and leaving our cash on the collection plates. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, heaven and hell really exist. Both are distinct locations in this universe, but even on this planet it is an observable fact that some people live in a heavenly situation and some people live under hellish circumstances. So it could be said that both heaven and hell are on this planet. But apart from that there are heavenly planets within this universe and there are hellish planets as well. Let med tell you about what happens at the point of death, according to the Bhagavat-purana. If you have been very good and pious, you will upon leaving the body be led to the planets of the demigods - the heavenly planets, called Svarga. There you will enjoy for millions of years before again you will be born on earth as a human. On the heavenly planets you enjoy basically as you do on earth - sex, drugs and rockn,roll - but it takes place on a subtle plane, the astral plane as some call it. You are in a subtle body - a psychic, finer physical body that doesn't exude excretions. IOW, you don't perspire, fart or stink. In heaven there are heavenly dancing girls and the soma-drink - an intoxication that makes you feel good and prolongs life. The music is delivered by the gandharvas - some sort of angles who are the musicians of the heavenly planets. On the heavenly planets there is no disease or old age, but eventually you die and fall back to a human body on earth. Now, at the point of death, if you have been very cruel and evil not caring or empathizing with other living entities, you will be picked up by the Yamadutas, the messengers of Yamaraja - the god of Death - and taken to the hellish planets, where you will be tortured and undergo purgatory for what feels like eternity. Like on the heavenly planets, it happens on a subtle, astral plane, so a moment can feel like a long, long time - like in a dream. After having ended your prescribed suffering, you will again be born on earth, but not necessarily from a human womb. You can be born in any of the 8.400.000 species of life. If you have just been an ordinary, somewhat decent human, neither too good nor too evil, like people are most, at the point of death you will fall into a deep sleep and stay like that for 7 months after which you'll wake up and find yourself tied up in a womb. The situation for the fetus is full of pain and distress. You are in full consciousness but you are totally bound up and gagged, it's like being bound up very tightly in a sack. If you are lucky, you will remember everything you did to land you in this particular womb, why you will be born to certain parents. Then after 2 months of such hell you are squeezed out of a hole much too little for you, and born in shock into total forgetfulness. The foster state is described in the Bhagavat Purana in great detail. If, however, you have practiced spiritual life and think of Krishna at the time of death, you will return to the spiritual world in your original constitution of eternity, knowledge and bliss. Or you will be born in some universe on some planet where Krishna has descended to reveal His pastimes. When that period has ended, you will return with Krishna to Goloka either as one of His friends, His girl-friends or as His elder in a parental mood. The choice is yours. Where ever you go after death will be according to how you formed your mental body. The mental or the psychic body is formed after the activities of your gross, physical body and the mentality you are cultivating. Krishna says: And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body remembering Me alone at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt. (Bg. 8.5) Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, O son of Kunti, that state he will attain without fail. (Bg 8.6)  ",

            "answer_text": "I grew up as a Christian believing in a literal heaven and hell, until I looked into it further. I don't know if Jesus was the son of God, no one does. Anyone who says that they know that to be true beyond a shadow of a doubt are kidding themselves. To truly believe anything, you must doubt it. If you refuse to doubt, you don't have faith that your beliefs can overcome said doubts. And if the doubts prove to be relevant, one simply learns. It's a win/win, really. Anywho, I do have a great respect for the Bible and Jesus, as I believe both contain valuable information that contributes to a spiritual mindset. The reason I no longer believe in the evangelical hell is as follows: The Jewish people had no \"hell. \" They had \"Sheol. \" Ancient Jews were a lot more comfortable with uncertainty than Western Christians are. Sheol was simply the state of being dead. They had something of a mythology dedicated to it down the road, but if you go back far enough, you see that Sheol had a bit of mystery behind it. Even so, Sheol in the later days was more like a purgatory than hell. One of the first mentions of hell (eternal flames hell) is in the New Testament The Jewish people at this time had pretty much been absorbed by the Romans. The Romans had a tendency to steal aspects of culture that they liked, including a lot of Greek mythology. This is why when the disciples spoke of this eternal punishment, they used the word \"Tartarus\u201d or \u201cHades.\u201d They'd begun to abandon their roots. Jesus, on the other hand, clearly had a different idea about hell. He used the word Gahenna. Gahenna was commonly known to be a place where one burns their garbage in those times. It was in the center of the city, and it was on fire at all times. It wasn't, however, a place of torture. In fact, the gates never closed. Everyone had open access to it at all times. This fact combined with Jesus' constant teachings of love and selflessness lead both I and many theologians to believe that Jesus referred to hell on Earth. Child Abuse, spousal abuse, addiction, rape. Any \"sin\" (translated to mean separation from God (love, life) you choose what that is for you) is an example of hell on Earth, more or less. Just like Gahenna, all are welcome to either enter or leave. Why would anyone stay in hell some ask. Any person with any intelligence would just leave. But if you believe in an integral worldview (one in which spirituality and physicality are not only parallel but intertwined), most Christians would claim to, you have to accept that just as a rapist or abusive parent choose to experience hell on earth every day, they'd do the same thing in the \"afterlife\u201d Another theory, that can be used in conjunction with the last, is the idea that Gahenna is a place much like Sheol, a purgatory. People entered Gahenna to burn their trash (or sin) not their bodies. It is amusing to think that most evangelicals would cringe at the thought of paganism, yet one of their greatest beliefs and subjects of fear comes directly from Greek mythology. This was the commonly accepted belief before the protestant reformation, that's where the modern Westernized church was born. The concept of eternal hell goes nicely with Greek Gods of petty jealousy and war, not so much with the love and selflessness taught by Christ. Some make an argument for an Old Testament Christian God of wrath, but if you ask me, that's just an example of primitive humans interpreting spiritual experiences in a very primitive way. Just look at the things they did. They committed genocide. Multiple times. Jesus says \"turn the other cheek.\u201d it doesnt add up at all. God may have given us the Bible, but man gave us the English translation. God did however give us brains, so I can't imagine that he doesn't expect us to analyze a little bit. Thats one possibility. The other: Nah, there's no such thing as hell ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026not so much as literal places, in the sense that they exist on the physical plane of what we call reality and we could actually go there in a spaceship or something. Basically, here's the argument: what I like to call the \u201cmaterial\u201d universe (which is actually not that material at all) is remarkably similar to a computer simulation. For those like myself, who believe in an intelligent design, there's no reason why an omnipotent creator would have any kind of problem changing it as he wills, since only he has the programming administrator key, so to speak.  Atoms are just a biological, more complex version of 1s and 0s. The universe very much appears to work on some kind of binary system, although it might not strictly be 1s and 0s per se, it could be some other things\u2026 Proponents of the simulation hypothesis claim that our world may in fact be a digital program that was created by beings infinitely more technologically advanced than ourselves. I don't necessarily believe this to be true. I think the material universe is the work of a being that far exceeds our comprehension, that exceeds any concept of time or space, an omnipotent and omniscient intelligence, not merely a creature. But the fact that our world mirrors a simulation shows that it isn't in the least absurd to believe in God. Here are also some good logical arguments against the anthropic principle:  -  So while simulation theorists believe that there is a physical existence outside of the universe, possibly much like our own, I believe there to be a much more spiritualistic or otherworldly one. What is most interesting is that the material universe also appears to be finite. That is very powerful knowledge.

Here\u2019s what scientists say.Einstein's Search & the Illusion of RealityThe Spiritual Was More Substantial Than the Material for the AncientsI believe that there is an extradimensional reality, which overlaps with ours\u2014what we might call the \u201cunseen realm\u201d. In Biblical Greek the word often translated as \u201cspirit\u201d is \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1, i.e. pneuma. Although often pertaining to breath or wind, possibly giving the idea of something immaterial, it is quite likely that it's simply used to refer to that which you cannot always see (See the last article I linked). There is no reason to consider it \u201csuperstitious\u201d or \u201cabsurd\u201d to think that there are indeed forces that are at work, forces which we can't see, and which do not bow down to our laws of physics, as these laws are only pertaining to our physical reality. In a way, simulation theorists already believe this to some degree. But what is sin? Let me offer an analogy for my position, therefore you may come to see it as not as absurd as you first may have thought. You may disagree with it, but I don't think it's a bad argument. Sin is like a \"glitch\" in the software of our minds and bodies. We are programed for a certain path, a certain purpose. But the God also gave us a degree of free will. We can chose to go against his design, but this will result in a glitch which could potentially grow into a virus that could threaten to destroy the simulation\u2026unless it is checked. It's a sickness, and it goes much deeper than just breaking a set of rules. No, sin lies upon an instability. Not being grounded properly, or building one\u2019s identity on what's not made to last. It's a spiritual condition. See evidence for God's existence here: A compelling case for the existence of God? You decide.The Case for the SoulBut does the biblical heaven, and the biblical hell actually exist? Let's first start with what the King James Bible refers to as \u201cHell\u201d, which is translated from a variety of different words in the original Hebrew and Greek. One such word is \u0393\u03ad\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1, i.e. \"gehenna\", which is not a Greek word, but a transliteration of the Hebrew name (\u05d2\u05b5\u05bc\u05d9\u05d4\u05b4\u05e0\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd\u200e, g\u0113hinn\u00f4m), which refers to the perpetually burning trash dump in a small valley below the walls of Jerusalem. It was a place where Cananites were believed to sacrifice children to their gods. Jesus always used the term as an analogy.   \u201cThese people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.\u201d (Matthew 15:8) Many Christians believe that Hell is a literal place, a place of fire and brimstone, possibly underground somewhere. However, I believe that this view is just yet another thing which was taken out of context by literalists. Think about it, Hell is darkness, right? So how can there be any, light in hell, then? So no, the Hell that is commonly thought of does not exist, at least not in the way many people imagine it. However, I believe that Hell does exist. I think we can pretty much demonstrate that \u201chell-fire\u201d exists. You've probably already come into contact with a tiny glimpse of what it will be like. Really, think about it. When a person breaks up with their first love, or loses something else that they've grown attached to, what do you feel? Emptiness. But does that emptiness feel like nothing? No, it manifests as pain. And what do you find that many people refer to this feeling as? A living hell... Because that's exactly what hell is. Or rather, it is the seed of separation from God that is planted in your soul, a glimpse of what's to come. There it is people. Hell, in a sense does exist. That is Hell as in the spiritual/mental state, i.e. \u201chell-fire\u201d. But what about Hell, as in the designation? Well, I believe it exists on one of those extradimensional planes I mentioned. Whether you believe it or not, God is like a life support machine. If one does not believe in God, then God will take it in patience. However, when you pass from this life to the next God will do what any gentleman would do. He cuts you off. He severes the ties in the relationship. The only problem is that being cut off results in a spiritual death, since God is the source of all good, and this state of separation is metaphorically described as a blazing fire. In other words, hell-fire is an inner torment, not an outward physical burn. And it is infinitely and incomparably worse than any literal fire. Because you aren't losing flesh, your losing every part of your identity which could be considered good. Because all that is good comes only from God. You see, evil is a lack of good, it is an emptiness, a sense of unwholesomeness. This is the sort of state that demons exist in, although not all of them have been cast into the pit just yet.  The Zozo demon caught on camera  This state of separation is precisely why demonic entities are so wretchedly evil. Because they are the disembodied souls of the nephilim who were born eternally separated from God. The fallen angels are even worse off, because using their immense power and influence these beings willfully cut themselves off from God. Worse mistake they ever made, I can guarantee you. The designation for lost souls, which is Hell itself, is best described as a bottomless pit of desolation and unimaginable despair, otherwise referred to in multiple places as the abyss. 7 Bible verses about Abyss Hell is far worse than anything you could imagine, it is utter desolation. Demons will probably be in there with you as well, and they feed off that pain. They mock you, enrap you. Hell is by it's very essence the ultimate climax of death itself. As opposed to the gentle passing from this life to the next, which is the natural order of things, spiritual death is something that was made possible for humanity when our ancient ancestors first sinned, causing a separation from the presence of God. Learn more in-depth about Hell: Damien Cowl's answer to God: How can a loving God send people to hell?The Philosophical Truth About HellThe truth about societyIf God exists, then why doesn't God stop bad things from happening? There are a few reasons, the first is that it was humans that wanted to be our own \u201cgods\u201d and said in our hearts that we don't need God. So should we really blame God for allowing us to try to be our own \u201cgods\u201d to demonstrate just how dangerous and self-destructive this prideful way of thinking is? The second is that God doesn't force people, everything bad that happens is entirely self inflicted. The fact is, God doesn't have to lift a finger because in a sense people who hurt others are already dead. It doesn't matter how many innocent people a bad person were to cause harm to, because that person is more dead inside than his or her victims will ever be. In fact, if Christianity is true, then innocent murder victims are most likely spiritually alive, all wrongs forgotten in the next life. Nothing we do in this world has a lasting impact. Trauma doesn't exist in the afterlife, it only exists in the abyss, which is where the unsaved go. But heaven is not spiritual death, it's spiritual life. And since in biblical times the spiritual was seen as more substantial than the material, it goes without saying that the existence of the innocent dead in paradise completely drowns out any pain they possibly could have experienced here on earth. These things suddenly have no weight anymore. People who hurt other's aren't really hurting their victims so much as themselves. For those who are innocent, nothing anyone can do on this earth will have a lasting effect. Earthly things are just dust in the wind. Our well being is secure in the long run. Sometimes God executes earthly judgment, but he only does so to keep those who seek him on the right path. For those who do not seek him with the fullness of their heart, God does not punish them, he allows them to go their own way, and to dig their own grave. If they don't want him, then he's not going to get in their face about it. They were warned about the consequences of their actions, and they rejected the Gospel message. Nothing else needs to be done. They chose their path. The people who do wrong are already on a self destructive path. People dig their own graves. God gives everyone time to ask him to help them out, but if they deny his help God's not going to force them to admit that they need help, rather it would be just to let such a hellbent person fall to their own demise. It's wrong to force help on someone who doesn't want it.   \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\u201d (John 8:12) In Judaism, many rabbis use the term Olam Ha-Ba to refer to a heaven-like afterlife. In some messianic traditions it can used it to refer the age of resurrection, which is a similar concept to the doctrine of the Millennial reign, which teaches that a thousand year long Golden Age or Paradise will occur on Earth prior to the final judgment and future eternal state of the \"World to Come\". When the Talmud does speak of Olam Ha-Ba in connection to the afterlife, it often uses it interchangeably with the term Gan Eden (\u201cthe Garden of Eden\u201d), referring to a heavenly realm where souls reside after physical death. The use of the term Gan Eden to describe \u201cheaven\u201d suggests that the rabbis conceived of the afterlife as a return to the blissful existence of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden before the \u201cfall.\u201d It is generally believed that in Gan Eden the human soul exists in a disembodied state until the time of bodily resurrection in the days of the Messiah. However, many Christians have gotten the concept of Heaven, as in the afterlife, confused with the heavens, which refers to the skies, or likewise the cosmos. My understanding is that these are two different things, and indeed different words are used in the original Hebrew. I believe that there are a number of different extradimensional \u201cheavens\u201d, which may coincide with the different choirs of angelic beings. Heaven might also refer to the recreated Earth in Christian eschatology, which is a type of New Eden, a paradise, or it could also refer to a state of stasis for the blessed souls of the dead, which is basically when the spirits of the saved return to God's bossom, so to speak, awaiting the resurrection.  What are angelic beings? Angels are interdimensional beings, the Hebrew word typically used is m\u0259l\u0101k\u0331 (\u05de\u05b2\u05dc\u05b0\u05d0\u05b8\u05da\u05b0), which means \u201cmessenger\u201d, or \u201crepresentative\u201d. However m\u0259l\u0101k\u0331 can also refer to human messengers, or intercessors, thus making it a bit difficult when reading a simple English translation. Although commonly depicted in pop-culture and contemporary religious art as resembling fair humans with birdlike wings, the ancient biblical texts bring a much more bizarre, otherworldly, and almost Lovecraftianesque portrayal. Although, they are sometimes said to take on human guise when dealing with human beings.  Angels are often given dominion over different celestial bodies or formations and numerological, alchemical, or astrological signs are attributed to some of them. Angels can also embody certain attributes or tasks. Many of the angels (at least among those we supposedly know by name) also have sigils which are associated with them. A sigil is an inscribed or painted symbol used in certain traditions for ritual or prayer to symbolize what are considered to be supernatural powers. In regards to angels, the term has usually referred to a type of pictorial signature which is supposedly a representation of a particular angel.  However, sigils are also often associated with witchcraft, specifically go\u00ebtia and \u201cdemonic magick\u201d, so I'd personally advise against having anything to do with this sort of thing. In chaos magick, the word sigil refers to a symbolic representation of the practitioner's desired outcome. Therefore, this not an endorsement of Occult practices, rather it is simply intended to be an example of how certain things are often attributed to angels. Where are they? These entities exist in the 'heavenly' realms, which, as I've discussed previously I believe these are basically extradimensional planes of reality. However they have long had the capacity to manifest themselves into our material plane of existence. It is generally understood that this can be done numerous ways\u2014not yet fully grasped by modern science. Manifesting into our physical reality is to an angel what tinkering with a simulation is to an expert programmer. As highly advanced beings from a plane of reality unlike our own it's not difficult to believe that these beings might posses super advanced technology, which could play apart in much of what they are said to be able to do. My other answer is a definite must read, as it goes into depth about fallen angels: Damien Cowl's answer to Are Pagan gods demons? Biblical classification: SERAPHIM  These are the highest order or choir of angels. These particular angels serve as guardians or attendants before God\u2019s throne. The word seraph comes from the Hebrew s\u0101r\u0101f (\u05e9\u05b8\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05e3), which literally means \u201cfiery-one\u201d, typically referring to the shine of brass. The only Bible verse where they are referenced is in Isaiah 6:1-7. They praise God, calling, \u201cHoly Holy Holy is the Lord of Hosts.\u201d What\u2019s interesting to note about Seraphim is that they have six wings. Two of their wings cover their faces, two cover their feet and the other two are for flying. Personally, I think that the \u201cwings\u201d may be symbolic for interdimensional travel, or perhaps a figurative representation of status, since they don't always appear as having wings. CHERUBIM Following Seraphim in the angelic hierarchy comes Cherubim. They are the second highest in the nine order of angels. These beings were originally considered to be a class of Seraphim. Both cherubim and seraphim are depicted in Ancient Israelite art as winged serpents, similar to the uraeus in Ancient Egyptian lore. While seraphim are said to have six wings, cherubim only have two to four.  Ancient Israelite seals depicting seraphim/cherubim. There are also the anointed cherubs which are said to guards the throne of God. The being which came to be known as Lucifer (\u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc\u200e, h\u00eal\u0113l i.e. \u201cmorning star\u201d) used to be one of the anointed cherubs before he fell, which, being stripped of his name and authority, he afterwards renamed himself Satan (\u05d4\u05b7\u05e9\u05b8\u05c2\u05d8\u05b8\u05df, ha-\u015b\u0101t\u0101n i.e. \u201cThe Adversary\u201d). Two such beings were depicted on the Ark of the Covenant.  In the ancient world the serpent symbolized immortality and divine wisdom, so they may not be literal serpentine entities. THRONES  The Thrones are a class of angels mentioned by the Apostle Paul in Colossians 1:16. This verse says, \"For in Him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and for Him.\" The Thrones are the angels of humility, peace and submission. If the lower Choir of Angels need to access God, they would have to do that through the Thrones. DOMINIONS  This group of angels are said to keep the world in proper order. They are known for delivering God\u2019s justice in unjust situations, showing mercy toward human beings and helping angels in lower ranks stay organized and perform their work efficiently. They also are recognized for expressing unconditional love at the same time they express God's justice. VIRTUES  Virtues are known for their control of the elements. Some even refer to them as \u201cthe shining ones.\u201d In addition to being the Spirits of Motion, they also assist in governing nature. They also assist with miracles. They are also known for their work encouraging humans to strengthen their faith in God. POWERS  The Powers are considered Warrior Angels as they defend against evil, defending not only the cosmos but also humanity. They are also called the Powers because they have power over the devil, in order to restrain the power of the demons. They also help people who are wrestling with passions ad vices to cast out any evil promoted by the enemy. PRINCIPALITIES  The Principalities have command over the lower angels. They also direct the fulfillment of divine orders. They are also known as Princedoms or Rules as they directly watch over large groups and institutions, including nations and the Church. They also ensure the fulfillment of the divine Will. While these angels are still wise and powerful, they are furthest from God in the angelic hierarchy so they are better able to communicate with man in ways we can understand. ARCHANGELS  Archangels are called the great heralds of the Good News because they are sent by God to deliver important messages to mankind. They are the ones that communicate and interact with us. Michael is believed to be the angel who delivered God\u2019s divine inspiration to John in the Book of Revelation and is known as the protector of the Church, guarding her from evil. Michael is most widely known for his role in expelling Lucifer from heaven. Gabriel is first mentioned in the Book of Daniel and helps Daniel in his mission on earth. Later on, Gabriel appears to Zachariah and the Blessed Virgin Mary, delivering the greatest message ever that God meant to Incarnate and set his tent with us. Raphael is mentioned in the Book of Tobit, to heal Tobit and deliver Sarah from a demon. Raphael accomplished both acts, disguised as a human, guiding Tobias along the way and instructing him on what to do. MALACHIM  The Malachim are closest to the material world and human beings. They also delivers the prayers to God and other messages to people on earth. One of the greatest characteristics about the Malachim is that they are most caring and social to assist those who ask for help. According to Scripture, angels have various responsibilities and roles in God\u2019s Kingdom. We are ultimately encouraged by the knowledge that God\u2019s angels are at work. There are also circumstances where angels may even visit us. God, who is responsible for creating the angels has also promised us His presence in the face of life\u2019s storms.  Do we continue after death? If one can prove that our consciousness continues to exist after death, then judging from our current state, and how it continually grows worse throughout our lifespan, then it goes without saying that Hell, or at least the state anyway, most certainly does exist. Whether or not heaven exists would be more difficult. What is interesting is that when an egg is fertilized there is a flash of light (for those of you who don't know, yes, every bit of scientific evidence proves that life begins at conception). What is even more strange is that an armed forces team observed a similar light leaving the body of their fallen comrads. This was observable using heat vision equipment. Notice how the light floats upwards until you can no longer see it? It could've been faked, though I think this is definitely worth looking into. Maybe this is something that actually happens. Think about it. Light flashes when you're born. What if that same light leaves your body once your brain shuts down completely? Maybe, using a type of thermo vision, researchers could catch sight of it when a person is killed instantly (like, if they get shot in the brain or something). Not that I'm saying we should replicate that, but it's an interesting thought. Of course, the scientific explanation for this is that the bright flash occurs because when sperm enters an egg it leads to a surge of calcium which triggers the release of zinc from the egg. As the zinc shoots out, it binds to small molecules which emit a fluorescence which can be picked up by camera microscopes. You can also learn more about life after death here: Learn the Evidence: Life Continues After Physical DeathScientists Just Captured The Flash of Light That Sparks When a Sperm Meets an EggAs of yet many scientists believe that when a person dies, conciseness dies with them. Humans are just biological machines that propagate DNA, and that there's no such thing as a soul.

            "answer_text": "Do you believe in hell & heaven? If so why? That is the most difficult question I have ever seen offered on Quora. There is no absolute answer as you would have to be dead and then come back to Earth at precisely, the same time and same place as you die. One glance at the Sky and the Milky Way and you would soon realize the difficulty in obtaining that part of it. There are indeed Billions upon Billions of Planets and who knows what is out there. Hell and Heaven are based on Religion. There are hundreds of different Religions that believe in different things. The bulk of Religions are based on Faith and that one is a hard one to prove also. Most people believe just because they believe. No rhyme nor reason to the philosophy, it just is. Now we come to the real Question and the reason it is not as clear as mud to me. It has to do with what you believe and what is taught. If you believe that their is an all knowing, all encompassing, all powerful and one who loves his children, then you would have to go with \u201cno Hell\u201d and only heaven. Here is why. I saw a mother, driven to a State Prison to watch her son be executed in a Texas execution chamber. The Mother was crying, Couldn\u2019t control her grief or her sorrow. It was obvious at the moment that no matter how many her son had dispatched, she was going to love him unconditionally. No matter what he did, she was still going to love him. Now fast forward to Religion. The only way that Religion works or controls people, is fear of burning in Hell. If God was as powerful as we all believe he is, then he takes on a parental role over all of his children and that means you and me. Do you believe for one minute that a Parent would allow his son or daughter to perish in front of his eyes without putting up a fight? People have jumped in front of moving trains to save a child, ran into burning buildings and even jumped into freezing water. What makes you think God is any different. Do you think he would let his child burn in hell? Second, if Hell exist at all, it is because of a fallen Angel call Lucifer or Satan, take your choice. Now if God is as Powerful as we all believe he is, there is no one that can compete including some pip squeak fallen angel that got a runners up trophy instead of ruling the whole place. He lost. If a physical fight would ever break out, I would put my money on the deity we call GOD. You asked the right question but in the wrong way. It\u2019s not if we believe in Heaven and Hell, it\u2019s if we believe in Religion? If you don\u2019t believe In Hell, you don\u2019t need a Priest. You don\u2019t need a Church to show you the way to Paradise, you just earn it by being a decent person here on earth. God doesn\u2019t need any money so you don\u2019t have to contribute to some guy that drives a Cadillac or wears a Diamond Ring. You take Hell out of the equation, and Religion just doesn\u2019t work. Being a good person still does. Believing in a higher Power still has it\u2019s advantages and possibly living a better life if you are afraid of looking bad in front of a parental authority and not wanting to make him sad. The rules still work about not killing people or stealing. Even morals will make you a better person. Instead of Hell, maybe you should be thinking about what you will be doing for eternity in Heaven. There are a lot of places that could be considered different forms of Hell on Earth and I can accept that there might be a lot of places in Heaven that are different too. You might want to be reunited with someone you love in Heaven or you might want to sing in the Choir. If you believe in Religion, please God, not some weak fallen angel that get\u2019s way to much respect for being a loser. I believe that God\u2019s house will be big enough to handle all the masses that want to believe. If you don\u2019t, then pick out a nice park for you to be buried in as Eternity is a long time. Try to find a place under a Tree. The roots should not get to you for at least a decade. ",

            "answer_text": "Heaven and hell cannot exist. It is one of the many fantasies created by religions. That adults still believe it is remarkable. When logic is applied to the idea difficulties arise. What would a heaven look like? A baby who died would surely not remain a baby in heaven for eternity. It would need care to grow and mature. If its parents were still on earth who would look after it? Would it age in heaven? For a child to grow it needs to go to school and socialise, go through puberty, get married and so on. Or another young person, dying before having the chance of a family, would be denied this important reproductive experience. If it were possible to have children in heaven, would they be breast fed and later given earthly foods or would it be some form of mystical food. Surely we would not eat and grow food in such a place. An old person dying in pain from cancer and unable to walk would not want to continue in this condition in heaven. He would want to be younger, anything else would be a disappointment. If a cook died heaven would not be a happy experience as his/her chosen profession would be denied. I can\u2019t see how golfing, football, flying, stamp collecting, fishing and just about every other pleasure that humans have enjoyed on Earth could be possible in heaven. We would be left with conversation but what would there be to talk about? Even if one engaged in melancholic reminiscences, could this be done eternally? Heaven would soon become hell. Any rigorous logical examination of heaven soon shows the impossibility of this idea. Logic can also be applied to the idea of a hell. How could a person with no material body suffer pain? Who would keep the fires burning to keep people in pain? The logical difficulties are endless so the idea of heavens and hells can be considered a myth. Heaven and hell are carrot and stick mechanisms to stop people leaving the respective religion. The devoted and convinced religious person brushes all these arguments aside as trivial saying that heaven and hell are so different that the pleasure and pain cannot be understood in human terms. This is a cover for \u201cI do not know\u201d. It is a \u201cgod works in mysterious ways\u201d type of argument. But with these convenient answers no attempt is made to say in detail exactly what these new pleasures and pains could be. Where does the eternal bliss come from? ",

            "answer_text": "I believe the Bible is Yahs/God's word. Now I'm going to be honest and tell you the truth because those who will ACKNOWLEDGE HaMessiach as Yahs only begotten son.,confess their sin to God and repent/turn to God as your turning from sin by keeping God's commandments will receive eternal life. Now the Word of Yah speaks of the heavens and earth. There are three Heavens. 1. Right above our heads, the atmosphere, the space above the clouds. 2. Where the solar system is, space along with the planets. 3. Where Yahuah dwells and Yahusha Hammesiach / The Messiah who died for our sin, according to the scripture, rose from the grave with all power given to him from his father in heaven and is now seated at God's right hand. The Bible speaks of the New Jerusalem that will be comming down from heaven as a bride adorned for her husband. In the book of John 14th chapter says. In my father's house there are many mansions! These mansions are for somebody lolol!! We will inherit the earth under a new Government. The Twelve tribes of Yisrael and their decendents will be in leadership then along with Yahusha Hammesiach our Hebrew Royal King! Heavenly Bliss will be on Earth then. Heaven is a temporary place for some as He pours out His wrath on the earth to defeat the evil world as we know it. GET RIGHT AND GET READY. START OUT BY TREATING GODS TRUE PEOPLE THE AMERICAN NEGRO RIGHT. LOVE THEM. HELP THEM CARE FOR THEM. YOU CANT SAY YOU LOVE GOD AND HATE HIS TRUE PEOPLE, HIS CHILDREN THE ISRAELITE DECENDENTS. DO NOT BE FOOLED. WHY DO YOU THINK WERE SUFFERING NOW?? AND SUFFERED BACK THEN AFTER SLAVERY?? JEALOUSY!! THEY KNOW WHO WE ARE!!!!! Hell is translated wrongly in the kJv bible. I'm honest! The correct word is Hades. Hell is really the dirt dug grave!! The bible speaks of Gehenna where the fire burns eternally and this was an example of a real place, and giving us an example how the place of torment will be even if one person does not burn eternally as some good people believe and as some believe they will be burnt up. Now the bible says in Rev. That in the kingdom to come, Yahusha HaMessiach will gather His people on every Sabbath day and view the souls of those who were wicked burn in the lake of fire! Hmm that was never taught in bible school or church! So yes I believe the burning will be eternal. How and with whom exactly. Remains a mystery only Yahuah knows!!Revelation 20:10-15 ESV / 23 helpful votesHelpful Not Helpful And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. ",

            "answer_text": "In reply to the question, I shall share a story very close to my heart . There was a village in England. A person named Mathew was notorious  for  never visiting church and for his athesim. One day, when he was passing by near the church, he overheard the priest saying that those who do good works and believe in god go to the heaven. Mathew entered into the church for the first time.Everybody was surprised. He asked the priest\"whether the persons who do good work but do not believe in god go to hell or the persons who do not act good but believe in god go to heaven\" The priest thought and thought .He felt that if  he says that those who believe in god but do not do good work and still go to the heaven than there would not remain any importance of good work. Conversely , if he says that those who do good works but do not believe in god,  do not go to heaven then there would not remain importance of remembering  and believing god and the people might turn  into athiests. He was an honest person. He confessed to Mathew that he did not know the answer  and that he would  reply to the question next Friday at the time of church prayer. The priest went to his house and thought deeply. He could not find any answer. He knew that if he did not answer the question , Mathew and similar athiestic people who did not trust god would become more vocal against existance of god ,heavan and hell. Soon the next Thursday night came and the priest was still clueless about the answer to the question. While thinking he slept. He saw a dream...he saw that there was a train on a station full of passangers.the train was about to leave for its destination....the destination was heaven!!!The priest embarked on the train. Soon the train was at the doorstep of the heaven. He got down the train and entered the heaven. He wanted to know whether big thinkers like Buddha, Mahavir and confusius etc. ,who were very good persons but did not believe in existance of god, were there.He searched and searched but could not locate them . He also noticed that the heavan was not very happy place either and all his notions about heaven being a beautiful and peaceful place were misplaced. It was a very insapid and lacklusture place without any sign of happiness!!!! Suddenly he heard a noise ....the train was now going to hell.....he jumped and cought the train...soon the train reached hell!!! But it was beautiful...people were enjoying ..laughing...the were looking contended... he also noticed Buddha..Mahavira and other learned people ..they were also looking very happy....there were flowers and animals all arround living in peaceful coexistance.... Soon, the priest was awake. He saw that it was morning. He had to answer the questions. He rushed to the church...he was not afraid... He reached the church. He noticed that Michel was already there, smiling.Before Michel could ask him any question ,the priest replied that it was true that those who do not do good works but believe in god go to the heavan ...further those who do not believe in god but do good works go to the hell...he further explained...the heaven and hell are not geographical places but conditions surrounding you...bad people wherever the go create hell. Conversely, good people wherever they go creates heaven.. ",

            "answer_text": "Given that heaven and hell, as we know them, mainly come from the Judaeo-Christian tradition, it seems unlikely. The Tanakh - what Christians call the \u201cOld Testament\u201d - is the canonised Jewish writings from the first temple period and the exile, with a couple of early post-exilic writings which traditionally were the end of prophecy. The later stuff, which developed the idea of the shaitan - the opponent - more, didn\u2019t make it into the canon, neither Christian nor Jewish. But then Christians took on the idea and decided that Jesus, whose name means \u201csaviour\u201d had been on earth to save people from their wicked nature that came from Adam. What then of people who don\u2019t avail themselves of this salvation? Well, there must be some punishment. The idea of heaven had always been around, as some kind of wish. Many people like to think that their loved ones who have died are still alive somehow, and hopefully in a better place, where there are no more problems or worried. That seems like a nice thought. So if you trace these ideas you can pretty clearly see how they evolved. If they came from God you\u2019d think he would have explained them somewhere, probably early on, right? Other religions do have ideas of an afterlife, but they\u2019re often either very different, or they\u2019re influenced by Christianity and Judaism. Islam, of course, used Christianity and Judaism as a base, and so has a lot of similar ideas. In most other religions though, the idea was much less certain. You could only hope that maybe you would go somewhere better after you died. The idea that you would come back to this world or another one like it, were quite common. Often this depended on how well you had behaved. This is still what most Hindus believe. If you behave very very well, through many lives, you might eventually not have to come back at all, and go to Moksha, which is more about not existing at all then about a place where you play the harp all day. If you think about what it means for you to come back as a different person, it starts to sound a lot like you don\u2019t come back at all. Because if you\u2019re a different person, you\u2019re not you, are you? So that\u2019s Buddhism. So no, there is no heaven and there is no hell. Not in any literal sense. \u201cYou\u201d exist only while you are alive. So make the most of this life and don\u2019t hang out for a better one, this is your one shot. It\u2019s a short, fleeting, illusion. But what an illusion! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi,Your question is;Is there a way to prove hell and heaven exist?Yes. All it takes is to understand what Jesus really taught. How do we do that?The first step is to recognize that church itself teaches that the church is confused. They state that the bible is difficult to understand even for their own bible scholars. Most Christians apparently see that as 'credentials' rather than failure.Jesus had tens of thousands of people that followed him for days, even without food. He taught a simple and important way to live. The lesson about heaven and hell as taught by Jesus, is as follows; when we allow worry, doubt, fear, anger, anxiety, jealousy, guilt and other forms of unease into our life then we are 'living in sin' and with that sin we create a life of hell, right here and now. If we keep unease out of our life then we have the kind of peace Jesus promises us. We live a life in heaven.The choice we have between 1) living in sin which is also known as trusting Satan, our own Ego, and 2) trusting God. These choices are the 'free will' we have and Jesus calls the choice, 'our cross to bear'.Jesus taught this simple message over and over and provided details of how to trust God. He taught us that we are not to worry about tomorrow. The church only teaches us to worry about tomorrow and heaven and hell as an after life occurence, but their teaching is not surprising. The church disagrees with Jesus on 25 other points.If you allow worry and other unease into your life then the hell you are living in will be proof enough of its existence, unless of course that hell has become a 'comfort zone' and as a result, seems perfectly acceptable. If you are interested in, but have not yet experienced 'heaven' I recommend that you read 'The People Whisperer' by Jan Maria Reijers available on Kobo and Kindle or in paperback at Chapters or online at flagpoleproductions.com, for the details of how to get to heaven, as taught by Jesus.Peace and Joy,John ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Is it true that heaven and hell really exist? Answer: Which heaven and which Hell? In Christianity you of course have Heaven and Hell. More on that later. In Judaism you have Heaven = Olam Ha-Ba or Gan Eden Hell = Nothing exactly like it they have Sheol = dark pit/grave where every person goes and Gehenna = place of atonement where sinners and non-believers go for no more than 1 year to learn from their mistakes. There is no concept of eternal punishment in the Jewish faith. One would think that as the Jewish faith is the oldest of the 3 Abrahamic faiths that would be the end of this part of the discussion. YHWH spoke to Moses about all the important things and it would be valid to assume that he did not lie to Moses. In Islam you have Heaven = Jannah but has 8 levels or doors Hell = Jahannam and has 7 levels. Some sects of Islam believe it is eternal while others believe it is not. Those who are wretched shall be in the Fire: There will be for them therein (nothing but) the heaving of sighs and sobs: They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord willeth: for thy Lord is the (sure) accomplisher of what He planneth. And those who are blessed shall be in the Garden: They will dwell therein so long for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord willeth: a gift without break. S. 11:106-108 The Dharmic religions with the ideals of reincarnation and Karma have a completely different concept of \u201cheaven\u201d in which you journey on the path towards Brahma (Moksha) and basically hell is having to endure the rebirth into a lower life form (it is a little more technical- see Samsara). The Buddhist have Nirvana and their version of hell id extremely complex and is called Naraka. There are hundreds of layers and a a being is born into Naraka as a result of the Karma they have accumulated and stay there until it is paid in full so to speak. At that point they will be born into a higher realm. Again this is over-simplifying. Now to the Christian version of Hell. In the first few centuries Hell was seen more like the Jewish version and was referred to as Purgatory. When the Torah became the OT translation errors started to occur. Sheol and Gehenna became Hades. There was no Satan/Devil doling out punishments as the word Satan comes from the Hebrew ha-satan meaning THE ACCUSER or THE ADVERSARY and was a title not an entity. Look at Job in the Torah. YHWH was surrounded by his council of higher angels and ha-satan was among them. Ha-Satan was unable to to anything without YHWH\u2019s prior permission so it is obvious this angel was subservient to YHWH. When the Islamic religion started spreading into Christian territories there were battles not only for the land and wealth of the area but for the people that occupied the lands. Wars cannot be fought without Armies. How do you get the populace to join your army and not the other guy\u2019s army when you are fighting religious wars? You have to make the rewards greater and the punishment greater. This in when Hell took on the eternal lake of fire and punishment and Satan become a fierce entity almost on par with God. But for you Christians reading this you must know that there really is no eternal punishment and this is according to the Bible not me. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Ezek 18:20 The soul that sinneth, it shall die Rev 20:14\u201315 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. So my answer is heaven and hell exist in the minds of the believers only and then only to the degree in which they have been indoctrinated. If you accept the Christian version and dismiss all the other version I will ask you why? On what basis to you reject the faiths of others? Lack of evidence perhaps? Every theist makes a Plead for Special Exemption against the constraints of the evidence and lack of evidence they use to dismiss all other faiths. The only difference is that I use the same criteria against their religion and gods and tenets as I do against ALL religions and gods and tenets. ",

            "answer_text": "Heaven and Hell, as described in the Bible, violate the laws of physics. If those laws are true, then at least the biblical version Heaven and Hell are false. If, for example, souls can rise to Heaven, then they must carry information - specifically \u201cGood enough for Heaven\u201d or \u201cNot\u201d. If they can carry information, then they must follow Unitarity (physics) - Wikipedia. This means that souls are bound to the laws of physics. Those laws dictate that anything that can carry information must also deform spacetime - they must have gravity. So Heaven must weigh something. What\u2019s more, the Bible says that Heaven has \u201cmany rooms\u201d (Bible Gateway passage: John 14:2 - English Standard Version) and that Heaven is eternal (Bible Gateway passage: John 3:16 - English Standard Version) OK, so Heaven exists, it has many rooms, it lasts forever, and it keeps getting heavier. Heaven will eventually collapse into a black hole. Now, does this prove that Heaven doesn\u2019t exist? No. It just means that Heaven can\u2019t follow the laws of physics. Ditto for Hell - the Bible describes it as having a burning lake of sulfur (Bible Gateway passage: Revelation 21:8 - English Standard Version) which obviously cannot exist for eternity because of the law of conservation of mass. Unless Hell just produces infinite quantities of sulfur and oxygen, in which case it becomes a black hole as well. So, Heaven and Hell\u2026black holes? Maybe. But real places in our universe? Not if the laws of physics are true. ",

            "answer_text": "This is just my personal opinion on this idea of the afterlife. I'd say it's more along the lines of if you do believe in either of them, you spend your life worrying about where you'd end up and that worry alone basically puts you in a type of mental hell. You constantly second guess yourself or anticipate some kind of retribution for your actions. Not only will you be internalizing this fear to behave according to standards set by other humans (religion is entirely born out of mans imagination) you will also be living a life of constant fear from your own society to conform as the retribution wont come from any God, it'll come from the people you know and love. Hell in this instance really is other people. And it's all as real as you decide to let it be. If you look at the \"contributions\" that religions have brought into the world, you'll find they do a lot of harm in the name of an intangible unexplainable unprovable  God. Even though ISIS really has the worlds attention with this in particular time, don't forget what the Christians were like in the past and even today with scandalous and rampant global child molestation being protected by the Vatican itself.  Being religious doesn't make you good. Being good makes you good, and even then, it comes down to human constructs and norms. Paganism saw the way to enter Heaven through glorious bloody battle and often brutally killed innocent people. You don't even have to step out into nature to see the sadistic nature of life, cats love to play with mice before killing them. Who is to say that the pagans were wrong? If heaven were real what if the only way to enter is to be hardened brutal killers and survivors instead of pacifists in robes? I could go on and I'm sure you can too.  In the end all religion is flawed because they are institutions set up and managed by man and whilst it may have seemed like a good idea at the time, religion has proven otherwise time and time again ESPECIALLY in and as a result of an ever globalizing era. We have inflated egos, and can't share a universal God as a direct result of the labels, connotations and denotations that come with individual religions. Don't get me wrong, I think religions still have great cultural value in keeping communities together and other cool stuff but when it comes to matters of God, unless people can all find a happy place to be together there will always be war and killing for God(s). By believing so deeply and faithfully in their individual gods so hard, they have made it hell for each other and their own people. Again, if you let it, it will become your reality.  Instead of dwelling on whether or not these places exist, know that its your responsibility as an individual to find your own relationship with God without preconceived ideas and biases - if thats what you choose to believe - or don't bother with any of it at all and just focus on being a human being, educating yourself and discovering what you truly love in this life and what is has to offer you OR best of all do both.

            "answer_text": "If there is a Heaven there is a Hell if there is a Hell there is a Heaven Heaven is indeed a real place. The Bible tells us that heaven is God\u2019s throne (Isaiah 66:1; Acts 7:48-49; Matthew 5:34-35). After Jesus\u2019 resurrection and appearance on earth to His disciples, \u201cHe was taken up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God\u201d (Mark 16:19; Acts 7:55-56). \u201cChrist did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; He entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God\u2019s presence\u201d (Hebrews 9:24). Jesus not only went before us, entering on our behalf, but He is alive and has a present ministry in heaven, serving as our high priest in the true tabernacle made by God (Hebrews 6:19-20; 8:1-2). We are also told by Jesus Himself that there are many rooms in God\u2019s house and that He has gone before us to prepare a place for us. We have the assurance of His word that He will one day come back to earth and take us to where He is in heaven (John 14:1-4). Our belief in an eternal home in heaven is based on an explicit promise of Jesus. Heaven is most definitely a real place. Heaven truly does exist. When people deny the existence of heaven, they deny not only the written Word of God, but they also deny the innermost longings of their own hearts. Paul addressed this issue in his letter to the Corinthians, encouraging them to cling to the hope of heaven so that they would not lose heart. Although we \u201cgroan and sigh\u201d in our earthly state, we have the hope of heaven always before us and are eager to get there (2 Corinthians 5:1-4). Paul urged the Corinthians to look forward to their eternal home in heaven, a perspective that would enable them to endure hardships and disappointments in this life. \u201cFor our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal\u201d (2 Corinthians 4:17-18). Just as God has put in men\u2019s hearts the knowledge that He exists (Romans 1:19-20), so are we \u201cprogrammed\u201d to desire heaven. It is the theme of countless books, songs, and works of art. Unfortunately, our sin has barred the way to heaven. Since heaven is the abode of a holy and perfect God, sin has no place there, nor can it be tolerated. Fortunately, God has provided for us the key to open the doors of heaven\u2014Jesus Christ (John 14:6). All who believe in Him and seek forgiveness for sin will find the doors of heaven swung wide open for them. May the future glory of our eternal home motivate us all to serve God faithfully and wholeheartedly. \u201cSince we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is his body, and since we have a great high priest over the house of God, let us draw near to God with a sincere heart full of assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water\u201d (Hebrews 10:19-22).

Nobody knows if you will or will not be. Nobody knows if there is a plan or not, a destiny, or a purpose higher than the one you choose for your self, and anyone that says otherwise is promoting their world view. Nobody knows whether(or what) special rituals, practices, and absolutions have any intrinsic meaning to reality, but plenty will try to shape your behaviour and some will feel threatened if you do not conform. Nobody knows if there is if there is some sort of all powerful creator, but plenty will try to convince you that they have special insight into the matter. If such a being exists, nobody really knows whether it has any awareness at all towards humans. Nobody really knows if it is at all concerned about(or even notices) tiny human actions, such as sexual practices, or rituals meant to attract favour, or harm to others. Nobody really knows if such a being expects to be thought about. Anyone that tries to insist that they know any of these things is selling you a personal story intended to promote their agenda. They may have good intentions, but ultimately, they are serving their own interests, and you will have to sort out if it aligns with your own.

            "answer_text": "This may not be proof, but it's always something that supports it: (All of these things are worth researching, because they're not only ''proof'' but they're also really fascinating and interesting) : 1) PORTRAIT OF OUR LADY OF GUADELUPE     It's a portrait that has never been explained scientifically by any scientist, historian, archeologist, optician, etc. It is just fascinating. This is an excerpt from one website about the portrait : How can a cloth painting last almost 500 years?Infra-red studies also revealed other unexplainable phenomena: The image was not painted, and the color did not penetrate the fibers as would paint. Weaving with such irregular fibers also produced a rough surface which would have distorted any simple surface painting, yet the image one sees is clear and undistorted.Richard Kuhn, the 1938 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, found that the image did not have natural animal or mineral colorings. Given that there were no synthetic colorings in 1531, the image is inexplicable.Dr. Tonsmann insisted that the basic image had not been painted by human hand. Made of the \"ayate\" fibers used by the Indians, the tilma should have deteriorated centuries ago. It was not sized and has no protective coat of varnish. Anything of cactus fiber would have deteriorated within a hundred years, especially when exposed to the pollution, candle soot, and the like. Nevertheless, the tilma remains.  Not proof, but something that supports the existence of Heaven and Hell. 2) THE TESTIMONY OF GLORIA POLO    Not proof, but supports the existence of Heaven and Hell. 3) THE LITTLE BOY WHO WENT TO HEAVEN Little boy who says he went to Heaven \u2013 then came back! 4) THE POSSESIONS OF ANNELIESE MICHEL    It's hard not to believe in this. Try watching the documentary about it. 5) THE HUMAN BRAIN    I find it really hard to believe that some chemical reaction resulted in something so complex, something that can process information, remember things, analize things, etc.  6) THE WORLD    Also, a chemical reaction wouldn't create only ONE planet that was perfect and contained the possibility of living. If you look at a tree, you see a tree. But that one tree has parts that function in some specific way. And those parts have parts that function and THOSE parts also have parts. This example could also be used with humans. After all, we have a body and that body has parts which have parts which have parts which have parts. This might sound like nonesense, but it's illogical how people think that some explosion created things like this. 7) JESUS     Jesus Christ is pretty much proof. It's not even like it is a legend, because such a person had lived at that time and it was proven that Jesus had existed. Therefore, it's weird to think that some guy who said he was God in human flesh received so many followers, even at that time. He must have proved somehow to show that he actually was God. If a man came up to you saying he was God, you wouldn't believe him unless he did something to prove it, right? So how come so many people believe in Jesus? How come there is a completely new religion devoted to him? How come the miracles he performed are recorded in a book written by numerous people? ",

            "answer_text": "I wrote about this in my upcoming book \"After Life\" being released May 6. Heaven and hell, as we believe them to be in our current culture, is very far removed from what the authors of the Bible saw or believed in. All concepts aside, quantum field theory (QFT) gives us some ideas on the afterlife. From a physics perspective, something like hell, a place full of ever-burning fire, is unrealistic because there would need to be a constant supply of fuel for the flames to continue raging on. Plus, the \"demons\", Satan, et al, are not mentioned within those specific roles (namely demons being figures that tortured, and Satan being the ruler) in hell. Also, if we take the concept of \"the heavens\" being just a dome around the earth, it is safe to say we have found no evidence of any such place. Now, the QFT piece. TO get an idea of QFT, imagine four men sitting in boats out on the water. One of them has a sack of potatoes that he tosses from his boat into another. As the sack is tossed and caught between the two boats, there are waves, or ripples, that reach out and affect all four boats in the water. On the quantum level, subatomic particles work in a similar fashion. There are about four total that we can see interact with other particles, and they all affect the others in particular ways, even when not interacting with them. Anything in our physical world is noticeably affected by other things through QFT. That means, when objects like quarks appear randomly, and then disappear after a fraction of a second, it is detected on the quantum level by the particles they affect. So, if any supernatural element, say an ever-present deity, heaven, hell, spirits, demons, etc., came into or out of our physical realm, it would be detectable. But we do not detect anything remotely close to that idea. Long story short, no. No I do not think heaven and hell are real.  ",

            "answer_text": "Which ones? Most heavens sound very boring, or drug , or sophisticated whore houses. Angels with harps, eternal bliss (with your daily dose of ?), pure white clothes, and clouds, and men in beards. Others promise 99 virgins (give or take a few). Per man I suppose. I wonder what women think if the attraction of virgin men. I wonder if they have a disposal chute for the used virgins, or if they are recycled on some way. Some promise greetings by angels (that's special, right?). Fed on fruits (maybe the cooks are all in hell for spoiling the custard or ever cooking the fish), sitting on a throne, with beautiful gardens. Just a sampling, which would lead me to conclude like W.C Fields - \"on the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.\" Hell on the other hand has some more variety - demons assaulting your private parts with sharp objects, no air conditioning, and roaring fires. Endless pushing of stones up small hills, exotic tortures, bottomless pits fiery furnaces and lets not forget gnashing of teeth. Endless sorrow, wails and moans. Sounds like a bad day at Six Flags. I always wondered if the chaps running hell get extreme pay. Does Satan send them to heaven on the weekends to take a rest? Maybe its a swap for the virgins and the occasional cook. I don't know about you, but if God promised me rotating time-shares in His chalet in Switzerland, His yacht in Monaco, and his Japanese villa in Kyoto, I might take a shot at that Heaven. Long way to say, that these descriptions describe the limited imagination of the chaps who write up these concepts. Take it with a kilo of salt. And sulphur. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Next question? Oh, you want more detail. Well, yes I do believe that there is a concept called heaven where good people are rewarded, and a concept called Hell, where evil people are punished. However I don\u2019t believe either place actually exists. For starters, this reward or punishment is supposed to be eternal. How is it logical to reward or punish someone forever, for what you do in the insignificant time that you are alive? Imagine doing someone (who doesn\u2019t age) a small favour, eg. give them change for $1, and in return they give you free meals for the rest of your life, plus all of your descendants. Or conversely, imagine you steal a quarter from your (non-aging) dad\u2019s wallet as a kid, and not only does he throw you out of the house, but continues to punish you and all of your descendants whenever he can. Neither of these scenarios is even close to the disparity of heaven and hell. The comparison was even made regarding Hitler, being tortured for 100 years for every person who was even inconvenienced by WWII, and even that immense length of time would be insignificant to eternity. Secondly, some people think that god is omniscient, and knows everything past, present, and future. If that is the case, then free will or not, god knows exactly how you will respond to every decision you encounter in your life, and therefore whether you are destined for heaven or hell. So you were created with their destiny already decided. That also makes no sense. Unless of course god is an amoral monster\u2026 Since there isn\u2019t any actual evidence that heaven, hell, or god exists, I\u2019ll assume they don\u2019t since they don\u2019t make any sense. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer from an atheist, Questions about heaven, hell and life after death are all coming from the inability of our brain to comprehend the fact we and the ones we love will cease to exist one day. Yes, your best friend, your lover, your mom and dad, your dog/cat and you are all going to die one day and you can do nothing but helplessly watch their corpse being taken to the grave. That\u2019s reality and yea it\u2019s a bummer. The stories about life after death must be older than any known religion. But the concept of heaven and hell were popularized by religions. Basic idea is that god keeps a score card for all your actions and intentions if your score is good you will be send to heaven otherwise you are literally in hell. Since most people consider themselves as potential candidates for heaven. Let\u2019s explore the idea of heaven from a realistic perspective. Most Abrahamic religions has given detailed description about heaven for example in Muslim heaven you have rivers of vine, virgin girls for men (no virgin boys for women), free food etc. Christian heaven is also similar but no virgins. For most other religions it\u2019s full of happiness, no sorrow, sickness, tears etc. And most importantly in heaven you won\u2019t die. You live forever, which sounds very good but when you think of it is very boring and stupid. If you live forever you don\u2019t have to do anything today, you always have tomorrow. Imagine celebrating your 9725678th birthday in heaven while knowing that you will live for trillions of years. But here on earth all birthdays are important because you never will never know when you will kick the bucket. And you don\u2019t have a job in heaven for example if a doctor die and go to heaven he/she is practically jobless because there is no sickness in heaven. Same fate for a banker, carpenter, programmer and all other careers, if you can\u2019t do the one thing that made you who you are will that be still you? Another funny thing is all religious heaven is only as technologically advanced as the time period that religion originated, so don\u2019t expect Wi-Fi connection in heaven and PlayStation 4 and Netflix (bummer again). If a person who you love the most dies and ends up hell and you are in heaven, would that place be a heaven for you without him/her. For those who claim that in heaven you are with god and will be always happy, we know value of happiness because of sorrow and being happy doing nothing forever is not that different from our corpse slowing getting fossilized in thousands of years. It\u2019s very clear that the concept of heaven and hell is nothing but wishful thinking. We want to have all the pleasures that we enjoyed in real-life and more forever in heaven when we are dead and also we want to see the people who we hate get tortured in hell. There is nothing divine or spiritual about it. Concept of hell is even more ridiculous, merciful god created hell for eternal torture, contradicts the creator\u2019s nature and intentions. Of course you can argue about freewill, but a god with some common sense would not have given freewill and then put conditions afterwards. So in a weird way death makes life livable. Knowing that we are here only for a limited time gives us the urgency to do everything on a schedule. Otherwise we can just do everything later. Everything will get boring after a while. Remember the fact that you never existed before you were born your nonexistence after your death is not different from that, just that you will live in the memories of others who loves you till they die.

That is a wicked boring and dense way of seeing it. The way I see it is Heaven and Hell are kind of like karma. Deep down, people want to believe that what they are doing at the moment is meaningful. Like say I give a poor man $100, I get nothing out of it but a sort of self assurance. But what if I want something? I could just tell myself that when I die I will be judged for my actions in life, and given eternal prosperity in a golden land of milk and honey. Similarly, I could judge people by their actions, both good and bad. And wham, you\u2019ve got a priest. I can tell people that it is good to be good, and it is bad to be bad; Because if you do bad in life, you will go to a dark land of fire and brimstone. People will look to me for guidance\u2026. they will build me a building where I could tell them how to behave. Bam, you\u2019ve got a church. Hmm\u2026. I\u2019m running out of money\u2026.. I\u2019ve got an idea. I could tell these peasants that they will go to Heaven if they give me money, a lot of it. Ahh\u2026. Now I\u2019m rich. Oh, that town over there is calling me a fraud? That\u2019s no good\u2026. Quickly my followers, burn their town to the ground, kill everyone, leave no survivors!!! Oh, you ask why? Well\u2026. Because you will get into Heaven! Bam, you\u2019ve got a crusade. That\u2019s a general way of me seeing it. Do good in life to feel good. Do bad in life if that\u2019s what you want. But if you go around killing people, then that\u2019s not good. Why? Because you make other people feel bad. Bad is not good. But if you want to be bad, it is because of free will that you can do whatever you want. Is free will bad? Yes and no. Because of free will, I don\u2019t have to do what people say, I could save my own skin when the kitchen heats up. Of course, with the power of free will, I can save those stuck in the kitchen. wow, this turned out longer than expected. Uh\u2026. Good day. Be good to your neighbor and such. Love people more than yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Our sense of justice demands that there must be punishment for the criminals -those who offended, abused, raped and murdered people. Human beings have a sense of right and wrong and good and evil. And so, we have a justice system in all government system we have - we put into trial all those who are accused of doing crimes and punish those who are guilty. Our desire for justice in this life is there because we are moral beings and we crave for justice. But our earthly justice and penal systems are not perfect. Not all criminal investigation results in a conviction. People literally get away with murder, rape and abuse. Is that right? If there is no heaven or hell, then criminals truly got away with what they have done. Some rich people are able to bribe their way out of prison. They do not have to pay for anything. Sometimes the justice system itself is corrupt or flawed. Is that right? Is that okay? Is that acceptable to our sensibilities? A shocking number of US murders went unsolved last year There\u2019s a nearly 40 per cent chance you\u2019ll get away with murder in America What about those who were oppressed, abused, raped, and murdered? If there is no heaven and hell, then they will never get justice. They were victims of crimes forever, and the guilty would never ever get punished. They were just very unlucky victims who would never be heard and be given justice. Is that right? Is that okay? Is that acceptable to our sensibilities? Our innate sense of justice demands heaven and hell. Below is a video of a man named Ninoy Aquino - he was a Filipino politician who was unjustly imprisoned for many years [some in solitary confinement]. While in prison, he pondered about life, meaning, purpose, and if there is a God or not. At the end of the day, he surmised that there must be a God, a heaven and a hell - otherwise, his life and his suffering are totally meaningless and the perpetrators of the crimes committed to him get away without punishment. His long-suffering led him to the conclusion that there would be an eternal justice one day and he would get his justice in the next life if not here on earth. [He did not get justice on earth - he was murdered.]  Human beings crave for justice. Injustice on earth demands justice in the afterlife. Otherwise, life is meaningless and absurd. ",

            "answer_text": "Heaven and hell are not geographical locations. They are just states of pleasantness and unpleasantness in which a being remains in, after he leaves his gross physical body. This completely depends upon how the person had lived his life when he was alive, his karmic structure, level of awareness and consciousness, habits, characteristics, personality and longings. If a person leaves his body with certain level of awareness and fulfillment, it can put him in a certain state of pleasantness which is called as heaven. A disembodied being does not have a discerning/discriminatory mind or buddhi also called as intellect, to change the state he is in once he is disembodied, due to which the being operates out of his tendencies, what we call as vasanas in the yogic science. If the being has pleasant tendencies, it will enjoy such pleasant states for a period of time, depending upon the karmic substance left and the vibrancy of the pranic substance, until it is ready for the re-birth. If the person has left his body with low level of awareness, unfulfilled desires, anger, resentment, guilt, insecurity and fear, such qualities, may put that being into a state of unpleasantness. The level of unpleasantness or pleasantness will completely depend upon the karmic structure they are carrying and their tendencies. Whatever is the quality of the being, it will just multiply and manifold due to lack of discerning mind which is not present for a person who had led a very mundane and gross life lacking spiritual dimensions. It is also conceptualized that depending upon their karmic structures and longings, the being may become devas, yakshas, or gandharvas which are well known and much talked about celestial characters from the puranas, this may happen for a brief period until the pranic substance has reached a certain level of vibrancy which is conducive enough to enter a womb for its rebirth. These celestial characters are nothing but various states of pleasantness and unpleasantness a person will be in. Having a state of high level of pleasantness may shower a being with all comforts and pleasures of swargalok which is the home for devas. These concepts such as hell and heaven are just symbolic in nature and can only be understood methaphorically. ",

            "answer_text": "Islamic perspective If the person you are having a discussion with is an atheist then the question cannot start with showing proof of the unseen but the starting point of discussion should be whether or not there is indeed a creator who created everything there is in existence. Paradise and Hell fire are things of the unseen and in the perfect wisdom of Allah he decided to keep them unseen as a test for mankind. He has bestowed upon mankind intelligence and the power of reasoning and a free will which he has not given to any other of his creation (except the jinns). The precise test that he has laid upon mankind is: who amongst his creation uses the bestowed intelligence and power of reasoning by pondering over his innumerable signs and of his own free will decides to believe and submit his will to the will of his creator. If Allah had laid open paradise and hell fire for all to see the test would become invalid for everyone who witnessed these two promised phenomena of Allah with their own eyes would immediately believe and the test would not have any meaning. Or another meaningful discussion with the atheist would be to discuss if there is indeed a logical need for the hereafter! A good righteous person may live a good and pious life and build many orphanages, schools and hospitals and serve the poor and needy all his life. What reward can man possibly give such a righteous person? and what about all the people who benefited after his death from the good works he laid the foundation for in his life time? Does he get absolutely no reward for those? Logic dictates that there must be a day when the whole world should come to an end and a day of accounting be held where the righteous get the reward for their good deeds otherwise it would not be a just system. Conversely what about an evil person who kills thousands of innocent people? What possible retribution can man take from this evil person? The maximum a court can do is decree to put him to death. The punishment for killing one person is death and the killing for a thousand people is still only death in our limited world. Logic dictates that there must come a day when the whole world should come to an end and a day of accounting be held where full retribution is taken from the evil person. If one leaves aside his set beliefs and prejudices, his own logic and reasoning will force him to accept that there has to be a day of judgement where the righteous are rewarded for the good they did and the evil is punished for the evil he committed. Thus the questions which need to be addressed to the atheist are if there is indeed a creator for everything in existence? If yes who is this creator and what are his rights on his creation? If not then how did everything come into existence?Is there anything more than the life of this world? Is there a need for a day of accounting? Is there a need for a life hereafter?Who will be the judge of the day of accounting? The one who created or does someone else have this right?If a believer can get that far with an atheist then the rest of the questions can be easily addressed. Then comes the question of his guidance, his prophets, his books, his promised life of the hereafter etc. To believe in the unseen is one of the conditions of faith or \u2018imaan\u2019 and in Allah\u2019s perfect wisdom and knowledge he decided to keep the rewards of paradise and the punishment of the hell fire in the unseen. One has to believe in the existence of the creator before he can believe in paradise and hell fire. Thus it would be best to first discuss with the atheist about the existence of the creator and then graduate towards the guidance and promises of that omnipotent and perfect creator. I can provide several aayahs of the Quran regarding the existence of paradise and hell fire but what possible good would it do to the one who does not even believe in the existence of the creator? If we need to prove anything we either need to witness it ourselves or we may accept someone else\u2019s witness to it and for everything of the unseen we as believers can accept only what the creator and his messengers have made known to us.

            "answer_text": "You will get this answer by my small story of Sufi mystic Hazrat Inayat Khan. A disciple had been training under his master for years but was still devoid of any divine experience or clear understanding about anything. One day he requested his master, \u201cMaster, please grant me a vision of heaven. It\u2019s been so long now that I\u2019ve been serving you.\u201d \u201cMy child,\u201d the master said, \u201cgo and sit in the next room. Close your eyes and sit still. You\u2019ll see heaven.\u201d \u201cReally? Just like that.\u201d \u201cGo.\u201d The disciple went into the next room and meditated. Surely enough he had a vision but it was far from what he expected. All he saw was a vast ground and nothing else. There weren\u2019t any beautiful palaces or rivers of honey. Just as there were no oceans of milk or bricks of ruby. The roofs were not diamond studded. Heck, there was nothing other than endless barren land. As disappointed as intrigued, he went back to his master. \u201cO, my master,\u201d he pleaded hiding his disappointment. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve seen heaven, I should certainly like to see hell.\u201d \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d The master stroked his white flowing beard. \u201cVery well then, go and sit in meditation again. You\u2019ll have a vision of hell.\u201d The disciple did as instructed and once again, he saw nothing but the same vacant land. There were no fire-spitting snakes, no devil or ferocious animals no one flaying anyone, no pots of boiling oil. Wherever he looked, there was just empty land from where he stood to all the way to the horizon, in all directions. \u201cWhat the hell,\u201d he thought. \u201cThis certainly couldn\u2019t be it.\u201d \u201cMaster,\u201d he spoke with conviction. \u201cThis was anything but a vision. I saw no heaven or hell.\u201d \u201cYou mean you were expecting glorious structures, magnificent scenery and unearthly beauty in heaven?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOr, snakes, fire, devil or untold tortures in hell?\u201d \u201cExactly.\u201d \u201cMy son,\u201d the master said. \u201cThere is nothing there. You will have to take everything from here. This is the place to gather everything, either the delights of heaven or the fires of hell.\u201d So Above everything else heaven and hell are two aspects of our attitude towards life. These are two warehouses of our emotions and karma.When we are content and grateful we are in heaven. When we are angry, perturbed, or jealous we are in hell. Both are phases stages and cyclical states of our mind. Every selfless act, every gesture of gratitude, every soft word, every kind thought, they make up who we are. They create our world. Heaven or hell it\u2019s not just within us, it is us. Be kind. Count your blessings.  Amen ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: Is it true that heaven and hell really exist? No, they don\u2019t. They\u2019re nothing more than inventions of our ancestors. Both concepts were invented as part of organised religion\u2019s mechanism for obtaining and keeping followers, and controlling their thoughts and behaviour at a time when religion was inextricably linked to government and their laws. The invented concept of a heaven, and the idea that people who were faithful to, and followed, the laws and rules of the religion concerned, would go to it after their death (where they would also meet their deceased relatives and friends) and the opposite concept of a hell, where people who didn\u2019t obey the laws and rules of the religion concerned, would go to it after their death (where they would burn in a fiery torment forever) had a very powerful psychological effect on largely naive, gullible and superstitious people. This mechanism of reward and threat is still used by organised religion to this day, although with the exception of many narrow-minded and prescriptive Islamic states, the link between religion and government, and the law, has long been broken. It still remains a powerful combination, especially when it\u2019s applied to children who are too young to think for themselves, and are indoctrinated with such false ideas as being fact. These children grow up into adults who remain faithful to the same irrational and completely baseless concepts, and the cycle goes on and on\u2026 But both concepts are utterly untrue, impossible in reality, guaranteed as being man-made, and completely anachronistic in the 21st century!

The rich man also died and was buried. In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. So he called to him, \u2018Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.\u2019\u201d Luke 16:22-24 \u201c\u2026Abraham said, \u2018Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.\u201d Luk 16:25 Heaven, on the other hand, is where I want to go. \"But as it is written: 'Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.'\u201d 1Cor 2:9 NKJB \"Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him. They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever\" Revelation 22:1-5 ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, heaven or hell is not a specific place. When the body is dead, and you are out of the body, how is it possible to burn or fry you in oil or stuff like that? Obviously you don\u2019t have a body anymore and the soul is beyond matter/space/time to get affected by fire or burning oil. You might mentally suffer for the memories and impressions you have built up. Suffering would be so intense that you can compare it to being fried in oil or crazy things of that sort. But know that heaven or hell is not something which can be located in space. And now, lets see what heaven can offer to a being who has left the material body. Some say that heaven has beautiful girls(virgins particularly) and the best wine and stuff. Let's think about this for 2 seconds. What can someone do with virgin girls and wine when there is no body?! Once the orgasm is reached, which bloody guy can still be interested in sex at least for the next couple of hours? And here we are talking about a situation where there is no body at all, leave alone the energy in genitals. God knows what women are going to get instead. I guess it would be a living hell to be in the presence of beautiful virgin girls(as they say) and be absolutely impotent(sexually). As per Hindu scriptures, it is mentioned that lord Yama comes with Chitragupta and probably few workmen to suck the life out of a person and take him to hell. A very few people will go to heaven or Indra\u2019s paradise (or whatever). It might sound ridiculously crazy to any intellectual person. This is indeed not a story but a concept which is explained in the form of a symbolism. Yama in Sanskrit means \u201ccontrol\u201d. That\u2019s why \u201cPranayama\u201d means control of Prana through breath. Chitragupta in Sanskrit means \u201csecret picture\u201d (chitra = picture; gupta = secret). What actually Happens is: When the soul/life force is leaving the body, all the subconscious memories start floating on the surface of mind. Your conscious memory may not remember everything you have gone through in this life. But believe me when I tell that your subconscious mind has been storing every single event and experience you have had so far. Those memories and impressions have just gone dormant. When the situation is ripe, even when you are alive, they rarely rise up like bubbles in the ocean of consciousness and you reacts to those memories. During death, all such memories rise up. All the wrong activities done out of ignorance and selfishness will rise up because the ego has tremendously loosen up. That secret picture lies in each one of us. We can lie to the whole world and we can even lie to ourselves by convincing that we have not done anything wrong. It is because of ego that we keep reasoning our wrong doings. But deep inside (subconscious level), only we know what bad things we have done. *Chitragupta has already noted them down**There can be nobody better than Yama when it comes to Judgement* We usually do bad due to lack of self control. The ones who have self control, will go to heaven, which means, they will remain at peace with themselves because they have nothing to regret. ",

            "answer_text": "Hell and Heaven Exist! NO DOUBT! We have abundance of personal expenses in India dor that. How can one say that heaven and hell are mere psychological concepts? They simply say that, without a thourough examination, as they are not aware of the truth! Those who oppose will realise it oncw they are dead and still continue to exist but can't come back and say sorry for the misunderstanding! Those who understand the reality know that both heaven and hell exist for a purpose.If you don't know the purpose of their existence, you may merely reject it.If you look at inanimate things, they exist but cannot think; right? If, according to modern science, a mere combination of lifeless things created a life which can think, feel, desire, etc., I would call it INCORRECT reasoning. There exists something that is beyond the material inanimate world. There is consciousness, which is in the form of life in each of the living beings. The conscious soul also exists in our experience and it is the soul that is the living thing! That is why each human can think, feel, desire, etc. Atheists or scientific people believe that such souls cant exist without proof without even giving it benefit of doubt. If one doesnot realise this, one may end up like those atheists, who say at the fag end of their life, feeling afraid what would happen to them at the time of death, \"O GOD, if there is a GOD, please SAVE MY SOUL, if there is a soul. \"In a country like India, which is renowned as Dharma bumi (righteous land) or Yoga bhumi (land of yoga) , or Moksha bhumi (land of Liberation), one can undergo a lot of spiritual and magical experiences that prove the existence of supernatural forces and consciousness. So, Life is a journey to learn, to evolve mentally, intellectually, and spritually to be ready for the highest reward of LIBERATION. One may next ask what is the purpose behind their existence. On the path to liberation, HEAVEN and HELL are small stops to encourage good deeds and to discourage the bad deeds respectively. Once the rewards or punishments to our different deeds are handed out and exhausted, we return to the training ground for further learning. This cycle continues till one becomes perfect and liberated. Even if you have to create a simple chair, you need intelligence and understanding as to for whom are you creating the chair, what is their height, weight and anatomy of humans so as to build a chair of proper material height, etc., to help people use it well to sit and relax.But how can one imagine that a most complex biological machinery like human body, has been created by dead nature which possesses NO INTELLIGENCE or CANNOT THINK or PLAN?! Only an extremely high level of intelligence can create a complex biological being like humans or animals. And there is definite puropse for which this world is created. There are a lot of rebirth examples in this world which prove that life after death exists.There are many people on this earth who have undergone some near death experiences, who can vouch for the existence of hell or heaven. I myself have some personal experiences to prove their existence. The exact details of HELL and HEAVEN and there whereabouts are the most closely guarded secrets in the world. In my experiences, the existence of hell and heaven is real! But but How do you believe/decide anything? Most people are aware that everything that exists must have a purpose, so according to theists and those deeply knowledgeable in Indian scriptures, there is a purpose for hell and heaven. Again there needs to be a God to manage the hell and heaven and people start rejecting the existence of God for weird reasons, so the idea of hell and heaven too get rejected. Basically, religions are built on the experiences and knowledge gifted by the great souls who touched the divine and gained from it. The religions are further strengthened by the experiences of other followers who enriched the religions. So each religion is followed by millions of believers who trust in the words of their great Prophets and the followers don't need any external proof to believe the existence of God or hell or heaven. The other worlds inspire people to act in positive manner as good deeds are rewarded and doers of bad deeds need to be punished. As per Indian religious scriptures, no knowledge can be gained by anyone without being permitted by God. So no one can know or believe him unless God himself allows it. Even Duryodhana in Mahabharata epic witnessed the Vishwaroopa (all pervading form of God) of Lord God Krishna, but contrary to the pleasure and belief of Bhishma (who too saw God's form and rejoiced), thought that whatever he saw was an elaborate hoax/illusion as he had convinced himself priorly that there cannot be a God. So Duryodhana believed that there cannot be a God but Bhishma believed that God existed. So both theists and atheists are believers, one that God exists and the other that he doesn't. Then natural questions arise as to where are those worlds are and whether anyone has visited those worlds and returned to tell about them. Only Shri Vadiraja Swamiji, a Vaishnava saint from Karnataka in India, has revealed in his works the whereabouts (yet to be decoded) of the other worlds. A yogi who is capable of leaving his/her mortal body by Yogic power and return later can have such experiences of traveling to the other worlds. I have positively heard of such experiences from many in India. Many near death experiences also show that other worlds (hidden or invisible worlds) which are beyond the reach of present science and technology do really exist. But whether they exist or not, nobody is supposed to be good just out of the temptation of heaven and out of the fear of hell. One needs to truly turn good to be liberated and not out of temptation or fear. Despite the ongoing debate on the existence of hell/heaven, all religions speak of goodness and advise us to \u201cdo unto others want we want others to do unto us\u201d. Following this one dictat of all religions will suffice to convert this mortal world into a heaven. It is interesting to note that all major religions that accept the concept of God also accept the existence of hell and heaven. Hindus say there are seven heavens and seven hells (swarga and naraka). Christians speak of seven heavens and so do Muslims (Jahannum and Jannat). All these religions accept existence of Angels and demons.

            "answer_text": "Ah, the two words that almost in every languages separated the good and evil and the eternal resting place that we should care about but didnt in real life. Personally, heaven and hell was two places I have been through with the same woman-my ex. it was heaven when I was making love to her in the spa in y backyard when the snow was falling. And then there was hell for six months after we broke up. I\u2019m sure it was not an hallucination like Hotel California as the Eagles were singing in in 1977. On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hairWarm smell of colitas, rising up through the airUp ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering lightMy head grew heavy and my sight grew dimI had to stop for the nightThere she stood in the doorway;I heard the mission bellAnd I was thinking to myself,\"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell\"Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the wayThere were voices down the corridor,I thought I heard them say... Welcome to the Hotel CaliforniaSuch a lovely place (Such a lovely place)Such a lovely facePlenty of room at the Hotel CaliforniaAny time of year (Any time of year)You can find it here Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes BenzShe got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends\u2026\u2026.. You see, heaven and hell are all over the places. They are in songs, literature, paintings, legends, folklore, tall tales, even buildings and theme parks. Almost all religions have them as the after life one can expect to enter. While Christianities looking forward to meet with Paul at the Pearl Gates, Asian parents who embraced the mythology of heaven and hell often used that to encourage goodness and keep their children refrain from doing bad things. Happiness eternally in heaven is THE message of most of these religious preaching while hell is supposedly the ultimate punishment. The Chinese even have 18 levels of hell for me and my friends. So believe what you want and if it can turn people into doing good, I\u2019m all for it. However, I find it odd that what can people do in heaven with seven virgins after they have blown themselves up to pieces? Would their penis still able to function when stitched back? Then again, why do I want to float around in cloud when everything is white and no color? Where is the entertainment when every one was looking down on earth to find entertainment? The movie \u201cDogmas\u201d in 1999 starring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon was considered as blasphemy by the Vatican. The two fallen angels looking for loopholes to get back to heaven was hilarious to me but upset Catholics to no end. To me, heaven and hell are just metaphors to describe either suffering or happiness after death. I think people should care more about what it means when we are alive and breathing. Why can\u2019t people just make this world a heavenly place instead of making war and contamination that made earth hell? Lets start with ending all these wars between religions. Let the Gods fight their own wars. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, both heaven and hell are states of consciousness that are always present within us. When we are consumed with negative emotions like anger, fear, greed, lust or guilt, we are already in hell. In the same way, when we experience love, beauty and truth, we're in heaven. After death, hell is a level of experience on the astral plane, created by unresolved negative psychic impressions. These impressions produce vivid and painful experiences, being the reflection of strong obsessions or guilt from past actions. Ultimately, these are self-limiting experiences. But in some cases, they may seem to go on for a long time. After death, the sense of separateness dissolves and we experience the interconnectedness of all life. Naturally, the memory of any pain we've caused others is felt sharply, with deep regret. So, the only punishment of \"hell\" is the acute awareness of the pain we have caused and the regret that we didn't choose differently. No matter how heavy these impressions are, in time they get resolved and the awareness is purified and allowed to continue to the higher planes. No one is damned or condemned. There is no one alive who has not committed wrong action. Life is not about being perfect. But when we see that we've made a mistake, it's important to apologize to the ones we've hurt and try to make amends in whatever way we can. This is not esoteric teaching. It's something any child understands. ",

            "answer_text": "How about asking the bible, God\u2019s word and - according to Jesus - The Truth? There is no concept of a hell in the bible. Why? Because God never had a concept of something like a hell. In Jeremiah 7:31 God speaks about the practice of burning living people in fire and describes it as \u201csomething that I had not commanded and that had never even come into my heart\u201d. In Arabic and Turkish they use the word \u201cCehennem\u201d for hell. Its origin is in the \u201cValley of the Son of Hin\u02b9nom\u201d, look it up in Jeremiah 7:31. The Valley of Hin\u2019nom/Hennem later became a place for burning waste. They also disposed the bodies of dead criminals there. So the Valley of Hinnom - Cehennem - became a symbol of total destruction without any return. Or Guaranteed Non-Existence. Non-existence by the contrary is a concept of Jehovah as he said in Genesis 3:19 \u201cFor dust you are and to dust you will return\u201d. Or in Psalm 37:10 \u201cthe wicked will be no more\u201d. According to Heaven: God\u2019s word describes it in a language, we humans can understand. And since we think spatial, it is described like a location. So e.g. in Job 1:6 it says, that \u201cthe sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and Satan also entered among them\u201d. Later on \u201cSatan \u2026 was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him\u201d (Revelation 12:9, italics by me). So this is described in a spatial, 3-dimensional way. Even Gabriel, the Angel who was sent to Daniel and Mary, describes his position in a spatial way: \u201cI am Ga\u02b9bri\u00b7el, who stands near before God\u201d (Luke 1:19). Anyway, everything in God\u2019s word is written for humans, and therefore it is written in a 3-dimensional language we humans can understand. Heaven is a spirit realm. Therefore, Satan was not hurled down in a spatial way, but he became restricted to a spatial room or simply 3-dimensionality like humans. There is a fine description of the matter: What Is Heaven? ",

            "answer_text": "Sure - you can prove that one or none of them exist by dying. The trouble is telling anyone else about the results of the experiment. There are lots of afterlife claims - even the ones that involve a heaven or hell or both can vary quite a bit. The Muslim heaven is different from the Christian one and that is different from the Norse heaven and so on. This makes it impossible, without dying, to absolutely prove or disprove all of them in one go or decide which one or collection may or may not be true. All we can do is examine the particular claims for consistency - do they make sense - and look for any sign of evidence that continuation after death is even indicated - that it may be possible at all. There are some indicators - for instance, those religions which hold that there is some supreme being who cares about us and wants us to know him and has reputedly made revelations to individuals through history have an extra mode of proof. Their God would certainly know what it would take to prove the existence of heaven to everyone and would have the power to provide that proof \u2026 so we are left to wonder why this has not happened. Either that God does not exist (ie maybe believers are wrong about the character of their god) or that God does not want us to be able to prove heaven and hell. Aside: the hell law states that hell is a place of torment reserved for those who believe in it, and the worst part of hell is reserved for those who believe in it because they are frightened that they will go there is they don\u2019t. \u2014 Principia Discordia ",

            "answer_text": "I think both terms are poorly used language denominators for complex concepts. IN the research I\u2019ve done, filming 45 people under deep hypnosis, they all refer to the \u201clife between lives\u201d arena as \u201chome.\u201d As in \u201cWhere would you like to go now?\u201d they answer \u201cI want to go home.\u201d They don\u2019t mean here. The concepts of hell that I\u2019ve filmed or seen or read about, all appear to be constructs that were believed prior to the near death event - and when people remember having that event while under deep hypnosis, when asked \u201cso why did you choose to come to this place?\u201d it dissolves in their minds eye. It\u2019s what they \u201cexpected to find\u201d upon their demise. What I\u2019ve found consistently in this afterlife research is that people during a near death experience describe this place of \u201cunconditional love\u201d often as \u201cheaven\u201d - or some place \u201cbeyond the light.\u201d But in the cases where a person is guided to this event via deep hypnosis, since they\u2019re aware of where they are going and why - they describe it as home. If we could define home as a specific place, that would be great - but even that word means something different to everyone on the planet. Other than the idea of what home \u201crepresents\u201d - safety, comraderie, love, unconditional love, etc. So I prefer to use more specific language in this research. By \u201chell\u201d if you mean a static place that everyone goes, I\u2019ve never come across it in the thousands of cases I\u2019ve examined, and the 45 I\u2019ve filmed. If you mean \u201ca place of fear and doubt, perhaps associated with human fears\u201d I\u2019ve seen that on rare occasions (\u201csmell of sulphur\u201d \u201ca frightening place\u201d) but in every case, when the person was asked \u201cwhy\u201d we had come to see this event, they realized it was a choice to see it. \u201cIt was what I expected to find after this lifetime. I see now that it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d And if by heaven you refer to \u201cthat place that people claim we exist between lives in some form of bliss\u201d I can report that I\u2019ve come across these accounts many times, again no two are identical. No two describe the same buildings, the same people, the same guides, the same libraries, etc. But they all describe people, building, libraries and guides\u2026 just relative to their own journey and experience. Not a belief. I\u2019m just reporting verbatim what people have said about the journey. Not a theory or philosophy either. Just eyewitness accounts. ",

            "answer_text": "How We Can Know There Is a God ?[ONE way to determine whether there is a God is to apply this well-established principle: What is made requires a maker. The more complicated the thing made, the more capable the maker must be. For example, look around your home. Tables, chairs, desks, beds, pots, pans, plates, and other eating utensils all require a maker, as do walls, floors, and ceilings. Yet, those things are comparatively simple to make. Since simple things require a maker, is it not logical that complex things require an even more intelligent maker? Our Awesome Universe A watch requires a watchmaker. What of our infinitely more complex solar system, with the Sun and its planets revolving around it with split-second precision century after century? What of the awesome galaxy we live in, called the Milky Way, with its more than 100 billion stars? Have you ever stopped at night to gaze at the Milky Way? Were you impressed? Then think of the incredibly vast universe that contains untold billions of galaxies like our Milky Way! Too, the heavenly bodies are so reliable in their movements century after century that they have been compared to precision timepieces. If a watch, which is relatively simple, implies the existence of a watchmaker, surely the infinitely more complex and awesome universe implies the existence of a designer and maker. That is why the Bible invites us to \u2018raise our eyes high up and see,\u2019 and then it asks: \u201cWho has created these things?\u201d The answer: \u201cIt is the One [God] who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he calls even by name. Due to the abundance of dynamic energy, he also being vigorous in power, not one of them is missing.\u201d (Isaiah 40:26) Thus, the universe owes its existence to an invisible, controlling, intelligent power\u2014God. Earth Uniquely Designed The more scientists study the earth, the more they realize that it is uniquely designed for human habitation. It is just the right distance from the sun to get the proper amount of light and heat. Once a year it moves around the sun, with just the right angle of tilt, making seasons possible in many parts of the earth. The earth also rotates on its own axis every 24 hours, providing regular periods of light and darkness. It has an atmosphere with just the right mixture of gases so we can breathe and be protected from damaging radiation from space. It also has the vital water and soil needed to grow food. Without all those factors, and others, working together, life would be impossible. Was all of that an accident? Science News says: \u201cIt seems as if such particular and precise conditions could hardly have arisen at random.\u201d No, they could not. They involved purposeful design by a superb Designer. If you went into a fine house and found that it was generously stocked with food, that it had an excellent heating and air-conditioning system, and that it had good plumbing to supply water, what would you conclude? That it all just came about by itself? No, you would surely conclude that an intelligent person designed and made it with great care. The earth was also designed and made with great care in order to provide what its inhabitants need, and it is much more complex and well-supplied than any house. Also, consider the great number of things that add delight to living. Look at the vast variety of beautifully colored flowers with their pleasant scents that humans enjoy. Then there is the great variety of foods so delicious to our taste. There are forests, mountains, lakes, and other creations pleasant to look at. Too, what of beautiful sunsets that enhance our enjoyment of life? And in the animal realm, are we not delighted by the playful antics and lovable nature of puppies, kittens, and other animal young? So the earth provides many delightful surprises not absolutely needed to sustain life. These show that the earth was designed with loving care, with humans in mind, so that we would not just exist but would enjoy life. Therefore, the reasonable conclusion is to acknowledge the Giver of all these things, as did the Bible writer who said of Jehovah God: \u201cYou yourself have made the heavens and the earth.\u201d For what purpose? He gives the answer by describing God as \u201cthe Former of the earth and the Maker of it, He the One who firmly established it, who did not create it simply for nothing, who formed it even to be inhabited.\u201d\u2014Isaiah 37:16;45:18. The Amazing Living Cell What of living things? Do they not require a maker? For example, consider a few of the amazing features of a living cell. In his book Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, molecular biologist Michael Denton states: \u201cEven the simplest of all living systems on earth today, bacterial cells, are exceedingly complex objects. Although the tiniest bacterial cells are incredibly small, . . . each is in effect a veritable microminiaturized factory containing thousands of exquisitely designed pieces of intricate molecular machinery . . . far more complicated than any machine built by man and absolutely without parallel in the non-living world.\u201d Regarding the genetic code in each cell, he states: \u201cThe capacity of DNA to store information vastly exceeds that of any other known system; it is so efficient that all the information needed to specify an organism as complex as man weighs less than a few thousand millionths of a gram. . . . Alongside the level of ingenuity and complexity exhibited by the molecular machinery of life, even our most advanced [products] appear clumsy. We feel humbled.\u201d Denton adds: \u201cThe complexity of the simplest known type of cell is so great that it is impossible to accept that such an object could have been thrown together suddenly by some kind of freakish, vastly improbable, event.\u201d It had to have a designer and maker. Our Incredible Brain This scientist then says: \u201cIn terms of complexity, an individual cell is nothing when compared with a system like the mammalian brain. The human brain consists of about ten thousand million nerve cells. Each nerve cell puts out somewhere in the region of between ten thousand and one hundred thousand connecting fibres by which it makes contact with other nerve cells in the brain. Altogether the total number of connections in the human brain approaches . . . a thousand million million.\u201d Denton continues: \u201cEven if only one hundredth of the connections in the brain were specifically organized, this would still represent a system containing a much greater number of specific connections than in the entire communications network on Earth.\u201d He then asks: \u201cCould any sort of purely random process ever have assembled such systems?\u201d Obviously, the answer has to be no. The brain must have had a caring Designer and Maker. The human brain makes even the most advanced computers look primitive. Science writer Morton Hunt said: \u201cOur active memories hold several billion times more information than a large contemporary research computer.\u201d Thus, brain surgeon Dr. Robert J. White concluded: \u201cI am left with no choice but to acknowledge the existence of a Superior Intellect, responsible for the design and development of the incredible brain-mind relationship\u2014something far beyond man\u2019s capacity to understand. . . . I have to believe all this had an intelligent beginning, that Someone made it happen.\u201d It also had to be Someone who cared. The Unique Blood System Consider, too, the unique blood system that transports nutrients and oxygen and protects against infection. Regarding the red blood cells, a main component of this system, the book ABC\u2019s of the Human Body states: \u201cA single drop of blood contains more than 250 million separate blood cells . . . The body contains perhaps 25 trillion of them, enough, if spread out, to cover four tennis courts. . . . Replacements are made, at a rate of 3 million new cells every second.\u201d Regarding white blood cells, another part of the unique blood system, this same source tells us: \u201cWhile there is only one kind of red cell, white blood cells come in many varieties, each type capable of fighting the body\u2019s battles in a different way. One kind, for instance, destroys dead cells. Other kinds produce antibodies against viruses, detoxify foreign substances, or literally eat up and digest bacteria.\u201d What an amazing and highly organized system! Surely anything that is so well put together and so thoroughly protective must have a very intelligent and caring organizer\u2014God. Other Marvels There are many other marvels in the human body. One is the eye, so superbly designed that no camera can duplicate it. Astronomer Robert Jastrow said: \u201cThe eye appears to have been designed; no designer of telescopes could have done better.\u201d And the publication Popular Photography relates: \u201cHuman eyes see a far greater range of detail than film does. They see in three dimensions, at a tremendously wide angle, without distortion, in continuous motion . . . Comparing the camera to the human eye isn\u2019t a fair analogy. The human eye is more like an incredibly advanced supercomputer with artificial intelligence, information-processing abilities, speeds, and modes of operation that are far beyond any man-made device, computer or camera.\u201d Think, too, of the way that all the intricate body organs cooperate without our conscious effort. For example, we put many different types of food and drink into our stomachs, yet the body processes them and produces energy. Try putting such a variety of things into the gas tank of an automobile and see how far it goes! Then there is the miracle of birth, the producing of an adorable baby\u2014a copy of its parents\u2014in just nine months. And what about the ability of a child just a few years old to learn how to talk in a complex language? Yes, the many amazing, intricate creations in the human body fill us with awe. No engineer could duplicate those things. Could they be merely the workings of blind chance? Surely not. Instead, when considering all the wonderful aspects of the human body, reasonable persons say, as did the psalmist: \u201cI shall laud you [God] because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful.\u201d\u2014Psalm 139:14. The Supreme Builder The Bible states: \u201cEvery house is built by someone, of course; but God built everything that exists.\u201d (Hebrews 3:4, The Jerusalem Bible) Since any house, however simple, must have a builder, then the far more complex universe, along with the vast varieties of life on earth, must also have had a builder. And since we acknowledge the existence of humans who invented devices such as airplanes, televisions, and computers, should we not also acknowledge the existence of the One who gave humans the brain to make such things? The Bible does, calling him \u201cthe true God, Jehovah, . . . the Creator of the heavens and the Grand One stretching them out; the One laying out the earth and its produce, the One giving breath to the people on it.\u201d (Isaiah 42:5) The Bible rightly declares: \u201cYou are worthy, Jehovah, even our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they existed and were created.\u201d\u2014Revelation 4:11. Yes, we can know that there is a God by the things he has made. \u201cFor [God\u2019s] invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world\u2019s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things [God] made.\u201d\u2014Romans 1:20. The fact that something made is misused does not mean it had no maker. An airplane can be used for peaceful purposes, as an airliner. But it can also be used for destruction, as a bomber. Its being used in a death-dealing way does not mean it had no maker. Similarly, the fact that humans have so often turned out bad does not mean they did not have a Maker, that there is no God. Hence, the Bible correctly observes: \u201cThe perversity of you men! Should the potter himself be accounted just like the clay? For should the thing made say respecting its maker: \u2018He did not make me\u2019? And does the very thing formed actually say respecting its former: \u2018He showed no understanding\u2019?\u201d\u2014Isaiah 29:16. The Creator has shown his wisdom through the amazing complexity of what he has made. NOW ABOUT HELL 2. There is no Hell. What Really Is Hell? WHATEVER image the word \u201chell\u201d brings to your mind, hell is generally thought of as a place of punishment for sin. Concerning sin and its effect, the Bible says: \u201cThrough one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.\u201d (Romans 5:12) The Scriptures also state: \u201cThe wages sin pays is death.\u201d (Romans 6:23) Since the punishment for sin is death, the fundamental question in determining the true nature of hell is: What happens to us when we die? Does life of some kind, in some form, continue after death? What is hell, and what kind of people go there? Is there any hope for those in hell? The Bible gives truthful and satisfying answers to these questions. Life After Death? Does something inside us, like a soul or a spirit, survive the death of the body? Consider how the first man, Adam, came to have life. The Bible states: \u201cJehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life.\u201d (Genesis 2:7) Though breathing sustained his life, putting \u201cthe breath of life\u201d into his nostrils involved much more than simply blowing air into his lungs. It meant that God put into Adam\u2019s lifeless body the spark of life \u2014\u201cthe force of life,\u201d which is active in all earthly creatures. (Genesis 6:17; 7:22) The Bible refers to this animating force as \u201cspirit.\u201d (James 2:26) That spirit can be compared to the electric current that activates a machine or an appliance and enables it to perform its function. Just as the current never takes on the features of the equipment it activates, the life-force does not take on any of the characteristics of the creatures it animates. It has no personality and no thinking ability. What happens to the spirit when a person dies?Psalm 146:4 says: \u201cHis spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts do perish.\u201d When a person dies, his impersonal spirit does not go on existing in another realm as a spirit creature. It \u201creturns to the true God who gave it.\u201d (Ecclesiastes 12:7) This means that any hope of future life for that person now rests entirely with God. The ancient Greek philosophers Socrates and Plato held that a soul inside a person survives death and never dies. What does the Bible teach about the soul? Adam \u201ccame to be a living soul,\u201d says Genesis 2:7. He did not receive a soul; he was a soul \u2014a whole person. The Scriptures speak of a soul\u2019s doing work, craving food, being kidnapped, experiencing sleeplessness, and so forth. (Leviticus 23:30;Deuteronomy 12:20; 24:7; Psalm 119:28) Yes, man himself is a soul. When a person dies, that soul dies. \u2014Ezekiel 18:4. What, then, is the condition of the dead? When pronouncing sentence upon Adam, Jehovah stated: \u201cDust you are and to dust you will return.\u201d (Genesis 3:19) Where was Adam before God formed him from the dust of the ground and gave him life? Why, he simply did not exist! When he died, Adam returned to that state of complete absence of life. The condition of the dead is made clear at Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10, where we read: \u201cThe dead know nothing . . . In the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.\u201d (New International Version) Scripturally, death is a state of nonexistence. The dead have no awareness, no feelings, no thoughts. Unending Torment or Common Grave? Since the dead have no conscious existence, hell cannot be a fiery place of torment where the wicked suffer after death. What, then, is hell? Examining what happened to Jesus after he died helps to answer that question. The Bible writer Luke recounts: \u201cNeither was [Jesus] forsaken in Hades [hell, King James Version] nor did his flesh see corruption.\u201d*(Acts 2:31) Where was the hell to which even Jesus went? The apostle Paul wrote: \u201cI handed on to you . . . that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried, yes, that he has been raised up the third day according to the Scriptures.\u201d (1 Corinthians 15:3, 4) So Jesus was in hell, the grave, but he was not abandoned there, for he was raised up, or resurrected. Consider also the case of the righteous man Job, who suffered much. Wishing to escape his plight, he pleaded: \u201cWho will grant me this, that thou mayest protect me in hell [Sheol], and hide me till thy wrath pass?\u201d*(Job 14:13, Douay Version) How unreasonable to think that Job desired to go to a fiery-hot place for protection! To Job, \u201chell\u201d was simply the grave, where his suffering would end. The Bible hell, then, is the common grave of mankind where good people as well as bad ones go. NOW ABOUT HEAVEN 3. Heaven Heaven is a subject of both wild speculation and heated controversy. Yet, what the Bible teaches about it is far different from what many have been taught. What is heaven? WHAT SOME PEOPLE SAY There are diverse beliefs about heaven and its purpose. For example: Many professed Christians would agree with the New Catholic Encyclopedia, which calls heaven \u201cthe ultimate home of the blessed who die in the Lord.\u201dJudaism focuses more on the present life than on the afterlife, says Rabbi Bentzion Kravitz. But he suggests that \u201cin heaven the soul experiences the greatest possible pleasure\u2014a greater perception and feeling of closeness to God than it had previously.\u201d Kravitz acknowledges, however, that \u201calthough Judaism believes in heaven, the Torah speaks very little about it.\u201dHindus and Buddhists believe that heaven exists on many spiritual levels. It is a temporary stop, after which a person is either reborn on earth or transcends to Nirvana or Buddhahood\u2014a state that is higher than heaven.Some reject any religious notion of heaven and say that the whole idea is childish nonsense. Heaven is a topic of much speculation WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES In the Bible, the word \u201cheaven\u201d has more than one meaning. For example: Genesis 1:20 describes the creation of birds that \u201cfly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.\u201d In this case, the word \u201cheavens\u201d refers to our atmosphere, the observable sky.Isaiah 13:10 mentions \u201cthe stars of the heavens and their constellations\u201d\u2014what we would call outer space.The Bible speaks of God\u2019s \u201cdwelling place in the heavens\u201d and says that there are \u201cangels in heaven.\u201d (1 Kings 8:30; Matthew 18:10) Note that the words \u201cheavens\u201d and \u201cheaven\u201d are not simply metaphors, but describe an actual place of residence. *\u201cLook down from heaven and see from your lofty abode of holiness and glory.\u201d \u2014Isaiah 63:15. Do all good people go to heaven when they die? The Bible does not teach that the earth is merely a temporary home where we await death and a subsequent afterlife in heaven. The Bible makes clear that death was never a part of God\u2019s original purpose for humans. Consider: God told the first human couple: \u201cBe fruitful and become many, fill the earth.\u201d (Genesis 1:28) Earth was to be man\u2019s permanent home, where he could live forever. Death would come to the first man and woman only if they disobeyed God. Sadly, they chose to disobey.\u2014Genesis 2:17; 3:6.The disobedience of that first man resulted in death, not only for himself and his wife but also for their offspring. (Romans 5:12) Did that leave the human race without hope?The Bible says that \u201cthere are new heavensand a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise.\u201d * (2 Peter 3:13) By means of his Kingdom, God will restore our earth to the condition he intended for it, \u201cand death will be no more.\u201d (Revelation 21:3, 4) ]Source- www.jw.org ",

            "answer_text": "There is a Heaven but Hell (Hades) as a place of punishment does not exist in the Bible. Heaven is where the Creator (Yahweh or Jehovah) resides. It is also populated by the angels of which Jesus Christ in his pre-human existence was and again is the Archangel (Chief Angel). Jesus NEVER claimed to be GOD or equal to GOD. Hell is the English translation of the Greek word Hades, which meant \u201cunderground or below\u201d. This was in turn translated from the Hebrew word Sheol which translated to English directly would be \u201cthe grave or underground\u201d. This is where one goes when they die. Not Heaven, not Hell: We are ALL sinner, no one that ever lived except Jesus Christ was or is free from sin. The wages of sin is DEATH. Not hell or a burning fire. Romans 6:23 NKJV 23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. What is death. Non existence, as your were before your were conceived and born. Ecclesiastes 9:5 -6 New King James Version 5 For the living know that they will die; But the dead know nothing, And they have no more reward, For the memory of them is forgotten. 6 Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished; Ecclesiastes 9:10 NKJV 10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going Jesus said that in the future he would resurrect all those in the Grave. John 5:28\u201329 New Revised Standard Bible 28 Do not be astonished at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice 29 and will come out\u2014those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation** **Many translations render this word as \u201cjudgment\u201d rather than condemnation. It makes more sense as judgment can mean condemnation OR a teaching, leading, guiding. It is unreasonable to assume that a sinner (that is every one of us) would be resurrected just to be sentenced to death and returned to the grave. It is apparent that sinful humans will be instructed in correct behavior and their \u201cjudgment\u201d will be based on how they respond AFTER they are resurrected. Those who continue to do evil and practice sin will then be condemned to eternal death, not a fiery Hell. Again, I am NOT trying to tell you what to believe. I am just pointing out scripture and what it says. Believe what you wish. ",

            "answer_text": "That the grave, whither we all tend, expressed by the Hebrew sheol , and the Greek hades , is a place of darkness in which there is no work, device, wisdom, or knowledge. Ecclesiastes 9:10. That the state to which we are reduced by death is one of silence, inactivity, and entire unconsciousness. Psalm 146:4; Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6; Daniel 12:2, etc. That out of this prison house of the grave mankind are to be brought by a bodily resurrection; the righteous having part in the first resurrection, which takes place at the second advent of Christ, the wicked in the second resurrection, which takes place a thousand years thereafter. Revelation 20:4-6. That at the last trump, the living righteous are to be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, and with the resurrected righteous are to be caught up to meet the Lord in the air, so forever to be with the Lord. That these immortalized ones are then taken to Heaven, to the New Jerusalem, the Father's house in which there are many mansions, John 14:1-3, where they reign with Christ a thousand years, judging the world and fallen angels, that is, apportioning the punishment to be executed upon them at the close of the one thousand years; Revelation 20:4; 1 Corinthians 6:2, 3; that during this time the earth lies in a desolate and chaotic condition, Jeremiah 4:20-27, described, as in the beginning by the Greek term abussos ( \u00f5\u00f3\u00f3 \u00ef\u00f2 ) bottomless pit (Septuagint of Genesis 1:2); and that here Satan is confined during the thousand years, Revelation 20:1, 2, and here finally destroyed, Revelation 20:10; Malachi 4:1; the theater of the ruin he has wrought in the universe, being appropriately made for a time his gloomy prison house, and then the place of his final execution. That at the end of the thousand years, the Lord descends with his people and the New Jerusalem, Revelation 21:2, the wicked dead are raised and come up upon the surface of the yet unrenewed earth, and gather about the city, the camp of the saints, Revelation 20:9, and fire comes down from God out of heaven and devours them. They are then consumed root and branch, Malachi 4:1, becoming as though they had not been. Obadiah 15, 16. In this everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, 2 Thessalonians 1:9, the wicked meet the everlasting punishment threatened against them, Matthew 25:46. This is the perdition of ungodly men, the fire which consumes them being the fire for which \"the heavens and the earth which are now\" are kept in store, which shall melt even the elements with its intensity, and purge the earth from the deepest stains of the curse of sin. 2 Peter 3:7-12. That a new heavens and earth shall spring by the power of God from the ashes of the old, to be, with the New Jerusalem for its metropolis and capital, the eternal inheritance of the saints, the place where the righteous shall evermore dwell. 2 Peter 3:13; Psalm 37:11, 29; Matthew 5:5.

            "answer_text": "Yes and no, in that order. HEAVEN Heaven exists but nobody can go there. Heaven is the hiding place of God in the darkness. 1Ki 8: (KJV Strong's) 10 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the Lord, 11 So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord. 12 Then spake Solomon, The Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. 13 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.No going to heaven except they came from there first. He told one of the priests of Jerusalem this; Jn 3 (KJV Strong's) 11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. 12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? 13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in [of] heaven.Jesus made it clear to non believers that they could never go there. John 7 (KJV Strong's) 33 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. 34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.Jesus made it clear to believers that they could never go there but he did make it clear that they could follow him afterwards. John 13:33 \u2014 38 (KJV Strong's) Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. 34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. 36 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards. 37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. 38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.Believers were confused by this afterwards bit so he explained that he was going to prepare a place for them to live and then when he returned to earth they would be with him forever. 14:\u200b1 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. 4 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.Jesus always taught about inheriting eternal life, not people going to heaven. It was the pagans who believed they died and went to heaven but, Christ taught something completely different. More recently, since 1967, messianic believers have returned to the Revelation roots of the teachings given by Christ on eternal life and eternal death. He taught that we die and go to the grave to await resurrection but, there is no consciousness until that happens at the return of Christ. As this is a prophetic issue, only the bible can explain it and there should be evidence I both old and new testament. Jesus tells Daniel to enjoy his life and he will be resurrected at the return of Christ. Daniel 12: (KJV Strong's) 13 But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest and, stand in thy lot at the end of the days.HELL The comprehension of hell comes from the ancient Greeks and the belief in an afterlife descended from the Egyptians before them. Hell is a pagan religious belief with no foundation in biblical truth. Christians didn't start reading about hell until the late 1800\u2032s when the word made its debut in bibles. Suddenly from then on the popularity of its use caused a groundswell of converts to Christianity. Fire and brimstone evangelists scared people into believing in God through promises of hell or heaven in the afterlife. Hell preaching teaches immortality of the soul after death but this is opposite to the curse uttered by God before the flood of Noah. Genesis 6: (KJV) 3 And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.Gen 6: (Revelation Bible) Yhwh said, \u201cMy breath will not be wasted quarreling with mankind. Even he is a living body yet, his days in the sun shall be a fraction of 120 years.\u201dConsider also that eternal life is only given by Christ to his BELIEVERS when he returns and not before then. So either the bible is right and man is not eternal in either body or soul OR the bible is wrong and traditions of other religions are right. Only one can be correct. Understanding of eternal torment in Hell comes from the kingdom of Hades. Hades/Pluto was the Greek god of the underworld. Biblically, hades is incompatible with Christian theology bedside belief in other gods is abandoned. Scriptures are explicit in this regard; Exodus 20:3(KJV) Thou shalt have no other gods before me.(Revelation bible) You shall have no strange divinities before my face.To believe in hell is to believe in strange deities which is opposite to biblical teaching. The other meaning for Hades is \u201cgrave\u201d according to Strong's concordance definition on number 86. ",

We have been warned that the good and the bad will be judged; all the deeds are recorded It will be very easy and very happy day for the obedient believers It will be a very sad and difficult time for the disbelievers and the wrongdoers God wants us to witness our own test results in order to admit that we have been fairly rewarded according to our faith and our deeds Qur\u2019an 27:83-85 is a scene from the hereafter, when we are asked \u2018what else have you been doing?\u2019. \u2018When they \u02f9finally\u02fa come before their Lord, He will ask \u02f9them\u02fa, \u201cDid you deny My revelations without \u02f9even\u02fa comprehending them?

Bad is their judgment! 45:24 The disbelievers say: \"There is nothing but the life of this world? We live and die; nothing but time destroys us.\" In fact, they have no knowledge concerning this. They are merely guessing. 45:28-34 explain a scene from the hereafter; people will be rewarded for their deeds; all deeds are recorded. \u2018You shall see every nation on its knees. Every nation shall be summoned to its book of record, and Allah will say: \"Today you shall be rewarded for your deeds. This book of Ours speaks about you with the truth. Surely We have recorded all your deeds.\" As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, their God will admit them into His mercy. That will be a glorious achievement. But as to those who disbelieved, Allah will say: \"Were My revelations not recited to you? But you showed arrogance and became a people of criminals\". It will be said: \"Today We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours! Hellfire will be your home and none will be there to help you\u2019 Qur\u2019an 33:67-68 is a scene from the hereafter to teach that those who follow the arrogant leaders will be misled. 23:64-66 is a scene from the hereafter to warn those who prefer to live a luxury life ignoring God\u2019s message. \u2018But as soon as We seize their elite with torment, they start to cry for help. We shall say: \"Do not cry for help this Day, for surely from Us you shall receive no help\u2019. 46:20 is a scene from the hereafter to warn the arrogant people who did not obey but chose to enjoy a luxury life. \u02f9Watch for\u02fa the Day \u02f9when\u02fa the disbelievers will be exposed to the Fire. \u02f9They will be told, \u02fa \u201cYou \u02f9already\u02fa exhausted your \u02f9share of\u02fa pleasures during your worldly life, and \u02f9fully\u02fa enjoyed them. So Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for your arrogance throughout the land with no right, and for the transgressions you committed.\u201d That is similar to the wisdom taught by Jesus in Luke 16:25 17:14 is a scene from the hereafter teaches that each person will validate his records of his deeds. 32:12 is a scene from the hereafter to warn those who fail to do good deeds. \u2018If only you could see the wicked hanging their heads \u02f9in shame\u02fa before their Lord, \u02f9crying: \u02fa \u201cOur Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back and we will do good. We truly have sure faith \u02f9now\u02fa!\u201d 34:25-26 teach that everyone will be judged for his deeds only (not for the mistakes of fathers or others). \u2018Say: \"Neither shall you be called to account for whatever we may have become guilty of, nor shall we be called to account for whatever you are doing.\" Say, \u201cOur Lord will gather us together, then He will judge between us with the truth. For He is the All-Knowing Judge.\u201d 34:34 warns the people who have wealth and authority because those are usually the first people to reject the prophets. \u2018Whenever We sent a warner to a society, its elite would say, \u201cWe truly reject what you have been sent with.\u201d 35:37 is a scene from the hereafter to explain the conditions of the disobedient who wish to go back to life to do good deeds (although they are granted enough time to demonstrate their behavior). \u201cTherein they shall cry for help: \"Our God! Get us out, from now on we shall do good deeds and shall not repeat the ones we used to do\". The response will be: \"Did we not give you lives long enough so that he who would, could take a warning? Besides, someone did come to warn you. Now taste the fruit of your deeds, here there is no helper for the wrongdoers.\" 39:59-61 is a scene from the hereafter to warn the arrogant who deny the signs and revelations. \u2018Not at all! My revelations had already come to you, but you rejected them, acted arrogantly, and were one of the disbelievers.\u201d On the Day of Judgment you will see those who lied about Allah with their faces gloomy. Is Hell not a \u02f9fitting\u02fa home for the arrogant? On the contrary, Allah will deliver the righteous to their place of salvation. No harm shall touch them, nor shall they ever grieve.\u2019 Qur\u2019an 39:71-74 After the Judgement, the Unbelievers will be driven to hell in groups. When they reach there, its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: \"Did there not come to you messengers from among yourselves, who recited to you the revelations of God and warned you about the meeting of this Day?\" \"Yes,\" they will answer. But at that time the sentence of punishment would have been already announced against the unbelievers.\" It will be said to them, \u201cEnter the gates of Hell, to stay there forever.\u201d What an evil home for the arrogant! And those who were mindful of their Lord will be led to Paradise in \u02f9successive\u02fa groups. When they arrive at its \u02f9already\u02fa open gates, its keepers will say, \u201cPeace be upon you! You have done well, so come in, to stay forever.\u201d They will say: \"Praise be to Allah Who has truly fulfilled His promise and gave us this land to inherit, now we can live in paradise wherever we like.\" How excellent will be the reward for the righteous? As recorded in Qur\u2019an 52:35-36 disbelievers will be asked: \u2018Were they created without a Creator? Or were they their own creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth?

            "answer_text": "In HINDUISM, heaven does exist. But not hell, because it isn't necessary. Even the Upanishads have discussed heaven. According to Hinduism, men who by practice of yoga, attain higher states of existence, go to heaven after death. But only if they wish to. But they can live for eternity on earth, go to heaven after earth ceases to exist. This is fate of ancient Rishis and Munis discussed in Upanishads. They won't be reborn again and again, as their karmas been burnt to ashes, by fire of Self knowledge. Whether you believe in God or not, it doesn't mean anything.. according to Hinduism. God doesn't care as it doesn't affect him. But there is no school of athiesm in Hinduism. Reincarnation was central tenet of Hinduism and Buddhism. According to Hinduism, every human being including animals are born again and again and again. There is no escape to this phenomenon. Even Maharishis cannot escape the power of reincarnation, even when they performed Tapasya for thousands and thousands of years. Many of them lived on bed of oceans for hundreds of years to perform Tapasya. We all human beings are bound to this earth by karma. Our wives, kids and parents are all bound to us by Karma's of previous lives. It's due to karmic connections that we get parents and siblings, wives and children. This is called bondage, karmic debt that must be repaid. In my personal opinion, there is no heaven or hell for all animals and humans on earth. Reincarnation is similar to recycling. This belief is in accordance to Hinduism. In Hinduism, you can go to heaven only if you perform various types of Yagya ( religious offerings to god's of heaven ) and perform ritual in accordance to vedic texts. But all these rituals and ceremonies can only be performed by Brahmins priests . These ceremonies today would cost a lot of money, and no Indian family can afford it. And we no longer have such knowledgeable Brahmins either. For normal people, whether rich or poor, there is no heaven or hell, just simple reincarnation. ADI Shankaracharya sung a song more than 4000 years ago, punah jananam and punaha Karanam ( Bhaja Govindam *). Search YouTube Bhaja Govindam  Govindam by ADI Shankaracharya, who composed and sang this song. According to ADI Shankaracharya, even knowledge of all ancient sanskrit scriptures, all Vedas and Upanishads cannot save a human from reincarnation. Only grace of Lord Krishna can save a human from reincarnation and salvation to Vaikunta ( supreme abode of Lord Vishnu *). After death, we don't go to heaven or hell, but simply reincarnate either as human or any other species. If there is human suffering for bad karma, just go to government hospitals across India ..And read about worst Prisons across the world online without visiting one. Heaven and Hell are on this earth itself. In Hinduism, to go to heaven, you need to destroy all good and bad karma that bind you to earth. Our karma binds us to earth, as a result we are born again and again. According to Hinduism, Humans are born in bondage and die in bondage. Rich and healthy people enjoy heaven on earth. Hinduism predates Buddhism and other religions by thousands and thousands and thousands of years. Ancient temples found in southern India are thousands and thousands of years old. Most of them predate written history ",

It\u2019s been so long now that I\u2019ve been serving you.\u201d \u201cMy child,\u201d the master said, \u201cgo and sit in the next room. Close your eyes and sit still. You\u2019ll see heaven.\u201d \u201cReally? Just like that.\u201d \u201cGo.\u201d The disciple went into the next room and meditated. Surely enough, he had a vision but it was far from what he expected. All he saw was a vast ground and nothing else. There weren\u2019t any beautiful palaces or rivers of honey. Just as there were no oceans of milk or bricks of ruby. The roofs were not diamond studded. Heck, there was nothing other than endless barren land. As disappointed as intrigued, he went back to his master. \u201cO, my murshid,\u201d he pleaded hiding his disappointment. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve seen heaven, I should certainly like to see hell.\u201d \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d The master stroked his white flowing beard. \u201cVery well then, go and sit in meditation again. You\u2019ll have a vision of hell.\u201d The disciple did as instructed and once again, he saw nothing but the same vacant land. There were no fire-spitting snakes, no devil or ferocious animals, no one flaying anyone, no pots of boiling oil. Wherever he looked, there was just empty land from where he stood to all the way to the horizon, in all directions. \u201cWhat the hell,\u201d he thought. \u201cThis certainly couldn\u2019t be it.\u201d \u201cMaster,\u201d he spoke with conviction. \u201cThis was anything but a vision. I saw no heaven or hell.\u201d \u201cYou mean you were expecting glorious structures, magnificent scenery and unearthly beauty in heaven?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOr, snakes, fire, devil or untold tortures in hell?\u201d \u201cExactly.\u201d \u201cMy son,\u201d the master said. \u201cThere is nothing there. You will have to take everything from here. This is the place to gather everything, either the delights of heaven or the fires of hell.\u201d Heaven and hell are two aspects of our attitude towards life. These are two warehouses of our emotions and karma. How stuffy it gets here, whether it\u2019s fragrant or foul, it all depends on what we have stored in these warehouses. When we are content and grateful, we are in heaven. When we are angry, perturbed, or jealous we are in hell. Both are phases, stages and cyclical states of our mind. Heaven is indeed the vision of fulfilled desire, and hell the shadow of a soul on fire. In this infinite creation of unimaginable proportions, our acquisitions and attainments have little significance. Our world is tinier than the tiniest speck of dust in the world. Ultimately, to the world at large, what matters is not how fat your bank balance is but how big your heart is. Every selfless act, every gesture of gratitude, every soft word, every kind thought, they make up who we are. They create our world. Heaven or hell, it\u2019s not just within us, it is us. ",
