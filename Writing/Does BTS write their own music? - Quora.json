            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Members of BTS, especially RM and Suga, and JHope in early albums, are listed among writers for almost all BTS songs. So BTS somewhat participates in writing most of their songs, along with many other artists per song, some of which are Pdogg, Supreme Boi,\u2026 Now, since I've noticed many Armys praise this as why BTS is successful I.e. why they listen to them, let me clarify that they do not write lyrics by themselves, they merely participate in writing. The amount of contribution to song is relative as it may have some to no impact to the song. To make songs seen more relatable (and idols more talented), sometimes idols tend to be featured as writers, with no explanation how much of their participation actually affected final song. The similar situation is e.g. RM writing his Unicef speech - he didn't. But to make it more relatable, it is said RM made a draft and agency finished it - you can't tell how much of it was RM and how much others. Because Armys idolize RM and speech seems more personal written by RM a not some professional speech writer, they choose to claim that agency merely did grammar correction (its hilarious anyone actually believes this). The same thing is with songs. One or more members are listed among professional writers - mostly at the end of the list (showing relevance to the song). And the list contains from 5 to 12 writers per song. So does any contribution mean they write their own songs? I hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they do. But they also get help from their CEO, Bang Si Hyuk or more we\u2019ll known as Bang PD or Hitman Bang. They also sometimes get help from a producer called Pdogg. His real name is Gang Hyowon and he\u2019s one of the main producers at BigHit. There\u2019s also a man that goes by the name of Slow Rabbit who helped BTS in the beginning. He helped RM and V produce \u20184 O\u2019 Clock\u2019 and helped RM and Suga on their mixtapes. However BTS collaborate and work with so many other artists on various songs but more than 90% of the lyrics are written by BTS themselves according to Pdogg: \u201cI mostly work on making the track and I play the role of completing the lyrics and melody written by the members. More than 90% of the lyrics are written by the members themselves.\u201d - Pdogg For example, J-Hope worked with Supreme Boi on one of his tracks on his Mixtape, Hope World, and he featured in it too. The track was \u201c\ud56d\uc0c1 (HANGSANG)\u201d Amongst BTS themselves, the main producers for their songs are the rap line: J-Hope, Suga and RM. Anyway, in conclusion, yes. BTS do write their own music but often collaborate and work with other producers or artists on some songs. ",

Hahahaha, there is no way BTS members have writen 90% of their music. Just check the writing credits of every single BTS album. In all of them are like 9-10 credited songwriters per song\u2026 why would a company like BigHit spend so much money in so many songwriters who only do the \u201c10% of the job\u201d? That is one of the dumbest lies i have ever read. I haven\u2019t even find a BTS song where ALL the credited songwriters are actually oficial group members. There is always a random professional ghostwriter backing them. And yeah, let\u2019s believe Pdogg, a ghost-writer who obviously would be fired if he didn\u2019t kiss the butt of BTS members and would get sacked if tried to take the credit that he actually deserves in songwriting. Honey, BTS is a BRAND, and the employees can\u2019t say negative things about the brand that pays their bills LOL ",
