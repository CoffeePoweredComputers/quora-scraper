            "answer_text": "Myths are stories that in their essence center around truth. Myths seek to embody an explanation of larger questions that faced ancient people. In addition to the daily question of \u2018where is my next meal coming from?\u2019 they also asked such questions as \u2018how did the world begin?\u2019 and \u2018where did we come from?\u2019 \u2013 likely as they watched the skies and pondered the heavens. Ancient peoples sought understandable and creative ways to explain the unexplainable, with creation myths like the Norse story of Odin. Often referred to as All-Father Odin, he and his brothers killed Ymir, the first being in Norse mythology and father of all giants. They made the world (called Midgard) from his body and man from tree trunks to populate this new world. A collection of pre-Christian poems called the Eddas describes the earth\u2019s creation this way. From Ymir\u2019s flesh the earth was created,And from his sweat [or blood] the sea,Mountains from bone,Trees from hair,And from his skull the sky. And from his eyebrows the blithe gods madeMidgard, home of the sons of menAnd from his brainsThey sculpted the grim clouds. \u2013 from Sources - Norse Mythology for Smart People It is noteworthy that the Biblical book of Genesis mentions a race of giants. Myths are also an attempt to explain how or why natural events occur, as with tales of an ancient flood that virtually destroys the world. Such an example is the Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh as well as the Biblical flood weathered by Noah, his family, and pairs of creatures who survive the flood by riding it out in the ark. The older epic of Gilgamesh and the story of Noah are quite similar, even down to the instructions on building the boat. In both cases, the flood is caused by (a) divine ruler(s) who seeks to start anew with mankind. Here\u2019s a link that will give you a snapshot of other examples of myth. Examples of Mythology ",

            "answer_text": "In a brief stick of mythic proof we liken the flimsy truths of today as mistaken notions of jumping to conclusions, knee-jerk responses, hasty generalisations, and comic colloquial coverlets collapsing from incompatabilities to culture and custom discomfitted by coquettish contortions of disconcertings and anamalous misconceptions. In a corner of the meaning of the word \u2018myth\u2019, we find what we know not to be so masquerading as if it was. Can we see past this connotation of falseness in the word \u2018myth\u2019. I hope so, and yet there is no reason to dismiss it either. It is well known to lovers of mythic tradition that the wisdom and the prevalences of storied locution that are myths ought never be weighed for their ability to espouse truth, but rather for their brevity in pollating a breadth of experience no longer possessed of the living, gently looming preponderance upon preemminance with posterity pending and percipient propositions premiering. Tethering the dramatizations of the dear but dead to the pollity upon postulations professed and repossessed in stead, bring us the mantle of making a word of discourse to where there is not, is mythology at work. The Judeo-Christian Bible begins with a holy story of creation that by all means to any of us that uphold its sacredness, we recognize its mythic mastery, a weaving of the motions of life gone and coming to that of the nonce state. Now at once with then twice. A continuum of cause and respect to be effectual flexion of potable truth. This is its reason for being a sacrament and is our pleasure to propose it is a value that projects from its presentation and presents purposefully from its projective allure. To be a stopped rag of parchment, now penchant to rice paper, is else what one who believes in it can see by similar reasoning applied to its bookbinding. We all tell stories and color them with the bled dye of our living grist. Do not curse upon our fathers\u2019 and call to bastardize a scurrilous sanctity of paternal relation and maternal correlation , even though Adam was muddy and Eve pretty ribsy of that. This myth is well-met and matters of a mathematic authenticity are marvelous in the wake of the matted precursional mythos. Resounding literal stigmata pits a posteriori to apricot halves here . Do your ears hang to lo? Moo can\u2019t complain. Snot infirmarial escrutcheon\u2019s my dried back. ",
