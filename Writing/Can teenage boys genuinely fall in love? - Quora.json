            "answer_text": "Its funny you think guys cant do things lie falling in love\u2026Its usually girls who say \u201cAll boys are the same\u201d not the opposite? Plus its not true at all. You know,, guys can love pink, guys can cry, guys can fall in love actually guys are usualy the more sensitive. You guys tend to fall in love with the personnality quicker than the physique (NOT ALWAYS THE CASE) while girls will more often find a guy attractive for their physique (again NOT ALWAYS THE CASE). But in teenage-hood, its very common. You are a one of a kind, I admire you a lot. I was in a girl only school, and I rarely heard of a guys genuinely in love with someone. Most of the time, the boyfriends who came to \u201cpick their girl up\u201d were agressively french kissing their \u201cprizes girlfriend\u201d and I heard lot of \u201csex night\u201d stories. (Now that I think of it, my highschool years where nightmarish) Well yes guys can fall in love,I wish you lot of luck ",

            "answer_text": "I think you're confused. See as we age we don't just magically form an ability to love overnight. You start by loving your mother. She is the human you will love more than any other. So you developed that love, what next? Maybe a T.V. show? At that moment your mind is telling you that you cannot live without that T.V. show. You need it to be happy! Then, you develop a love for baseball. If you never played baseball again, you know your life wouldn't be worth living. You need baseball! I can go on, but I think you understand. What defines love? Adults say we don't know what love is even though it is the first emotion we feel. We have a bond with our mother from birth. We don't even know how to open and close our eyes yet and we already love our mother. Yes, teenagers can fall in love. ",

            "answer_text": "They can indeed fall in love. It's less common for it to be the same way as in movies, simply because said movies are unrealistic. Every relationship is different. Falling in love won't be the same experience for everyone, or even for the same person with different people. People show affection in different ways. Teenagers definitely do fall in love, although a lot of the time, what they think of as \u2018love\u2019 is actually infatuation - a short-lived attraction for someone that's so intense that they believe they're in love. That's not to say that they don't fall in love though - given enough time and patience, it's possible for a healthy relationship to become one of love. I should know. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure we can, why not? Thing is, falling in love with someone who has already fallen in love with you is a rare thing, unlike in movies. Sometimes his goal is sex, sometimes he kissed you because you seemed interesting enough and wanted to have time to see whether he\u2019ll fall in love, sometimes it\u2019s for the status, etc. The only difference is that teenagers are usually more horny than general population and they are more easily pressured by the society into having a relationship with someone (anyone, or a particular persion). So it might be rarer, though not proven, but it certainly exists. ",

When we\u2019re teens can be more difficult to separe sexual atrattion to a true love, but can be a real and genuinely love. Sometimes girls can be a challenge for we and will make a confusing in our minds, will let us a silly but will be the one of the best challenges of our lifes.
