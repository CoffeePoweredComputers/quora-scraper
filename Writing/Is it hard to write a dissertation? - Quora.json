            "answer_text": "Interesting question. No, it\u2019s not really hard. It\u2019s more time-consuming, tedious, and sometimes frustrating, but not really all that hard. My experience was that much of the work for my dissertation had already been done in various forms by other authors. I read their dissertations, a lot of academic and professional papers, dug for U.S. government publications on various aspects of the topic(s), and mapped as much as I could of the knowledge base. Somewhere in my doctoral journey, I had a class on how to build a taxonomy, along with the nature of ontology and epistemiology. We also were required to take various classes on how to write academic papers, ethical (and legal) rules for conduction studies, and a couple courses in handling statistics. After some good preparation in graduate school, none of this was really all that hard. The main thing was making sure that I was talking regularly to my academic advisor, who would be the chair of my dissertation committee. Fortunately, I consider the networking and relationship-building fun. So, no, it wasn\u2019t really hard. The dissertation just contained a lot of detail-oriented work. Data gathering, knowledge mapping, referencing, proof-reading, forming hypotheses and testing them with sound statistical process. It just takes time and patience. Good luck in your own journey! ",
