            "answer_text": "Writing a poem can be either very casual or vital which entirely sits on your mindset and desire. While writing a poem a day can be very challenging\u2026 it can be fun and self satisfying too, but depends on what your write. It is easy if you are occupied by something overwhelming, doesn't matter good or bad. Once you put the words on your emotional track, believe me, you may even find it hard to end the poetry which you had started with that silly line. If you have written poetry before, even for once, I would suggest, stick to something personal that you are feeling right now or a memory. And if you are new\u2026dont worry, just write the words that come to your mind\u2026which actually may not come (forgive me!) . Well, poetry is not rhyming a bunch of words. Don't sweat it on rhyming \u2026.or framing some kind of perfect sentence. It doesn't deserve to be called a poetry if it doesn't come from you\u2026 I mean the real inner you. The topic can be completely stange and unconnected to you , but the words have to be your very own. At the end of the day, poetry is what you write out of your self. The above lines are a piece of poetry itself. Just write anything! Poetry is expressing yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Write a poem when you are in a mood to express your feelings or http://emotions.As far as poetry is concerned you cannot force your self that may spoil the beauty of the poem. So write when you have natural flow of mood to write. I have read somewhere a question asked to Gurudev Tagore,\u2019 why do you write poems?\u2019 Gurudev said,\u2019I cant help http://writing\u2019. It is the intense urge to express himself through poetry that made him a great poet. ",

It comes to mind when it has to. When your mind is calm and in its own mood to write, it will automatically find inspirations from around you and make you write. Don't force yourself to write. It'll come to you itself. ",
