            "answer_text": "\u201cI swear, baby. I\u2019ll make sure I will call you up each day no matter what\u201d said George to Jenny while he crushed his ribs onto hers. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me alone. Don\u2019t go away\u201d continued George while he whined, as his teardrops started drenching the left portion of her shoulder. But she still appeared calm & composed. George breathed a heavy sigh and clapped his eyebrows very rapidly to scatter away his tears from rolling down. \u201cI am sure you will forget me once you step away from my sight\u201d George gave a thought to himself while he still submerged his face into her heavy heart brooding over their long-distance relationship. A series of thoughts dragged him into his past where Jenny once told him, \u201cI am not going to leave you even in my death\u201d George had a look for one last time on Jenny\u2019s coffin where the bold lettering read \u2013 ST. GEORGE FUNERAL SERVICES. With a positive yet heavy heart, he let go of him from her with a strong will to continue his 60 years of love towards her. ",
