            "answer_text": "While i fully agree to all the answers listed here. I will put in a alternate view. The CA field is in a mess & the institute has something to do with it but so have we too.Let me ask you some questions: How many CA's do you know who really want to Professionally connect & by Professionally connect I mean talk only about Career, goals & opportunities? How many CAs do you know who really have the right skills required to do a job? How many of them can think of macro impacts of financial decisions & not just balance sheet/audit & tax aspects of a financial decision? How many CAs do you know who have thought about the specific field they want to work in after being a CA? Most people you ask this question will say tax/audit/accounts but these are fairly large fields with a lot of specialization areas plus there are other fields apart from theses where CAs can make a mark but not everybody takes the pains to research upon them, in fact most fresh CAs are just concerned with getting a job whatever it may be rather than pursuing a specific field & putting in all efforts to break into that field. Yes there is rampant unemployment for CAs & many are working way below the average salaries offered in campuses but partially the people themselves are to blame for it because just because you cleared a CA exam does not establish your right to higher salaries you need to demonstrate skill & value. Let me give another solution which i tried to implement to help fellow CAs who were unemployed. I created a group on facebook (Facebook) by the name \"Jobs for CAs\". where i posted about all the job mails which came to me as part of mass mailing through all Job websites. Of course not all these mails were useful to me so i posted the job details on the group so that some fellow CA might benefit from it. All i demanded from the group members was to add as many CAs they knew to the group & share any such mails that they might find useful for the group. Let me tell you what happened: The group today has 446 members but i was the only one posting about the jobsSome people mistook me for a recruitment consultant & starting sending me messages to help them find a job in their city.Some would reply on the job posts in a very condescending manner about further details required which could be googled every easily.Some people would use it as a platform to advertise about CA coaching classes which i didnt approve so never got posted on the group wall.Some people wanted to use it to develop a political agenda which also i didnt allow so never got posted on the wall.Today the group exists but its largely inactive because of the very people in the group. 2 things i learnt from this: Almost every CA thinks that he has done his bit by passing the exam & now it is the duty of others to help him get a job & not just a job but one which gives them high salaries, high growth & all of that in their areas/location preference.CAs are absolutely zilch interested Professional networking & helping other fellow CAs. The kind of networking that MBAs follow where one MBA from IIM A will act as a point of contact in companies for all future vacancies.The burden of developing the stature of the profession & the value is as much on the institute as it is on us. A few things that all fellow CAs need to realise are: There is a life outside pursuing CA & CA coaching which is unfair, demands smart work.The perception that Institute builds in all of us while teaching us about what industry expects from CAs is not entirely true.CAs need to be in a network & help each other grow & it can be as simple helping each other find a job.We need to develop skills that are relevant to the industry & not just stick to the audit & tax textbooks. Soft Skills play a very significant role & its not so difficult to develop them also (definitely not difficult than passing the CA exam)Apologies if this sounds a bit rude but frankly speaking this is the truth. So stop relying on someone else to help you build your career or create your value in the market. ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer : I am a CA and would encourge you to be one if the subjects interest you inspite of all the problems that I am going to write about ... Yes, it is a mess !!  Primarily for the following reasons :  1. The syllabus - The syllabus is designed to make you an expert \"auditor\" or \"tax consultant\". I think, with the kind of understanding that a CA student has of financials, CA institute would do well to include more topics in areas of Corporate Finance, Banking or even Private Equity. Considering the fact that most of CA students are doing a Bachelors in Business or Commerce, ICAI can build on the \"business\" knowledge of students and turn them into astute finance professionals with solid business understanding. Tweaking a few subjects in the syllabus can easily make the \"skills\" of a CA more relevant to a broader level of industry. 2. Poor alumni network - Basically, it sucks ! The only CAs who network are perhaps the guys interested in running for some ICAI election ! There is very little value addition done in terms helping young CAs or Articles by the experienced ones. 3. Articleship - For god's sake, stop taking advantage of young 19 year olds who work for you 70 hours a week. Idea of articleship is to \"learn\" and not to \"work\". Yes, working is the best form of learning but I think it is stretched too far. Even if u want young people to work for u, atleast dont crush their self-esteem by paying them lesser than drivers, clerks or the guy working at McDonalds ! 3 years of such unfair behaviour and you have a heartless 22 year old who pretty much hates the system rather than embracing it for all he could learn. 4. ICAI's marketing skills - ICAI has started the campus placement programs. But the salaries offered are often discouraging. The bar is set so low sometimes that its impossible (for most) to lead a financially rewarding life without a further degree (CFA, MBA etc). ICAI, lets throw some weight around with corporates and get the young CAs  what they deserve .. the guys have practically worked for free for 3 years and studied their hearts out .. they deserve better ! 5. ICAI itself !! - The number of emails, I got before the election soliciting votes .. OMG !! And none of them had quantifiable agendas, just empty promises ! And no updates for the next few years, no effort to make the process inclusive .. it looks so politicised. Like we have in audit, lets make a checklist of all u promised to do and then \"(reverse) tick\" the things actually done .. I wish there were more accountability. While, I hv no problem with CAs working for Big 4 (just like IITians would like to work for Google), I would love to see more focussed help for young CAs looking to start their own firms. P.S. - I am a CA. and extremely proud of it. I write this not to dissuade anyone from taking the CA course. Infact, I think the course transforms your life ... it is a challenge, which when overcomed, gives a lot of joy and sense of self-gratitude. And it builds a very very strong foundation of knowledge to expand upon. But that does not mean there is no scope of improvement in the system. And the above list is just my view of where a start can be made to improve things! ",
