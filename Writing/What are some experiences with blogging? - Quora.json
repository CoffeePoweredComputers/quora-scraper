            "answer_text": "I am a part-time blogger for 8 years. I sold like 3 blogs for now. So I think I have enough experience to share related to blogging. First and foremost, its NOT quality and unique content writing that is enough to propel your blog to web traffic frenzy. That is one of the many signals search engines use to improve your website articles ranking in search engines. The important part is SEO. (Search Engine Optimization). This is like an Art and not a Science. This gets rapidly changed every day and every month and every year. So you have to keep up-to-date info on this aspect. The second point is the niche you choose plays a major role, in your blog getting maximum exposure, traffic and money. If its a competitive niche like Tech, Gadgets etc, you are flowing with the river. But certain in-depth niches like some exceptional disease in health niche which has very less competition and more traffic, if you can do good onsite-SEO, you can get good results. The thing about blogging, is not only the expertise you have on the blog niche, but the amount of competition also matters. So doing keyword research properly and finding the right keywords to target is important. For example, I had a health blog which had only 40 articles, but after 2 years its traffic jumped to 1500 sessions per day. In another tech site, I have 350 articles, but its traffic is less than 700 session per day. ",
