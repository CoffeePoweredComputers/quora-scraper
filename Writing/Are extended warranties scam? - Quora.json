            "answer_text": "Yes, they are! Many are scams because the companies are very bad and/or the contracts are written in a manner to limit payouts. Just GOOGLE US Fidelis for an example of how many of these companies operate. This is particularly true with third party (not from the manufacturer) extended service contracts related to vehicles. These are the companies who send you bizarre letters or emails or flood the TV with ads prommising things any reasonably intelligent person should realize are impossible. All are scams due to the manner in which they are priced. First, the providers of the contract use experts to determine the expected payout. Second, the contract is sold to the dealer at a profit. Third the dealer sells the contract to the buyer, again at a profit. In the end you have a contract with two levels of profit over the expected payout. These contracts are huge profit makers for the dealer which, of course, is why they push them so hard. All most all independent consumer advocates advice against extended service contracts. For these reasons. Obviously, a contract costing $100 for an electronic product is a much less risky purchase than a contract related to a new vehicle which may cost $2,000 or so. If you do buy one of these contracts, make sure you fully understand the small print and fully understand the cost relationship of the contract to the replacement cost of the product including the likelihood of actually using the contract.

            "answer_text": "Considering the current scenario, they are a must thing to buy with the product. Device components like display, battery etc. are becoming more and more advanced and as a result repair costs have escalated. So, if in case you are getting extended warranties or protection programs like CMP by Flipkart and Acko by Amazon are the best insurance you can have for your device. Nowadays, one of the main USP\u2019s of devices like laptops and smartphones are their displays which is the weakest part of the device. So, there are more chances of you accidentally breaking it a span of 2 or 3 years life of the product. Moreover, display repairs usually cost around 1/3rd of the actual cost of the product. In these case Protection programs and extended warranties really help you mitigate the cost and save you money in the long term. Also, these extended warranties and Protection Programs are usually on offer if you buy them with the product. So, paying a little extra during the purchase can save you a lot in the near future. If a laptop has accidental warranty go for it. Similarly for every device these warranties are beneficial in the long term. There are very few people who can actually use a device unscathed for more than 2 or 3 years. Something or the other is bound to happen. As they say \u201cPrevention is always better than cure\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Extended warranties are another way of making money and most of the companies makes alot. So you should buy or is it a scam? No, its not a scam, Its like Insurance you don't have to break your bone to make it worth but actually have a peace of mind if anything happens you are covered. Same in extended warranties. Lets take an example of a Laptop. If you paid like 4500 for an extra year of warranty if something happens like motherboard dies so it will easily vost you 70\u201380% of the board value. Nor for 40k either you can spend 25\u201330k in case that happens else get it covered by paying 4500 just assumptions. So how companies make money? Answer to your spam doubt, if something happens to you ex. laptop and you paid 4500 so it might get covered in that cost or maybe it costs company 15k or more. Here lets assume 100000 people take the extended warranty and 10k people got tge issues so they just adjust over here and make profit from per product line model users not individual users. Those 10k people used like max 40k users money and rest 60k users money get into companies pocket. Customers are happy and company too. Companies provide extended warranty on the products which have good life span. Like TV, refrigerators, Laptops, PC etc. Mobiles have short life, and high repairing costs and % is high too, That's why most of the companies don't provide that. When back Nokia was in the market it used to offer 1 year extended warranty options on its mobile phones and you know why. Do Upvote if you find my answer helpful :) ",

            "answer_text": "Why we are calling it as a scam. The scam is something like where the money extracted by us without our consent or our knowing. Now the answer : See, taking an extended warranty varies on the product r\u00e0nge. P\u00e9ople generally don't refer to purchase the extended warranty on less expensive products. But yes if the amount of the particular product is high, then you must go for it. As it will assure the successful lifespan of the product. Now, my second opinion, Less expensive product we generally use for max 6 months. Then we tend to purchase or get it upgrade. But that time also we should have an extended warranty as it will make life of 6 months product to 1 year or 2 year as per your need. I have personally brought extended warranty From GoWarranty . I was in trouble with my microwave and my Iphone. And I have decided to take warranty extension for microwave just to check first. When I felt services to be great. I have decided to go for my iPhone too from GoWarranty And till now so many times my both the devices got damaged and repaired without incurring any extra cost. The services of GoWarranty is amazing. If anyone will use this service they won't be thinking extended warranty as a scam again. ",

Preying on the fact that most don\u2019t read the fine print. Many are legit. I have successfully used extended warranties to repair stuff actually covered. I love accidental warranties because accidents happen. Usually I pay a hefty price for this but it\u2019s worth it for some items. Others I look for memberships or credit cards that offer it as a fringe benefit. Here\u2019s an example of a camera repair covered by accidental. Was $69 a year for a lot of items I purchased.  ",

            "answer_text": "I have purchased several extended warranties with Honda. They have never turned down a claim. I will add that there were not many issues over the term. When a issue came up the dealer I visited treated it like I was a customer with a problem, write up a service request and inform me the initial cost will be one hour diagnostic charge. When the problem was found to be under warranty it was repaired for free and the diagnostic fee dropped. I would suggest not buying a third party warranty, they seem to be the one`s that want to fight claims. I have heard of stories were when an internal engine problem claim was submitted the cars owner was told to \u201chave the engine opened up\u201d at their cost and the warranty company would send out a rep to investigate and see if it was a covered issue. So, again, I would stay with the car Manufacturer`s Warranty\u2026 ",

Banks, credit unions sell extended warranties and the warranty price is negotiable, Too! You can usually negotiate 30 percent off a warranty. If the selling dealer won\u2019t come down, shop somewhere else. Even carmax will sell an extended warranty and it has great coverage. ",
