            "answer_text": "Any essay about \u201cclimate change,\u201d i.e. \u201cdangerous, man-caused global heating\u201d should end with a call to action. If you\u2019re in America before the 2020 election, the call to action should focus on the single most important thing any American who\u2019s patriotic and cares about more than short-term selfish desires: voting the fossil fuel industry\u2019s puppet political party out of office. Because nothing you do about your personal carbon footprint will make remotely as much difference as that. The Republicans opting out of the Paris Accord isn\u2019t the worst thing they\u2019ve done. It\u2019s the systematic dismantling of the federal government\u2019s scientific agencies that\u2019s the worst. The Republicans\u2019 war on science has been horrifying in its thoroughness and ruthlessness. Not just the climate, but anything in science that might impact the profits of the donor class that the GOP establishment works for.  Factio Republicana delenda est! ",

            "answer_text": "Conclude by stating that even though local climates do change in cycles naturally due to grand solar minimums and maximums, it isn\u2019t necessarily due to anything humans do on a daily or periodic bases. Environmental protection is crucial for local environments even though it may have zero impact on the earths climate over all. This rarely has anything to do with Carbon Dioxide but more to do with other toxins that industry sends into the air and water surrounding their facilities. Carbon Dioxide produced by humanity is minuscule compared to that produced by forest fires and volcanic eruptions which produce more carbon dioxide in a short period than humans do in a year. If pollutants are so important to the climate, then why do governments continue to spray toxic metals such as aluminum, barium and strontium into the air above your cities? It kills vegetation and animals that depend on it. It also causes conditions that doctors call chemtrail lung especially in cities. Climate change is a natural process but knowing the trend can help countries prepare for future crop growing seasons and food production that could save them from many problems in the future. ",
