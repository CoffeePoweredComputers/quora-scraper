            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Do you use home row technique when typing? Oddly enough, no. I\u2019ve observed similar behavior in other typists as well. Left long and pointer tend to hover over E and R respectively, while the entire right hand tends to hover over the upper row. I\u2019m still using the correct technique, but my fingers are anticipating the more common keys ahead of time. When first approaching the keyboard, because F and J are the only keys with tactile guides, my fingers will sit on the standard home keys, and they will return to those keys while I\u2019m paused, or thinking. But once I\u2019m in action, they will keep anticipating. ",
