I\u2019ve learned to ask certain questions when my wife is present. My contrarian observation is that I observe many of the most prolific Quora members rarely ask Questions. They might have 10,000 Answers and zero questions. I ponder if that suggests a lack of curiosity on their part and/or a reluctance to expose ignorance. I try to have the attitude of \u2026 Ignorance can be fixed \u2026 stupid is foreverI learn more when I am wrong than when I am correct.A wise man seeks wise counsel \u2026 and is intentional to reduce \u201cpride of authorship\u201d",

I'm on Quora merely to fuel my curiosity for anything out of the ordinary on almost any topic (science, wildlife, astronomy, sport, and religion). So I guess I'm innately curious. I don't ask questions though, I just browse through. I do answer questions, but only in selected topics that I am well read in. Of course, when I see an A2A or a question or answer that seek to misrepresent Islam, I'm compelled to answer, but mostly I'm just here to learn new things every day. ",
