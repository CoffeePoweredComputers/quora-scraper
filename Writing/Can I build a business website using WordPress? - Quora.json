WordPress is the leading content management system out there in basically any industry. Emerged as a basic CMS for blogging, it evolved into a powerful publishing tool for any kind of website. When launching a company website on WordPress I recommend to consider the following things: Performance: WordPress offers some standard performance optimization. However, I\u2019d recommend checking some SEO & caching plugins to optimize your website for speed (Google & your users will love it). Standard WordPress plugins: There are many great and mighty WordPress plugins out there for improving your websites. I particularly recommend these ones. As someone who\u2019s using WordPress pretty heavily for years (for our company website + blog + personal blogs), it is definitely a low entry if you just need a basic website. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, you can build a business website using WordPress! WordPress is a popular open-source content management system that accounts for a bulk of business websites online. Armed with a host of features to develop and customize a site, WordPress is very convenient to use. The themes are plenty and you can integrate a lot of plugins as per your wish. Once you are done developing the website, you can maintain it easily and without spending a lot of money. The super-active community of WordPress is always helping each other and they never cease to contribute. WordPress is updated on a regular basis and with each update, its interface becomes better. These reasons have made more and more businesses drift away from other CMS platforms and opt for WordPress website development.  If one has to rank WordPress in terms of SEO-friendliness, there is no doubt that it will leave many other content management systems far behind. When you have a business, you expect it to grow! And, as you grow your website will have to match that growth without any glitches. The scalability of WordPress is quite robust and since it had started as a blogging platform initially, it offers a wide range of blogging tools that you can utilize and customize your webpages. If you do not have the technical know-how to manage a CMS, you can always seek professional help to develop a great website for your business. Let\u2019s hope that the answer helps you! ",

Many of the domain name registrars will also offer email addresses for your business at an additional cost.

Just be sure to use the .org version for your business website. It\u2019s actually against WP\u2019s TOS to commercialize the free sites built on the .com site. It also will give you a good place to introduce your business to the world ( as well as backlinks to your social media and eventually your website). Just leave it up once your site is finally built so there won\u2019t be any broken links.
