            "answer_text": "I only buy quality fountain pens, so I only buy once a year or once in 2 years as a special present or something. I recently bought a Ranga handmade fountain pen, which has a Bock nib and writes beautifully (one of the best wet nibs I\u2019ve tried), and the barrel is a ripple Indian ebonite barrel. I recommend Ranga pens if you live in Chennai (I went there to visit my family and bought a Ranga pen fromt the place itself). I also bought a Waterman Expert with gold plating and lacquered black recently. I only buy fountain pens once in two years or once in 16 months. ",

            "answer_text": "I pretty much don\u2019t buy pens like I used to do. I\u2019ve got too many. What I do a lot of is nib work. I might pull a pen out and grind, polish or swap out the nib. I just reworked a nib on a Lamy Safari. It\u2019s absolutely incredible how much I have been able to improve a nib that I did about a year and a half ago. My skill set is getting pretty amazing even for me. Making a pen better than new is fun. ",
