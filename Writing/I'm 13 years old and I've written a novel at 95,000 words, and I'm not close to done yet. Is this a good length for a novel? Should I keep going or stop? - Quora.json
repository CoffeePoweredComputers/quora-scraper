            "answer_text": "First of all, I just want to say that you should be incredibly proud of yourself. I myself was writing long before the age of 13, but never have I stuck with a project long enough to see it hit 95,000 words. Now, an answer to your question. First of all, I think you should keep going. One should never let the \u201cword count rules\u201d bind their ideas. The problem, however, is that if you are looking to be published in the future, most publishers will not pay to have a book over 70,000 words published unless the author has already published a few successful books on the past. It\u2019s too expensive and, even if you were to self-publish, it would cost you and arm and a leg to have a book of that length printed. Of course, there are exceptions- your book could be absolutely stunning, and the publisher could spring to publish a 150,000 (by completion) novel. However, I am not going to lie to you- that\u2019s incredibly unlikely. So, here\u2019s what you can do. I would suggest writing the book until it\u2019s completed and try not to worry about the word count. Then, when it\u2019s finished, see if you can edit and streamline it down to a more reasonable length. If you cannot, consider making it a series- there is absolutely nothing wrong with doing so, providing you know how to do so. I wish you the best of luck, my fellow writer! And hey, if I can expect to see your book on the shelves anytime soon, send me a message! ",

            "answer_text": "Go until you're done. Save that thinking for the next draft, where you can merge and streamline events, cut things that don't fit, add stuff to fill holes, repace the chapters or acts and otherwise refine the structure. The size will change, sometimes dramatically. You may even find you want to split it in half. But its important you finish what you're doing now and take it to its conclusion. Nothing is worse than stopping to rework a section only to find that by the time you go back to actual writing you've lost the ending, so to speak. Or more that particular flow you have as you write a first draft. Ive lost a couple stories to this. But definately finish the thought so you have something whole to work with later, even if you decide to move on for now. You may come back years later while working on a different story and find some narrative threads or concepts here that can still be of use to you then. Just never stop at one draft if you intend to \u201ccomplete\u201d it. Those few rewrites can turn even the worst piece of garbage into a solid experience\u2026just that little extra tidying can really go a big way. ",
