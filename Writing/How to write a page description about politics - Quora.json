All you do is sit down at a typewriter (or today, a tablet or laptop or whatever) and bleed.\u201d But if you only need a single page, rather than a novel of a few hundred pages, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult. Step 1 \u2026 think about the topic. I\u2019m not sure of what country you come from, but if you\u2019re not from the U.S., maybe you can give some thought about what is interesting about your country\u2019s politics. Is it legitimate? Is it corrupt? Is it somewhere in between. Assuming there are multiple political parties, you can describe them and compare them. Jot down some notes as you think about the topic and eventually, you\u2019ll have the start of some thoughts that you can turn into sentences. Organize them, massage them, insert some additional information (for example, transitions from one topic or thought to another. Ideally, you might come to some conclusion \u2026 or if not you can say why you didn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t/etc. Before you know it \u2026 you should have a page (or more) on the subject of politics and maybe you\u2019ll even need to trim it down a bit, if you run over.
