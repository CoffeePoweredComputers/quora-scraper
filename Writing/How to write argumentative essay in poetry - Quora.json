            "answer_text": "When writing an essay, you should start from a general idea or concept and work toward something specific. The first part of the introduction is called \"the hook.\" The hook is designed to draw the reader of the essay in. Depending on the angle you chose for your essay, you may need to give background information on the culture or historical events relevant to the poem. Briefly preview these main points after the hook. Giving your reader an idea of what you will discuss functions as a road map to your essay, showing your reader how you will get to you main point. The final sentence of your introduction should then end with your thesis statement. ",

            "answer_text": "Did you mean by \"in poetry\" something like \"expressed in rhymes\" ? If so, write the essay as prose, then begin rewriting it, sentence by sentence, in the best metrical form / rhyme scheme you can achieve. You will find that 1,000 words of prose may come easily, but making that into, say, 150 lines of iambic pentameter, is dreadfully difficult. If not, the first answer is pretty good on critiquing a poetic work. ",

            "answer_text": "What would be the point? If you want to make an argument in rhyme, do so. Try reading Andrew Marvell\u2019s poem \u201cTo His Coy Mistress\u201d for an example of argument in rhyme. In my not-so-humble opinion, either write an essay or a poem. Each has it strengths and merits, but they don\u2019t overlap much. You need a thesis, supporting sentences and data, facts, analysis and reasoning to support your thesis. How you structure it is up to you. ",
