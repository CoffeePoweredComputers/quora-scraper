            "answer_text": "In reality, content length should always match the nature of the question the content is trying to answer. Even Google webmasters say that your content should be no shorter or no longer than it needs to be to answer the user\u2019s query. Having the same word-count as a top-ranking article isn't going to make your pages rank first, just like having a bunch of USB chargers isn't going to get you to the moon. But, I'm still tempted to buy some of those USB chargers...https://t.co/TIuJHwHufn\u2014 \ud83c\udf4c John \ud83c\udf4c (@JohnMu) February 8, 2020\n While this opinion is vague, it gives you a general idea of what Google is looking for\u2014good content that fulfills a user\u2019s search. So instead of focusing your word count on ranking, focus your word count on bounce rate and engagement. The high ranking will follow. The internet is littered with sources claiming what the optimal content length for SEO and revenue is. Ezoic ran the data of over 3,800 publishers to find what content length performs best. DOES CONTENT LENGTH AFFECT BOUNCE RATE?  We can see that longer content has lower bounce rates. This is true with a content length between 2500-5000 words that had a bounce rate of 23%. Interestingly, content between 500-750 words had a lower bounce rate than articles over 5000+ words. This seems counterintuitive since articles between 2500-5000 words had the lowest bounce rate. The content lengths with the two highest bounce rates were both the highest and the lowest word count ranges\u20140-250 words and 5000+. Keep in mind, the way Ezoic measures a navigation bounce differs from how Google Analytics measures it. For example: a user lands on a page of your site, spends 10 minutes reading the entire article and then navigates away, Google Analytics counts this as a bounce. Ezoic\u2019s Big Data Analytics views this interaction as a success since the user most likely found what they were looking for DOES CONTENT LENGTH AFFECT VISITOR ENGAGEMENT?  Y-Axis: Seconds The content length with the highest average engaged time is 2500-5000 words. This time, content over 5000+ words performed better than content between 1000-2500 words, but just slightly. Nonetheless, the top three content length ranges demonstrate that long-form content engages visitors longer. While this has been known in digital publishing for some time, this data confirms the information SEOs and publishers have been operating under for years. The lowest average engaged times on page by word count were 0-250, 250-500, and 500-750. The shorter your content is, the lower engaged time on page you\u2019re likely to have.

            "answer_text": "Websites that present this type of content receive an inordinate amount of attention, since people on the web read and perceive the content in a different way. To get a viral article, in addition to the length, it is important to make a good reflection and narration, to have well-documented information and to treat an own and original theme that is not too \"spent\" on the Internet. People want information that helps them advance both in their professional lives and in their personal lives, so giving them the resources to improve their situation is an important factor for a brand. These are the 2500 words we are talking about as the ideal length for 2017. It is not about writing the first thing that comes to mind with the sole purpose of achieving a good positioning on the search engine results page, because in fact, in this way we will be causing the opposite effect. The extensive content positions better in the search engines, but we must take care of the quality of our content. In the following graphic we see the relation that exists between the number of words of an article and its position in the SERPs of Google. ",
