            "answer_text": "2things and they kind of overlap! I grew up in a small town in California called vacaville, Which if you\u2019re familiar with spanishcliterally means \u201ccow town\u201d. A handful of years after I graduated I started hearing about a band thst came from my old high school\u2026the band:Paparoach. I refused to listen to them\u2026. I liked rock but I was an 80\u2019s Rock kind of girl not this 90\u2019s grunge crap and they came from Vacaville High\u2026they couldn\u2019t be good??!?!!?!?!!!. Lol!!! I vowed to never listen to them! I married a metalhead and refused to listen to http://metal\u2026.it sounded horrifying to me and hubby tortured me with it a lot! And I held solid with my no Paparoach vow from 1993 until 2014 when i kept hearing a song on the radio Station my husband was listening to that I liked and Shazam\u2019d it a handful of times\u2026paparoach \u201cwhere did the angels go?\u201dfreaking loved it! Still refused to listen to anything else of theirs lol!So I bought it (oh the horrors! Lol!) then I heard they were playing in Salt Lake City in 2015 which is only a 5 hour drive from our home in Idaho\u2026another band was playing that hubby was geeked about seeing:Five Finger Desth Punch. I bought him meet & greet tickets for FFDP, I got one for Paparoach figuring I could connect with them on the vacaville thing. My VIP was extra crazy. Evayse it was side stage. So I meet them before the show, get a pic with them\u2026get a tour backstage where I proceed to tell them about my vow and then I apologized profusely! The lead singer, Jacoby Shaddix gave me a bottle of water and i got to meet one of the other band\u2019s guitarists(From In This Moment)asked me how the streak was broken so I told him. My side stage pass was really standing at the corner of the stage in the photographers pit!?I was only supposed to be there for paparoach\u2019s set but I charmed the security guys and they brought me back before the opening band\u2026which ended up being my new favorite band (From Ashes To New) got to watch In a This Moment and FFDP FROM THERE TOO\u2026.which is how I ended up getting coronavirus from FFDP\u2019s lead singer\u2026obvs not COVID-19 since this was 2015 but it was horrific nonetheless!!! Paparoach comes on stage and goes through their set\u2026they play that song:\u201d\u201cwhere did the angels go?\u201d And jacoby runs over to me from center stageand give me the double tiger gun move!!I did not cry\u2026but i laughed and smiled big!! :) i loves all bands and joined my husband and daughter in metalhead-vile!!! Lol now we\u2019ve been to over 350 shows since thst one and have even had some bands stay at our house when they\u2019re in town!!! And no, I won\u2019t name them and no, it\u2019s not Paparoach!!! :) ",

            "answer_text": "When I learned my husband had been in a sexual fling with some 50-year-old hag that looks like a mix between a crack whore and Yosemite Sam. Never in my life did I forgive any man that cheated on me. I simply dumped them and moved on. And my mantra was, \u201conce a cheater, always a cheater.\u201d And I almost did that with my husband, except for a few reasons. I learned he had been targeted by this whore and her cuckold loving husband because he had a communication disability and they were trying to convince him to sell our house and buy one with them.They were trying to get him to give back our brand new truck to destroy his credit, so it was obvious if he would have invested with them (and he had no plans to do any such thing) he couldn\u2019t have been on the contract and they would take his investment.She knew about guardian ad litems and most likely would have claimed one over him to ship him off to a nursing home, because she gets off on emasculating men and he couldn\u2019t have defended himself, since his disability is a Wernicke\u2019s Aphasia.She wanted to have me beaten up because he refused to leave me, and later I learned, had been trying to dump her for some time but was being threatened with blackmail.So, upon learning all of that, and the fact that he couldn\u2019t even kiss her or say what she called \u201cnice things\u201d to her, because all he wanted from her were blowjobs, I was ready to destroy her and her husband in court. I learned he didn\u2019t even value her enough to rent a hotel room, which isn\u2019t him. I wasn\u2019t about to leave him, even though I was irritated with him. I forgave him after he told me everything, and we sought counseling and became close again. Especially, knowing she had threatened ME and I hadn\u2019t even known about her. I learned with that, just how devious humanity can be and that she was a covert narcissist who had been beaten for 20 years by her disgusting husband, from him. In the end, she was devastated, tried to conduct a smear campaign against him with her low life friends that we could have cared less about, including some woman who cries that her husband is dying of cancer and begs for help but thought it was funny that this whore targeted MY husband. I couldn\u2019t get over the hypocrisy of that. She is now stuck with her husband who she hates and who passes her around for his own sexual satisfaction. She tatted my husband\u2019s name on her chest (at 50 years old, no less) FOUR MONTHS AFTER he dumped her. I\u2019m guessing she thought that would prove she loved my husband and send him racing back to her. Either that or it would further emasculate her husband and empower her for all the years she remained married to a selfish abusive prick of a man. She didn\u2019t even know my husband well enough to understand he hates tattoos, especially on women, so that was hilarious. She cried all over the internet about how he had not even cared about her. DUH!! He told her from the first time she flirted with him that he was engaged and lived with me and she said, \u201cWell you aren\u2019t married.\u201d And he turned her down as she panted after him for a year, until we finally had a huge fight and I left town. And even after she performed on him, he clearly told her it was only about sex. But I guess that challenge really heated her up and she drove herself to believe she loved him. They never even went on a date or spent the night together. It was pretty much a lunch time blow job thing. She took us to court and was humiliated by what was revealed in court. I also threatened to sue her work, for allowing her to harass us on company time and use coworkers and her employees to fake testimony in court, when she wouldn\u2019t stop stalking him. Even the detective who investigated her stalking and harassment agreed that couple were some disgusting people. The one thing I DO know is that after that crazy bitch, my husband will NEVER have another fling. He now realizes that most women that sleazy are cray-cray too. ",
