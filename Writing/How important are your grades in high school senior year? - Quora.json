For most college applicants, the first term senior year grades are Included in the transcript that the colleges review, and therefore the colleges expect to see: Difficult/challenging courses and excellent grades. Granted, students that are admitted early do not have their senior grades reviewed for the acceptance process, but the colleges know that those are students who should Not slack off\u2026\u2026. But if they slack off, they will eventually Pay the Price: Every early admission student has her/his first term senior grades sent to all of the colleges to which she/he applied, including the early admission college. If the grades have fallen, then the early admission student may be issued a warning by the college to get her/his \u201cact together\u201d. Then, once the person accepts an offer of admission and sends in the non-refundable deposit, that college Demands to see the final transcript for that student, which should include consistency in good grades, the fact that the person graduated and no major disciplinary actions.

Finally, and Most importantly, at Least two of my senior year courses were a direct basis for freshman classes that I subsequently took at MIT.

Enjoy senior year, Responsibly, which includes being a consistent student. ",
