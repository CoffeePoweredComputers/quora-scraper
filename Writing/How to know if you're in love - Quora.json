            "answer_text": "\u201cIf you're really in love, then when you start feeling the urge to compliment your partner, you should feel a fresh thought coming to mind always.\u2026 Can't get that girl or guy out of your head? Daydreaming about the person when you should be working? Imagining your futures together? These dizzying thoughts may be signs of love. In fact, scientists have pinned down exactly what it means to \"fall in love.\" Researchers have found that an in - love brains looks very different from one experiencing mere lust, and it's also unlike a brain of someone in a long-term, committed relationship. Thinking this one's special When you're in love, you begin to think your beloved is unique. The belief is coupled with an inability to feel romantic passion for anyone else. Focusing on the positive People who are truly in love tend to focus on the positive qualities of their beloved, while overlooking his or her negative traits. They also focus on trivial events and objects that remind them of their loved one, daydreaming about these precious little moments and mementos. This focused attention is also thought to result from elevated levels of central dopamine, as well as a spike in central norepinephrine, a chemical associated with increased memory in the presence of new stimuli. It\u2019s a big, confusing world of love and life out there. But there really are some tell-tale signs you\u2019re in love that can help you figure it out. Here are some important signs you\u2019re in love: 1. You don\u2019t feel pain. And yes, I mean physical pain. (And yes, this is actually true!) Studies have shown that love really is a bit of a drug, and intense love actually has the ability to relieve pain. 2. You feel like you\u2019re on drugs. This sounds extremely dramatic, but there\u2019s truth behind it. When you first fall in love, and at times throughout your love story, you maybe like you\u2019re on a sort of drug high. Falling in love can produce a very similar sensation to getting high. When you\u2019re in love, your brain releases euphoria, which can occur at various times throughout your cycle of love, and helps you solidify the bond between you and your partner. 3. You\u2019re interested in new things. (That just happen to be about them.) This doesn\u2019t just apply to new sensations in your world, but in the literal sense. If you find yourself drawn to more new ideas and experiences than you\u2019ve ever been interested in before, chances are, you\u2019re in love. For example, if your new partner is involved in improv, you may find your Friday and Saturday nights completely entwined with laugh out loud comedy. If your partner is a huge soccer fan, you may find yourself with season tickets to see your local team. If your partner is a tax attorney, all of a sudden you may understand the IRS a lot more than you ever had before. If you\u2019re in love with someone, you will find yourself more and more interested towards what they care about. And the good news is, everyone likes new hobbies. 4. You check your phone a lot. Many of us are already kind of super-glued to our phones.But when you\u2019re in love, you may find yourself even more likely to quickly respond to a text message or even (gasp!) more likely to pick up a phone call. It\u2019s a common joke that no one likes talking on the phone anymore, but when you\u2019re in love, you may find that you make an exception for that special someone. 5. You check social media a lot.Consider yourself lucky if you\u2019re falling in love with someone who is not much of a social media user. Otherwise, consider yourself even more addicted to those social platforms. Not every couple is an \u201cInstagram Couple\u201d but you might be. If you find yourself posting a bunch of cute pictures and generally leaning into the corniness of the world wide web, you may just be in love. 6. You feel sick.Nobody likes being sick, but being lovesick really is a scientific phenomenon. If you notice your heart racing, your hands getting sweaty, your stomach filling with flutters that kind of make you feel nauseous, don\u2019t rush to the doctor. You really may just be in love. The stimulation of adrenaline and norepinephrine is legitimately something that happens to most of us when we\u2019re in love. You can truly feel like you have the flu when really, you\u2019re just overwhelmed with those feelings of love. (There\u2019s no medicine for it!) You may also experience symptoms like appetite loss and feeling kind of nauseous. What a world. 7. You catch yourself smiling.This sign is a little more pleasant than all of that flu stuff. If you happen to check your phone in front of a friend, chances are they\u2019ll tease you about the big smile plastered across your face. It\u2019s a common theme in movies and television shows and there\u2019s a reason why. When someone is in love, you can almost always tell by the big ol\u2019 smile on their face. Thank you for reading :) Hope my answer will be helpful to you :) Spread love \u2661 ",

            "answer_text": "How do I know? Well, I spent 43 years looking for \u201cthe one\u201d. And even though it didn\u2019t take me that long to realize that there wasn\u2019t a mythical creature out there somewhere who could fulfill all my needs and desires, I still hung onto the hope that there might be someone who could make the butterflies in my stomach tickle me whenever I saw her. And there was. For two decades, I tried what I could to find someone I could even feel comfortable with. And as an introvert with anxiety problems, this wasn\u2019t easy to do because I\u2019ve never liked to socialize at all. Going to parties or night clubs was never something I enjoyed, and the kind of woman I wanted wasn\u2019t very likely to be found there, anyway. I didn\u2019t know what or who I wanted. Only what I didn\u2019t want. And unfortunately, I only met women I didn\u2019t want to get involved with.Not bad people at all. They just didn\u2019t seem right somehow. There was no chemistry. From the age of 20, I was actively trying to find someone. Or that\u2019s to say, I met people at work and at my usual hangouts like the library and the record store where my friend works, but most of the women at work were married already and I felt too awkward to approach women who were reading a book in private. And because I felt awkward, I looked awkward as well, and I\u2019m sure this put a lot of people off the idea of approaching me. There was no social media at that time. No Facebook and certainly no Tinder.You could always put a classified ad in the local paper, but I figured that if it was difficult for me to approach someone cold in a public place, it would be even more terrifying to do so with a completely unknown person I hadn\u2019t even seen. Eventually all the dating sites and apps became available, but by that time, I was kinda set in my ways and didn\u2019t want to use them.I was an old-school romantic who\u2019d grown up with people who married and stayed married to their first love. And as naive as that may sound, that\u2019s what was normal to me. That\u2019s the kind of relationship I wanted to find. Love at first sight. Or at least soon thereafter. In my 30\u2019s, I\u2019d given up on that idea. I\u2019d become cynical and bitter.I hadn\u2019t met anyone and I didn\u2019t like to look for someone in the places where people meet. And I especially didn\u2019t like the idea of someone judging my worth from looking at my picture and swiping left or right. Even if someone wanted me, I didn\u2019t want someone who wanted me, purely based on my physical attributes. It wasn\u2019t until I hit my 40\u2019s that I seriously started to ache for another person\u2019s company. I was afraid that it was too late. That I\u2019d left it too long. That I\u2019d been too much of a coward to seriously make an effort. Then I found Quora. And by writing here, I suddenly met lots of people who weren\u2019t necessarily looking for relationships, but who nevertheless shared my interests and liked to express their opinions on everything under the sun. I loved it! I\u2019m not sure why it took so long to discover this site (it would\u2019ve been great to do so much earlier) but once I did, I suddenly had more friends than I\u2019d ever had before in my life. And I felt at home here because people weren\u2019t simply interested in their own status or follower count; many of them were here because they had a lot to say and they wanted to be heard. And to learn from others. That\u2019s exactly the sort of environment where the woman of my dreams could be lurking. Not that I had any serious faith in that possibility, but I could at least imagine it. It wasn\u2019t out of the question. I contacted people. People contacted me. I established both friendships and relationships. And I lost or caused the end of friendships and relationships. It was both beautiful and painful at times. Just like life is supposed to be, I guess.But that elusive woman I dreamed of failed to materialize. 3 years had gone by and I hadn\u2019t found her. I still enjoyed being on Quora, but my cynicism and bitterness had started to return. I became more and more convinced that I either wasn\u2019t fit for relationships, even online, or else Quora might not be the place to look for them. I was 43. Desperate and needy. Pathetic. Out of options. Depressed beyond belief.There was no one for me. There couldn\u2019t be. I wasn\u2019t worthy. And then she found me. She just showed up one day. Out of the blue.There was no profile picture to look at, but I was immediately intrigued by the way she introduced herself and let me know the reason for why she\u2019d contacted me. She didn\u2019t beat around the bush. She\u2019d read my answers and could relate to them.So much so that she\u2019d actually opened a Quora account, just to be able to talk to me. Being bitter and cynical, I thought she might be a scammer at first.I\u2019d had to deal with them in the past, and they often appeared out of nowhere, just like her. But she was different. Very intelligent and funny. And she knew what she was talking about. There was no pretense about her. She actually had read my answers with great interest, and the way she spoke about things I\u2019d written, it was if she could see right through me. Almost from day one, we could finish each other\u2019s sentences.That had only happened with my best friend back at school, and even then,we could only do that because we sat next to each other every day for 9 years. With her, it took a couple of days! I was amazed. And also a bit scared.Who was she? How did she know me so well? How come I never got bored with her like I did with most other people? How was she always able to read my mind and say what I wanted to say and the things I\u2019d never told anyone before? It felt like I\u2019d found a soul mate. A twin sister. We started talking. All the time. And after several months, we\u2019re still talking. All the time. And I still can\u2019t get enough of her. As an introvert, my instinct has always been to withdraw. I don\u2019t like having other people around. They drain my energy, just by being there.I prefer to hang out in my own little bubble where I can do what I want, whenever I want, without others telling me off for doing so or forcing me to pretend to enjoy their company. But with her, I felt energized and full of hope whenever we spoke.7 years of therapy and too many antidepressants couldn\u2019t achieve what she did for me by simply laughing at one of my stupid jokes. And even more impressive, she made me laugh! For years and years, friends would complain about how stiff and boring I was for not laughing at their jokes, and I always felt embarrassed about that because I wanted to laugh. I just didn\u2019t think they were funny. But she was. She was a master of surprising me with plot twists and punchlines I could never see coming, and I fucking loved it! That\u2019s what I was looking for. A woman who thought like me and could relate to me.I tried for a long time to fit in and be like others, but that didn\u2019t work.If \u201cthe one\u201d existed at all, she\u2019d have to be like me: Insecure, patient, empathetic, intelligent, opinionated, funny and a bit naughty, etc. And she was all of that and so much more. But apart from being very similar people, what really tipped the scales for me; what truly made me know that I\u2019d been found by \u201cthe one\u201d was a few very important things. She showed me her artwork. She\u2019s a brilliant artist who paints some of the most impressive stuff I\u2019ve ever seen. And she\u2019s also humble about it and would probably hate it if I praised her too much. But I\u2019m very picky with the art I like, and her work impresses me. I\u2019m very proud of her.As a musician, I always hoped I\u2019d find a woman who was artistic and creative.She accepted me the way I am, because she\u2019s the same. I didn\u2019t think that could be possible, but no matter how much I tried to \u201ctest\u201d her with questions and suspicions, she instantly blew away any such notions by being absolutely real and straightforward with me. And I respect that.I could be vulnerable with her. When we met, I hadn\u2019t truly cried for over 20 years. I held it all inside and bottled it up. But I found that by being kind and understanding, even when I was behaving like a complete shit, she brought the tears out of me. I couldn\u2019t stop it from happening.Her words were therapeutic and comforting, and I wept like a baby.I haven\u2019t told her this, but it was a cathartic experience for me.My therapists always had a box of tissues if I needed them, but I never did.Letting someone else see me crying would be the ultimate loss of face, I thought. But with her, it just happened naturally. It felt right.I cried. She cried. We cried together. And it was lovely.I like her courage. She claims to be no braver than me, but she was the one who found me and approached me. She took all the difficult steps.And I think that\u2019s so fucking cool that she would do that when society so often tells us that it\u2019s the man\u2019s job to woo the woman.I wish more women would approach first. It\u2019s great. Especially for cowards like me.I like to talk. A lot. It\u2019s not easy for me to find people who can keep up with me, but when I like someone, I like to talk with them. And most of them give up on me or get bored. She doesn\u2019t. Or if she does, she\u2019s kind enough to not openly let it bother her.I used to be concerned about that at first because I was afraid that she\u2019d leave me like the others did when I wanted too much of their time, but she can talk as much as I do. About the same things I like to talk about.And if I can\u2019t think of anything to say, then she takes over and we continue.I could go on, but let\u2019s just say that I know she\u2019s \u201cthe one\u201d.She\u2019s the first woman I\u2019ve been interested in that I didn\u2019t awkwardly pursue or desperately tried to keep.She\u2019s with me because she wants to be, and I feel exactly the same way about her. I have something to look forward to now. Every day she makes me smile.She\u2019s put a smile on the most hardened cynic in the world. And for that, I love her. ",
