Whether the words were any good would be another matter. (For awhile, when I was just starting out, I wouldn\u2019t quit for the day until I\u2019d finished a thousand words, then five hundred. Now I\u2019d go with old Ernie, and be satisfied with \u201cone true sentence.\u201d) For most of my writing career, it took me a couple of years to write a novel. That would be anywhere from 60,000 to 150,000 words. Some good writing takes a long time. Some bad writing never ends. ",
