            "answer_text": "0.2 of one million is 2/10 of 1,000,000. You could use mental math. 1/10 of 1,000,000 is 100,000 so 2/10 must be 200,000. Another quick way is to remove the final 0 and the new number is 100,000. To know where to place the comma start at the left and count back 1, 2, 3 comma. To find 1/10 of any number ending in 0 remove the final zero. 1/10 X 100 = 10, 1,000 =100, 1,000,000,000 (billion) = 10,000,000 or ten million. Use multiplication: 2/10 X 1,000,000 = 1,000,000/10 =100,000 and 100,000 X 2= 2000,000. 2/10 of 1,000,000 is 200,000. You could reduce 2/10 to 1/5, but in this instance, I chose not to reduce to lowest terms. It was just as easy to divide by 10, and multiply by 2. However, when you have a fraction as a sum, product, difference, or quotient you need to reduce to lowest terms. Remember OF means to multiply. I prefer working with fractions rather than decimals. If you chose to work with decimals you would multiply 1,000,000 by 0.2 and the product would be 200,000. 0.2 of 1,000,000 is written 200,000. ",

            "answer_text": "0.2 of 1 million is 200,000. So it is 2 times 10 to the 5th power. 2 x 10^5. If I converted it from Base-10 to Base-16, it would be 30D40. 30D40 is a representation of [3, 0, 13, 4, 0]. If I converted it from Base-10 to Base 60, the result would be a representation of [55, 33, 20]. I don\u2019t necessarily have symbols for those. The Babylonians do. Using their cuneform:  Which lines up with the numbers stated earlier 55, 33, and 20.
