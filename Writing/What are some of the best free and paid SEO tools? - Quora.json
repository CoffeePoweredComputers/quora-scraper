            "answer_text": "The Great Tools are given here which are mostly used: 1. Google Search Console: Analogous to BWT (yet much richer), Google Search Console \u2013 formerly \u201cGoogle Webmaster Tools\u201d \u2013 provides data and configuration control for your site in Google. That\u2019s a pretty big deal. For more, check out our extensive guide. 2. Google Analytics: The most valuable SEO data is that which helps you understand your visitors  and how they interact with your site.  No tool I\u2019ve used delivers that data like  Google Analytics, and none of the tools I mentioned does a better job providing data that helps you understand the number that matters most \u2013 the bottom line. 3.Keywords analysis tool : Google Keyword Planner: Google\u2019s Keyword Planner, the tool formerly known as Adwords Keyword Tool, lets you pull monthly Google search query volume estimates for dozens of keywords in seconds. I can never understate the importance of knowing what people search for. Screaming Frog: Screaming Frog is a website crawler designed specifically for SEO. Within mere minutes, you\u2019ll get critical data on every URL. Best to just download it and take it for a spin. Once you see all that data, you\u2019ll have questions. Other Tool: 1. Wordstream: The Wordstream Free Keyword Tool offers thousands of keyword ideas from a huge database of more than a trillion unique searches. This tool outperforms some of the paid alternatives in the market 2. Copyscape: Copyscape is a free plagiarism checker. The software lets you enter a URL to detect duplicate content and to verify that your content is original. 3. Robots.txt Generator: Robots.txt Generator is a freeware utility that makes the creation of robots.txt files a breeze. 4. XML Sitemap Generators: XML Sitemap Generators create \"web-type\" XML sitemap and URL-list files (some may also support other formats). 5. GTmetrix: Having a tool to examine page speed and diagnose opportunities for improvement  is now an essential part of the SEO toolkit. Anything that impacts user-experience impacts SEO, and site speed is a big deal for UX, especially for mobile.we have found GTmetrix reliable and a good balance between thorough and user-friendly. Other page speed tools that are good include  Pingdom, WebPagetest (great visual waterfall), and Google PageSpeed Insights. That last one is especially good.  6. Web Developer Toolbar: The Web Developer Toolbar has become much relied-upon during the technical phase of our SEO audits. 7.SEO Quake Toolbar: SEO Quake shows data on traffic, links, social shares, on-page keyword optimization and more. The SEO Quake website has lots of helpful tips on what to do with all this data. 8. Hootsuite: In 2015, social media is typically vital to SEO success. Hootsuite is one of many platforms for managing social media. I\u2019m not saying Hootsuite is the best social platform, but it is what I\u2019m most familiar with and is plenty helpful for promoting new content and staying on top of opportunities to engage with key influencers. 9. Chrome Developer Tools: \u201cF12\u201d is now the SEO button, because it is the shortcut to major awesomeness built right into Chrome. Some SEO tasks you can do with Chrome DevTools include: examining mobile UX and SEO with the amazing mobile emulator, diagnosing page speed, picking apart source code, examining HTTP status codes, and mocking-up live edits to a webpage (including the title tags and Meta descriptions in the SERPs).

My Favorite SEO Tools isn\u2019t an SEO Tool | AJ KohnDiscover DevTools | CodeSchoolChrome DevTools  Hacks for Digital Marketers | Distilled10: Bing Webmaster Tools: Other Keywords checker Tool: 1. Keywordtool.io:  Keywordtool.io is great for generating a ton of keyword ideas containing your seed term, especially long-tail keywords that won\u2019t show up in the AdWords keyword tool due to having  very low volumes.
