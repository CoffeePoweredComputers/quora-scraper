            "answer_text": "The analysis of one\u2019s handwriting to determine the personality of a person is called graphology. Here are some of the basics to analyse handwriting: Inclination of letters: A rightward inclination from of letters from vertical might suggest that the person is optimistic, more energetic or more success driven. Whereas, a leftward inclination might suggest a more laid-back, relaxing or less stressful attitude. Vertical writer falls in betweenMargin: A larger right and smaller left margin indicates that the person is more attached to the past. Similarly, higher left but a smaller right margin indicates that person is more future driven. Writing with almost equal margins indicate balanced approach in life.Word Spacing: Put the person\u2019s finger between two words. If the spaces between words are lesser than the finger width, then the person might be emotionally more warmth seeking and prefers closer relationships. If the space is more, this might indicate that the person is emotionally more independent.Hope this helps. Thanks. ",
