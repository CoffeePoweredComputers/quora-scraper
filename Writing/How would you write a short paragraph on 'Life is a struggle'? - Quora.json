Then, I\u2019d create six or seven sentences that either explain that thesis or provide examples of struggles, or which present arguments in favor of life being a struggle. Suppose I went up to you and asked, \u201cWhy do you think life is a struggle? How or in what ways?\u201d What would you tell me? Take whatever you would tell me verbally, then write it down. Then go back and polish it for formal tone and proofread. You may be making this task harder than it needs to be. ",
