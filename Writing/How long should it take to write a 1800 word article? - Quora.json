            "answer_text": "How long should it take to write a 1800 word article? How long it takes to write a certain length article depends on so many variables that it is impossible to tell without much more information. Here are a few of the variables: How much and what kind of research I need to do.If I know everything and only need to jot it down, I can do it in one or two hours.If I have to check a few facts on the internet, I can still do it in one afternoon.If I have to read a lot of articles online, and compare them with each other, fact-checking with primary resources such as government websites as I go to be sure which sites are reliable, It might take more than one afternoon.It will take a lot longer if:I have to travel for my research, ordo interviews.What quality of writing is required.If I am writing for a casual adult newsletter, so that I can jot it down from memory then go over it to correct formatting and typos, one or two hours should be enough.If I am writing for a professional magazine it will take me somewhat longer because of the higher quality writing that is required. I will be expected to say more with fewer words.If I am writing professionally for a high/low magazine for people who have high interest but low reading level, it can take me days. The reason for this is that I will have to edit extremely heavily, rewriting many times to say complex concepts in very simple easy language. I have never done this but I\u2019m thinking it may be the equivalent of condensing a 5000-word article into 1800 words without losing anything.Please note: Point two Writing is completely separate from Point one Research. If research takes a week or a month, the writing itself requires a separate schedule. Truth be told, I don\u2019t work in such an organized manner. First, I ponder on topic and decide what basic concept I want to communicate and what approach I want to use to communicate this topic. Then I focus on the details required to make my point. It\u2019s the details that take time to research and fact-check, even travel and interview people for. The thing is, the details are the foundation of the concept. If the foundation is not sound, then neither is the concept. Some might say I work backwards. So be it. It\u2019s how my brain works and it works for me. Each writer has to find what works for them. Some people can read and write twice as fast as I can and produce just as good content. Their answers to this OP will cite much less time for the same product. To answer this OP: There is no \u201cshould\u201d about how much time it takes to write a certain length article. If you are the publisher, the correct question to ask the writer is: How much time do you think you will need to write this article? Before you ask that question you will have stated your expectations for the finished product. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on the kind of article and the amount of knowledge you have on the topic. Someone who is an expert might crank out a rough draft in a day and after sleeping on it give a quick edit and be done. Seymour Hersh, in his autobiographical book Reporter, said that he always did a lot of reading first. I myself like to internalize the material before I spit it out in my own words. I once wrote an article about article writing in which I compared it to making chocolate chip cookies. First, you gather all your ingredients, then you mix them, then you bake. In other words, do not bypass the preparation phase. ",
