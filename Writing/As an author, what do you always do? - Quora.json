Some of the most memorable secondary characters in my Peryton series had what I planned to be \u2018spear carrier\u2019 roles: like in a cartoon opera, march in, ground your spear, say what i taught you to say, then turn around and walk out. Instead, they marched in, grounded their spears, said what I told them to say\u2026 but then looked around, thought for a moment, sat down on the nearest chair or bench, crossed one ankle over the other knee, laid the spear across their lap, looked me square in the eye, and said, \u201cI like it here and I\u2019m not leaving. So deal with me.\u201d I had no choice; they would not negotiate and could not be bullied or shamed into leaving. And what great characters they became! (Yes, Melanthus, I\u2019m looking particularly at you.) ",

Yes, I research. But writing is the only absolute must-do for any writer. I know very successful writers who aren\u2019t on social media, don\u2019t attend conferences or conventions, don\u2019t do book tours, don\u2019t promote. But they all write. Maybe some write fast, some slow, some every few years \u2026 but again: it comes down to having put in the work. ",
