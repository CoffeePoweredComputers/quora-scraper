It did get me in trouble once\u2026 One time, during a visit to Chicago, I went to see the Sears Tower. (Now the Willis Tower, I think?) Well, the lift to the observation deck, or whatever they call that tourist area on the 125th floor, was not free\u2026 in fact, it seemed unreasonably expensive. Why should I pay, just to get to a lookout point that wasn\u2019t even on the top floor? After all, all buildings have stairwells, right? Yep, they do! So, up I went\u2026 Being 18, young, indestructible, and Oh so clever, I gleefully bounded up the stairs 2, 3, even 4 at a time. Since I was an avid biker at the time, my legs were in pretty good shape, and I don\u2019t think I bothered to slow down until about 15 minutes later. Every 4 flights up, there was a closed fire door, and I discovered that opening those doors had an interesting vacuum effect as I progressed higher, creating quite a windy updraft! Great way to cool off\u2026 46 minutes later, I reached the 125th floor. Pleased with myself for avoiding the charge for the lift, I grabbed the door to enter the observation deck. Locked. Uh-oh! Not just locked, but a high-security lock with an electronic combination keypad. Ummm, nope! So I went up a few flights\u2026 Hey! Normal locks on these doors\u2026. no problem, easy to pick. I pulled out my lockblade knife and easily opened the door to the 128th floor. All business offices and such, but figured I\u2019d have a look around, and maybe see if I could get to the roof\u2026 I didn\u2019t realise that all those locked doors from the stairwell had silent fire alarms\u2026. Ooops! It didn\u2019t take long for security to grab me, and police were called. The security chief and responding police officers seemed pretty amused that I had climbed 128 flights of stairs, and decided that work-out was probably punishment enough. Whew! I got lucky\u2026 28 years later, older and wiser, with compressed discs from too many parachute jumps, I\u2019m perfectly content to take the stairs one at a time. But, whenever the Sears Tower comes up, I think back and smile\u2026 ",
