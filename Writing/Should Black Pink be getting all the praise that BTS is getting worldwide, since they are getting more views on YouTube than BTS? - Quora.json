            "answer_text": "Um no. BTS deserves it more to be honest. I\u2019m definitely ARMY, but I still think that based on statistics and I\u2019ll tell you why. BTS is getting lots of praise worldwide because it came from a small company and it\u2019s now a whole new Kpop sensation, and it\u2019s the most iconic and arguable the best and definitely the most famous Kpop group in the world. They also have a variety of music from a rock or punk style in their beginning albums to things like boy with luv and DNA now. They have won 200+ awards, and their choreography is amazing. Their lyrics are also very meaningful. I don\u2019t know Korean but I\u2019ve seen the lyrics and English, and they\u2019re not all centered around the same general love, breakup idea. They also have to do with self worth, flexing lol (in like Mic Drop and stuff) and other stuff like Go Go. They also have new stuff like black swan that are more chill but have a great tune and everything. Yes, they have love, but even their songs about love are more meaningful. They have accomplished way more, especially on Billboard with their best 100 artists and songs and everything. They actually worked for their fame and they deserve it. Also, they\u2019re known in every corner of the world, while many other Kpop groups are not. Now, onto BLACKPINK As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve probably heard before, blackpink came from one of the big three, so it didn\u2019t really have to work all that much for its popularity. Also, many people have literally learned about blackpink because they noticed BTS first. I\u2019m still in middle school, and I can tell you firsthand, you see BTS EVERYWHERE. People have BTS merch and stuff all the time. The same doesn\u2019t go for blackpink. Also, many people say blackpink\u2019s style is unique, and they\u2019re not wrong, it\u2019s definitely interesting and different from the Kpop norm, but their songs are so so similar. Not only are they always centralized around the same love breakup topics, their tunes and everything are so similar, and moreover they have like what 13 songs? BTS has waaaaayyyy more songs and some don\u2019t seem nearly as closely related as blackpink\u2019s do. Like if you listened to Danger or No More Dream, and then listened to something from one of their Love Yourself albums, you might not even realize they\u2019re from the same artist. Whereas blackpink over here, at first I couldn\u2019t tell the difference between Kill This Love and DDU-DU-DDU-DU. And they made a big deal about how some songs like Kill This Love had hard choreography\u2026.no\u2026.just no\u2026.BTS\u2019 choreo is waaayyyy harder and they don\u2019t make a big deal out of it and you can tell it\u2019s harder they\u2019re like fainting and all after they do DNA and stuff. Also as for what you\u2019re saying about them having more views on YouTube, well obviously they will if they have 13 songs. Also, YouTube puts pauses on BTS MV\u2019s views. They don\u2019t do that for blackpink you can accidentally hit a BLACKPINK song and the view will count. And BTS was the first to reach the 1M, 10M and everything in 24 hours. They broke Taylor swift\u2019s record for fastest to get 1M with fake love. Also there is much more hype with BTS. Everyone is excited for Map of The Soul: 7, which is their new album. Problem is, BLACKPINK has like one album so a new album isn\u2019t that much of a thing\u2026.Also if you count all the listeners BTS has many more. And lets talk about their stage performances. Not gonna lie, blackpink sound like dying horses on stage. Like i know BTS doesn\u2019t have the strongest vocals out there, but they are hardly dependent on auto tune. They sound pretty good onstage. Like Jungkook\u2019s voice is flawless. My girl Jennie over here somehow managed to be a vocalist but she lipsyncs in award shows and everything. BTS sings in award shows and concerts with their hard choreo and all. So considering all the reasons above, blackpink doesn\u2019t have good reason to be get much more praise. Also the favoritism towards certain BLACKPINK members is completely unfair. Like what\u2019s so special about Jennie? Lisa\u2019s a better dancer than her, Jisoo and Rose have waaaayyy better vocals, and her rapping isn\u2019t anything special. Someone please get Suga over here for a sec. Jisoo is the one member who sounds somewhat like an alive human onstage, her vocals are actually good but she is so underrated. Jennies the only one with a solo and blackpink doesn\u2019t even write their own songs and BTS does, and still manages to make their lyrics better. This could honestly go on and on so I\u2019m just gonna stop now, hope this didn\u2019t sounds too biased I tried to not put too much personal opinion into it. ",

            "answer_text": "I personally love BLACKPINK, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a hard stan. Mostly because, while I love their personalities they\u2019re still pretty new and have hardly any songs out. They\u2019re still finding their identity, and sound. Those are the only reasons that have kept me from hardcore stanning BLACKPINK. Anyways, consistently BLACKPINK doesn\u2019t recieve more views than BTS. It appears that they do mostly because of the way YG markets their MV\u2019s (which if you ask me their marketing schemes are bs). Okay please no one get butthurt, this is just my opinion, let\u2019s proceed. Most of the views and recognition BLACKPINK is getting internationally sprouted from BTS. BTS has made their debut in America and has became a very big deal internationally as well, that\u2019s how most people got into the Kpop world and discovered BLACKPINK (ahem me). All those YouTube reactors you see, where do you think they started to stan BLACKPINK? From BTS. Bangtan started to promote a lot more in the USA and got big, people started to react to them and fans wanted more and told them about BLACKPINK, then the girls began to grow their popularity internationally. BLACKPINK became so popular internationally mostly because of their: visuals, vocals/rapping, fashion, and overall charismatic hip hop image. \u2014 Okay no more skipping around the bush, let me answer this question. I love BLACKPINK..but like honestly all the praise their getting just is too much, I just think they\u2019re a bit overrated. A lot of it isn\u2019t their fault, it\u2019s mostly YG who treats them like trash (yes that was shade YG). I mean these girls debuted in 2016\u2026it\u2019s literally 2018 and they have only 9 songs out and not even a full album. Sure YG promised a cb in the winter but he\u2019s known for his empty promises. Like just do your job right and manage them properly please and thank you, we\u2019re tired of this. Also can we talk about Ros\u00e9\u2019s voice? While I do hate the crap she gets for her voice being unstable or whatever, I do see where they\u2019re coming from. Like don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Ros\u00e9\u2019s vocals in the group, but COME ON. Have y\u2019all heard her original singing voice?? It\u2019s much healthier for her, much more stable, and overall has a unique and deeper tone to it. I seriously believe it could add so much depth to BLACKPINK. If only YG would stop teaching her unhealthy techniques that require her to damage her voice, I mean doesn\u2019t it remind you of the whole Britney Spears thing?? BLACKPINK have worked very hard, and they\u2019re extremely talented and do deserve all the praise and love. But some, let me repeat this because some of you will still come at me with \u201cnot all blinks are like that\u201d, SOME blinks don\u2019t really know their place. They compare BLACKPINK to Girls\u2019 Generation, or Twice, even BTS.. like was that a joke? BTS has gotten a lot more praise, they\u2019ve been around longer and have had to work twice as hard (as they are from a small company) to be where they are now. You can praise your favorites, but don\u2019t get ahead of yourself this early in the game. I\u2019m a BLINK, and the girls are very talented and have potential to be even bigger and are already off to an amazing start, but let\u2019s just take things a bit slower and let them experiment with their music more. So yeah that was my opinion, and I stand by it. Thanks for the request, hope this helped :) ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I do have a lot of friends who are Black Pink fans and though I'm not a hardcore fan, I still listen to their songs sometimes. In terms of fame if they are recieving more views that BTS, they are becoming more popular. My favorite American dancer/choreographer Matt Steffanina even made a choreo to Ddu Du Du. So I guess Black Pink and even other kpop groups such as EXO probably also will or do deserve the same praise. I think another factor, that may sound a little sexist but is in no way meant to be, is that generally girls fangirl more easily and more passionately than guys. Because BTS and EXO have male members, non lesbian girls may support these groups as a celebrity crush situation. The percent of lesbian girls is pretty low compared to straight ones, so statistically you can see why male groups are getting more recognition. Regardless, Black Pink is very talented and have an amazing fanbase just like the BTS ARMY. It all comes down to the fans. If you want them to win awards and such, doing your best and voting will surely help them out. Hope this helped! Again, nothing in this answer is meant to offend anyone gender wise or the LGBTQ+ community. I support all genders and sexualities! EDIT: I definetely understand that youtube viewd have nothing to do with talent. Another fact I'd like to address is that Black Pink and other groups have ridden off of BTS' success which is partially true, but no matter how they gained fame a support, they have. Black Pink's fans love them for who they are, so maybe it just took more marketing strategies for people to get to know abou them, but it does not make people LOVE them. ",

            "answer_text": "No. When BLACKPINK's MVs come out, YG puts them in the People & Blogs category for a few days before moving them to the Music category, while Big Hit puts BTS' MVs straight into the Music category. If I remember correctly, for videos that are in the People & Blogs category, you only need to watch a few seconds for a view to be added to the video. In the Music category, you have to watch the entire video for your view to be counted. tl;dr: BLACKPINK's views are manipulated. BTS's aren\u2019t. Additionally - and I don\u2019t know how often this happens - YouTube deletes and freezes views. They deleted 10\u201320mil from BTS's ON, and froze the views on IDOL for 24 hours without adding those views after the freeze, meaning about 30mil views were lost (both incidents were caught on camera, so it's not just ARMYs making shit up). Some have said a few million views were deleted from BLACKPINK's new HYLT MV, though I haven't found any recordings of it so I'm yet to find out whether it's just some BLINKs making shit up. Add the lack of evidence to the fact that YouTube has never deleted or freezed views on a BLACKPINK video, and that that the alleged deletion is only being claimed by a few people with no uproar by the fandom at large, and I'm inclined to believe it's just some BLINKs making shit up. Full offense, but this is partially why I don't stan BLACKPINK anymore. It's not the girls' fault, of course, and I don't have any bad feelings towards them (the same can't be said for the many BLINKs who hate Jennie \ud83d\udc40) but YG is a(n) [insert expletive of your choice here]. I'm just so tired of the repetitive, meaningless, nonsensical songs, terrible management, and view manipulation. The incident with Lord Ganesha\u2019s statue hasn't even lowered my opinion of the company because it was so low already. Waiting to see how badly YG handles it. To any BLINKs who want to send hate in the replies: Do as you wish and say as you wish. I have my opinion, and you have yours, and both are equally valid so long as they're equally informed. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Blank Pink hasn\u2019t received more views on YouTube than BTS. While the girl group has seen recent success on YouTube, that is mainly attributed to the fact that their company posted their video as an ad, so even when people were streaming BTS videos, the Black Pink video would show as an ad, which would then count as a view. It should also be noted Black Pink has used metadata like \u201cBTS\u201d to attract more views. BTS and their company has never used such marketing tactics. Also, BTS could never ride on the tails of Black Pink like Black Pink has ridden on the tails of BTS\u2019s success because Black Pink hasn\u2019t had any global success up until this point. In fact, you can\u2019t even call Black Pink\u2019s success \u201cglobal\u201d yet. BTS definitely paved the way for other Korean groups, moreso than any other group has in all of history. So to answer your question, Black Pink deserves praise for their hard work and any good work they put out into the world. But BTS has earned more praise and success than Black Pink ever will - they worked for it, they didn\u2019t use their videos as ads, they didn\u2019t steal metadata, they didn\u2019t ride on coattails, nor did they use sexuality to boost views. BTS earned their success fair and square. At this point, BTS is the most popular musical group in the entire world, garnering more support than even global leaders like Beyonce and Taylor Swift. So I don\u2019t think Black Pink can yet be compared to BTS\u2026 they just aren\u2019t in the same category. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, both groups are amazingly talented and are very popular. If you look at it in a marketing way, its very different how they approach fans. Both companies are doing it for the money and its no surprise. Blackpink\u2019s company, YG Entertainment goes the way of \u2018starving\u2019 the fans so when BP comes out with a new show or song, everyone gets hyped up because they never basically come out of any content, and then BLINKs would stream that song repeatly while their waiting for a new comeback or something. So when they stream, they break big records and basically makes a name for Blackpink. As for BTS, they do it a whole different way, instead of \u2018starving\u2019 ARMY\u2019S, they in fact come out with tons of shows, behind the scences, movies, albums, etc but still earn lots of money. Both ways are very effective; oh and PS Blackpink music tends to be more of westerners taste and not really Koreans taste. All in all both groups deserve the fame but if BP is allowed to produce their own songs and stop being controlled by THAT EVIL YG, they would show their true sleves and maybe people would hate them least. I\u2019m very sorry if their is spelling or grammar mistakes lol, or if it doesn\u2019t make sense or I got some imformation wrong. Feel free to disagree to my opinion cause I don\u2019t really care lmao. Also if you think I\u2019m being bias, I am a Ex Blink ( I was a BLINK for like a year or two) and I am currently a 8 month ARMY. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if they should get the praise as BTS does, but they are totally different. One of the praises that BTS received is that they care about the society in all kind of ways, and that includes their lyrics for a bunch of their songs and their general concept of HYYH, Wings, You Never Walk Alone and Love Yourself series - which, is absent in Blackpink\u2019s songs, so probably it\u2019s a \u201cno\u201d for the first answer. By the way, getting more views doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they are better. I find many so-called unpopular groups who have a lot fewer views have better songs and concepts than the so-called hits or popular ones. For example, BTOB and Gfriend definitely excel BTS and Blackpink in terms of vocals and dances respectively. (*BTOB is truly always stable in during live performances as compared with BTS and BP, while Gfriend is always in sync - when dancing normally, random play dances, 2x, 2x random, and even when their eyes are covered) ",

At the end of the day we have more things to worry about rather than views and likes and followers. Both groups are successful. But does that mean a group with 14 songs should get all the praise? No. The girls are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo talented yet the entertainment company treats them like garbage. Literal garbage. People need to understand that no one cares about how many views you have. People are having to worry about more thing like COVID-19, The Lebanon Explosion, A recent plane crash and so many things. Beating records, Getting views, having a 200 million + fanbase. BTS has been there done that. so no I don\u2019t think so. YG is literally trash. ",

Korea(it contribute to 4.8 billion dollar to the country which is much hight than what the biggest Korean airlines bring to the country) they are recognized by the south Korean president him self, UNICEF, BLM, and many other things. I am not saying that bp os not doing anything it's just than bts is the biggest artists and influencers from south Korea and one of the biggest in the world. Both are great so crazy fans don't come at me. Peace out ",

If you think YT deletes BTS views it is really not BP\u2019s fault. BP is getting consistently rising views since they are more popular in both genders in Asia where fans are die-hard streamers. Also, BP has achieved more popularity in China after Lisa\u2019s Youth With You appearance. BP has a lot of casual listeners (not blinks) who wont bother buying their album but would freely listen to free content from youtube. Also, you don\u2019t really have to be a Blink to jam to BP\u2019s songs and their songs do not require a lot of theorizing/analysis. Does this make me shift from being a blackjack to a blink? NO. 2NE1 is irreplaceable in my heart. ",
