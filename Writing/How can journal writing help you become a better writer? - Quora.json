            "answer_text": "Although I journal for the therapeutic benefits, I also use it to improve my writing and creative skills by changing up the style or approach.  Sometimes I will write in the third person instead of the first. It\u2019s like having a newsperson reporting live from my psyche and commenting on the current conditions. Or I will experiment with different voices instead of writing down my thoughts as I hear them in my head (this is different than hearing many different voices in your head, which often calls for therapy more extensive than journaling.) For example, I might express my thoughts through the voice of a British dandy or a Texas rancher or Jerry Lundegaard from Fargo. Usually a journal entry is a random collection of what\u2019s going on in life, but every now and then I\u2019ll take a single topic and present it as a story with a beginning and an end.  So yes, keeping a journal can help to improve your writing skills, if you want it to. But you can get the therapeutic benefits of journaling by simply jotting down disjointed sentence fragments, and I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with that. I hope this helps. Dan ",

            "answer_text": "The first and foremost quality that needs to be possessed by a writer is 'observation'. Looking around you isn't enough. A writer needs to pay attention to the most minute details, that one might-at first glance miss it.   Sometimes we might not have ample time to take in our surroundings. In such cases, those events become a part of our sub conscious memory.  They don't quite fade away, but they aren't crystal clear either.    Journal writing is nothing but recording your day to day activities by writing them down.This sometimes helps you revisit those buried memories, extract them from your brain and analyse them!  While writing the happening of a particular event we are recounting the order of events, identifying the role players in it and assessing their reactions to their surroundings.  And in writing them down from our perspective, we inadvertently add in a few details of our own. These may or may not have happened,  but our brain remembers these from some other past event and merges them with this memory.  And voila! You have already woven a story in your mind- which makes you an almost-there-writer.  The very last step now is to put it on paper.  With a little command over language and with this power of observation mingled with the \"urge to pen it down\",  you, my friend, are a writer!!  And if you don't have a command over the language- DON'T PANIC- because an average human's thoughts are so sharp that their flow itself makes words tumble out of their own accord.  All you need to do is think. Close your eyes. Go back to whatever it is that you want to write about. Once you are in that state, let yourself slip into it. Your mind will do the rest.   You will begin by writing half baked stories which don't even appeal to you,  but as you keep going there will be a significant change in your style of writing. You will notice the fluidity of words which are in perfect harmony with the sharpness of your thoughts.    It won't happen immediately, but it will definitely happen at some point of time. And soon too!  -Hope this helps you. Thank you. ",
