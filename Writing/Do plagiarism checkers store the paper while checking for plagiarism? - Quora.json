            "answer_text": "All plagiarism checkers have different policies of their own. Turnitin and other top plagiarism checkers have been accused of storing people\u2019s data. Here is the list of plagiarism checkers that store the paper: Turnitin: It includes papers and also shares with other people and companies. It writes in their terms and condition, you give them exclusive right for it (Not recommended for individuals)Viper: It saves papers and sells them to third parties. (Not recommended)Grammarly: This grammar and plagiarism checker saves papers but DOESN\u2019T SHARE with anyone. (Recommended)Plagiarism checkers that don\u2019t store your papers Plagiarism Checker X: It is a multilingual plagiarism checker that is safe and powerful. It doesn\u2019t save your data. (Recommended if you don\u2019t need Grammar checker)ProWritingAid: This is a plagiarism checker and grammar checker that is also not interested to save your papers in the database. It doesn\u2019t have an attractive interface like Grammarly but it\u2019s better in performance (Recommended)There are maximum chances that if there is a free plagiarism checker it must be saving your paper. Because there is no other reason to create a free plagiarism checker. Developers and owners need to money. This is why free tools are not recommended for academic purposes. ",
