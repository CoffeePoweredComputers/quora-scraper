Make a note of the main idea (or ideas) in the text. 2.  Rescript that idea into more simplistic language. 3.  Minimise my new text by editing out any irrelevant ideas or words. 4.  Be sure that I have accurately represented the opinion of the original author. 5.  Check to see that I have correctly cited my source if I need to.   ",
