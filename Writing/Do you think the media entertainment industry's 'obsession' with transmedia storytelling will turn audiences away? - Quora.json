            "answer_text": "I had to actually look it up to even know what it is. So I\u2019m not sure the entertainment industry is as \u201cobsessed\u201d as you say. There are definitely things like the Marvel or DC comics that have the IP expressed in comics, movies, toys, cartoons, digital TV series, etc. If that\u2019s what you mean, then \u2026 I don\u2019t see that changing, and I certainly don\u2019t see it turning audiences away. I\u2019m not aware of any kind of storytelling that requires you to follow the story from one platform or delivery mechanism to another \u2026 like a film that gives you only part the story, then you need to watch the TV, then read the book, to get a full picture. Often these things are there but additional. So the film, TV show, and book are all full stories, just complementing each other. Not sure how that\u2019s bad. ",
