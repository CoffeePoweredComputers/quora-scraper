            "answer_text": "Do you know who you are? There is something in our genetic psyche that causes us to be unfulfilled, to search for more. It is there to feed us, to protect us and to cause us to procreate. That same piece of our id can cause us to be self-destructive. If you are trying to suppressive parts of you those parts will rise to the surface and influence your decision making. You have to be true to ALL of you. Find outlets for the self destructive parts. I know a doctor that had horrible eating habits and would binge eat after trying to diet. This doctor knows there are certain foods that they crave, chocolate being one of them. So everyday, at the end of the day the lock themselves in their office. Take out a small box of chocolates and spends 20 minutes in a ritual choosing and enjoy a piece of chocolate. When making trips out they take time to but chocolates to add to that box. It may sound silly but they can now control their eating habits and choices much better because they can focus energy and thoughts towards that 20 minutes of their day. Something to look forward to, something positive to think back on. Something that feeds a desire they were trying to suppress. Is their a part of yourself you are trying to repress and can you give yourself a few moments in your day to enjoy that things without being destructive? JC ",

            "answer_text": "Let's think about it again \u2026 The stuff what goes into your mind is what defines you but you cannot express everything to everyone or even one. And that is normal. Being satisfied in your own skin and not able to express that to others is still OKAY.. Believe me it's okay . It's all the game of perception. If you want to make yourself liked by others and you keep on making efforts on this then you will always struggle to be yourself. So leave this and be okay in being you just you ! No outer reflection ! No outer judgement ! Just do some things that make you happy. Make yourself happy all the time. This is a full time job. And then I guess that inner perception of yours will automatically form an aura of your own. And then you won't struggle to be urself.   :) ",
