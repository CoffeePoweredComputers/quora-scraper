            "answer_text": "You need to ask yourself is what you want to write. Off the top of my head here is what you can do: Books? I\u2019ve read that its very difficult to sustain yourself in this line. You just can\u2019t seem to sell enough books even if you\u2019re a decent writer. Unless you have independent income this might be hard to sustain. Articles? You can always start-off as a content writer but the hours are long and pay is mediocre at best. Blog? This works if you find a niche (something you\u2019re interested in) and can build up a dedicated audience. Initially, it can be discouraging. Medical content? There ought to be a space out there for people who can create medicine-related content whether it is books, articles, blogs, proof-reading or ghost-writing. If I were you this is the space I would look to get to. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you can definitely become a good writer, but why to wait for completing MBBS . Start to narrate the fire within you , your experiences , your medical exposures, sentimental experiences that you have came across while studying on a paper right now and you will have books compiled when you complete your MBBS. You can start following Aakriti Jha a student from MBBS on Quora.She is a cool writer and may be provide you a better guidance. ",
