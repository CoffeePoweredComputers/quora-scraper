            "answer_text": "Build a strong, loyal, and engaged community around your blog! You don\u2019t need a lot of money, you just need to be active and build relations without being spammy.  Basing on my experience as the online marketing manager I have compiled a list of good practices which let you grow traffic on your website. I shared it already in a few answers, but it\u2019s constantly growing.  Here\u2019re my best tips to increase traffic by building and engaging community (only easy to provide, and affordable things you can do to stand out from the crowd) Post regularly - it is a must! People like to know that they can regularly read something new on your website. Keep it alive!Write an e-book, do a webinar, organize an online course, a live session - it\u2019s always good to give something to your audience. They will repay with love, shares, and engagement. Also, it let you create your own personal brand as an expert, and this is priceless!Build a database of e-mail addresses - this way you would be able to stay in touch with your audience. It\u2019s a good idea to give them something for subscribing, for example, an e-book :)Use social media - find places where your target audience is active, set up a fanpage, g+ profile. Instagram, Snapchat or Twitter account. But choose wisely and be there where your audience already is to meet them instead of wasting time and trying to get them there.Share your posts on social media. Use your fanpage and personal profile. Share posts on groups for bloggers or thematic groups (check terms of the group to ensure that you\u2019re allowed to post links to your own blog).Implement social buttons on your website and articles - it makes sharing so much easier, and people just like to use them. Use one of the available plugins; it\u2019s quite easy.Don\u2019t forget about CTA! - Like post! Subscribe! Follow! Leave a comment! Sign-up for a newsletter! (Upvote this answer if you find it helpful! :) ) At the end of your blog posts and social media, posts put some call to action and encourage people to share your posts.Say thank you!- react to every single share of your content on the internet. Like, comment, say thank you, engage in conversations. It\u2019s so easy and let your readers know that you are grateful, care about them and their opinions.Engage - engage in online conversations relevant to your blog posts on the internet. Share your knowledge, make people like you, and share links to your articles. Share their posts and content related to your topic, it\u2019ll pay you back!Cooperate - with other authors, bloggers and experts. Find influencers in your niche, talk to them, engage them, collaborate. This way you can reach their audience and let them reach yours. Win-win! #protip The best way to track mentions on the internet is to use some tool which will constantly monitor the web for you instead of searching manually through the internet and all social media channels. Here the great help for you would be an application for real-time internet monitoring and analyses called BRAND24. It gives you instant access to all public mentions on the internet and allows you to track and engage in online conversations relevant to the topic you\u2019re interested in. The tool shows you in one dashboard mentions from all over the web, from social media to influential publishers. Thanks to this you can track shares of your blog posts, mentions about you and your blog, join and engage in conversations. Also, due to analyses, you can find inside the dashboard you could find influencers and authors with the biggest social media reach, so you will know who to cooperate with. Start monitoring now, try a free trial and see how beneficial it\u2019d be for you!  I hope I helped!Thanks for the answer request! ",

You will look natural and very helpful,Use Reddit as well but again ovoid submitting URLs with zero added value . You are always looking to be helpful and seem natural at the same time.\u2026. There is still a lot of other things you can do to promote your content and still look professional instead of looking spammy. . Good luck with your online business! ",

The key to quality traffic lies in getting information around relevant people, rather than spamming everybody. Join social media groups related to your niche. There are plenty of groups in Facebook and Reddit on virtually every niche. Answer questions related to your niche in Quora. Make an impression that you have a good amount of knowledge on the thing you\u2019re writing. If people who are in need of help know that you are a pro in your field, they\u2019ll consume all your content. That\u2019s how you get quality traffic. I hope this helps. ",
