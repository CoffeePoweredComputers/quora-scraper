            "answer_text": "Narrow your focus to a single aspect of gender inequality such as gender inequality in the workplace, in child rearing, in pay for equal work, or some other aspect before you start your research. Look for something that will allow you to find some good solid statistics. Activate your curiosity. See what the statistics actually prove. Look for variables that could confound your findings. Be objective about your sources and correct for bias. Use that interrogation to find your thesis statement. Write your paragraphs based on your findings and make 3 to 5 points. In conclusion, briefly summarize what you have found. If it were me I would keep my opinions out of it. It's an essay, not an editorial. It should be an interesting project. ",
