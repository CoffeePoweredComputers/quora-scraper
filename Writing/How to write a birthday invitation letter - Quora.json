            "answer_text": "I would think that making it simple would be a good way to have it understood but you don't need to have a celebration with other people really. There isn't any point in using up your time or money on something like that. Why bother to celebrate a day, have a party/gathering i mean, when it's just another pointless thing for a moment which won't matter the next day or worse, which has no lasting enjoyment. It's a black hole that will destroy any money you put into it and will only ever leave you feeling cold and tired when you think back on it. Think about how much you and others have spent both in time and actual money in the past. You have nothing to show from your past actions. Another use of the time and money would be to actually find out who you can trust and whom are your enemies and then ensure that even after you pass on, those enemies are dealt with and haven't gotten away with what they did.
