            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know. I think that IQ is a very poor way to assess intelligence, though. To have an idea about how smart Wallace was, you can simply read his works. There\u2019s a good chance you will be overwhelmed by the grandeur of their structure and texture. Wallace was able to develop extravagant plots with literally hundreds of characters, without reducing any of them to clich\u00e9 and making the reader really feel for them. And his command of the English prose is arguably unsurpassed. To me, this amounts to the highest score in verbal-linguistic, logical-mathematical and inter-intrapersonal intelligence, more than any IQ assessment. ",
