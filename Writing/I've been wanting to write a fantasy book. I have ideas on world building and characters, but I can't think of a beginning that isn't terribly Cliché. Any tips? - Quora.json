            "answer_text": "I've been wanting to write a fantasy book. I have ideas on world building and characters, but I can't think of a beginning that isn't terribly Clich\u00e9. Any tips? Fantasy is especially difficult to start because of difficulties in describing the setting. So first off, try not to beat yourself up too much about having trouble with the beginning. There\u2019s a lot to juggle! You have to introduce the readers to the setting in such a way that they start to get an idea of the \u2018rules\u2019 of your world (if there\u2019s magic, how pervasive it is, etc.) as quickly as possible without immediately bogging the reader down with lengthy descriptions. Tip One: Think about an initial conflict. It doesn\u2019t, and probably actually shouldn\u2019t, tie into the main conflict, but it can begin an internal conflict for your main character. Let\u2019s say that the main conflict you have in mind is a war between humans and dragons. The temptation might be to start with a prologue where a dragon attacks a village, destroying it, and then you start chapter one elsewhere with your main character. It\u2019s a decent start and shows off your world and the main conflict, but readers of fantasy hate \u2018restarting\u2019 a story. Even very good prologues tend to annoy readers. But let\u2019s say that your character isn\u2019t involved in any of the exciting war stuff. Won\u2019t it be boring by comparison? No. Remember, readers fall in love with characters, not just the world. And the thing that helps make characters well-rounded and interesting is an internal conflict. Creating an internal conflict isn\u2019t about tacking on a random flaw. I can spot a random flaw a mile away. Alcoholism is a typical one. Aside from getting occasionally blackout drunk and comments from concerned friends, there are no consequences to the tacked on alcoholism. No pain, no disability, no one looking down on them, no struggle to stay sober nor any struggle to get people to leave the character alone and mind their own business. It\u2019s made pretty and occasionally provides some slapstick humor. That\u2019s not good enough for an internal conflict. A good internal conflict is difficult to overcome and deeply impacts the character\u2019s life. It\u2019s present on page one. Whether it\u2019s single parenthood suddenly becoming harder than ever, poverty that\u2019s taken a turn toward homelessness, or promotion to a job where everyone wants you to fail, a good internal conflict ratchets up tension without becoming melodramatic or cliche\u2019, provided that you don\u2019t express it in the first way you can imagine. So let\u2019s go with the alcoholism because that\u2019s so overdone and so often badly done that I can\u2019t possibly come up with a fresh opening using that, right? Well let\u2019s see about that! The \u2018easiest\u2019 thing is to take someone who\u2019s at rock bottom and really show the suffering. But there\u2019s nowhere for that conflict to go but up, and it\u2019s pretty clich\u00e9. I say, let\u2019s start with the character believing they\u2019ve finally gotten a handle on things. They\u2019ve sobered up and been sober for two weeks, they\u2019ve cleaned up, and they\u2019ve even convinced their uncle to help them one last time even though the uncle has given up on them. Please, please loan me your armor and sword, and I\u2019m going to go get my old job as a guard back. OMG I want to write this story now, LOL. With this awful disease, the inner conflict for the character will never go away. And that\u2019s sort of a beautiful thing, because hey, series! But even if you don\u2019t write a series, you can choose whether the ending will have the character return to the well, probably never to resurface again as a poignant down note to an otherwise yay yay joy joy happy ending (happy endings are always more awesome if there\u2019s a big price to pay for that ending) or as an up note to a tragic ending\u2014there\u2019s reasonable assurance that this character\u2019s sobriety will last, and so in a way, there\u2019s hope for some sort of tolerable future. And of course there\u2019s the delicious black out drunk at the dark night of the soul moment in the story, perched there to consume the character completely if they give in to it. You can go light, of course. In the Dragon Prince, the dire world circumstances are kept on the somewhat light side by making the focal character\u2019s desire to be a real wizard both heartfelt and full of youthful hope. Though the \u2018I want to be a wizard\u2019 has been done over and over and over again, I\u2019ve been engaged in that story purely because the characters come across so legitimately young and innocent enough that they don\u2019t realize how hard a thing they\u2019re actually trying to accomplish. Nor do they think about the potential consequences other than what\u2019s directly under their noses. Awesome! The trick to going lighter as opposed to dark (which is my tendency) is about the perceived stakes from the character\u2019s pov and/or the reader\u2019s pov. The kids don\u2019t know any better. To them, life or death is campfire stories and some heart-racing moments when they face off with creatures that we as viewers deep down know won\u2019t hurt them. To an adult, life or death reaches much farther, deeper, and higher into the soul because adults have more experience and understanding (presumably) and they often see that life or death is not just about them. And with adults, we\u2019re less assured that somehow things are going to come out okay. I\u2019m talking about genre expectations now, not real life, btw. In the vast majority of fantasy books, kids and animals are off limits except for the dark night of the soul. For adult characters, they have a target on their back and the reader senses that. To sum up: You can craft the character\u2019s perception of the personal stakes carefully to adjust the tone of your opening, and the whole book. You can also have the personal stakes be specific to the character to lighten the load. Potentially losing the Millennium Falcon would be devastating, and yet at the end of the day it\u2019s just a ship, right? Potentially losing the people on the ship\u2026that\u2019s higher stakes stuff. If in your heart you think about the worst thing that could happen and then think noooooooo that\u2019s usually really high stakes stuff. If your reaction is \u2018oh, that would be so sad!\u2019 that\u2019s usually lower stakes. And you can have those opening stakes be reasonably low. The higher stakes stuff will be generated by the main conflict, not the opening. Why? Because it\u2019s easier to make those stakes seem really, really high after we really, really care about the characters and the world. Now, for the setting: My biggest tip, and probably only reliable one, is to involve the setting in the opening as if it\u2019s a character. I\u2019m not just saying that because Tolkien rocked it. You can actually go a bit farther that Tolkien and have that setting be antagonistic toward the character in the opening. A classic is the adventure opening where there\u2019s a car chase or a chase through a marketplace. The type of obstacles and how many obstacles bring in loads of world elements without having them pointed out seemingly at random as if your character is some sort of tourist. And if they are a tourist in a city where they don\u2019t speak the language, hey, now they\u2019re really paying attention. In fact maybe they aren\u2019t a tourist. Maybe they\u2019re stuck in this new place, barely knowing the language, which adds to the conflict. But more usually the character begins somewhat in their element. So you have an option to make their surroundings act on them in a new way that forces them to think, to engage, to push back if necessary. There\u2019s a bridge collapse. How the character, and the people around the character, deal with getting across the river with the bridge out will tell the readers loads about the world. Maybe the character is out of money for food. How that character finds a meal, or perhaps only thinks and discards ideas about how to find a meal, also tells us loads about the world. For just about every question you have about opening a book and how to make it not seem clich\u00e9 involves crafting seemingly mundane conflicts that reveal the character and world in action. That may be actual action-action, or more generally protagging, even if it\u2019s to accept a mysterious card delivered by a little girl who can only say that some strange creature dressed in shadows handed it to her. (And don\u2019t dismiss the little girl. She might be dirty and scared. Heartstrings officially tugged! How will the character respond to her? And how will that character feel if she runs away when they offer help? Maybe they can run into her again later\u2026because she might be a perfectly good supporting character. Or not.) I hope this helps! ",

I wouldn\u2019t suggest not to write a book. Just write the first chapter. When you start the book will write itself. And then if you don\u2019t like first chapter come back and change it. Just write anything. Book I am writing now I started with first chapter which I already changed twice. And I still don\u2019t have prologue. I\u2019ll write it I finish the book. Don\u2019t over try with the setting. Do your best to introduce your main character the best way you can but still without revealing everything. And my opinion is that the first sentence is the most important one. Even if it is Cliche. It was 2002 year when I read Game of Thrones and first pages of prologue were missing. And the first sentence I read was \u201cThe others made no sound.\u201d It\u2019s been 17 years but I still remember that. And to this day I think it\u2019s better opening than the actual one and It\u2019s pity to me that George R. R. Martin didn\u2019t stated it that way. You can start with some baddass phrase (even if it\u2019s cliche) and then it will go on it\u2019s own. Next thing you know you\u2019ll already have first act. I think this way: forget all rules and what others say is wrong or right. If you objectively think it\u2019s good regardless of rules then most likely it is good for everyone else. Just start your chapter. Rest will follow. ",

Legend has it that Hemingway tossed the first few pages of his novels, perhaps the gem you would be looking for that would begin the story would be found some paragraphs or pages after the first beginning. All first drafts are crap. Think of the scene of Hermione\u2019s parents finding Harry\u2019s dead parents on the island after they failed to escape Voldemort. You don\u2019t remember reading it? It\u2019s because J.K.Rowling wrote it, but later cut it out. J.R.R. Tolkien is the only writer I know of who kept his first sentence: \u201cIn a hole there lived a hobbit.\u201d He\u2019d already started other manuscripts that touched on times prior, and we don\u2019t know what those first sentences were. Just start writing. You can always go back and change it as many times as you feel the need to or your editor suggests. Or you can start in the middle if you can\u2019t figure out how to start the story. Or at the end and work backwards. Best wishes. ",

The point of the beginning is to hook the reader onto the story so that they keep reading, thats the most important part. With the book that I am writing, I started with a major plot point, somewhat similiar in style to The Maze Runner when Thomas wakes up in the large metal box. That scene I feel is a major plot point or turning point to the story. Don't forget that you can always rewrite the starting. I have probably rewritten my beginning about nine times before I was reminded that if I keep rewriting that I would never finish it. Even now I am slightly unhappy with my beginning, but if I keep writing my book, I pretty sure that I can come up with a starting to the story that I would be happy with. Good luck :) ",
