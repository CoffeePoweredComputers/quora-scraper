            "answer_text": "You specifically mention CNET, PC World - I think that if you're talking about an editorial story in a reputable magazine it is extremely unlikely that money would change hands directly. (Not because companies wouldn't be willing to pay, but it would undermine the credibility of the publication which is pretty much their entire value). There are a million possibilities between completely earning editorial coverage and bribing somebody to write a glowing review, though. Here are a few ways people can influence reviews: 1) Hire a good PR company. A normal one can get you on a journalist's radar; a great one can call in a favor which may in fact be a good review.2) Distribute evaluations freely. This one is tricky - if your product sucks it's just going to end up getting you second or third-tier press which isn't going to really move the needle. If you do manage to land a major press hit for a crappy product you will start getting organic reviews soon which won't be so positive.3) The best way to pay for good reviews is to spend the money on product development. Building products is a lot easier said than done, though, and I think usually good product development costs more than 1 & 2 which explains a lot of the products you see on the shelves today :) ",

            "answer_text": "Great question!  Unfortunately, companies giving \"incentives\" to customers to write 4/5 star reviews is very prevalent. Companies use a number of tactics to get great reviews including hiring review writing companies. It is also widely believed that yelp \"filters\" out bad reviews for companies that purchase ad space on their business pages.  In terms of online products, many \"reviewers\" with links back to the product page to \"PURCHASE NOW!\" usually get a percentage of the sale if it is traced back to their \"review site\" ",

            "answer_text": "There could be companies doing this. In this age and time, viral marketing is a much more effective strategy than traditional strategy. The best part about this is that you definitely won't know if the review is a \"paid for\" review. I would think that such marketing strategies apply more to the mid-low tier of the competition though, since most large companies have sufficient fan base or marketing departments to create the hype. In any case, it's probably better to have take any review with a pinch of salt, since individuals have different tastes. ",

Many reviewers get preferential treatment by companies, by getting invited to closed events, VIP presentations, seminars in exotic places and sneak previews, etc. it makes the reviewers feel special, being part of the inner circle and people who companies \u201cconfide\u201d and \u201c trust\u201d. Often it is a win-win situation as the reviewers are early adopters who provide vital feedback to the developers and contribute to creating better products with desired functionality, etc. ",

Some examples of these are cosmetics, beauty aids and devices, restaurant food quality, jewelry, completely service based industries such as massuers, fortune tellers, and pseudoscience products claiming miracles.
