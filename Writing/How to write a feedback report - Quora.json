            "answer_text": "Sample reports like this tell employers so much more about the potential employee than whether or not they are capable of performing the task of writing a report. Report writing\u2014especially when considering feedback about a product, a retail purchase or dining experience\u2014usually comes with an entire set of rules that tend to be specific to each individual client\u2019s way of doing things. General things to remember are also the most important. Above all else remain objective in your evaluations. Stick to reporting facts and backing them up with observations. Unless specifically asked, do not include anything subjective in nature\u2014in other words this type of report is seldom interested in your feelings or opinions. The reports I write most often are for service industry companies (restaurants, bars and casinos for the most part) and a report typical of my experience might go something like this: I arrived at Joe\u2019s Bar and Grill at 7:13 PM on Friday the 18th of June and was immediately greeted by the hostess, named Gretchen. She was approximately 5\u20327\u2033 in height, had shoulder-length blonde hair that she wore in a pony tail, green eyes and a nose-ring in her left nostril. Gretchen was wearing the standard Joe\u2019s Bar and Grill uniform consisting of a black skirt, white blouse and black necktie. Gretchen made eye-contact as soon as I entered the establishment, greeted me by saying, \u201cHi! Welcome to Joe\u2019s, I\u2019ll be right with you, ok?\u201d She maintained eye contact until I indicated I didn\u2019t mind waiting and after thanking me, she turned her attention back to the telephone that I didn\u2019t realize had been on HOLD when I walked in. At 7:20 PM a gentleman standing approximately 6 feet tall with a shaved head, metal-rimmed eyeglasses and a dark brown goatee leaned into the waiting area from what I thought was likely the bar and without looking away from the television screen above the bar asked me (I thought) if I wanted a beer while I waited for, \u201cGretch to stop her yacking.\u201d I was unsure if the gentleman was an employee because he was wearing faded blue jeans that were fraying at the cuffs, black motorcycle boots and a blue T-shirt, the sleeves of which had been removed. Unsure if who he was or to whom he was speaking, I hesitated but before I could ask him to clarify, he mumbled something I couldn\u2019t understand and returned to the end of the bar where he sat on a stool that was situated even with the bar itself\u2014neither behind it where I might assume he was an employee, nor on the \u201ccustomer\u201d side of the bar where one might assume he was simply an overly-friendly patron. While I\u2019d offer this as a very basic example of objective report writing, I can tell you as someone who uses these assignments when deciding which candidates I might offer a position, almost automatically I will end up hiring the person that took the time to ask me to specify exactly what my needs and expectations were for this project and then repeated them back to me. THAT very small trait is more memorable than the most perfectly written report you can imagine because that candidate took the time to show me the importance he place on making sure he understood my needs and didn\u2019t presume he could read my mind.

Something like this: Approach I was asked to review your digital channels and so I approached it by taking each in turn and applying the following tests: What was the content? Was it informative? Etc Results Here are my findings: Channel One Strengths Improvements Recommendations You could probably have a conclusion section and sometimes it is better to put that at the top so that they know up front what you think of them.

            "answer_text": "I think the best idea for that is using a complex survey tool.
