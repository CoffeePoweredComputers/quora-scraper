            "answer_text": "You could earn your first income from freelance writing in as little as 2 months. Be on an income generating roll. But then, you could have it all dry up and find yourself as broke as you were before you started! Here's my story: In the month of July 2016. I heard a lot of \u2018noise\u2019 on various internet forums about a platform where virtually anyone with or without experience could write, and earn a minimum of $5 - $10 per article. And even \u2018as much\u2019 as $150 - $1000 per project. Initially, this interested me but, I ignored it! Living in Nigeria and earning $150 per week wasn't something you could easily scoff at. Oh, no! It's not. To put things in perspective, $1 back then was about =N= 350. It's higher now. Besides, I was broke, and this looked like a lot of money to me. To the average Nigerian earning =N= 30,000 per month. $150 a week is a lot of money! But, I had my doubts. Enter smart internet marketer. Let's call him John. I stumbled upon John's ad about how simple it is for anyone living in Lagos, to earn $300 - $500 a month using his \u2018proven system'! Side note: ads work. They are so insidious, and appear innocently on your feed. Using your browsing history to \u2018assault\u2019 you with targeted ads. And that's why I have a love/hate relationship with it. Telling you this ad interested me, would be putting it mildly. It hooked me! So, I happily gave out my email. John, didn't bombard my inbox with his offers. He made me imagine I could earn in dollars. He spoke to my fears. My inhibitions. He assuaged my doubts. And everyday, he wore down my resolve just a little bit. I began to believe that I, Princewil Enyioma Nwandire. Could reside here in Nigeria, and earn in dollars! Without working directly with any MNC, or \u2018traveling abroad'. I was sold on John\u2019s idea. So, I bought his course. He called it \u201cDollar Advantage\u201d. I shelled out =N=5,000 for this course. And I did it happily. Heck, I'd have gladly paid =N=10,000! And what was the course about? How to create gigs on Fiverr using existing knowledge you had or were curious about. That's it! There was one other bonus attached: how to become a self-published author on Amazon and Draft2Digital. His emails made it appear simple. It\u2019s official - Fiverr profile went live in August 2016. That, my friend was how I became a seller on Fiverr. Offering 500 word articles, blog posts, SEO writing and Amazon kindle book description writing services. I found out that it wasn't easy. Because it was a hustle just to get my first buyer. And I took writing late in the night to a whole new level. Delivering carefully researched, plagiarism free articles. When I saw the first $4 on the dashboard, it surprised me and gave me hope! It showed me it was possible to earn money online. This tidbit, fuelled my resolve. Looking back I wish earning on Fiverr, was simple. But it is though, don't get me wrong. It's simple, but it requires hard work, creativity - you could easily expend on your digital business outside Fiverr - and plenty late nights working to have orders delivered on time, every time! This, I'm sure you'd have noticed, is not sustainable. Using John\u2019s system - which I later found out, could be easily found for free on Google - I got my start through Fiverr, worked late into the night so I could deliver several orders on time. Nevertheless, I started earning regularly in the third month. Irregular power supply, the quest to please my buyers and the PAIN But due to irregular power supply in my neighborhood, and the power company's unreliability to supply power when needed, I began a daily 10 minute commute to Renny's Fast Food in Oyigbo, Rivers state. I'd buy two meat pies, and one Fayrouz. Why, you ask? So I could charge my laptop and work in peace without being hassled to leave or buy something. Eventually, I and the bar-tender Sunny. A fair-skinned, (in Nigeria, we\u2019d say \u2018yellow complexioned\u2019) jovial millennial became friends, and I could charge my laptop and work for as long as I wanted. Pretty neat eh? During the weekends, I and my friend let\u2019s call him Charlie would drop in on Sunny. Gist, drink beer and throw funny jibes at each other. Emboldened by my first gains on Fiverr, I stumbled upon a few writing blogs. So, what did I do? I followed them. In January 2017, I signed up on Sean Ogle's Location Rebel - Lifestyle Business Strategies for Beginners. Mind you, it's free. I signed up for other newsletters, read, re-read countless blog posts. Each of them in very clear, and strong terms, condemned writing for a content mill. Blog posts like how this writer built a 5 figure income, 110 websites that pay writers and earn your first $1000 challenge helped open my eyes. I finally began to see the relationship, a sort of correlation between the professional services I offered on Fiverr - mind you, for very low pay - with services other freelance writers were offering on their own outside the Fiverr platform. So how much did I make from Fiverr? I made enough to pay for a hosting on Siteground, enough to pay for internet subscriptions for months. Enough to pay for three logos which cost me about $137. But, I ran into a problem. Lost $114. The money just vanished! And couldn't withdraw my income on Fiverr - I still can't withdraw any of my earnings. But I found an expensive, and time consuming way around it. Disheartened by Fiverr By March 2017, I had grown tired of the late nights of working to deliver orders on time. Tired of the $5\u2013$10 gigs not being commensurate with the effort, and value of my services. I became disillusioned. So I began to wonder if Fiverr was really the right vehicle for my freelance writing success, or whether I should quit the whole thing and rest! By now, the competition on Fiverr had gotten stiffer. Orders, if at all they came, were far in-between. So I followed Bamidele Onibalusi's challenge for freelance writers quoted above. I had nothing to lose. I'd be honest here, I hadn't launched my website brownstreamdigital then. So, not having a website was a bit of a problem. Because having a professional writer website, was part of Bamidele's strategy. But, there was another option. Not guaranteed, but potent nonetheless. I went with the second option. What did it involve? It involved creating an about.me page. I did. You can check it out here. Attached it to my twitter profile. I followed this up by updating my twitter bio, stating that I was a writer for hire. I paused all my gigs on Fiverr and that was how I halfheartedly launched my content writing business. We want to hire you to write for us One fateful morning in. Late in the month of May, 2017. I check my email, and I see this \u201cStanley Cooper SEO agency wants to hire you\u201d. I was inclined to write it off as SPAM. I see it was sent in response to my hire me page on about.me, we sent about 17 emails back and forth - don't laugh, back then, I was still a beginner - before we finally settled on a price. He agreed to pay me $40 per article, and $50 for emergency weekend jobs. I made about $870 from this one client in June. If I knew what I knew now, I\u2019d have landed three additional clients. How much do you think I'd have earned? Unfortunately, to pay me, he needed my PayPal account. But PayPal users in Nigeria can\u2019t receive payments, they can only make payments. Or buy things online, we cannot be paid with PayPal. So what did I do? I remembered a childhood friend, who currently resides in the States. I reached out to him on Facebook, and asked him if he had a PayPal account. Yes he does! I do a dance of joy, and carefully explain everything to him. Telling him to rest easy, it's not advance fee fraud or other internet vices that Nigerians, unfortunately have become known for! \u2018No it's not 419.\u2019 \u2018No, I didn't dupe any Oyinbo man o.\u2019 Yes, it's a legit business. \u2018No fear, I no go put you for trouble\u2019 - By the way, that's pidgin English and it means: \u2018have no fear, this won't get you in trouble'. I knew he was going to accept, but you really can't be sure. I'd be the first to agree, I got lucky. And it showed, because I didn't land another client after Stanley Cooper. Why? Good question. I didn't prospect for clients consistently.I didn't pick a niche to market. I was more or less a generalist writer.I didn't show clients the value my writing would add to their business. e.g: increased traffic? Better ranking? Increased engagement and conversion?Amidst all the writing I did on Fiverr. I couldn't use any of them as social proof of my expertise and the businesses I've worked with. Why? On Fiverr, you are a ghostwriter, that's why! Ghostwriters command better pay. But proficient writers inside the Fiverr landscape don't know that.So that's my story. Not all, but a part of it. This answer is already way too long as it is. So, what you need is a system you can follow. A system that can position you as an authority in your niche, and land you regular work with clients whose needs, are an EXACT fit for your skills and expertise. I'm currently on course to earn my first four figures in February 2018, I'll update this answer afterwards! Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "This is one of those \u201cHow long is a piece of string?\u201d questions Jessica. The answer is\u2026it depends. Firstly, it depends on the individual freelancer. It depends on the quality of their writing, their experience, their knowledge, and their personal qualities. It also depends on their other freelance skills, such as their ability to sell themselves, find a USP, stand out amongst their competitors, and pitch to clients. Secondly, it depends on the freelancer\u2019s network. If they have a strong network and are already fairly well-known, then they might start making money straight away. But if they have no network, then they might spend time establishing their reputation, cold calling or cold emailing to get leads, and sending hundreds of pitches before anyone takes notice. Thirdly, it depends on the kind of work they want and what they consider to be reasonable pay in exchange for their skills. I\u2019ve seen writers start earning immediately if they\u2019re willing to take any job for any pay. I\u2019ve also seen writers take a year to earn any money because they\u2019d rather spend their time pitching for better clients. Neither are right or wrong. Finally, it depends on what you consider to be \u201cmaking money\u201d. If you\u2019re interested in a freelance side hustle to gain some pocket money, then potentially that might not take long to achieve. But if you want to earn enough to quit your 9-5, then it will most likely to take time\u2014months or even years of building your client base and freelance reputation. ",

            "answer_text": "Freelance writing isn\u2019t a get-rich quick scheme, and there is no definitive answer to how fast you can start to earn money. There are a lot of methods to become a freelance writer, but without any prior writing experience, you\u2019re going to have to prove the value you can provide a client. If you have experience, and work diligently to find positions, then finding work matters on how many clients you can present yourself to. The fastest way to put yourself in front of clients seeking out writers, will be to sign up on freelance websites like goLance. On these sites you can create a profile, upload a portfolio, picture; everything. Once completed, clients will be able to search for you and offer positions directly to you. You can also submit proposals for any open positions. goLance is free to use, and only charges a small commission from earnings. As you continue to use freelance websites, you\u2019ll start to find more and more positions for writers. When you submit a proposal, ensure that every proposal is unique, and you fit the needs of the client. Once you start landing gigs and collecting reviews, you\u2019ll start to become more demanded, and therefore find more work. Patience and perseverance will ultimately become the most beneficial for you in the long-run. If you treat freelancing like a part-time income, it will pay accordingly. If you treat your writing as a career and continuously pursue every available writing position, then eventually you will be able to live solely on your writing income. I hope this helps. ",
