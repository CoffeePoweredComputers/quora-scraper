            "answer_text": "Season five of The Wire is the weakest in my opinion. Every season of The Wire is great, but season five was the only one that wasn\u2019t an all-time great. The newspaper storyline was the weakest of the series and the Jimmy McNulty \u201cserial killer plot\u201d was a bit silly. Seasons one, three, and four are some of the greatest seasons of television ever made so they\u2019re definitely not the weakest. I can\u2019t believe some people think that season two is weaker than season five and the worst of the series. I thought season two was an underrated masterpiece and almost just as good as seasons one, three, and four. That season made some big changes to the show, but the dockworkers storyline was great and the story couldn\u2019t have been told any better. Season five is the only season of the show where I noticed some weak points. ",
