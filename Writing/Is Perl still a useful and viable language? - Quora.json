            "answer_text": "I think all programming languages are useful, just like all tools are. Perl is a grassroots technology and it doesn\u2019t have the gigabucks backing it that other languages do. It was made for administrators and so wasn\u2019t widely known to end users like Python. Perl has some nice features and the syntax is very clever That being said, working in Perl these days can be a lonely road. The IDEs are pretty much all abandonware, which means the development community is shrinking or at least not getting bigger. I met a fellow at work who I consider a friend. Very intelligent, very technical too, introduced me to Perl. He was one of the Perl Monks. Today he\u2019s mostly writing puppet scripts, calls Perl \u201cThe COBOL of my generation\u201d ",
