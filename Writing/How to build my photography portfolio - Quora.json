            "answer_text": "You have a couple of issues here. The short/easy answer to building your portfolio is to keep shooting as much as possible, and only save your very best images to your portfolio. People will assume that your least impressive image is your standard/average image, because everyone gets lucky from time to time (your greatest image). I\u2019d strongly advise against trolling for photography clients on Craigslist! Most of the people searching Craigslist are looking for cheap (or free) stuff. What exactly are you wanting to shoot? Model portfolios? Executive portraits? Your portfolio needs to show what you want to shoot. If you shoot and show senior portraits then you can\u2019t expect executives to hire you based on those images. If you want to shoot model portfolios then you\u2019re in for a tough road. Way too many people are willing to shoot pretty girls for free. Family portraits? There are plenty of people who will do a photo shoot if they don\u2019t have to pay for it. Provide a free 8x10, and if they really like them then let them purchase additional prints/files. Editorial work? Contact local magazines and offer your services. Until you have some good portfolio images to show it will be hard to get people to pay you. My advice is to shoot some free stuff to build good images, then show those to the people you want to hire you. And that really depends on whatever type of photography you want to do. ",

            "answer_text": "So you might be wondering, how do I make a photography portfolio? I\u2019ve created many photographer websites in the past. It\u2019s easy to see them now and cringe. Because of that, I decided to write a post that will help you learn from my mistakes. This is why we asked experienced photographers from our community for their most essential tips that they would have loved to know, once they stepped foot into the photography market. What is a portfolio? How Many Shots Do You Need? A portfolio is an opportunity for you to present your work, but it\u2019s important to consider why you need this portfolio. Are you going to use it to apply for a job? Do you want to use it to start your own photography business? Or do you just want to exhibit your work? Present Like a Pro Your portfolio website is nothing but a presentation, so when creating it, refer to some iconic presenters like Steve Jobs for better results. BLACK PHOTOGRAPHY PORTFOLIO Don\u2019t use images that need an explanation Remember that image that you fought through rain, debris, and all kinds of obstacles to shoot? Don\u2019t include it simply because it was a challenging photo. Share it if it is a great photo, but don\u2019t include it in your portfolio if you need to explain just why that photo is so great. The best photographs will speak for themselves. If the wow reaction only comes after an explanation, don\u2019t include it. ",
