The narrator is me, older and looking down on it all wondering if all the emotion if worth it.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve actually almost always identified myself with characters in my story. I feel like it gives my characters the depth and emotion that readers love. Identifying yourself with a character allows you to put yourself in the character\u2019s shoes and just use your own experiences and past to shape the character. For example, one of such characters is named Ying. She\u2019s bubbly and fun but there\u2019s another side to her which people don\u2019t often see. Being someone who\u2019s a happy pill most of the time, I think people get this impression that my life is all fairytale and joy. Life goes on, I\u2019m innocent and naive. But, I think people don\u2019t realize that I\u2019ve gone through A LOT of hardships, been cheated, lied and backstabbed before. The reason why I\u2019m happy, though, is because I don\u2019t remind myself of the bad times. I remind myself to move on. Creating Ying and using my experiences as a backstory for her really allows me to make the story more realistic. She\u2019s not a \u2018perfect\u2019 girl. Being happy doesn\u2019t mean being \u2018quirky\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "This is Astor.  Astor is a personification of the darker side of my personality. I think all writers identify with all the characters they\u2019ve created on some level, but Astor is specifically meant to be a self-insert. I\u2019m not even sure where to begin with him. Astor began as one of many personas that I adopted inside my head. Being a writer, I tend to see the world through the eyes of various characters, but every couple of years there was one who I identified closely with myself and made into a kind of internal identity. Astor was originally just a slightly edgier, cockier version of me. But Astor had a mind of his own. For one thing, I didn\u2019t name him. He told me his name, firmly. I decided very little about his appearance \u2014 I think his violet cat eyes were the only thing I actively chose to give him, and the black hair and pale skin were a given. But I didn\u2019t decide to give him long hair, even though now I couldn\u2019t imagine him without it. I already knew what he looked like before finding the above image, and so far, the above image is the most spot-on one that I\u2019ve come across. That\u2019s pretty much exactly what he looks like. Astor is basically a concentrated embodiment of all the aspects of myself that, at some point in my life, I refused to acknowledge. I associate him with my Shadow archetype in the Jungian sense (although obviously he\u2019s a combined Shadow/animus). When I was first building Astor as a character, I thought that arrogance was the root of all evil (and proceeded to lose all my self-confidence as a result), so Astor is completely full of himself. He is a prince and likes to be worshipped by his subjects. I find it impossible to simply relax and enjoy my life, so Astor is hedonistic, indulging in every sensual pleasure of his palace. I was uncomfortable with my own sexuality during the first half of puberty, so Astor is carnal and licentious, and an incubus-like nocturnal creature that seduces women. In my mid-teens, I was a complete rebel without a cause, obsessed with the idea of free will and individualism. Astor is a tyrant, delighting in subjugation and domination. Throughout the last decade, I\u2019ve had to work through all of these individual qualities and become comfortable with them. The version of Astor that I\u2019m writing has some redeeming qualities to balance all that out. I\u2019ve given him my sense of empathy. His character arc is based around his fear of his future responsibilities as king, and his genuine desire to be a good king for his people without collapsing under the stress. He\u2019s still an anti-hero, and his appearance and mannerisms evoke the most stylish and decadent of villains, but he\u2019s a better person than he gives himself credit for. Writing him has helped me to learn more about myself and embrace the darkness within. He\u2019s absolutely my favorite character I\u2019ve ever written, and by far the most personal. I love him so much. ",

Scholars say the farm was the model for the Van Tassel home in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Apartments begin at 500,000 and there is no pool, no sauna and no tennis court, just a magnificent lawn with a WW I monument. I live above it in a prewar co-op. The main character of my latest novel Blooded in Sleepy Hollow has the Catholicism Inleft begins. I envy her strong swimming ability but not her conscience. Her husband creates video games for a living and seems like fun. I think well-created characters are too complex to be emulated. There would always be a downside.

Described as an \u201cimposing, scar-covered man,\u201d who was \u201cbald, and clear, blue, predatory eyes.\u201d Raptor certainly fits the bill for a soldier of fortune. But he wasn\u2019t always a mercenary and Raptor isn\u2019t even his true name. Raptor was a criminal whose life was spared when he was finally caught. Most people wanted to see Raptor dead after his capture but mysteriously he only had to serve a relatively lenient sentence for his crimes. Once he served his time, he decided to start working as a mercenary under the alias Raptor. His bravery and \u201cit is just business\u201d mentality caused him to be known as \u201cThe Merciless Eagle\u201d. I\u2019m nothing like Raptor. Growing up, I didn\u2019t have a father figure until I was in high school. I was cowardly, meek, and risk-averse. In my life, I always looked up to my coaches and the chefs I worked under as they pushed me out of my comfort zone and encouraged me to take risks. Before The Adventurer and Raptor part ways, Raptor says something that made me believe the characters in books can truly come alive. \u201cI can see it in your eyes, kid\u2014- you really are after something, aren\u2019t you? Something to make you feel alive? That\u2019s what everyone wants. For me, I\u2019ve wanted to feel alive all my life. The only times I do are in battle, when I\u2019m bloodied and close to death. In those moments, fighting for my life, I feel truly alive. Between those moments. I\u2019d be better off dead. I\u2019d prefer my life to be like the brilliant strike of lightning, rather than the long, untroubled burning of a candle. Lightning, while fleeting, is exciting. It burns gloriously and leaves all who see it amazed, stupefied even. I look at a candle for the same fleeting moment after lighting it, and that is it. No wonder, no exhilaration. It may burn for an eternity but what does it matter? Go out there and live like lightning, kid.\u201d Raptor embodies a lot of what I wanted to be when I was a kid. I wanted to be brave. I wanted to be able to take risks. I wanted to be able to do awesome, once in a lifetime things. But For a while, I was too cowardly. Too weak. While I don\u2019t want to become a bounty hunter or warrior now, I have been blessed to have teachers in my life that have pushed me to take risks and chase after my goals fervently. Live like lightning. I don\u2019t believe I wrote that, in a sense. It is just what Raptor said while I was writing and without a lot of what he embodied in the novel, I probably wouldn\u2019t have written it in the first place. Thanks for the A2A. \u201cSo, you finally built up the courage to tell me to stop, huh?

            "answer_text": "I made a character who was a princess in a fantasy kingdom based off of medieval France. It followed her through her childhood into her adulthood to when she manipulates the political system to take the power from behind her weaker husband with the help of her advisor. When she\u2019s an adult, she has a much stronger character than me - I don\u2019t see hardly any of me in her. When I wrote out her childhood scenes, though, I took a lot of it from stories that my family members would tell me and from what I remembered to create her character then. Having no children of my own, sometimes I struggle to write children characters and they end up being extremely mature for their age. So, I made her what I had been - a spoiled brat. She throws tantrums, she berates her servants, her tutor smacks her at one point when she goes overboard, she breaks things, and she\u2019s just an unholy terror. (No, I wasn\u2019t THAT bad, but exaggeration often has a better effect.) When she\u2019s a teenager, she\u2019s incredibly dramatic, naive in her perception of the world (much like many teenagers are), and impulsive to a fault - much like I was as a teenager. Besides that, though, at her core, she is her own character and entirely unlike me. Her growth and her experiences are some that I, as a common pleb, would not go through. I wanted her to grow from tragedy in the male-dominated political system, which is how her character develops to be so strong and intelligent in the future. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course. In fact, I believe most writers begin creating characters through their wish to be someone else. One of my first characters-or at least, the ones I spend many time and effort in creating-was a girl in my novel Drifting Around: a novel that I'm still writing. Hailee Morgan was a fearless, fearsome creature. Unafraid to do anything she wanted, couldn't be caring less about what people said about her. I had-and still have, sometimes-problems with minding too much to other people's opinions and thoughts about me, which leads me to be afraid to do so many things I want to carry out. So I put the reverse personality that I so wished I had on Her. Aside from the not-caring personality, Hailee also had the ability to wield words right back at her opponent, causing the bully or the critic to shut down. This was another one of my wishing personality. I am a good writer, but a poor in-the-moment speaker. I absolutely sucked at making my points to someone, or standing up for someone, even myself. But Hailee could say the right works at the right time and fight back people just the discreet way that seemed not like provoking. Apart from all these, Hailee was also very good at skateboarding, a dream I could not accomplish because I lived in a third world country which did not have the right type of streets and equipment to skateboard. I used to skateboard well when I lived in London, but now I had to move back in Bangladesh. So combining all the points, I wouldn't wait to trade places with Hailee in a heartbeat. I really wish she existed. ",

Too many characters and for too many reasons for me to get into fully, but I\u2019ll try to give one or two examples. The main character of one story I\u2019m writing, who has the alias of Vegas (I haven\u2019t settled upon a name for him yet) is one that I identify with only to a limited degree. We have some common aspects, but mostly he is everything that I could have been had I made the opposite decisions in a number of circumstances. The best way I can think to describe it is the episode of Futurama where the characters meet alternate versions of themselves. While they look very similar, most of their differences came down to decisions that were made by tossing a coin. So with Vegas, he is essentially the \u201ctails\u201d side of the coin, and I am the \u201cheads\u201d side. If I had called tails, I would be Vegas, and if he called heads, he would be me. Then there\u2019s Mako Kirisaki, another character from a very different story. I identify quite strongly with him. We share similar protective instincts, we have similar levels of tenacity, we have similar tendencies to isolate ourselves from other people (albeit for different reasons), we each get dumped with burdens that weigh heavily upon us. There are other similarities too but this answer\u2019s pretty long as it is so I\u2019ll stop there. ",

This is also where we deviate from ourselves into traits that we do not ourselves have. So, I have a primary OC in some of my writing who wears jeans and t-shirts and boots and has a primary residence in the same state I live in, all things I like. And the character is female. There the resemblance ends as she is also a talented covert agent bound to the earth goddess \u2026 Yep, total fantasy there. <laughter> Other characters care about some of the things I do: equality in the world for everyone, not being racist, education for people, etc. But, they are not me and I am not, save for getting them out into the world, them. <chuckle> ",

It was much easier to write when I just had to figure out what they would do, and move forward from there. Obviously I changed them slightly, made them what we wished we could be if we were in that situation. Part of me still, as I write, want to be my main female character. I think I write main characters similar to what I would want to be. That or I would just love to live there lives. But I think that's kind of the point. I write stories that I would want to read, that I would want to be the heroine of. I\u2019m trying to branch out and work on other character types, but it\u2019s actually rather difficult. ",

Moira is a genius in her job, but she\u2019s highly bipolar. And although I\u2019m not in the least attracted by her bipolar disorder, what seduced me of Moira is her nerve, tenacity, focus and grit when she wants to achieve her goals. In the early chapters of the novel where I introduced her, she even risked taking her own life to obtain what she wanted. And she succeeded. I mean in accomplishing her mission, not losing her life, which she kept. She\u2019s ready to go all in when she wants something and no obstacle is too big for her. The flip side of it all, though, is that she\u2019s a mess in relationships, and this is a trait we actually share. So when someone dumps her or does her wrong, she breaks down a lot, and that makes me sad. I feel for Moira. The curious thing is that she shouldn\u2019t even exist in the novel; as a character, she appeared once, in an early version of the current story and was not supposed to be seen again. She ended up being one of the bad guys, even if she played more in the grey zone, so you don\u2019t know if, the next time, she will be helping the MC or kick him in the abyss. ",

We created fictional main characters that represented each of us. My friend's character didn't represent her exactly, but was more of an alternate reality version of her\u2014like what she might be like if she hadn't been raised the way she had. However, my character (Holly) was almost exactly like me. She would experience nearly everything I had, with some exceptions. For example, she had social media (which I don't have), went to a public school (which I don't attend), and had workaholic parents (which I don't have). Holly is now becoming her own character with her own personality, but originally she was almost exactly like me. I identify with a lot of my characters, but I identify most with Holly, because I'm able to relate on an emotional level AND on a personal experience level. ",

There are also characters in my book that I want to be because I write them to be better than myself. Of course, none of them are perfect; they all have their flaws, but they each have their own redeeming qualities as well. Of all of my characters, I would say I want to be the most confident one. She can be a (excuse my language) b*tch sometimes, but she\u2019s loyal and cares deeply about the people she loves. Just as a note, I do give my characters other personalities than my own. I don\u2019t know how great a book would be if all the characters had the same personalities and characteristics (and especially if they all had my personality, there would be no one cool and everyone would never talk).
