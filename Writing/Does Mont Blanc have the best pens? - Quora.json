            "answer_text": "It depends. In the 1950s a Meisterstuck 149 was made of celluloid with a flex nib, an ebonite feed, and a telescoping piston. A modern 149 is made of injection molded plastic mixed with glass, uses a plastic feed and a standard brass threaded piston mechanism. Montblanc pens have changed drastically over the years as they transitioned into being a luxury brand. So to answer your question, Montblanc at one point did make the best pens but now they are more focused on marketing than pen making. If you are looking into getting a Montblanc I would recommend instead getting a Pelikan or Visconti pen instead. ",
