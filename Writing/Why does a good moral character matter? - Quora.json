            "answer_text": "Hello Joseph Angelo De Leon, thanks for seeking my thoughts on the question; Why does a good moral character matter? The simple answer is that leaders with good moral character can build teams, organizations, governments and communities that reflect that character. On the other hand, leaders with poor moral character do the opposite. In a previous Quora answer, How do you identify development of society?, I illustrated the answer with these two frescos.  The picture above is called \u2018Good Government\u2019 by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (c1290 \u2013 1348) Note the prosperity - life is full of activitity. People take pride in their city they are enjoying music and dancing in the foreground. Lots of color. No sign of ostentatious wealth. Minimal sign of ego. God may be present but in an understated way. See how all of these aspects become clearer when you compare this scene with Lorenzetti\u2019s other fresco \u2018Bad Government\u2019.  Note the pyramidal shape of assembled people, God and the angels, then the devil as king, the clergy, nobles and the military with sword and shield at the ready (seated on the right) have a privileged position. And on the bottom, others are depicted as little people living with the dying and what looks like a large corpse. There are skeletal rat like figures in the bottom right hand corner. You may ask; Okay but how does this relate to good or bad moral character? What is the mechanism? It\u2019s all about behaviors. This is where the FIBS ROCK model becomes useful. FIBS is an anagram and correlates with the behaviors of bad character and the anagram ROCK is the basis for the behaviors that underpin good character. Let\u2019s start with FIBS. The letters of FIBS stands for: Flatter . . . people flatter others to manipulate them, Inflate . . . people inflate their contribution to anything successful and show ingratitude to others, Break . . . people make loads of commitments but nearly always break them and always find an excuse, Scapegoat . . . people scapegoat others to avoid taking responsibility. By the way does the cluster of behaviors described by FIBS remind you of any well known leader and their leadership style? . . . When Donald Trump likes someone he calls them the \u2018very best of the best\u2019 He gives himself 10 out of 10 for the way he has handled the virus, He constantly breaks commitments (remember those tax returns) and he is always on the look out for scapegoats . . . most recently Dr Fauci. ROCK stands for: Respect, the leader respects the essence within everyone. Own, they own their part (no matter how small) in anything that has gone pear shaped and take responsibility for predictable outcomes that resulted from their activities. They Credit others - anyone who has contributed something valuable. AND They Keep commitments and when for whatever reason they can\u2019t be kept they let people know early. So good moral character is built on ROCK behaviors. And when leaders consistently display ROCK behaviors trust rises. When enough people display ROCK behaviors you get the type of society illustrated by the first painting. Now before I finish. Everyone thinks their behaviors are ROCK. If you were to ask Donald Trump where he was on the FIBS ROCK spectrum he would look you in the eye and say he was solid ROCK. Sadly although most people profess ROCK, when tested they display FIBS behaviors. Sadly most people get away with it. Very few people are called out on their FIBS behavior. There are things we can do about that . . . but that is for another time. To my US friends please know the world supports your active participation in the repair of democracy in your country. Journey with courage and kindness, Peter Rennie ",

            "answer_text": "A moral character depicts a person as \u201ctrustworthy\u201d - through being recognised as being a person of integrity. Someone others can rely on to not take advantage of them or violate their rights and personal boundaries. Someone who is respected in keeping their word and treating others with respect, fairness and dignity. The fruits of genuine moral character. That is a reputation someone earns - not a given, through \u201cwalking their talk\u201d. A person who earns such a reputation of having such a moral character, gains notoriety and respect as being a person \u201cof substance\u201d. Being recognised as a person of reliable strength of character and sense of identity - that cannot be swayed through self interest over doing the \u201cright thing\u201d. This moral integrity in a person adds value to other people\u2019s quality of life also; as they feel more confident to put their trust in them to protect their well-being, over others who obtain a shady or immoral character. And they can rely on them to do just that. Such a moral character carries weight for success in all walks of life - as a partner, parent, friend, business partner, employee and particularly \u201cin leadership roles\u201d. As trust builds \u201crap-ore with others\u201d, and people will trust those of moral character more with what is important to them, over more shady or immoral characters who are less trustworthy. Which can include trusting people of integrity with their hearts, their pain, their business goals/interests, as confidantes, friends, carers and leadership of their lives/nation. This is why many, particularly politicians, will slander opponents in the attempt for others to \u201cquestion their moral character/reputation and intentions\u201d, in order to win over them for self interest/ambition. Where the focus should not be on the individual/s personally - but on policy creation/merits/flaws/solutions and/or their leadership decisions that may have led, unintentionally or intentionally, to harm or enhancing good; highlighting the important point \u201cof getting it right for the greater good of a nation and all its citizens\u201d. Not on a power struggle and brainwashing the populace = immorality. Ruining moral character/reputation - is a way of succeeding over such respected individuals to make themselves or their agendas \u201cappear better\u201d; which in reality or practice, may not be the case. Hence why it is so important to judge \u201ca person\u2019s consistent actions\u201d (if they follow up on promises or what they preach) - to discern true moral character; and not tolerate immorality if we want equality, respect, justice and peace in our lives/nation. If we want others \u201cto do the right thing by us and the world\u201d - we need leaders of moral character. People feel safer and more protected with moral people being around them and being involved in their lives on any level, shape or form. To highlight the above - would you allow a person of immoral and shady character to be around yourself, children, your business ventures, as a friend, carer, teacher, law enforcement, magistrate or as a leader of your country? What type of character would you prefer to be in these type of positions that effect your life and that of your loved ones? You have your answer through all the above of the importance of moral character; to build a better self, equality, personal/business/ governance relations - enhancing a safer, fairer more just humane society/world with less human rights violations and abuse inside and outside our personal lives. Where integrity and a high moral standing in character is imperative in \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d to produce trust, justice, liberty, respect and peace - acting in the best interests and well being of \u201call\u201d. Nothing is more important. Thank you for the A2A. ",
