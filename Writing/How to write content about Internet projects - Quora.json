            "answer_text": "I'm not a writer, but I would imagine the best way to go would be to read A LOT of articles which are popular or respected and close to what you want to produce. This way you can learn from the best. Then start writing your own until you accomplish a writing style which you are happy with. Then find internet projects which are likely to get traction with your targeted audience. Another thing I would say is that its important to know what kind of pre existing knowledge the reader is likely to have. If you go too in depth or technical the average reader may be put off, however if you target is technical people and you write them too dumbed down, the readers could become frustrated. Learn your writing style, learn the subject matter, learn the audience. Again, not a content writer so I may be off the mark. Goodluck! ",
