            "answer_text": "All the answers are excellent. However, if you are asking about a pen, not a brush, and you want to do calligraphy vs. just writing, then I recommend you buy either a brush-pen, or felt-tip marker with a brush tip. My first preference for doing Chinese is calligraphy is to use a traditional Chinese calligraphy brush:  To use a calligraphy brush, you will need to carry with you either a bottle of liquid ink, or a stick of solid ink that you can grind into liquid form each time you want to write. For myself, this is the only tool I would ever use for doing true calligraphy. However, this isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s preference. Sometimes you want to carry something with you that is more readily available for use. Option two is a brush-pen:  There is quite a range of choices of brush-pens. The best have natural hair and act very much like a traditional brush. There are also synthetic-fibre brush pens and a choice of firm, medium or soft. I recommend this very comprehensive guide to brush-pens: Guide to Choosing a Brush Pen for Calligraphy You can see a bunch of examples here: Brush Pen, Brush Pen Suppliers and Manufacturers at Alibaba.com Many stores in China should carry them. Finally, there is the handy brush-tipped marker. This is a synthetic fibre simulated brush tip similar to a standard felt-tipped marker. In terms of absolute ease of use, these are very handy. Drop one in your purse or bag and take it out whenever needed. You won\u2019t need to worry about refilling it or the ink spilling out or leaking. If you know what you are doing, you can get fairly good calligraphy results. But make no mistake: this is not a replacement for an actual calligraphy brush! If you want to use a marker, I recommend the ones made in Japan. They are very high quality, inexpensive, and have a longer tip than similar brush style markers made in Europe. Of the non-Japanese manufacturers I recommend markers made by Staedtler for the both the quality of the fibre tips and the ink colours. Japanese calligraphy markers come in different styles and are made by several different manufacturers:  ",
