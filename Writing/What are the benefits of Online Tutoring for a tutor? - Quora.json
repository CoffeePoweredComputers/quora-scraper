            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say the biggest proof Online Tutoring is flexibility! When you take online classes you are way more flexible than when you have to go to a tuition center or tutors home. Also, online tuition is generally a lot cheaper than face to face tutoring. Generally speaking, lessons are more affordable online, but you also save a lot of money on transportation costs. Another great benefit of Online Tutoring is the huge variety of tuition companies and tutors. If you have found the right tuition agency, you are able to choose out of many different tutors instantly. On the other hand, the biggest downside of online tutoring is that it is not for everyone. Some people have really bad concentration and don\u2019t have enough discipline to actually benefit from the online tutoring sessions. Additionally, it is more difficult for the tutor to build rapport with his students, as there is no face to face interaction. Online tuition has a lot of pros, however, it can have a lot of downsides as well if you are not the right person for it. So before you get online classes, make sure that you compare all the disadvantages and advantages of online tuition with face to face tutoring. ",
