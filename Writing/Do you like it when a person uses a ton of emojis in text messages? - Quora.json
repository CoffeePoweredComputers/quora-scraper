            "answer_text": "honestly, nope. i do not. when i was at a young age ( like 8 - 9 ), which meant i had a free state of mind, i always loved & i mean, LOVED to use emoticons so much. i really don\u2019t know, maybe it was how they looked like & it was just fun to look at & send at somebody, when it concludes to you spamming them with emojis. basically, my friends & i used to do that. send each other emojis at the time. but sometimes it could happen when we leave our conversations ; with an emoji / emojis in the end of our sentence / message. now, i\u2019m not saying that emojis are bad & all. it\u2019s just that it could be annoying at times if i\u2019d keep receiving messages from somebody who sends me a lot of emojis ; including those people who spam another person with emojis for no reason, or they don\u2019t even know the meaning of the emoji, like ; the sleeping emoji. people always have mistaken that emoji of a person frowned & a tear on the cheek or a falling tear ( &, i wasn\u2019t one of those people ). but, no. the \u2018 tear \u2019 is actually a sleeping bubble where you can also find in an anim\u00e9 whenever you can see them sleep.  \u2191 this is an example \u2191 but back to what i was saying. truly, no, i do not like it when somebody ever sends me messages full of emoticons / emojis right after, or kind of spamming me with them. i find it very immature of them to ever do so, even if they know they\u2019re annoying. so, if you see this, just know, that there are other people who could be sensitive on what you send them. i get very annoyed very easily, so i don\u2019t recommend you do it to others either, whether a prank or not, or to call it \u2018 fun \u2019. thank y\u2019all for your understanding. & cooperation.

People who are more into visual images may have problems with words and do better understanding images : they do well with emoji recognition. ",
