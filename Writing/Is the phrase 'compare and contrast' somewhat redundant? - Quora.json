            "answer_text": "No, \u201ccompare and contrast\u201d isn\u2019t really redundant. If we\u2019re asked to compare two items we may be looking for things they have in common as well as differences. (Though as shown in the definition below, and as mentioned by Justin Franco compare is also often used to refer specifically to similarities.) When asked to contrast them we are specifically looking for differences. Thus when someone asks us to compare and contrast, they are simply making it clear that they want us to consider both the similarities and the differences. I seem to recall seeing a lot of \u201ccompare and contrast\u201d questions on literature exams. For example if we were studying Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse and The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes a teacher might ask us to \u201cCompare and contrast the nature of the quests undertaken by the characters Siddhartha and Don Quixote.\u201d Alas I never had that particular question as we didn\u2019t read the books in the same year. compare - definition of compare in English | Oxford Dictionaries 1 Estimate, measure, or note the similarity or dissimilarity between: 1.1 compare something to Point out or describe the resemblances with; liken to: \u2018her novel was compared to the work of Daniel Defoe\u2019 contrast - definition of contrast in English | Oxford Dictionaries Differ strikingly: \u2018his friend's success contrasted with his own failure\u2019 \u2018a contrasting view\u2019 1.1[with object] Compare in such a way as to emphasize differences: \u2018people contrasted her with her sister\u2019",

            "answer_text": "Technically, no. I know it's pedantic to say technically, but it's true in this sense. Traditionally, when we compare things, we are looking for similarities. When we contrast, we look for differences. So the terms aren't redundant; they're opposites, though modern usage has allowed the word compare to mean finding both similarities and differences. ",

            "answer_text": "My professor who teaches English says it is redundant to use compare and contrast together, because \u2018compare\u2019 can mean looking at similarities and differences. If I am comparing two different shirts, Im automatically going to look at how they are similar and how they are different; the \u201ccontrasting\u201d is already there. And according to Merriam-Webster, compare can be used for differences as well. So, technically, adding \u2018contrast\u2019 is redundant, but sometimes it can be used for emphasis. Language is so fluid that saying \u201ccompare and contrast\u201d isnt wrong, it\u2019s just more emphatic, I think. ",

Of course,  a person  could make the point that  a  single term  can suffice for a  briefer explanation, and yet there is no objective reason  shown that informs people that  brevity is better in all circumstances.
