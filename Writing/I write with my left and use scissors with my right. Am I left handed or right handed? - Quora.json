            "answer_text": "\u201cI write with my left and use scissors with my right. Am I left handed or right handed?\u201d Same here. I eat with my fork in the right hand, and I cut food with my knife in the left hand, so I don\u2019t swap implements like most righties do. I throw with my left hand, and I bat more comfortably in the right-hander\u2019s configuration. I kick better with my right foot. I would call you a lefty if you write with your left hand, regardless of all the other stuff. I certainly wouldn\u2019t call you ambidextrous. Handedness is really a collection of functions. In most people, the functions are located in the left hemisphere, creating the right handed versions of them. For people like us, these various functions are distributed differently between the hemispheres. I suspect this means we think a bit differently, as well. Anyway, I do. ",

            "answer_text": "You are in fact just like me. I do many things with both hands, but that does not make me ambidextrous, it makes me \u201ccross dominant\u201d. And yes, that is a real thing, not something I just made up. As a child they (school) tried to make me right handed in everything, but it didn\u2019t work. I went home from school one day and told my mom that the teacher hit me on the hand with a ruler, and the shit hit the fan with that one. Cross dominance hits only 1% of the population.
