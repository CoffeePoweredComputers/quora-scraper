            "answer_text": "I agree with everything Adam Sear mentioned, and I'd like to add a bit more: 1. Lack of seeing the long-term rewards of reading. Modern electronic society provides easy, short term rewards. Want to learn something? Watch a video. Read a short post. Turn on the television to watch the news. These are quick solutions to what used to be long-term processes of understanding. As an aspiring electrical engineer, I do not blame technology. I am grateful Technology is widely available, but people have a tendency to develop poor habits regarding its use.2. Fewer, and shorter duration of, complex conversations as a result of greater image dependency. Think about the interactions dealt with my most young adults, and many adults, today. Unless you are involved in academia, most interactions lack complex structure and components. More and more of our information is transmitted via images or simple text: Yet How often do we attempt to interpret or translate these simple messages into different messages? Or, better yet, ask questions? The Reality of social media imposes a like or dislike mentality, stressing emotional absolutes. I would very much like to see improvement. However, I think Language will continue to deteriorate so long as idle habits continue in a majority of young adults. I often wonder if it is similar to a drug problem involving over-stimulation. Our brains reward us with dopamine upon completion of a task or finally understanding a difficult concept; I think many young adults, myself included, have developed a sort of dependency on shortsighted information as a means to a personal end/goal. This is in contrast to the beauty that comes from deep understanding and development in a complex, interconnected world. I think every person should be asking not what they stand to gain from any source of information but how their unique understanding may contribute to a more open-minded world. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, not all teenagers don't love reading\u2026 Many still do! It's just the fact that the age we're living in is the age of modernization, where technology and social medias are the part of our day to day life and because of this, teenagers crave for this stuff after seeing other teenagers do something with them because everyone finds it to be cool! One more thing is that nowadays, parents don't encourage children to read books\u2026 I've seen majority of parents (at least in my country) discourage their children to read books and they ask them to study instead\u2026 So teenagers tend to have less time to spend on anything which would entertain themselves and since books take more time to go through, teenagers usually go for the the route which would take less time and would entertain them too so therefore choosing movies, social media sites, and other streaming sites instead of books\u2026. Although there are teenagers who take out their time to read books because they find all the other medium less interesting and in my opinion, I think that books are actually the better option because they increase your vocabulary quite alot and are more detailed than movies or any other thing but it is what it is! Anyways, you should always do what you love and if you love reading, then do it regardless of people blabbering negative statements over it\u2026 Just do what makes you happy! :) ",
