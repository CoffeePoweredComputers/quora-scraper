            "answer_text": "I was born and raised in France. I am married to a Native American who has Cree and Chippewa and Assiniboine and Sioux ancestry. Her father was enrolled in Turtle Mountain in North Dakota as a Chippewa since the USA does not recognize the term \u201cMetis.\u201d He was actually Chippewa and Cree Indian with French ancestry, too. The name of the language of the Metis is called: French-Cree, Metis or Michif. Michif is the way the Indians could say Metis. The Metis or Michif or French Cree language consists of French words with Cree Indian verbs. A French person from France would be able to recognize the French words but not the rest. The accent on the French words the Metis use sound a lot like Quebec French. I was once talking to one of my wife\u2019s Metis relative and I asked her : \u201chow do you say this or that, etc.\u201d She would says l\u2019oreille for ear, etc. And I understood them as individual words and as an answer to a question, not in a conversation in French-Cree. I also read part of my wife\u2019s book on French-Cree dictionary and the spelling of the French words were not spelled like the way we do in France or the way it is done in Quebec. It was all spelled out phonetically. There were many very long words which you could not recognize as either Cree Indian or French. But when I would read them phonetically, I would know if it was Cree Indian or French from the sound of my reading. If it meant nothing to me, then it was not French. ",

            "answer_text": "There are M\u00e9tis all across Canada and even in the States. While many of them count French ancestry, a significant number had Scottish, Irish, Dutch, and even English fathers. While the name \u201cM\u00e9tis\u201d is French, it was applied to any mixed aboriginal/European mix, as long as they were in the community. Not every person with Native bloodlines counts as M\u00e9tis, as they have to have connections to the community beyond mere bloodlines. Many do speak French, in addition to various Native languages and English. There is no rule. More M\u00e9tis in Quebec, the Maritime provinces and near the former French settlements on the Prairies are likely to speak French. ",
