            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I know nothing about medicine. But, I know a few things about research and publishing. For some reason a lot of students think that writing a review article is easy and they think that their first paper should be a review. This is almost always a bad idea. To write a decent, let alone good, review you should have an intimate knowledge of the field. It is not enough to read (abstracts of) 50 papers and summarise them. You have to understand what drives this direction of research, where the ideas are coming from, what are the motivations and deep connections between ideas. You can not get this kind of knowledge just from reading, you have to work on these things to know this kind of details. If you are a beginner, there is virtually no way you will be able to write a good review. Could you write it and get published? Of course you can, there are enough of journals that are happy to take your money and publish whatever you write. But it you intend to do research, it is better to stay away from these journals. Should you do this king of review? Probably yes, this is a good way to familiarise yourself with the current state of research. But do not expect it to be published. ",
