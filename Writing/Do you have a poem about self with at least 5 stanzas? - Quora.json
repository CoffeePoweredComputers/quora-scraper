I am the sun and the heat,the ice and the cold.I am the fragrance so sweet,I am both the young and the old. I am wind that blows,the tree growing tall.I am the river that flows,I am both the big and the small. I am the light and the dark,the death and the birth.I am dull and the spark,I am space and the earth. I am pawn and the king,all players are me.I am the air on the wing,I am the silence in thee. I am the eternal in all,pause and you'll find,will you answer the call,We're all one of a kind. Written on 07/11/13 \u00a9 Ray Sinclair 2013 ",
