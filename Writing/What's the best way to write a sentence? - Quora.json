            "answer_text": "Please critique CUE 0~4, respectively: no use, take 1, take 2, take 3. CUE - by JOW Yuzo When you write, follow the CUE, an acronym for: C - Conciseness U - Unity E - Emphasis \"Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\" - John F. Kennedy, in inaugural address This quote has CUE. Conciseness means, \"Do not use a sentence if a phrase will do; not a phrase, a word.\" Ask not from your country, do for your country. That's patriotism. Conciseness ought to be brevity with clarity; clarity^1 of purpose in message. Being too brief could sacrifice attention*. Unity means to stay on topic, not stray away. When I talk about CUE, for example, I stay on this topic until it is discussed to my satisfaction. Waste few words on saying a 'cue' is a hairstyle called 'pigtail', or it is the stick for playing pool or billiards. Unity ought to include parallelism as inherent sentence construction that groups similar elements: nouns with nouns, not nouns with adjectives; poetry with prose, not prose with poet, etc. For example, \"The poet gives us his essence, but prose takes the mould of the body and mind entire.\" This thoughtful line by Virginia Woolf, English novelist/essayist, edited: Poetry gives us essence, but prose takes the mould of the body and mind entire. Emphasis means two things: Lead a sentence with an important subject, end with the point you want to put across. A sentence 'lead' is important; this \"Lead\" is perfect. But this sentence ending can be improved. Edited: Lead a sentence with an important subject, put your point at the very end, for people are apt to retain what you said last. Read with CUE in mind, edit with it, and in the process, your mind absorbs. Write with CUE in mind, readers view you an organized writer. ---------------------------- ^1 Clarity is our striven aim at any communication delivered with folksy inflection and pleasant rhythm. Desirable as these qualities are, they're not achievable by measurable means except thru continual practice. *Pres. Lincoln at Gettysburg addresses noble ideals in two minutes. But nobody dare critique his in-concise opening. Imagine the crowd, after listening over two hours to Edward Everett, featured orator, they rise and loosen up. Then Lincoln takes the stage. \"Four score,\" people turn toward Lincoln; \"and seven..,\" begin sitting down or resuming spots; \"years ago,\" figured out \"87 years.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Before you begin, make sure you have all the punctuation you\u2019re going to need. Take a period out of your period tray. Check to see that you have plenty of commas and that your colon, semicolon, exclamation mark and question mark boxes are well stocked. You may never need to use them but you don\u2019t want to have to get up from your typesetter for hot lead once you\u2019ve begun Then, I like to start with my last word or phrase. How can you tell what part of the sentence is best for ending with? Here\u2019s a handy rule of thumb: consider what words feel best to you if you utter them and then say \u201cYo,\u201d with a hand gesture. Get that phrase down, place your period, and then fill in the verbiage in front. It doesn\u2019t really matter what comes before, just be sure you begin with the letter \u201cI.\u201d ",
