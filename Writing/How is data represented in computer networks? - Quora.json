            "answer_text": "Quoting from Manish Kathuria's answer to Does data actually travel in packets from one computer to another over a network when requested by the sender? At the lowest level, the data to be transmitted is in the form of bits i.e. 0s (representing off or false) and 1s (representing on or true). The actual traffic in a computer network can take different forms depending upon the transmission medium. In the commonly used wired networks (Ethernet), the NICs or the Network Interface Cards exchange the signals through two pairs of wires (one for Transmitting and the other for Receiving). The 0s and 1s are transmitted by switching the voltage from low to high. The voltage levels used in the 100 Mbps Ethernet cable are +1 V, 0 V and -1 V. In case of WiFi, the Wireless Network Cards are capable of transmitting and receiving radio waves. While transmitting the 0s and 1s are converted into radio signals by the Wireless Network Cards and while receiving the radio waves are converted back into 0s and 1s. In a fibre optic cable, the bits are transmitted through light signals. The presence or absence of light can be used to represent 1s and 0s. ",
