Again, and again, and again.Bank Shot (Where Dortmunder steals an entire bank). SEMI SPOILER: In The Hot Rock at one point the crew of criminals have to break into an insane asylum to kidnap someone who has the safe deposit box info where the jewel is. They rob the place by utilizing a toy train (i.e. the kind you would ride at a fair) and rubber wet suits to get over an electric fence. A guard rushed in to tell the person in charge this (\u201cmen dressed all in rubber are jumping out of a train and invading the institution\u201d), and he says \u201csit down and tell me about it.\u201d Except way funnier. And it leaves us with the classic brain worm: Afghanistan Banana Stand. John Dortmunder - Wikipedia The whole Dortmunder series is great as is the darker series crime series by Westlake about Parker (sometimes found under the pen name of Richard Stark [in the Stephen King book \u201cThe Dark Half.\u201d the bad guy is named Stark.]). Parker (Stark novels character) - Wikipedia Reading these (the older ones) is kind of like time travelling, where people got paid with cash at their jobs, and you could forge a drivers license with a pen and paper.
