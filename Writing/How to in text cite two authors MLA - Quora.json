            "answer_text": "The parenthetical citation will look like this if there are two authors of a single work you are citing: (Jones and Smith 42). However, if there are four or more authors, you typically will list only the first and the abbreviation \u201cet al.\u201d (from Latin et alii, meaning \u201cand a whole bunch of others\u201d). For this example, it would look like (Jones et al. 42). Note that there\u2019s no comma separating the last name from the page number in MLA\u2014that\u2019s something APA format does instead. Many MLA samples may chose not to italicize the et al. bit, though generally MLA suggests uncommon phrases in foreign languages get italics. It\u2019s a bit of an argument as to whether et al. counts as common or uncommon, so follow your teacher\u2019s preferences there. On the other hand, if you have two entirely separate sources, one by Jones and a different one by Smith, you will cite each one individually. The stuff from Jones will be cited (Jones 42) and the different work by Smith will be cited (Smith 117), adjusting page numbers as appropriate. ",
