            "answer_text": "I personally used insight secure and iastoday master series. Both are good & putting considerably commendable efforts to provided daily questions for writing. I registered iastoday as they offer daily answer review too during by 2017 attempt. I hadn\u2019t ever seen a good review from insight team for my answers. Aspirants are actually wasting time writing in insight requesting for review. Please review ! please review !; none reviews. I came to know about iastoday from their beginners guide to mains . You can read it here They showcased general issues in writing. So i registered their writing skill development program. That was a course with daily answer writing with official review. They provided writing sheets to for real exam experience. First review was detailed & rating received was NA (not applicable). That was a time where i failed 2 prelims earlier. I thought im strong for mains & i cant perform well in prelims only. But actually iastoday put light to my preparation. I wrote 3 more answers correcting their suggestions one by one. I realized transition in review too. So i realised that the claim of personal monitoring & individual care were true. I used to chat with their team during this period & were helpful. You cant get a decent response or even reply to mail from other websites mentioned above in a week. But iastoday website offer live chat and that too for 24 hours. (No need of believing my words, test it.) Once i realized their capability & worthiness of chat support, I upgraded my membership to their flagship LIFETIME guarantee. I cleared prelims 2017, cleared mains 2017 and appeared interview 2017.  I give the whole credit to iastoday website which helped me through out the journey in 3rd attempt. You may read Pankaj Prakash's answer to Has anybody who has cleared UPSC civil services written answers on iastoday.in? Is the website worth? ",
