            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re going to like this, but here goes. The answer is - neither. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not trying to be disrespectful here. Style books are very important for writers if you\u2019re looking to write for established publications. It\u2019s their way of making sure there\u2019s consistency in approach, especially for volume publications and magazines. After all, it\u2019s tiring for readers having to cope with different ways of expressing dates, numbers and contractions. Also, it\u2019s not very professional. But as a solo blogger, whilst achieving a consistency in your style is not a bad thing to aim for, the extent to which it will contribute to your success in the blogosphere is going to be extremely limited. The reason for this is simple. Your readers won\u2019t be judging you on the technical style of your writing. They just want great content. They want content that speaks to them and the particular thing that they\u2019re looking for that will help improve their lives or entertain them. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t write using correct grammar and spelling - of course you should. But honestly, no one will care if you as a blogger writes in AP Style. So I would say, your best bet would be to focus on the more important elements of creating great content, such as writing short, clear sentences, using simple language in terms your audience can understand. When your blog is successful and you\u2019re looking to receive guest pitches from other bloggers; well, that\u2019s the time to start thinking about using writing guidelines! ",

            "answer_text": "Whichever one you feel most comfortable with. Here\u2019s why. Blogs convey information, but a blog is first and foremost a medium for you to express yourself with. What makes blogs unique or interesting isn\u2019t just the content - it\u2019s how you convey the content. Your writing voice, thought process, humor, analytical skills, formatting etc. are what make will make your blog stand out. You are unique - what you may want to write about may not be. So instead of figuring out which style is better, I\u2019m going to ask you to consider how you like to write. For example: Do you like to give brief summaries before diving into detailed explanations?Do you prefer to reference sources in text or at the end of your article?Make a chart with your personal pros/cons for Chicago Style and AP style. Whichever has the most pros may be the style you should blog with. If you find that you don\u2019t actually like either of those styles, consider choosing a different writing style, or eschewing a specific writing style altogether. Being true to yourself will be more effective than forcing yourself to conform to a specific style. ",
