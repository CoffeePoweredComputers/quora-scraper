            "answer_text": "Before I start, I want to say some of the best books are actually boring! Academic articles can be life changing. However, most people in modern shallow culture, want to be entertained. That is a problem. For example, in finance, Rich Dad Poor Dad (before) is OK:  In fact, it is very very well written. Very entertaining too. Not boring at all for a personal finance book. I am sure he makes a great motivational speaker and he does make some valid points. But his work isn\u2019t academic nor does it use many academic works, or summarize many studies, although he may summarize a few. For people new to finance, books like these would be better:   Here is a general reading list: Paul Farrell \u2013 The Lazy Person\u2019s Guide to Investing: A Book for Procrastinators, the Financially Challenged, and Everyone Who Worries About Dealing With Their Money Burton Malkiel and Charles Ellis. The Elements of Investing Larry Swedroe. The Only Guide to an Investment Strategy You\u2019ll Ever Need Larry Swedroe. The Quest For Alpha: The Holy Grail of Investing John Bogle, The Little Book of Common Sense Investing : Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns (Little Books. Big Profits) William Bernstein. The Four Pillars of Investing: Lessons for Building a Winning Portfolio John Bogle \u2013 Common Sense on Mutual Funds: New Imperatives for the Intelligent Investor John Bogle\u2019s \u201cThe Clash of the Cultures\u201d David Swensen, Unconventional Success: A Fundamental Approach to Personal Investment Lawrence Cunningham. The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America, Second Edition \u201cSecurity Analysis\u201d by Benjamin Graham Benjamin Graham\u2019s \u201cIntelligent Investor.\u201d Carl Richards, The Behavior Gap, Simple Ways to Stop Doing Dumb Things with Your Money. Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman Extraordinary Popular Delusions and The Madness of Crowds, Charles Mackay. The Essays of Warren Buffett For more academic work on how the 4% rule works in practice, I would recommend the following: Sustainable Withdrawal Rates From Your Retirement Portfolio, by Philip L. Cooley, Carl M. Hubbard and Daniel T. Walz \u2013 http://afcpe.org/assets/pdf/vol1014.pdf Other academic books to look at include: Bengen, W. P. (1994).

Journal of the American Association of Individual Investors. 18(8), 8-11. 6 Steps to Financial Freedom The point I am trying to make is, reading a cross-section of the evidence, and executing it , is far more likely to better your life than to flick through a few pages and think `this is boring`. The boring work is more useful as most people don't have the patience to read through it and it won\u2019t became as popular. In sales and `life` these books are good:    In politics, some modern and classics include these:      ",

            "answer_text": " Here are 7 books that have made a big impact on my life most recently, along with a few details on why I think they\u2019re important: Letters from a Stoic by Seneca. There's so much timeless wisdom in this book! A collection of letters written by Seneca, it's a dense read but be warned\u2014you'll be taking notes from every letter because each one is full of practical advice we can incorporate into our lives. And maybe it\u2019s an even better idea to read it through once, then go back and take notes the second time\u2014you\u2019ll be glad you did. The letters cover quite a large selection of topics. You\u2019ll get to the bottom of what is the importance of true friendship, to why you should exercise your mind daily, to specific ways of reducing anxiety about all the different events that are happening in your life, Seneca\u2019s ideas are a blueprint for living a high quality of life every single day. Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin. Written by two decorated, former Navy SEALs who fought during the war in Iraq, this book is a glimpse into what happens on the battlefield, and even more how a leader makes (or breaks) the success of a team. It's a fascinating read about the importance of setting a strategy, how to prioritize what needs to be done first, how critical it is to check your ego, and why taking full responsibility when things go wrong promotes good leadership and success. At times the book reads like a thriller, and then you realize all the scenarios that are described are based on real events and experiences we can learn from and apply to our daily lives. Emotional Agility: Get Unstuck, Embrace Change, and Thrive in Work and Life by Susan David, PhD. If you're interested in learning more about how to acquire a growth mindset, this book is an informative and excellent read. Written by a psychologist PhD who teaches at Harvard Medical School, the book introduces the concept of emotional agility\u2014being flexible with our thoughts and feelings (the equivalent of having a growth mindset), instead of being rigid and holding on to beliefs from our past (the equivalent of having a fixed mindset). There are four key concepts of emotional agility: showing up (facing your thoughts and feelings), stepping out (detaching from them), walking your why (focusing on your core values), and moving on (getting proactive in changing your habits and mindset). So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love by Cal Newport. The title comes from advice that the comedian Steve Martin gave a while back to aspiring entertainers: be so good they can\u2019t ignore you! Newport challenges the advice we often hear that we should follow our passion, and says that going down this path can be dangerous, invoke anxiety, and feed into a constant need to reinvent ourselves. Instead, Newport argues that matching our dream job to a preexisting passion doesn't matter, but that passion comes after we put in the hard work to excel at something that provides value to others. This is a must read for anyone who feels they don't really have any specific passion and are not sure how to choose their career path or move forward with their life. Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers by Tim Ferriss. This book looks and reads like an encyclopedia: there's so much information included and it's best if you read it in small chunks! In essence, the material is divided into three sections (Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise), and consists of a comprehensive collection of life experiences, tools, and hands-on tactics compiled from a series of interviews Ferriss conducted with world-class leaders in diverse fields of expertise. These leaders range from top athletes to best-selling authors to Special Ops commanders. It's like drinking from a very concentrated cup of wisdom! The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living by Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman. The Daily Stoic is almost like a workbook: it offers 366 days of quotes of Stoic philosophers as well as practical applications of their wisdom through exercises. The philosophers mentioned include Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, Epictetus, Zeno, and Cleanthes. Here are two examples of powerful quotes: \u201cWe suffer more in imagination than in reality\" (Seneca), and \"We all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own\" (Marcus Aurelius). In other words, everyone can find something here they can relate to! There's also a ton of commentary to accompany each quote, and a super useful glossary of Greek terms. Never Broken: Songs Are Only Half the Story by Jewel. The artist provides a blueprint on how we can build strength and resilience in order to become a stronger, better balanced, and happier person. Instead of being impatient with ourselves, we should be more like hard wood that grows slowly: not look for quick fixes, but focus more on who we want to become in the long run. Jewel suggests this is possible to do by making decisions that aren't focused on only the present, getting to the root of the problem we're facing, and giving ourselves the permission to grow so that we can become the architect of our dreams.
