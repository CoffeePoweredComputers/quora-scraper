            "answer_text": "Employee introduction is a part of an orientation process which is being conducted by the HR Department. The most common practice is to send an Employee Onboarding Email to the group email address so that everyone can get the idea about newly joined employee. In your case if your organization doesn\u2019t have any employee onboarding email sending option, then you can do it by yourself. You can simply ask the IT department about the all employee group email address and after taking your department head\u2019s permission you can send them an introducing email about yourself. There mention about your last organization where you have worked and your education and your expertise. Lastly you may add your contact number if you want them to communicate you over the phone/ Skype or whatsapp messenger. Thanks | Hope this will help . ",
