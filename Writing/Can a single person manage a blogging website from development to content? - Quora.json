            "answer_text": "If I tell you about myself. I started blogging around two months ago. In starting everything was peaceful and I was enjoying every bit of it. But now it feels very overwhelming to do everything from keyword research, graphic design, writing, seo, promotion, participation in social media platforms etc. Still I am doing because I knew this is going to happen. However I suggest you to not quit if you already started. If you are feeling overwhelming with load of work, reduce the load of work but keep doing. If you not started yet then I highly suggest you to find atleast one person who is passionate like you for work and can give time and energy with you on your work. To conclude- Creating and building something from scratch was never easy. It's demanding and time consuming. But in journey if you met even one person who shares the same vision with you then lot of work can be done easily. Focus on important tasks and slowly keep making progress towards your goals.

If you know what are the blogging activities to perform, you probably should prepare a time-table to work accordingly. However, in your initial stage, you can efficiently manage your blog, But when times goes by or when your blog ranks at the top of the search engines for most of the keywords, then more efforts are required. So, you need to split your work to maintain your blog ranking position at the top. Cheers,Myilraj.GBlogger at OnlineHomeIncome .in ",
