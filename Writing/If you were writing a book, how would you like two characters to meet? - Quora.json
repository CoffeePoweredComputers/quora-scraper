            "answer_text": "I am writing a book, and characters can meet in all sorts of interesting ways! Accidental\u2014 a twist of fate. They meet at the coffee shop or train station, or they stumble over each other when walking past. Two complete strangers suddenly connecting makes an impact on the reader. Traumatic\u2014 a perilous scene. One saves the other from a horribly painful death, or they drop all judgement and team up to confront a dangerous situation. If they survive, their bond will certainly be stronger and closer. Arranged\u2014 set up, in a good way or a bad way. Maybe their parents or friends arranged a date. Or the antagonist uses one of them to get to the other. This way allows for more freedom in your creative storytelling. Eh, those are just a few but certainly my favorites. ",

            "answer_text": "I like Harvey\u2019s answer, but it seems like giving thought to how your main characters meet isn\u2019t a bad idea. Authors famously rewrite beginnings and endings endlessly. I think, though, that if you watch movies a lot you will find the main characters\u2019s first encounters are often calculated, and revealing, foreshadowing what is to come. In the same way many novelists do seem to give thought to how their characters are introduced and I suspect how they meet, but there is no singular way that is \u201cbest.\u201d Read the beginnings of great books and notice how the characters appear. Draw your own conclusions. In my YA novel The Red Scorpion , I did give consideration as to how my first two main characters met. I wanted it to be memorable and significant. But it should fit into the context of the story. ",
