It doesn't break down between writing and producing though. If anyone knows how to search the Korea official song registration/credit list, that should give you a definitive answer. Jungkook: 14 (did not count the different mixes of Run). His producing for MOS Persona chorus for all non-rap tracks didn't get credited though. Per Hobi JK produced Jamais Vu. I thought I heard he produced all the chorus. It doesn't show up here. Jungkook - Wikipedia   Jimin\u2019s: 7 Jimin (singer, born 1995) - Wikipedia  V: 13 (did not count the different versions of Run or if a song appears on multiple albums). V (singer) - Wikipedia   Jin: 8 Kim Seok-jin - Wikipedia  If this list is accurate, JK has the most at 14 and V closely behind at 13. ",

With the news of Taehyung\u2019s mixtape, possibility of Jungkook\u2019s mixtape, Jin\u2019s new song and Jimin\u2019s new song, their writing credit will eventually grow.
