            "answer_text": " Before the digital age, there were only 3 channels for marketing your brand. These are print, TV and radio. Today, these channels are still with us, plus of course, new channels like social media and the internet. The growth in these channels has been exponential, even with traditional marketing channels. There are now hundreds of TV channels, radio stations and newspapers. The volume of marketing in these channels alone is so loud the audience has a much higher filter, tuning out or down most of the marketing messages. In a loud and crowded playground, being louder won\u2019t cut it anymore. You need to communicate differently and effectively so your message resonates with your audience. Surprisingly, in America, TV is still the best marketing channel reaching a broader audience followed by radio and the internet, while print media finishes last. Agile marketing values change over following a plan. It means it can be adaptable to changes in the market. In this case, depending on the budget, Agile Marketing teams can still take advantage of television as America\u2019s number one medium combined with social media. Traditional Marketing professionals still play with their proven and tested game plans developed over years of experience. But the marketing industry has changed so fast in the last 3-5 years than in the last 50 years. Non-software industries can learn tons from Agile Software Development approach to become more efficient and responsive to rapid changes in technology. Just like software development, Agile Marketing will benefit from an iterative and responsive approach to marketing. I will not be surprised if other industries follow suit. Agile Engineering anyone?

            "answer_text": "This is a great question. I would think that the channel to start would be the channel that's easiest to experiment with. Where can you easily try something out? Put it out there, get feedback on it, and use the learnings from the feedback to guide the next iteration. This will probably differ from one organization to the next. One example could be social media. It's easy to put out a post/tweet and get feedback on it from your followers/fans. Quantitative feedback from whatever analytics program you use and qualitative feedback from user responses.  As long as it's a quick loop to put it out, get feedback, and use the feedback to go onto the next thing, then it will benefit from agile marketing principles. ",
