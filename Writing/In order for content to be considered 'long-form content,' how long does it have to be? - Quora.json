            "answer_text": "At least 2,500 words. Most opinion pieces are between 800\u20131,200 words. On the odd occasion, you will find pieces between 1,500\u20132,000 words. We can consider these essays, but not long-form articles. However, a long-form article is also an essay. In other words, not all essays are long-form. But if you\u2019ve been commissioned to write a long-form article, 2,500 is the bare, bare minimum. It\u2019s not about targeting a word count or length. Long-form pieces exact a critical look at their subject; it\u2019s the expansive treatment of a subject that really sets long-form apart. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe it to be mostly about how many words have been written. I\u2019d consider long-form content anything that is over 2000 words with a proper and defined outline and headings. Don\u2019t just write a big 2000 words paragraph but try and section it into multiple digestible pieces with engaging headings along the way. It helps with SEO, with readability and consumption. ",
