            "answer_text": "Hi! Thanks for the A2A! I\u2019m going to assume you mean actually physically falling rather than something more metaphorical than falling in love with someone or falling asleep. It would depend on things like the cause and manner of the fall, the person who was falling, the height and circumstances of the fall, the reasons for the fall, and how the person falling and the people observing were reacting to such a fall. For instance, a 400-lb man falling into a swimming pool is going to be something you describe very differently than a 3-year-old girl falling into the same pool. One thing might be comical, one thing suspenseful and tragic; or vice versa. Think more about these things and maybe, do some freewriting of phrases that describe all of the things that come to mind as you think about these ideas. You can perhaps begin to construct a good description by doing that. Think about the cause of the fall. Accidental? On purpose? Caused by someone or something else than the person falling? Are there other causes you can think about that evoke the same emotion, and can you use them effectively in a metaphor? i.e., Her slipping on the wet asphalt was unexpected, like rain in February, and just as harsh. Here, you can tell who fell, what caused the fall, and what kind of mood is being created by that fall. Think about the specific character and how you would picture that character falling. Would they not move, and just stare in shock? Would their arms and legs be all akimbo? Would they have any physical time to react? What would they say, or would they be silent, or would they scream? Would their hair fly behind them? What would their eyes and face look like as it happened? What would be passing through the character\u2019s mind? i.e. As the young detective fell from the clock tower, staring incredulously at the mentor who had pushed him, his hands clamored wildly for non-existent handles, and his last thoughts were of betrayal. Here, by addressing the height and circumstances of the fall, you can fill in what the character would do in that situation. This now-flattened detective is sad, betrayed, and frantic in his last moments. Think about the mood, setting and circumstances. Is it a comical pratfall, like in physical comedy? Is it an accidental fall that others find funny? Is it a scary fall that horrifies people, because the character is more than likely hurt? Is this a character falling to their death, doing a graceful dive or a leap of faith? i.e. As she hurled shut-eyed through the lazy iodine skies toward the damp earth below, her heart knew that spreading her wings in the next moment or so was the only thing that would save her from disaster. Here, you can tell that a female character is falling through the sky in an effort to test her ability to fly. She is not nervous, but calm, hopeful, and depending on herself. Good luck! Hope this helped! ",

Thank you and enjoy! \u2026 Each beat of the heart bolts after the another, carelessly bashing through in a massive disarray of doubt and regret, for realization is only of your attention once it is too late. Too late to think. I will never accomplish what I want with fear holding me back. Why did I wait so long? Too late to listen. I never received any signs against it. Why did I feel so nervous? Too late to stop. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this. Why am I doing this? Trying to release the grip of your own fingers penetrating the skin of your palm is near meaningless. Sweat begins to bead all over with the reoccurring nerves you thought you had finally abandoned, leaving you absent of the ability to do anything. Scream, cry, smile, blink, run, laugh, cough, kick, drink\u2014- Anything but fall. It is inevitable, an action outside of your control. Maybe you have been the one to bring it upon yourself, but stopping is not your decision. The consequences are all that lie within your future, the option remaining as to face them. \u201c I have fallen for you. \u201d Once the words escaped, my eyelids began to loosen from their tight embrace. She stared at me, her oval brown eyes now widened behind the glossy glass of her red-rimmed eyewear. She was hiding her lips behind one hand, glancing away as a hue of pale rose formed beautifully against caramel skin. \u201c \u2026 \u201d Silence was a worse impact than I once imagined, awareness of my idiocy now finally catching up after having made the jump. I watched with hesitant eyes as she now began to reveal her subtle lips, opening just enough to respond: \u201c I love you, too. \u201d Heart beat increasing, wheels turning to comprehend the situation with fists softening and a smile now spreading. There was no anxiety now; I made the first steps when I saw her, Looked over the edge to see our future, And I fell. \u2026 Oh, you meant falling? Like actually\u2026actually dropping\u2026 Out of the sky\u2026 Shit\u2026 ",
