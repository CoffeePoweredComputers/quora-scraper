            "answer_text": "In my experience with corporate boards, nonprofit boards, public committees over four decades I have found that verbatim minutes of most meetings are not necessary or helpful. An exception would be meetings of public officials in a democracy. Public meetings should be recorded because public officials represent the voters and we all need to know what happened and why. A sound recording backing up the official minutes which would be much more basic is a best practice in my mind. For meetings of organizations - businesses and nonprofits - recording the agenda, the decisions/votes and who attended is adequate. The debate of who said what isn\u2019t necessary. In some cases recording verbatim conversations of the meetings could be counterproductive. Discussions on lawsuits, personnel and compensation would be examples of where a particular remark by one person might have a negative effect. What the body decided is important not the debate and individual comments. For example, the most important responsibility of a board is to hire and fire the CEO/President of the organization. These are tough and detailed discussions that cover a lot of ground. Much of what gets said is just one persons opinion, questioning and brain storming. A verbatim record of the discussion that could read by others outside the board would not be helpful. Another major function of boards is strategic planning. For strategic planning there should be very open consideration of all ideas, opinions and information. Recording all this information is not important or helpful. What is important is the final product of a strategic plan. From a legal and public relations perspective you should assume that the written records of any meeting will become public. Would you want that? What would be the impact of that? Additionally, for most groups verbatim written minutes would be a significant burden and provide little additional value. The person stuck with recording the verbatim information cannot really focus on being a participant at the meeting. There is also the issue of whether it was correctly recorded. There is more to communication and meaning than the just the words. We communicate with our bodies, our faces, our inflection and our emotions. If you wanted to be accurate you would have to make a sound recording, transcribe and integrate the transcription with the written minutes you took. A very big burden that gains little in my experience. ",

            "answer_text": "I may return later to provide a more comprehensive treatment, but for now I would like to mention a few concepts and sources. In North America, the two most commonly used references for meeting procedures are Robert\u2019s Rules of Order and The AIP Standard Code. \u201cMeeting Procedures\u201d by James Lochrie is another excellent reference. Minutes are a concise record of what was done, not what was said. Until approved by the assembly, the draft minutes are not the meeting minutes, but only a draft. They should not be made public. It may be convenient and useful to make an audio recording of the meeting. It may be helpful to produce a verbatim transcript (from the recording). At a large convention, many reports may be presented, and these may be published as \u201cTransactions\u201d or \u201cProceedings\u201d. IMHO, although these reports are part of the Record, they are not part of the minutes. Except where there are recommendations or other items in the reports that are debated and changed. I am a member of an organization which has an annual convention. Preliminary Proceedings are produced in advance of the meeting. Final Proceedings are published 6 months later. And these \u201cminutes\u201d are then approved at the next annual meeting. During the two-day meeting, there may be a total of 5 minutes of non-scripted intervention \u2014 questions, points of order, motions. These items should go into the minutes, and since they are so minuscule and rare, it would be reasonable to provide actual transcripts of those 5 minutes of intervention. Instead, what appears in the official (published!) \u201cminutes/proceedings\u201d may be substantially different from what actually transpired at the meeting. ",

            "answer_text": "Short verbatim reports. Because, interpretations cannot be turned back to the original transcript whereas original quotes can be interpreted whenever required. A good practice is to take short notes (of exact said words) and when you have a moment, augment them in your own words. But do note down the original words. ",
