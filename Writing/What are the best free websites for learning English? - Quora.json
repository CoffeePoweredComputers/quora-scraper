            "answer_text": "Hi there, In order to learn English fast and effectively, I\u2019ve listed some resources and tips to target your listening, reading AND speaking. Some of the sites below are not websites targeted for language learning, however you can still learn a great deal from them. At the end of the day, the best way to learn English is to learn to use the digital resources available in everyday life and use it, whether these are websites, podcasts, videos or more. I really hope this list helps you on your language learning journey! 1. Memorize 10 New Words a Day for 100 Days Here are some ways to do this: Take a look at the Mnemonic Dictionary, and use memory aids to remember words: Fun and easy way to build your vocabulary!

Read Children Books On Kindle in English You may have to leave the ego at the door before reading children books in English. But you\u2019ll be rewarded for it, as children books are perfectly designed for English beginners to master their vocabulary and grammar skills.  3. Watch your favorite show on Netflix with English Audio or Subtitles Since you\u2019re already spending your weekends and nights \u2018Netflixing and Chilling\u2018, why not challenge yourself to learn English online as well? It\u2019s likely that your favorite shows are already streaming in English, so you just have to choose whether you want English subtitles or no subtitles. As a rule of thumb, if you\u2019re: A beginner English speaker: watch with English subtitles and audio in your native languageAn intermediate English speaker: watch with English audio and English subtitlesAn advanced English speaker: watch with just English audio 4.

Luckily for us, that\u2019s easy to find for learning English. When it comes to fun and effectiveness, we love recommending creative English blogs like ESL Hip Hop.

Memorize the chorus of your favorite English song Music is one of the most powerful ways to learn English or any foreign language. You can start by memorizing the chorus of your favorite song, and singing along while you\u2019re working, doing laundry, or jamming with your friends. Once you have the hang of it, challenge yourself to memorize the entire song using lyric tools like Song Lyrics & Knowledge. Don\u2019t worry about understanding the meaning of the lyrics in the beginning. In fact, even native English speakers don\u2019t understand half of what artists are saying in their songs!  7. Play Scrabble online with friends Scrabble is a classic game when it comes to improving your vocabulary skills. While it may feel like a piece of cake playing in your native language, it\u2019s a completely different ball game when you play it in English. Gather some friends that are also looking to improve their English vocabulary skills, and play together online or host a game at your place this weekend! Pogo: SCRABBLE  8.

            "answer_text": "This question is pretty broad, but there are many great resources available for free that will help improve all aspects of your English (reading, writing, speaking, listening). My list may be a bit outdated, but these are tried-and-true resources that I have recommended to many students and each has received positive feedback :) engVid - While the site itself is a bit messy and could definitely use a facelift, the content itself is gold. You can also find their videos on YouTube, where they are separated out into teacher-specific channels. The variety of teachers available is actually my favorite part of engVid! (See the teacher\u2019s note below for why). Check out one of my favorite videos of theirs, about how stress changes meaning. Helps primarily with listening and grammar fundamentals.Membean - Hands down, my favorite online vocabulary resource. They do have paid plans that I also highly recommend for people preparing to take the SAT or GRE, but really it\u2019s their extensive archive of roots that sets them apart. The way they explain roots and related words will turn you into a philologist no time! Helps primarily with vocabulary and reading.Duolingo - Okay, this one is an app, not a website, but it\u2019s so good I had to include it. Education is rarely as addictive or effective as when it is gamified, and Duolingo does a good job of combining the bells and whistles that keep you crushing candy with the repetitive scaffolding that helps you improve retention. Helps with listening, reading, speaking, and writing. Yes, all of them.Breaking News English - Again, this site could definitely use a 2019 makeover, but the concept is great. Real news stories are curated and abridged to multiple levels of fluency, allowing learners to read about current events at a comfortable level. I recommend reading a story at a level that you are comfortable with, getting familiar with the content, and then reading the same article, but one level higher. Helps primarily with reading comprehension and vocabulary.Note from a teacher: As learners, we all have individual preferences regarding what kind of voices/personalities we like to listen to, what kind of content we enjoy reading/watching, etc. It\u2019s important to identify and then cater to your own preferences in order to keep yourself engaged. If you try to force yourself to work through educational materials that don\u2019t interest you, it will feel like just that - work. In my experience both as a teacher and language-learner, it\u2019s imperative to find a way to learn that doesn\u2019t feel like work, so be sure you experiment a bit and try to find enjoyable ways to immerse yourself in English. Let me know which of these you like, or what I should check out and add to my list! ",

            "answer_text": "What is the best way to learn English online for free? I assume that the person who asked this question is not a Digital Learner since he is still interested to learn online. Learning online was popular in the past. Today we should concentrate on mobile learning. Our mobile devices are ubiquitous and multimedia; they can do what teachers can\u2019t. For example, mobile devices can create an environment for your subconscious training of English skills using multimedia comprehensible input that millions of learners can use 24/7 without the need of a teacher or a native speaker. Before I explain some pragmatic points of the mobile application I want to stress that adults experience frustration in learning English because conventional pedagogies dissect the language into individual components and teach reading, speaking, pronunciation, and grammar separately. This environment of Passive Learning and memorization is a wrong approach because a foreign language is not information to be remembered but a skill to be trained.

            "answer_text": "Which is the best site to learn English free? Quora and some language partners website like italki. Learn a language online Although Quora doesn't offer any systematical courses for ESL learners, its pure English speaking environment can help you enhance your reading comprehension at least. But the most important thing is that there are many intelligent users on Quora. They are always trying to help people for free. For this, I have to mention two remarkable gentlemen, although I haven't got their permission.They are Mr. Mikhail Kotykhov and Mr. Frank Dauenhauer.  Their answers are always helpful and practical if you really try to follow their suggestion. One night (GMT+8) I happened to read an answer of Mr. Dauenhauer and wanted to salute him for his great passion and patience of helping people.He had wrote an excellent answer to help someone proofread a paragraph. In real life, you have to pay people for proofreading your work. It isn't an easy job.Here is the answer's link: Frank Dauenhauer's answer to Can someone proofread this paragraph? I am also new here and not sure whether it is proper to mention users and recommend them to other users. If anyone disagree with my misbehavior, please let me know. I will edit or delete this answer.

            "answer_text": "Given that so many online education resources have popped up in the last decade, it really seems like \u2013 as long as you want to learn \u2013 you can learn just about any skill on the internet. I\u2019ll give you a rundown of the best English learning sites I\u2019ve evaluated (most of them are free!), plus a few recommendations on courses to start out with for each. AlisonFounded in 2007, Alison is the original MOOC (massive open online course). The site has 750+ courses, but it focuses primarily on improving workplace skills. For example, they have courses dedicated to helping you get a new job or enhance your value if you\u2019re looking to be promoted internally. With its diverse range of courses though, they really do have materials appropriate for any experience level of English learners. Here are the courses I\u2019d recommend checking out first: Social English Language Skills: This course will help you improve your everyday English conversation.Introduction to English Grammar: As the title suggests, this course will help you improve your English grammar.MOOECMOOEC is short for Massive Open Online English Course, so you know it\u2019s designed expressly for English learners. The courses range from beginner level to advanced English and are generally shorter than other MOOC websites. With other sites, it might take you several weeks to complete a class. Comparatively, many of MOOEC\u2019s classes are single-study classes. If you\u2019re not sure if online learning is right for you, I\u2019d suggest starting off nice and easy with MOOEC. One note: MOOEC is an Australian-based company, so many of the courses discuss locations in Australia. Plus, pronunciation of some words may differ from American English. If you go ahead with MOOEC, here are the courses I\u2019d recommend checking out first: Elementary English Course: If you have just started your English studies, this course is perfect for you.Common Mistakes: This course teaches you how to avoid English mistakes that happen all the time.Coffee Culture: If you are interested in Australian English or Australian culture specifically, you won\u2019t want to miss this class!FutureLearn Most online courses can be completed independently, but FutureLearn actually encourages students of the same course to interact and communicate with their peers. With more than 1 million current users, you\u2019d have plenty of opportunity to interact with other students! FutureLearn\u2019s classes come from more than 40 countries and regions around the world, including some British institutions such as the British Council and the British Museum. Right now, there aren\u2019t any partners from the United States contributing lessons. If your aim is to learn American English, you\u2019d be better off with a different site. But Anglophiles (folks who really admire England) will probably fall in love with this website, starting with these courses: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Writing in English for University Study: A massive boon for anyone who is seeking to study abroad!Understanding IELTS \u2013 Techniques for English Language Tests: This course is very helpful for any type of English exam you might be preparing for, especially IELTS!Exploring English \u2013 Language and Culture: Great for learning more about British culture and improving your English!",

L-Listen Listen audio\u2019s from TED Talks, there you have the world class audios for various topics. Initial stage you can use subtitle in english to understand the conversation better and later on you will good to go without subtitles. W-Write Try writing essays every month with new words you have learned, it will increase your writing skill and also keeps those new words in your memory long time. S-Speak If you follow the first three steps this will be easier. Happy Learning !!! ",

As a kid, I watched Cartoon Network hours a day. The TV station used to repeat all the episodes of different shows over and over again which helped me tremendously. I learned to use new words, English phrases and correct pronunciation very fast. Why? Because of repetitiveness. Today, I still often watch the same videos, or my favourite episodes. It may sound a little bit odd but I see in many cases that during a normal English conversation, I apply new word or a phrase automatically just because I heard it so many times in a show. Of course, you have a huge amount of different helpful tools, mobile apps, websites or books but this method had the greatest impact on me so far. Hope that helps. Cheers. ",

However, there are also many great youtube videos that break down the English language to a molecular level, you will learn a lot just by doing some simply research. Also I should mention, using Youtube is very helpful for your hearing and speaking practice, just click on a video that interests you(for example, history of WW2), and listen to the way native speakers construct their sentences. Most of the time you when you are in a native english speaking country, the people you encounter on daily basis don\u2019t talk like Bob and Jack from your professional English textbook, they use slangs, inside jokes, and varieties of colloquialisms that you would encounter by viewing youtube videos.

My answer will encompass both free websites and apps. First, when we are kids, we learn how to speak by imitating what other people are saying. So the first things to do is to watch English speaking tutorials online and try to imitate. YouTube is probably the best free website where you can search for those tutorials. I would recommend BBC Follow me series as a starting point. Second, speaking requires practice. Try to speak to other English speaking people as much as you can. If you are having trouble finding people to practice, please see my answer in the following Quora link for free websites and apps that may help you find English speaking partners: How do I get an English speaking partner? Hope this helps. ",
