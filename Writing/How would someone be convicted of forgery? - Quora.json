            "answer_text": "First off are you referring to what type of forgery as there are lots by definition. Lets take just one case where some one forged a signature of someone else in order to gain a monetary return. Such as forged signature on a check. Upon being discovered, through normal checks and balances, or by the real person whos signature was forged, a complaint to law enforcement is made. The case would then be assigned a number and to an investigator. The detective would then gain access to the account holders information, and accounts. Questions would be asked, leads followed upon, and so forth. When sufficient evidence is gained to seek an arrest warrant that evidence is then turned over to a prosecutor who will issue the warrant by means of a judicial process. The forger is then sought out and arrested, jailed for trial. At the trial evidence is presented by both sides, prosecutor will show that the accused did and had probable cause to issue the forged item ( check ) and did financial harm to the victim here. The defence will try to show that it was NOT the accused by means of an alibi or that he could not possibly have committed this crime for what ever reason. Upon all evidence from both sides presented, the judge or jury will decide who to believe, prosecution or defense. If found guilty then he is considered convicted and will be sent for punishment according to law. OR if found innocent he/she will be released from incarceration. This is how the law works. A crime is committed, investigated, arrest made, tried and convicted and punished. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many computer programs nowadays that can scan your work and compare it to a plethora of publications. If it is found that your work and another publication match beyond a certain percentage, it will be flagged for forgery and then reviewed by a human. The author may subscribe to this software to prevent forgery or copyright issues and may decide to press charges if he and/or his lawyer believe that forgery has been committed. With regards to forgery of a signature, or work of art, there are professionals who examine these and can usually spot a fake or forgery. To be convicted, your accuser would have to file a case with the police and a court date will be issued. The accuser must provide sufficient evidence to a judge and jury and a conviction will be made. ",
