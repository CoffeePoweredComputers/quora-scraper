            "answer_text": "I was never a law enforcement officer, but I worked for a towing company from June 1999\u2013April 2016. I still work for the company on a part time basis, but due to health reasons I am no longer able to run a truck. Anyway, I don't know when we received it because it was already in place long before I started, but our company held the contract for towing the town owned vehicles. When a law enforcement officer's vehicle breaks down, the officer immediately contacts dispatch to let them know the details of his/her breakdown. This information includes type of vehicle, location and nature of the breakdown any other information such as the easiest and sometimes only way to access him/her. Dispatch then contacts our company to let us know about the incident. A wrecker is then dispatched to pick up the vehicle, and sometimes the officer as well, and the vehicle is then towed to the town's repair garage, the Police Department's repair garage, or, depending on the nature of the breakdown, the new car dealership. The reason for picking up the vehicle but not the officer is that sometimes someone from the Police Department sends someone to the officer with a replacement vehicle or another officer takes him/her back to Headquarters to get a replacement vehicle.

            "answer_text": "\u201cFor cops: Have you ever had your police car break down? How did you deal with the broken car?\u201d Yes, my squad car has died on me during traffic stops, during regular driving, and during emergency driving (Code 3 responses, pursuit driving, etc.). The response is always the same \u2014 cursing loudly, followed by calling for a tow truck to come get the car. If it wasn't busy, another officer would come by to pick me (and a lot of the \u201csensitive\u201d gear in the car) up. If it was busy, the tow truck driver would take me to the police station and wait while I got the stuff out of the car. I got stuck in some deep snow one night and was dreading having to call it in when, suddenly, the City Public Works guys showed up with a front-end loader and plow to clear snow. They graciously filled the bucket with snow and then used it as a \u201cbumper\u201d to push my car about five feet to the cleared roadway\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Oh boy! My first agency was a small municipal department with only one officer on duty at any given time, except for weekdays when the chief was also on duty. All the members of the department had a \u201ctake home\u201d car except for me. When I worked, I drove the chief\u2019s car. I was a brand new out of the academy rookie that had just finished working with a shadow officer. The chief \u201cturned me loose\u201d but told me to not worry any about traffic, but to just patrol the neighborhoods and answer any calls. Oh boy! I\u2019m out on my own, now! As the chief instructed, I was patrolling the neighborhoods throughout the city. At around 0100 local time, I was between neighborhoods, riding down the only major highway that ran through the city. I wasn\u2019t working traffic, but the radar was on. Here came a truck running 90MPH in a 50MPH speed zone. Oh, I HAD to pull that one over! I turned around and raced to catch up to the truck. I activated my overhead lights and got the truck stopped. I checked out on the radio with dispatch, giving the truck\u2019s license plate number and my location. I stepped out to make contact with the violator, and as soon as my foot hit the road\u2026 PPPPPPPHOOOOOSH! The steam coming out from under the hood of my patrol car was so thick I couldn\u2019t see the truck I had pulled over! I made contact with the driver on the passenger side. It was an old man in his late 70s, and had his wife with him. I simply told him to slow down before he killed someone, and they were free to go. His wife asked, \u201cExcuse me, young man, can you give us the number to a tow truck? When we stopped, our truck started smoking something fierce!\u201d \u201cMa\u2019am, that wasn\u2019t your truck, that was my patrol car. I have to go take care of that, now, which is why I\u2019m not writing one whopper of a ticket. Y\u2019all drive careful!\u201d So, I blew up the chief\u2019s car. One my very first traffic stop. On my own. On my very first night working by myself. Yea. Go me. I called the officer that was relieving me in the morning. He brought his patrol car in, and I had to give him a ride home. I finished my shift, then picked him up when it was time for his shift to start. He gave me a ride back to the station. I didn\u2019t write a \u201cDear Chief\u201d letter\u2026 I called him. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer...we have arrangements with towing companies, or our own agency tow trucks to get our broken down vehicles to the repair shop. Long story. Cops cars, near the end of their career, break down all the time. I was once in pursuit of a fast convertible and my car actually died as I turned a corner. I was able to shift to neutral and start it up again, continuing the pursuit. We went on for about another half mile and he took another turn. Again, the car died and tried the same trick. It rolled to the side of the road and we sat there for 2-3 minutes until it started, again. I found the car abandoned at the Sheraton Universal Hotel, on a night with many activities going on, so the driver and passenger just mixed in with the various crowds. I found the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous in the car, autographed by many people who supplied their phone numbers and wished the owner well, within a couple of days. As a recovering alcoholic I recognized that the guy had just left treatment, likely relapsed and did not want to be caught DUI. I autographed his Big Book, too, wishing him well and hoping he'd finally got a handle on his disease. ",

Alternator went out - Coast to the side of the road and call for a tow truck. Get another officer to give me a ride to pick up a spare car. Weird problem where accelerating from a stop caused my steering wheel to turn - Limp the car to the mechanic shop and call for a ride. Get chewed out by the boss the next day because it turns out the problem was caused by me going all Dukes of Hazard and getting airborne over some steep railroad tracks during a chase. Apparently, during the landing from that jump I'd broken one of the car's massive motor mounts so that when I put the engine into a high torque situation, like accelerating from a stop, it was actually twisting itself out of place and leaning against some part of the steering mechanism. I was lucky it didn't fall right out of the car. ",

It was handled by the book, by radioing for a tow truck (this was back in the BC \u2014 Before Cellphone \u2014 days), which was the beginning of my nightmare. Each and every member of each and every agency in our County that I knew drove by, rolled their window down, and asked if I needed help (conveniently, this little incident took place across the street from the government center). When informed (yeah, right, nobody heard the call go out) that the tow truck was on the way, each waved and drove off. When I made it in to the office, I got tagged with the nickname \u201cCrash\". What really hurt was I didn't even have a decent story to tell \u2014 I was only going about 10 mph when the car decided to become a self-driving one! ",

A contract tow company then shows up and tows the car back to the station. From there, either the station mechanics fix it, or it is towed to our main vehicle facility in Los Angeles on \u201cSheriff\u2019s Road\u201d. One time I was responding code 3 (lights and siren) to a shooting. I drove over some railroad tracks, and my siren (PA part of it) fell off my car. I had to advise I was shutting down my code 3 response since I no longer had the ability to sound a siren as necessary. This didn\u2019t disable my car (or stop my response to the call). ",

The supervisor will pick the officer up and get him or her into a standby car quickly. Like another writer though, I once got my car stuck badly in snow. It was the blizzard of \u201878. I misjudged a drift and tried to plow through, forgetting that in this section of road, it dipped sharply, like several feet. Hey it was 3 am I wasn\u2019t quite as sharp as I should have been. How deep was I? Deep enough that I had to roll down the window and climb out on the roof. This is something you really don\u2019t want to have to do as a probationary officer but I got a lot of slack, officially at least, although the officers razzed me pretty hard\u2026in good fun of course. A sergeant arrived in his private 4x4 (anyone with a personal 4x4 was driving it that night on the city\u2019s gas and the city had also hit some dealerships buying several Broncos and the Chevy equivalent, and put tire chains on the squads), threw a chain on and pulled me out backwards.

The best is the time years ago when my training officer and I were on patrol when I felt a bump, heard a horrible noise and watched as the tire flew past us into a house, (where a lady was watching this circus unfold). The maintenance staff forgot to tighten the lug nuts. We called the maintenance staff out. The best part was when he tried to convince us that the \u201ccold weather\u201d had caused the lug nuts to come loose. The worst is when you are stuck because you drove were you shouldn\u2019t have and you are obviously stuck, (like halfway in a median or halfway in a ditch, or in a road with too much snow). It is quite embarrassing. EDIT: You call the dispatcher and wait for someone to come, while half of humanity slowly drives by, (or so it seems) taking pictures. Then your co-workers get a good laugh at your predicament. ",
