            "answer_text": "Using the word \u2018thanks\u2019 is a gross way to express your gratitude. Though it is difficult to replace \u2018thanks\u2019, but there are many subtle ways of telling someone that you are really grateful. You have to develop the art of communication which enables you to express the same emotion in different ways. Let\u2019s take different ways of thanking people without using the word \u2018thanks\u2019. However if you use it along with these sentences, they becomes more emphatic. Example 1. Someone offers you a help. You can express your emotion by saying/writing : \u2018That\u2019s very kind of you\u2019. Example 2. Someone helps you to solve your problem of math. You may express yourself by saying/writing : \u2018It\u2019s really nice of you to solve this problem for me\u2019. Example 3. You\u2019ve left your friend\u2019s house after an enjoyable dinner party. You can express your \u2018thanks\u2019 by texting : \u2018It\u2019s been a wonderful evening\u2019. Example 4. You, on behalf of your colleagues, have to express your gratefulness to a speaker X , who has given you a talk on Yoga. You can do it by saying or writing him later : \u2018Mr X, we\u2019d like to express our gratitude for a wonderful talk on Yoga\u2019. Or \u2018Mr X, we are grateful to you for your wonderful talk on Yoga\u2019. It is not necessary that you should use only the gross words for a particular emotion. You need to have a subtle understanding of your emotion. Only then you\u2019ll be able to use different and subtler ways to express the same emotion that suit the situation you are in and the people you are with. ",
