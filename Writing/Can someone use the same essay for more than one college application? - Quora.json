Just make sure you change the school name if you included it in your essay anywhere. Imagine how embarrassing that would be if I later realized I forgot to change \u201cand that\u2019s why I want to go to Florida State\u201d when I sent the essay to UF. Immediate rejection. However I do not recommend taking such an easy way out, especially if you are applying to more competitive colleges. I believe they want to see something more specialized to them. I could get away with it though because in reality I made my essay to FSU specifically. I used the same one with some easier schools that I knew for sure I would get in, and didn\u2019t really care about UF. FSU>UF ",
