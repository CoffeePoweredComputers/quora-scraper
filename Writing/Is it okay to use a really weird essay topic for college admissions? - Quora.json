            "answer_text": "If you choose your own prompt, you can write about anything you want. There are numerous theories on what makes a good essay. You can pay college consultants tens of thousands of dollars for their professional advice on how to make your essay stand out and you application get you admitted to an elite college or university. What do you hope to gain by choosing to write a weird essay - show the schools that read you essay that you are weird? Not sure that being weird is a virtue when there are so many earnest young men and women who are trying very hard to craft a narrative that shows the schools they apply to what value they will bring these schools. A college application essay is like a job interview. The school is looking for students who fit their culture, will enhance their student body, raise their ranking, and be stalwart alumni after they graduate. They are not looking for weird characters who would stand out on Halloween night. If by weird, you mean showing how you aren\u2019t the run of a mill college applicant who fits the mean but really isn\u2019t all that inspiring, then sure state your case for why you are an outlier who will fit in with all the other outlier applicants who are trying to gain admission into an elite university or college made up of outlier students.

When I visited UChicago, the Dean of Admissions told a story about a really interesting essay written by a girl, which was about cannibalism. The girl wrote about how if she were forced to eat people, she wouldn't necessarily eat the best tasting people, or the ones with most tender meat. Instead, she wrote, she would want to eat the interesting people, the ones with most unique textures. And, she concluded, that's why she wanted to attend UChicago. She wanted to be with interesting people and be able to experience diverse cultures. She was accepted in to UChicago. ",

It is an Answer to a question that the college\u2019s admission committee has posed to you and they want to hear \u201cyour voice\u201d through your written words. Pretend you are seated at a table, and across from you are the three admissions officers who will make the major decision to Admit or Reject you. They have read everything else in your application including all letters of recommendation and now they merely want to hear your Answers to a few questions. They are three adults of different ethic background, race, sex, and political philosophy. Now Answer their questions. Period. Only write a Weird answer if you believe you are a Weird person and want to use that to get admitted to that college, because you sense an openness for your weirdness at that college. All the best.

The 1% is if you write an essay about something inappropriate, unsavory, or illegal (writing an essay in those categories may be a call for support and help, and every person should have access to help). So the questions I have for you are: (1) what do you mean by weird? and (2) why do you want to write about it? Again, if you update the question with those two answers, more people can give you specific guidance. Lastly - what may be weird to one person, is normal to another. So, 99% of the time, I wouldn\u2019t worry. Good luck, Aleks ",

The weirder the topic, the better your writing must be in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, diction, and so on. Also, there is no substitute for good writing. If you are applying to Cat Tech, MIT, etc., write a brilliant essay in computer code that only a genius can decode and get the joke. Something like a new episode of the Big Bang Theory, but a new episode much funnier and surprising. You better be smart too. I went to college over 50 years ago at U California Berkeley, wrote a really clever essay, got in, and flunked out. I eventually graduated somewhere else. So don\u2019t aim for above your level. ",
