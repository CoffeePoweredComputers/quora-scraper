            "answer_text": "We all agree that it is not correct. I will explain what I think you are trying to say and why it doesn\u2019t work: That place is full of something. For example: That closet is full of clothes. That city is full of people. Then you\u2019re thinking that we can use the word \u201cthere\u201d to mean \u201cthat place.\u201d And we can: Put your clothes in the closet-> Put your clothes there. I want to go to that city-> I want to go there. But! When \u201cthere\u201d means \u201cthat place\u201d it can only be an adverb. It cannot be the subject of the sentence. However! There\u2019s a different word \u201cthere\u201d that does NOT mean \u201cin that place.\u201d It is only used as the fill-in subject of a sentence; there is or there are. It means \u201cexists.\u201d A pond exists in that place-> There is a pond there. The first \u201cthere\u201d means exists. The second \u201cthere\u201d means \u201cin that place.\u201d Some people are in that place-> There are some people there. The first \u201cthere\u201d means exists. The second \u201cthere\u201d means \u201cin that place.\u201d ~~~ So the problem with your sentence is that you are using the \u201cin-that-place\u201d meaning in a spot where you can only use the \u201cexists\u201d meaning. You are mixing them both together. And that doesn\u2019t work. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it is not correct, and I\u2019m not even clear about what it is trying to say. Some context would be helpful here. If you had noticed that some bags or boxes were unexpectedly heavy, but did not know what was in them, you could say: \u2018They are full of something!\u2019 or \u2018They seem to be full of something!\u2019 or \u2018They must be full of something!\u2019 But never \u2018there must be full of something\u2019. Also, there is no reason I can think of why you would normally want to put single inverted commas just around the word \u2018something\u2019. Perhaps if you were referring not to an unknown thing but to something in particular, and you knew what that thing was and your audience also knew what it was, but you didn\u2019t want to say what it was out loud because the thing in question was a big secret between the two of you, then it might make some kind of sense to add the inverted commas!

The wrong version of \u201cthere are\u201d has been used. Of the three similar sounding words: there, their and they\u2019re; \u201cthey\u2019re\u201d, meaning, \u201cThey are\u201d, should have been used. In Britain, \u201cthey\u2019re full of something\u201d, is sometime used as a semi-sarcastic, witty retort to someone who has just said something that included the phrase \u201cfull of\u201d. I.e.: Person 1: They are full of the joys of Spring. Person 2: They\u2019re full of something! (meaning Winter is over and hormones have begun to rise). ",
