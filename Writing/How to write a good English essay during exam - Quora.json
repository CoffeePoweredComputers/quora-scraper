            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure if you mean, write a good essay exam in English (the language) or write a good English (the subject) essay exam. This is what I tell my students: Write like your life depends on it. If you are writing in a blue book and you think you are done after writing a page or two, you are not done. You will not pass the exam. Nobody can write a very good comprehensive essay in two pages of a blue book. I blame the ridiculous 5 paragraph essay format. This is something the American education seems to love to teach. If you are 11 years old, great. Learn how to properly shape your essay but then expand your knowledge. I noticed students in the UK were writing much longer essays at 13 than I had been required to write in gifted English at 16 and 17. The first thing to spend some time on is the question. You should not panic. If you do, breathe deeply. Relax. Then think about how to create an introductory paragraph with a thesis statement that will help guide you. Whenever I used to get lost when writing long papers in graduate school, I would look back at my thesis statement to keep my argument on track. It is your map and guide. It won\u2019t let you down. The one thing that is imperative to remember, no matter what the subject, is to back up your assertions with solid and clear examples. If you just throw ideas into the ether and you do not back them up with an example that clearly illustrates and proves your idea, you are not making a solid argument. You are chattering away in a blue book. If your essay is about a book that you read, make sure that you know the book well enough to give solid examples of characters, scenes and narrative devices. If your book is a certain genre you are studying, make sure you know some examples that typify that genre. I also tell my students to get as detailed as possible with their examples. I have noticed the more detailed they get, the better they know their subject and the better they do on the exam. Finally, don\u2019t forget your conclusion, even if it is just a few sentences. Also, make sure to bring multiple pens and at least an extra blue book. I can\u2019t tell you how many times students forget these things. ",

            "answer_text": "In my school days, essay writing used to be my favorite part of learning the English language. While Romi Stepovich has given some excellent points to craft your essay, here are my personal insights: Make your essay as conversational as possible. Usher in the human element and talk. See how Chimamnad Ngoze begins her essay, FEMINIST MANIFESTO IN FIFTEEN SUGGESTIONS,\u201cDear Ijeawele,What joy. And what lovely names: Chizalum Adaora. She is so beautiful. Only a day old and she already looks curious about the world. Your note made me cry. You know how I get foolishly emotional sometimes. Please know that I take your charge \u2013 how to raise her feminist \u2013 very seriously. And I understand what you mean by not always knowing what the feminist response to situations should be. For me, feminism is always contextual. I don\u2019t have a set-in-stone rule; the closest I have to a formula are my two \u2018Feminist Tools\u2019 and I want to share them with you as a starting point.\u201d 2. If you need to present statistics, tie them to a human emotion or a thought provoking question. Do not present them as dry statements. 3. Do not be afraid to be vulnerable. Roxane gay in one of her essays says this:\u201cPink is my favorite color. I used to say my favorite color was black to be cool, but it is pink\u2014all shades of pink. If I have an accessory, it is probably pink. I read Vogue, and I\u2019m not doing it ironically, though it might seem that way. I once live-tweeted the September issue.\u201d Bring back the fun element into your writing. Provoke people to think. Remember, whether it be your college essay or a feature you are doing for a magazine, your aim is make people think and if possible bring about a paradigm shift in their perceptions. 4. Let your essay be a potpourri of sensory experiences. Show the reader what you see, make them listen to the chaos and pauses in the piece. Create a movement with your words. 5. Finally the conclusion. Bring the epiphany in. Let it be a reflection. or a strong question. Challenge the reader. Let the after taste remain with the reader long after they have read your essay. 6. Feel proud of what you have written. 7. Let it be a catalyst for further work. Cheers and happy writing. ",

            "answer_text": "Your essay should start with you stating the subject that you are going to be talking about. You should then quickly tell the reader what you are going to say about that subject, the main points of your piece. Good Flow is essential to clear writing. Your next sentence should always be one that the reader would naturally expect to see having just read your previous sentence. Either write about the subject of the previous sentence or the object. Do not suddenly start writing about cows. Don\u2019t switch ideas until the next paragraph. One paragraph should contain only one idea. And please remove all information from your writing that doesn\u2019t contribute to the ideas (points) you are attempting to convey to the reader. In summary, you should first decide the subject of your essay and then the points you wish to say about that topic. Think of a logical way to present your points. Then concentrate on writing only about those points\u2014and nothing else. And when you edit your essay, remove everything that would be obvious to a reader or superfluous to your main points. And when your teacher reads your piece, you will get an \u201cA\u201d if your essay flows well and the teacher easily understood the main points of your piece. ",

Then tell them what you just told them.\u201d Well, that\u2019s your introduction, your body (with examples), and your conclusion. But it\u2019s so much easier to think of it his way. So, write your introduction literally answering the question, \u201cWhat am I going to tell you?\u201d Write your body telling them what you want to tell them. Then write your conclusion literally answering the question, \u201cWhat did I just tell you?\u201d Always write as though you are writing to someone. ",
