            "answer_text": "Absolutely. If you want access to possibly hundreds of millions of book buyers located from all four corners of the globe, Amazon is pretty much the only game in town. Now, you probably may be thinking that Amazon is so big that it's hard to make money. Well, that's only true if you don't take the time to fully understand how to be successful on Amazon. You have to remember that there are many categories and subcategories on Amazon. It's very easy to lose yourself in that whole process if you're looking for a book. It is no surprise that a lot of book buyers end up buying a book that they weren't actually searching for. As long as you know how that system works and you know how to spot the right keywords and you know how to spot hot niches, you can publish a book that will not only sell, but sell well. I've got some good news for you. If your Amazon Kindle book ranks 10,000 or better, you're pretty much guaranteed $10,000 per year for the life of that book. Think about that. You write that book once, but it gives you a $10,000 check every year. What if you write five books? Ten books? Twenty books? Do you see the math? It is no surprise that a lot of authors on Amazon Kindle have 200 titles to their name. Now, you know, I know, and anybody with more than two brain cells can understand that they didn't write all those 200 books themselves. They had ghost writers, like Lisa Richmond or Gene Eugenio, write those books for $99 or less a pop. There are expert native English speaker American authors who ghost write for very little money. So don't think that you have to write all your books yourself if you're going to self-publish on Amazon. The name of the game is to know how the Amazon system works, position your book properly, and learn from your mistakes. Your first book or first ten books may be flat out flops, but that's a small price to pay because, at the end of the day, it's all about dominating the system. And if others can do it, what's stopping you? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes !! When Amazon started the KDP system, I believe it revolutionized the publishing industry. Now, ordinary people like me could publish their works without worrying if they were ever going to be accepted by a traditional publisher. This was particularly important to authors like myself, who write in a non-mainstream genre. Amazon also makes the process very easy. Provided you have your Word docx, with standard margins and fonts, you can upload that file as it is, and the Amazon converting machine turns it into mobi format for you. KDP also allows you to upload graphics to create your cover, using one of their templates, or you can create one, and upload that yourself. The KU system is also a good idea for new authors on Amazon. While the system doesn\u2019t work in terms of payments for authors (I make more out of a royalty sale than a KU page read system per title), by listing the book with KU for 90 days, a new author is more likely to get readers to take a chance on their book, than if it is only available for sale. The sales reporting on Amazon is also good. I check my dashboard every day, keeping an eye on what is selling, and where I might have any refunded books. I have only had one issue with Amazon over payments and that happened recently when they had a glitch with their UK/Europe payment system. Apart from that, the money arrives every month, just as I have come to expect it to. Originally, paperback versions of your books were done by Createspace, but Amazon has recently rolled that into it\u2019s own KDP system now. I wasn\u2019t happy about that at first (I had to transfer all my books), but the new system now offered by Amazon for your print on demand books seems to work as well, if not better than the previous Createspace system, and it\u2019s handy seeing sales noted alongside the ebook version in the dashboard. There are other platforms, yes. I also publish my books through Smashwords as I have a small percentage of my readers who won\u2019t or can\u2019t use Amazon. This does mean I can\u2019t use KU for my titles (I wouldn\u2019t anyway, as I explained above), but I have found ninety five percent of my sales come through Amazon. Thank you for your A2A and have a nice day :) ",
