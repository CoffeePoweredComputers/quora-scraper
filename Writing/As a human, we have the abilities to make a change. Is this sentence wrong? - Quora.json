Best fit would be \u201cAs humans, we\u201d; you could say \u201cAs a human, you\u201d or \u201cAs a human, I\u201d, but that would be more dependant on context. \u201chave the abilities\u201d - not completely wrong, but since you\u2019re talking about a single characteristic that humans possess, it\u2019d be more normal to put this in the singular: \u201chave the ability\u201d. \u201cmake a change\u201d - our ability isn\u2019t limited to making one change only. \u201cmake changes\u201d would be more appropriate; \u201cmake change\u201d could also be used (meaning that we can make \u201cchange\u201d as an abstract concept as opposed to \u201cchanges\u201d as individual concrete things) but it\u2019s less common. So: \u201cAs humans, we have the ability to make changes.\u201d ",
