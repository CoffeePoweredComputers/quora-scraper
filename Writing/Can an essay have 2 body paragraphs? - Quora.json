            "answer_text": "Yes. It can also have only one if you so desire. There is an issue with your question though. An essay is split into sections not paragraphs. While shorter essays will often have one paragraph per section most will have multiple. Paragraph and section are not interchangeable terms. If you wish to only have two paragraphs then you will need to make the core point sections into one paragraph. I would advise against this though. The reason most essays are structured with 5 total sections is because they cover everything that you need to have in an essay. If you consider that you can\u2019t skip the introduction or the conclusion then the body sections are the only ones you can fiddle around with. You could have the discussion section pushed into the conclusion for shorter essays or you could combine elsewhere but the point remains that if you need to compare and contrast two different ideas and topics then you are going to have to have two different sections for that. If your essay doesn\u2019t require a compare and contrast level of comparison then I don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t squash the sections down. At the end of the day it is up to you and the teacher you are handing the work to whether it is a good idea or not. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s nothing magic about having three body paragraphs. Have as many as you need to get your ideas across. The topic sentences of your body paragraphs should be determined by how you grouped your notes when you were outlining. Each body paragraph contains one main idea, backed up by textual evidence and your own analysis. Your analysis should make up the majority of your paragraph. The first part of your point should be a sentence or two that transitions into your quote and explains the topic your quote addresses. There should be a transition between each paragraph of the paper that introduces what the new paragraph is about and how it relates to the previous one. Visit here. ",
