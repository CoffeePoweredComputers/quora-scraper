            "answer_text": "\u201cOf course\u201d can be used in many ways; sarcastically, as an exclamation, as a superlative or exaggeration. I wouldn\u2019t use it this way in an academic context. However, generally speaking, I see no problem using it to observe an obvious conclusion. Of course*, you also have to consider for whom you are writing, and does that person, group, or publication have an opinion on the matter. Academics can get quite wound up over such things. *I would consider that a fair example of using the expression in a loosely academic context. I see writing as a balance between clarity and creativity. Academic writing will demand clarity, but that doesn\u2019t mean creative choices are nonexistent. While I might often chose different ways to express this logic, I certainly would not preclude \u201cof course\u201d just because of the academic style. ",

            "answer_text": "I dont think so, Though it can be used in certain kind of technical Writing but You can not use it in academic Writing. Academic writing is all about your erudition and dictions, use of \u2018Of Course\u2019 over here, is kind of deflect in your writing and also its use can be abused. Academic Writing all you need is proper intoduction , outline, good language, approch and a proper conclusion. So i dont think that using this type of Word would be benifical especially on academic writing. But still It depends on who is going to read it. ",
