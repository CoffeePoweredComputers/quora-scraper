            "answer_text": "Generally? Yes, Asians do condemn premarital sex. Though I was born in the US, I was raised for the first 19 years of my life in Indonesia and Singapore. I've been acquainted and befriended schoolmates from Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Japan, and PRC too. Therefore, I understand the mindset of many Asians quite well...not just Asian Americans. Some of these condemnations stem from conservative religious values or traditions (e.g. Muslim culture in Malaysia, Buddhist culture in Thailand).  But here is where it gets interesting: Asian men and women enjoy watching porn just like their Western counterparts. Also, though many Asian countries outlaw prostitution, the enforcement is often lax. I have personally known several men of my age in Indonesia and Singapore who have slept with prostitutes (note: I am in my 20s). Basically, there is a double standard is prevalent in these countries, even in Japan, which is famous for its Love Hotels and hentai mangas. This is not just for the individuals in the couple itself, but also for the future parent-in-laws. Though it is no longer common to find arranged marriages in Asia, approval from parents is still a huge thing over there. In America, if your parents disapprove of your current boyfriend, you can still say \"fuck it, I'm moving out!\" or \"This is my life, so please don't dictate over my life!\". Not so in most Asian countries. Having parental approval is almost an absolute prerequisite. So, how do you approach this issue? Just be honest to the Asian man you are dating. If he asks, just tell him that you are not a virgin anymore, and that you regret losing it in the first place. Since you are a woman raised in Western culture, it is kinda \"natural\" for you to not be a virgin at your age (seeing from your context, I am guessing that you are either in your 20s or 30s). Hollywood movies and TV shows are quite prevalent in Asian countries, and though the sex scenes are often censored, it is quite easy for them to get pirated copies of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", \"Fatal Attraction\", or even the \"American Pie\" franchise. Lots of Asian men know that from those movies that many American women have had premarital sex. So it may not come as a surprise to them if you have had it. And if he happens to be unable to accept you for that, then well...he is not for you. You just have to accept that there is nothing wrong with you, since people make mistakes all the time, and if he is not willing to forgive you for that mistake you committed in the past, then it is time for you to move on and seek someone else who is more accepting of you.

However, that being said.....It's really common to see teasers on magazine covers with Asian celebrities discussing how they maintain their virginity, but have done everything else.  It all seems pretty high school to me. You've had anal and oral sex, you've been fingered and yet somehow you're a virgin?  So ask yourself this. Are these guys actually experienced, but claiming to be virgins?  It all seems really hypocritical to me. ",

I have never heard of guys who had such objections.  My experience is confined to India and Singapore.  I have seen Asian catholics who may have some reservations.   I won't attempt to explain your situation. ",
