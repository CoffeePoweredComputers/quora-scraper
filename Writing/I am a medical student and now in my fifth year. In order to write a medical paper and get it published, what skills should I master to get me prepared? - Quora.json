            "answer_text": " Our medical students publish papers all the time; you don\u2019t have to take a crash course in laboratory research to do so. Most of their publications involve clinical reports, in collaboration with an attending, such as a chart study on the efficacy of a new drug, a case report of an unusual orthopedic condition, or a rare tumor discovered at surgery. All that is required is to ask to hook up with an attending and them them you want their help in getting you published. ",
