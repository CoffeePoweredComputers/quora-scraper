            "answer_text": "To write a novel is not an easy task.  It takes time.  So the first thing is don\u2019t worry about how long it will take before you have a completed book.  It will be done when it\u2019s done.  I suggest you write just about every day.  Try not to let too much time go by between writing.  You tend to lose your story, forget your characters, and lose momentum when you don\u2019t keep at it.  Save your writing work every day.  You never know when your computer will crash.  I have a general idea of how my story is going to start and how it's going to end.  I wing it a bit from there.  People who don't outline are callled pantsers, as we write by the seat of our pants.  Plotters, well, they do charts and plot everything out.  I find once I start writing sometimes the characters will tell me what's going to happen next.. and that would just ruin all that charting stuff.  lol.   When I write I stop at a logical point and I always write the opening line that I\u2019m going begin with the next day.  That way I\u2019m never stuck and I have my beginning line to get me going.  I usually read what I\u2019ve written yesterday, to get me up to speed to where I want to go today and to refresh my memory of the track the story is taking. The way I write is I write the chapter, or perhaps just one scene if it\u2019s complicated, and I stop. I go back and edit it, and rewrite it, and tweak it until it\u2019s perfect.  I check for verb tenses, and make sure I didn\u2019t use too many ing or ly words.  I take a look at my sentences and make sure I changed them up, meaning I used some short ones, and some longer ones.  I check to make sure my writing is deep, and not passive.  Meaning, I \u2018show\u2019 I don\u2019t tell.  An example of this would be the sentence:  She wore her blue dress.  I\u2019d change it to:  She decided to wear her blue dress, the one that hugged all her curves, and made his mouth go dry.  You can almost see the dress in the second example because I \u201cshowed\u201d it to you.  Be sure your punctuation is correct.  Take out any exclamation points, they are a sign of a new writer and they tell rather than show.  An example of this:  She yelled, \u201cno!\u201d  OR  \u201cNo,\u201d she yelled, hitting her fist on the table so hard the dishes rattled.    Once my piece is perfect, I move on.  This eliminates heavy editing at the end.  Some people like to write through, meaning they get the story out first, and then go back and start editing.  You\u2019ll find your own method once you get rolling. First, pick your genre. What do you want to write? Romance?  Thriller?  Mystery?I usually formulate my plot next.  What\u2019s going to happen?  If it\u2019s a mystery, who is getting killed?  Why?  Who does everyone think the killer is?  Who is the real killer?  Why did he kill?  At that point I start to put in characters because I know what I need.  Characters.  Make the reader want to date the hero and be best friends with the heroine.  I can\u2019t stress this enough.  People read books for the characters.  Think about the character Indiana Jones.  We love him. We don\u2019t care what country he goes to or what artifact he\u2019s looking for.  We want to see how he handles things.  And we\u2019ll go to movie after movie to see him.  Write characters that your readers will want to see more of in your next book. Make us care about them.  Make them human, meaning give them some emotional baggage.  Inner and outer conflict.  Besides the main story conflict (having to solve the murder), have an inner conflict that your H/H (hero/heroine) are working on or struggling with.  Indiana Jones had to go into the pit with snakes. He hates snakes.  Maybe your character doesn\u2019t trust men because she\u2019s been hurt, but she has to trust the detective handling her case.  Have them learn something and grow by the end of the book.  This is \u201cinner\u201d conflict and readers identify with it. Length of your book. A longer book is expensive to produce and publishing houses tend to be leery.  Too short, and it\u2019s a novella. There\u2019s a sweet spot where readers feel they have gotten their money\u2019s worth.Page length for a novel:80,000 \u2013 89,999:       Normal.90,000 \u2013 99,999:       Generally safe70,000 \u2013 79,999:       Might be too short; probably all right for a romance.100,000 \u2013 109,999:    Getting on the long side.Below 70,000:           Too short110,000 or above       Too long How long should your chapters be?  They can be one page or 20 pages.  This is all about your style of writing.  Each chapter should move the story along in some manner.  Never just throw in a chapter to talk about the weather or what your H/H is wearing or eating. Try to avoid dream scenes.  Readers just hate them.  They\u2019re meaningless.  Stick to one or two points of view.  Tell the story through the eyes of your H/H only if you can, and never switch POVs in the middle of a scene or paragraph. This is called head hopping and it\u2019s another sign of a beginning writer.  Editors hate it and will ask for a change. Decide if you want to tell the story in first person limited or third person limited. There are other ways to do it but these sell the best.  \u201cI liked the movie.\u201d  First person. \u201cShe liked the movie.\u201d Third person. Google this on-line for a better explanation because it is important.  Limited means you only tell things through the eyes of the H/H, what they see and feel. Writing is an art, but it\u2019s a learned art.  I highly suggest you take writing classes.  They offer them at most community colleges and there are great classes on-line for around $25 per class.  You can learn how to create compelling characters, create a story arc, learn scene writing, realistic dialogue, plot twists, killer opening sentences and chapter hooks, how to write a good villain, titles, themes, pacing, building suspense \u2026 to name just a few.  You also get to bring in your work each week for the other students to critique.  This is a great learning experience.

            "answer_text": "Step 1 \u2013 The One Sentence Summary Start by writing a one-sentence summary of your novel. Don't concern yourself with the names of the characters at this stage, just describe the character e.g. \"a retired tennis star\". So, the sentence could read something like this, \"A retired tennis star becomes embroiled in a mafia hit plot after agreeing to coach the mob boss's daughter\". Take care when writing this sentence as, when you come to write your book proposal for publishers or agents, this sentence will be a prominent feature \u2013 it'll act as the hook to sell you novel. Step 2 \u2013 Describe the story Now you need to expand the sentence you've just created into a paragraph of about five sentences. A popular way to structure novels is to have a three-act structure: Use the beginning (the first act) to lead your reader in, introducing the main characters, setting up the main conflict and confirming the time of the book. Use the middle (the second act) to develop your themes and reveal more about the main characters. But, make sure you have enough conflict and tension here or it can start to drag. In the end section (the third act), the story needs to go up a gear; this is where it should reach a climax. Eventually, you should tie-up most of the loose ends, but there's nothing like a few unresolved problems to get your readers demanding a sequel! Step 3 \u2013 Characters Now you need to turn your attentions to one of the most important part of the story \u2013 the characters. For each major character write a one page summary that includes: name storyline \u2013 what part will they play in the plot goal \u2013 what do they want motivation \u2013 why do they want it conflict \u2013 what stops them from getting it epiphany \u2013 what will they learn or how will they change End with a one-paragraph summary of the whole storyline for this character. These are working drafts so changing them as you go is normal. Remember, writing a book typically involves extensive planning and revising as part of the process. Step 4 \u2013 Expanding Now you should expand each of the five sentences you've created for Step 2 into a paragraph. By the time you've completed this you should have a one-page description of your book \u2013 it'll still only be the bare bones but it will give you a good idea as to whether the story works or not. If not, you can change it now, before your start writing in earnest. Step 5 \u2013 Back to the characters Now go back to your characters and write a one-page synopsis for each of them. It's useful to write this from the viewpoint of the character. This will help you get to know your characters, see where their story is going and, ultimately, whether they should be in the story or not. Step 6 \u2013 Back to the plot As before, go back to the one-page plot summary completed for Step 4 and do the same \u2013 fleshing out the main plot line and any sub-plots and flash backs and including more detail to create a four-page synopsis. Step 7 \u2013 Bringing characters to life The one-page character synopsis can now be expanded into fully fledged character charts including the minutiae of their lives, such as: birth dates description i.e. hair colour, height, weight etc likes and dislikes history hobbies work But, most importantly, you should decide how the character will change throughout the story. This teaches you more about your characters and the role they have to play in the story. Make sure each is a living, breathing character, not a two dimensional sterotype. Step 8 \u2013 Setting the scenes Starting with your four-page synopsis from Step 6 and write down all the scenes you need to turn it into a novel. Each scene should detail: what happens which characters point-of-view the scene is being told from conflict/tension points and hooks that will drag the reader from chapter to chapter As with most aspects of the novel at this stage, it's moveable and gives you a really good insight into how the story moves along. You can easily see if it has a good flow and where changes need to be made. Step 9 \u2013 Writing your novel Now, the hard part starts \u2013 writing the novel! You should be able to get through this draft pretty quickly as there'll be no wondering what comes next or who does what \u2013 all this has already been decided. Step 10 \u2013 Edit and re-draft! Don't expect your novel to be perfect after the first draft \u2013 it won't be. That's why you should now put it to one side for a week or two, then go back to it and start editing and redrafting. Keep doing this until you are completely happy with it. It might, and often does, take several attempts to get it right, so don't give up if you think it's not working. And finally, make sure you enjoy the process. Writing a novel is usually the biggest project most people have ever attempted so it'll be so much better if you actually get pleasure from doing it.
