            "answer_text": "50,000 words is a pretty daunting task, especially when you're starting off with just a blank page and nothing more than the seed of an idea \u2014 but as I've discovered, with the right approach, winning NaNoWriMo is within the grasp of the greenest of authors. You\u2019d be surprised at the number of now big-name authors who got started with NaNoWriMo (Joanna Penn is one of them). I recently got in touch with a bunch of authors and editors in my network to ask them for their #1 advice for fledgling NaNo authors, so I\u2019ll share some of it here. Pre-NaNoWriMo: Planning your book and your routine If your ultimate goal is to sell books, you need to 'write to market.' But to make sure you reach the NaNo finishing line, you need to be writing the kind of book you LOVE. Anything less than that and you'll struggle after the first few days.Distil the concept of your novel into a single sentence. If you can nail down that compelling one-sentence concept summary that describes your protagonist and his/her goal, you know you're in a great place to start NaNoWriMo.Draft an outline. That can either be a detailed chapter-by-chapter plan, details of your major scenes, or a general three-act structure (if that's what you're going for). You ending can always change, but if you don't have any direction to aim for, you'll end up losing yourself in the wilderness of the world you create.Building your Routine Set some rules of when must you write, and when must you not write. NaNoWriMo is as much about finding a creative routine as it is about writing a book. Tell your friends about your writing plans, so they don't tempt you to break it by inviting you to a last-minute dinner party. By the same token, build in some time off \u2014 for Thanksgiving for example.If you can't write for two hours at a time, plan some 15-minute 'sprints' each day instead. You'll be surprised how productive you can be in that amount of time.Reaching your 50,000 words in 30 days Don\u2019t expect your writing to be perfect: enjoy and explore. The great thing about NaNoWriMo is that nobody has to read your first draft apart from you. It's an opportunity for you to collect ideas and make mistakes; mistakes that might result in some genuine inspiration.Don't edit as you go. Creating and editing each solicit different parts of the brain (or so I've been told). If you worry about how you've phrased every sentence, you'll never reach your daily word count.Treat your NaNoWriMo draft like a resource gathering trip. One of the editors I spoke to used a charming metaphor: your NaNoWriMo draft is like putting sand into a sandbox. When you come to building your sand castle later, you won't use every single grain, but you'll be glad of all the options.Make sure you don't completely sacrifice quality in the pursuit of quantity. Almost anybody can sit down and type a 50,000 stream-of-consciousness manifesto. As one of the editors I spoke to says, NaNoWriMo is \"about the process, the discipline, and connecting with your ability to converse in prose.\u201dMaintain your productivity and inspiration Maybe create a mood board, either in real life or on Pinterest. Whenever you feel an oncoming spell of writer's block, you can look for art that matches the mood of your story and makes you feel the way you want your readers and characters to feel.Join a Facebook NaNoWriMo community and post your daily word count. You can 'gamify' your productivity in a way that's both social and will compel you to keep writing.These would really be the main lines for me. If you want more though, this post is pretty exhaustive and condenses all the (good) advice I received over the years: 38 Tips for Kicking NaNoWriMo in the Butt. Best of luck with NaNoWriMo this year, and Happy Writing! ",

            "answer_text": "I \"won\" NaNoWriMo eleven straight years, hitting 50K words each and every time I tried.  Not that \"hitting the 50K mark!\" and \"have a text that could readily be polished into the next Great American Novel!\" are synonymous with one another, not by a long shot.  But here are the things that helped me soldier through and at least get enough words to paper every year:   Resist the urge to research and edit.  It's \"National Novel Writing Month\", not \"National GOOD Novel Writing Month\".  It's perfectly fine to have weird \"stage notes\" in your text - \"he took a long swig from his bottle of [REGIONAL CRAFT BEER BRAND GOES HERE]\" - if it keeps you focused on penning the story at hand.  You can add all those specifics that flesh out your world later on.  (I think my favorite paragraph I read in someone's draft was \"Somehow, she gets to France.\"  That captures a lot of the spirit of the event right there.) Similarly, no matter how much thought you'd put into your world and characters ahead of time, new properties may emerge once you're actually putting words to paper.  I had a gigantic butcher sheet filled with characters and timelines and interactions... and once I was actually writing, I ran into a \"well, did his brother do this action because he was self-absorbed, but failed?  or out of brotherly love, where it was effectively a suicide mission to save his kin?\"  I hadn't even considered that little wrinkle until I was penning it.  So there's no shame in writing out notes to yourself like \"figure out these characters' relationships at some point\" or \"Diego and Jazmyn are more captivating as spurned lovers than siblings so rewrite the hell out of Chapters 3 and 7 when you get around to it.\" Find a troupe of writers - locals you can meet in a coffee shop are ideal, but online buddies will suffice - where you can hold them accountable and vice versa.  It's amazing how motivational it can be, trying to pen more words in an hour than your newfound friend, or not wanting to \"let the team down\" by being the ONE person they couldn't rouse to write enough, or receiving real world pep talks when your plot feels like it's in shambles and all is lost.  The interpersonal aspects of NaNoWriMo are great!  Leverage them if at all possible. Just keep pounding away.  It can be intimidating: \"I was burned out on Friday night so I didn't write then, and I had that family function on Saturday that kept me from the keyboard, so now it's Sunday and HOLY JEEZ I need FIVE THOUSAND words today just to get back on pace; HELP.\"  But if you look at just how much you write during the average day - texts to best friends and emails to work colleagues and comments on Facebook posts and so on and so forth - you generate a LOT more text than you think you do.  Run with that!  Channel those breezy or perfunctory conversations into your novel-writing as well!  Copying-and-pasting in relevant spans of text if that's suitable!  Sure, it was weird when that gnarled pirate spent three pages going off about Charlene's new baby, a helpful Perl script, and a PowerPoint about the Jenkins account; we can fix that in December.",
