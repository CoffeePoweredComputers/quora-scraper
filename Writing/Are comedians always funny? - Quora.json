            "answer_text": "I have always loved Norm McDonald.  His dry wit really connected with me when he was the anchor of \"Weekend Update\" on Saturday Night LIve.  He was publicly fired by a loser  executive at NBC because he found McDonald \"unfunny.\"  There's no doubt McDonald has a unique dry style but he's definitely very funny to many. I happen to really love Comedy \"Roasts\" (insult comedy) where an honoree is mercilessly insulted in humor by a stage full of comedians who also insult each other and then the honoree gets to reply at the end.  It's a legendary form of comedy that is being lost to political correctness.  In a Comedy Central Roast,  I don't remember who was being roasted, Norm McDonald (who is not an insult comedian and therefore rarely at Roasts) pulled what was the most brilliant comedic act I've ever seen.  It was a play on the then widely known, and perhaps widely believed fact, that McDonald was not funny.   He sat on the dais, unfurled a newspaper and sat and read it for the entire show, (but maintaining a straight face) while intense comedy and laughter is going on all around him and he's always in the camera shot.  When it was his turn to Roast the honoree, he got up said a few brief, deliberately unfunny things as if he was trying but incapable and was giving up, and then sat back down and unfurled his newspaper again for the rest of the night.  You'd have to know the backstory, that he's supposedly the unfunny comedian, but I have never laughed so hard in my whole life because it was obvious from the beginning that McDonald was trying to mock his reputation as being unfunny.  This was many years after his firing and although he's a successful comedian, SNL was probably the height of his career (at least in public notoriety; he's had 3 or 4 failed sitcoms).  The unfunny was the joke, and it was totally unexpected and uncomfortable!  BTW, one of the scientific sources of (some) comedy is an involuntary reflex to laugh to relieve tension built up by awkwardness.  I can assure you I was not the only one couldn't stop laughing at this unfunny awkward few minutes--it was a boisterous audience, not a laugh track. ",

It's a constant struggle to break new heights in weirdness.You just have to accept that a lot of jokes fall flat. Knowing when they do is the stuff you need to know.Some people are still entertaining when they aren't funny. Woody Allen possibly. Ben Elton. Robin Williams lost it completely for me.The same joke will make one person laugh and another yawn.Although not known in the US---Tommy Cooper died on stage and people thought it was part of his act. That is probably the best tribute any comedian can get.http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=d1a_1286219671 ",

            "answer_text": "Most comedians are turned down versions of who we are on stage. A lot of people have told me they're surprised how serious I am for a comedian when im not performing. Doesn't mean I'm not funny, just means I'm more deep and introspective. I turn it on when I have to, like if I'm meeting fans after a show. Then I'm an exaggerated version of me. Comics see the world differently than other people. Our perspectives are so unique that it can be kind of lonely. To be the only who sees the Matrix is a weird feeling honestly. Sometimes we\u2019re depressed. Sometimes were manic. A lot of comics drink and do drugs to keep up the facade of the always funny person they are on stage. A lot of us struggle with a damaged past and self esteem issues. A lot are anti social. So no we aren't \u201cbores\u201d but we def aren't the same people off stage as on. The people who are, the ones that are \u201con\u201d all the time? We hate them. ",

Opie and Anthony show used to sit down with comedians a lot (might still) and tell them just to be themselves and hang out. You really see some of them as they are in those places. My favorite is still Lewis Black in that environment. He is really himself when sitting down with them or when interviewing. See if you can find some of his interviews or sit ins. Also, a few comedians have had battles with some form of mental illness which you can look up. Only a few have been really public about it but some you can find the information about online. Maria Bamford has been public about her battles which you can see some information about on Youtube. maria bamford illness - YouTube This may or may not impact how they act offstage or they could need to be \"always on\" to keep themselves together.
