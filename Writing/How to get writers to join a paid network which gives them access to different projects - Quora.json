            "answer_text": "This is tough because there are SO MANY aggregators out there that pull together different projects and jobs - and some of them are scams, so many writers may shy away from it. You\u2019ll need to show how you are different from other sites, then actively engage writers networks on Reddit, social media, and anywhere else you can think of. You should have a free option so that people can see what the site does and if it would be useful to them, as well. Otherwise they are unlikely to just jump into an unknown site and pay for it. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there, Some of your best options are to search for groups related to the \u201cpaid network\u201d on #Google+ and #Facebook. You can also post on job sites about the :paid network\u201d details to get more exposure. Post your \u201cpaid network\u201d details on these sites and you will receive many quotes for details about the project.  I am a freelance blog writer. I would like to know more about this paid network and join. Cheers! ",
