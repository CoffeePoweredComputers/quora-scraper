            "answer_text": "It is important to understand that \u201ccuneiform\u201d defines a script, not a language. Therefore, if you find a cuneiform tablet, it may or may not be in Sumerian. For example French, Italian, English, and German are different languages but are all written in the \u201cLatin\u201d script. Therefore, just understanding the script does not secure a translation of the text. The cuneiform text may be expressing Sumerian, Babylonian, Elamite, Eblaite, Hittite, Hurrian, Urartian or other languages. Therefore, to translate a cuneiform tablet, one must first discover which language it is expressing, and then find someone who can translate the language. Scholars still have not fully conquered the Sumerian language; it is very complex. Many were involved in this Herculean task of translation. Here are a few who made significant contributions to deciphering Sumerian cuneiforms: Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion, Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet - Wikipedia. Fran\u00e7ois Thureau-Dangin, Stephen Herbert Langdon, Samuel Noah Kramer, and Arno Poebel. So, it wasn\u2019t just one person who gets the credit, but many, and the work continues. The discovery of cuneiform tablets has richly enhanced our understanding of our roots. It is a point of interest that the Sumerian is a language isolate, meaning it came from no other language, and no other language came from it. This leads us to think of the Biblical confusion of language at Babel (Cultural Change and the Confusion of Language in Ancient Sumer). Our home: www.genesisandgenetics.org ",

            "answer_text": "This might me a longshot! If I\u2019m not wrong, the Akkadians under Sargon the Great conquered and overthrew the Sumerians. They took some of the sumerian pantheon of gods made them their own, much as the Romans adopted the Greek gods (Zeus - Jupiter) Akkadians originally translated the Sumerian cuneiform into Akkadian, a northwestern Semittic language. The history of the Elamites are known to us because of the Akkadians, because the Elamites left no hard evidence of material that have survived till this day. ",
