            "answer_text": "However the paper was easy, but not very easy as I think, considering biology on a bit easier side, chemistry also do not had any bothering or controversial question as such (last year there were 3 controversial questions) and physics being on moderate side\u2026. Still 600+ score remains the safest score in NEET to get a assured government seat till now\u2026.. 620 last year fetched a rank around 700, 2017 it was around 1400 Considering the paper level and increase in no. of aspirants this year, it is expected that these marks will fetch a rank about 1500 or so\u2026 enough to get good govt clg through AIQ or through state Kudos to all those securing 600+ or even 565\u2013570+ thats a great great score that surely tells the hard work you put into to clear the test( I m pretty sure 565+ marks will surely get govt seat, no matter the cutoff) Cheers!!! Edit 1- gone all wrong 620 marks fetched a rank of about 3600\u2026.never expected that beyond 2000\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Taking into consideration the anomalies in the ranking system presented by NTA this year, your rank is supposed to fall down relatively when compared to the past trends. Your rank will probably lie between 1200\u20131600 as experts suggest. But still, this score is more than enough to get you into a govt. medical college in any part of India. And with this score, you will also definitely have to spare some money out of your pocket to buys sweets for the neighbors and relatives who will be unusually amused(i suppose) after seeing your result or hearing about it. Congratulations on getting such a good score in \u2018Mother of UG exams\u2019. ",
