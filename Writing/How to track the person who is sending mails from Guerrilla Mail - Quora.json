            "answer_text": "The short answer is you can\u2019t. The whole point of guerrilla mail is that it is temporary and disposable. The IP address given is the IP of the mail server. Any attempt to request logs from the mail server will not work as they do not keep a log. They do keep incoming email for 1 hour, then it is deleted automatically. If the reason for you wanting to track the person is that they are harassing you, you could ask guerrilla mail for help but don\u2019t hold your breath waiting. ",

The provider will not give you any further info. Unless you had the ability to monitor all connections of the provider (unlikely), you would not know where the sender connected from. Even then, he or she may have used TOR or a VPN. ",
