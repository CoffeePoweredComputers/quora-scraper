            "answer_text": "Yes, to some degree. Grammar is only one part of writing, and it's really just a tool to help comprehension. As long as you have enough grasp of the tool to be able to convey what you intended (or, at least, something comprehensible to the reader), the rest of the grammar can be assumed or fixed. But an author should seek to improve their grammar to the degree they can. Otherwise, there's very real risk of writing something that conveys meaning(s) that are entirely contrary to the author's intent. And an author can intentionally focus on building their writing style so it fits the grammar they know. Simple styles and grammar aren't bad things. No matter how well you know grammar, accidents will happen. That's okay. Accidents are far more infrequent than mistakes made out of ignorance or disability. If an author has a disability that affects their writing, there are ways to work with, around, or through that. I'm dyscalulic and probably dyslexic, myself, which means my drafts are prone to swapped letters, dropped little words, and swapped homophones. I personally have taught myself to look for, double-check, and be extra careful with problem words and phrases. The end result is that I am a bit more prone to them than the average writer with sufficient knowledge to avoid them, but my error rate is solidly in range of \u201cnormal\u201d. The author Patricia Briggs even has a number of wrong words get through to the final published editions of her books! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by an author I have been a professional writer for around fifty years, and I rarely use grammar at allMost of my work has been in the field of animation where I would draw storyboards of ideas, and often just suggest ideas and act them out for an artist to do a storyboard. I have also written advertising for TV and newspapers, cartoons and comic strips, slogans for buttons and letter headings, as well as lyrics for published songs. The aspect of grammar never came up in these When I have written several technical manuals, where the publisher would provide a proof reader and editor, and also a TV animated series which had a children\u2019s books based on itAt no time was my lack of grammar, spelling a problem I have taught screenwriting at university, and grammar and spelling were never a subject. I also have a website for teaching writing atwww.makemoviesdb.netIt has no references to grammar on it, though some of the links might include it I have only ever written one short novel as an exercise in self-publishing. It was not successful, though I doubt if it was due to bad grammar The question refers to \u2018Author\u2019, and by implication to mean someone who writes a document of some kind, and to be synonymous with Writer, but other terms such as Creator, Scriptwriter, Screenwriter, etc. might be used in place of Author if the work is not a document ",

Many people have good grammar skills, but good writers are much fewer. Honestly though, good ideas, stories and plots are really more important than your grammar. ",
