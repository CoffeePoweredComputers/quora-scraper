Seriously: The best character names are easily memorized as sight words - your reader doesn't have to parse them. You can name a character \u201cRikki Tikki Tembo No Sa Rembo Cheri Beri Ruchi Pip Peri Pembo\" all you like, but please shorten that to \u201cRikki\" or somesuch so your reader doesn't get bored reading the name over and over. Bored readers are unhappy readers, and unhappy readers don't buy or recommend the book that bored them. ",
