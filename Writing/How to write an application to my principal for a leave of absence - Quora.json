            "answer_text": "To Md Mustakim, (If you are a teacher, just make an appointment to talk with the principal. After your meeting, you can follow up with a written, official request for a leave of absence, if the principal requires this for record-keeping purposes. However, I think this question deals with students, so the rest of the answer will be directed at students.)  If you are a student in high school or elementary school, your parent or legal guardian should request your absence for any non-medical reason including travel with the family for an important event. If it is a medical reason, they may also need to provide a doctor\u2019s note. (If you are a college student, you can write the letter yourself and direct it to each individual professor.) If a school does grant a leave of absence, you may be required to make up any work you would miss. Your absence may also affect your grades. If it is a very short absence, you might be able to just ask the teacher instead of the principal. Below is an example of how you could respectfully ask for a leave of absence. 29 January 2020 To: Dr. Susan SharmaPrincipalReflective High SchoolBig City, Anywhere Dear Dr. Sharma, I am requesting a leave of absence from school due to serious medical diagnosis (cancer). I anticipate I will have to be out of school for at least four weeks. I have already discussed this with the teachers involved to arrange for making up the work I will miss. Please let me know your advice and what else I should do to make up any work.

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by \u2018casual leave.\u2019 Do you mean that you need a few days off for personal matters? If so, how urgent are these matters? Do you just want to spend time with a visiting cousin? Do you have a certain number of hours available each term according to your collective agreement, or are casual hours granted strictly on a personal need basis, at the discretion of the principal? Have you ever asked for casual leave before? Also, try to look at it from the principal\u2019s point of view. If you\u2019re a teacher, how difficult will it be to replace you? Is this a difficult time of the school year, perhaps just before exams? How will this affect your class? Will you have lesson plans prepared for a substitute teacher? Here\u2019s a sample letter, fairly formal in style, starting out quickly with the reasons for the request, adding supporting information and ending up with a suggestion for future action: Subject: Casual leave request, from Monday, October 14, to Wednesday, October 16, 2019. My 12-year-old daughter will be attending a soccer tournament in XYZ City October 14 to 16, and I would like to accompany her and her team as a chaperone. For this I will need three days of casual leave, as per article 27.3 of our collective agreement. I might point out that I have never asked for casual leave before, and I feel that the circumstances justify this request. This is a relatively calm time in our calendar, and I will have full lesson plans prepared for the substitute teacher. I would be willing to meet with him or her after hours during the week of the 7th should you think it prudent. Thank you, Corinna (or Ms. Smith, depending on what you usually call him/her), for your attention in this matter, and I would of course be happy to discuss this further if you need more details. However, I need an answer by next Friday so the team coach can make firm plans. ",

Then onto the salutation, i.e., Dear Ms. Simpson or Mr. Simpson: Next, here is where you sell the reason for the absence - I just found out that a close relative has passed away and I will need to be absent from all school classes during the week of December 3\u201312 to attend her life celebration (or funeral or whatever). I\u2019d like your approval and help to assemble lesson plans and defer exams until my return in mid-December. Of course, I will make up an course work that was missed.
