            "answer_text": "Many couples commemorate their wedding anniversary with special anniversary rings. Couples can personalize these bands to fit their personal style or according to their specific relationship. For instance, you can choose a band that stylistically harmonizes with your wedding and engagement rings. If your wedding band is simple with no stones, you can opt for a more elaborate anniversary band. Another special way to celebrate your anniversary is to exchange anniversary bands of different metals or stones. For instance, you can surprise your significant other with a silver anniversary band on the first anniversary year, a rose gold anniversary band on the second, a gold anniversary band on the third, and so on. You can also consider different types of stones, such as sapphires, rubies, and emeralds, depending on your personal taste, birth month, anniversary month, your children\u2019s birthstones, or whatever the case may be. One of the best benefits of using bands of different metals and stones is that you can create your own fashionable statement layered look by wearing multiple colored bands at a time. Make your anniversary present even more special with uniquely designed rings that carry special meanings, such as floral patterns , celestial motifs, or sentimental engravings. Eternity rings are another great option, for they are a type of anniversary band that symbolizes eternal love. You can choose a full eternity ring or a half eternity ring to represent your years together as a couple. Likewise, 3-stone, 5-stone, and 7-stone rings are all popular ways to mark anniversary years. No matter what type of jewelry you choose, as long as the gift is special to you and your relationship, the rest doesn\u2019t matter.

            "answer_text": "1. Take him/her after walk. Bring him/her to a coast, watching sunset together and have dinner.2.  If you still remember how your first date like, do it! Wear the same cloth when you first met, when to the same restaurant ( or wherever it is). And when you are there, it would be awesome if you have a picture of your first date to show him/her.3. Do it at your house! How you gonna do it? Take a chain of little lights and set it up in your house, on each chain put some pictures of you 2 on it. (ideally if you have a garden!)    (should be like this! sorry for my bad English!) 4. You know how to sing? Yes. Cool. Bring him/her to a tearoom and sing a song for her/him there. Simple is always the best. There are many things you can do. And the only who can come up with the best creative idea is you! You understand him/her better than any of us. Don't be too hard on yourself. Just think of something he/she likes and what does he/she needs now! Good luck and congratulation to you! ",
