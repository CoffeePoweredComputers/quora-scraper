            "answer_text": "Honestly speaking I have never tried this, but when I look at the question in detail it's quite thoughtful. First question that comes in my head is what is a Letter?  Its nothing but a medium to communicate. You send letters to loved ones/Friends asking things. But God is someone I believe to be omniscient and omnipresent. He is our Father. He knows what you want and why you want it. He will give it to you if and only if your worthy and I need not tell him what my worth is, that would be silly :) . A letter will not make sense, at least to an Adult. I want something I need not go anywhere He is there with me always I can pray or talk with Him like any friend or like Father.  When I consider this for kids This is a good Idea. Religion mostly preaches God as might powerful and He might Punish you for sins and blab blab blab. We don't want our kids to understand God as someone so scary. This should work with them God will be like a Pen Friend and yes it will make them more expressive of their needs and wants and goals in life (Helps psychologically :) ). ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I have. And I believe it's a great thing to do. You see how journal entries give you a kind of satisfaction when you\u2019ve put them down. Like someone is listening. So what if it's just a tiny piece of paper. And when you make it Dear God instead of Dear Diary, it assumes a new meaning altogether. You don't just write what you feel, but also what you want. Your dreams and wishes that you'd like God to fulfill. Writing them down, giving them a physical space also reminds of your goals and pushes you to work towards them. ",
