            "answer_text": "Capitalism is profitable for everyone. Everyone has the opportunity to raise themselves out of poverty. Most people that would be considered wealthy, those with $1 million net worth or more, were poor or of low average net worth at some point in their lives. When they were in their 20s and 30s a great many people had very little bit over a lifetime of 30 or 40 years of working hard and investing in a business, real estate or the stock market cumulated more money than most. So opportunity is what allows people to succeed and have pride in success And we do that. even for those people who continue to be poor in countries such as the United States, we provide a great many benefits for them and many more than most other countries. We provide Medicaid for the most poor, food stamps, WIC payments, and a great many charities that will help them. It is important to understand that when we look at the income of the poor benefits such as that that are provided to them are not counted. Most of our poor in this country have cell phones, televisions, and places to stay and food to eat.This was possible because the people that are successful donate to charities that help them and pay taxes for the government programs that support them. So democracy and capitalism helps everyone even if they are poor and not successful. ",

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t. There are, and always will be, \u201cinjustices\u201d. All democracy can ensure is that each person has the opportunity to vote and therefore influence what government does. The government, in turn, acts in accordance with the wishes of the majority of voters, but what the majority of voters support is not always, nor can it ever be, profitable to everyone. All societies have injustices and inequalities and always will. They may not be intended, but they will always exist. Not every need can be attended by society, even in a democracy. It\u2019s more important that we, as individuals, do what we can. ",
