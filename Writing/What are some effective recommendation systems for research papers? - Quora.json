            "answer_text": "Although there are comfortably more than 150 papers published in the area of scientific/research paper recommender systems (RS), there are only few systems available online for public use. The effectivenss of these systems is entirely relative as it is dependent on user requirement and the underlying dataset. Most of the publications related to these systems have fairly convincing evaluation results so it is up to the user to judge. On a personal note, most of the systems would be really useful if they have access to more research papers metadata and full-text. Stand-alone RS RefSeerX - Managed by the CiteSeerX Digital Library teamtheadvisor - Graph-based RS managed by OSUPubChase (discover life sciences research of interest to you) - Specifically for bio researchAMiner - Open Science Platform - Multi-utility system managed by Tsinghua UniversitySemantic Scholar - recently launched RS, managed by Allen Institute for Artificial IntelligenceReference Management Systems with embedded RS Mendeley (Free reference manager and PDF organizer)Docear Others CiteULike (Everyone's library)  is a research paper bookmarking system which also provides recommendations as you keep bookmarking papers in your list. I will update the above list whenever I come across more functional systems. ",

            "answer_text": "Google Scholar (Page on google.com). You do have to set up an account and populate it with papers, but once you get going, it is remarkably effective at finding papers based on what you have published. You can also set it up to send you keyword-based alerts: Page on google.com ResearchGate (Share and discover research) has also surprised me recently with good recommendations. Go to \"Publications\" (top left), then in the right hand column, \"Browse publications -> Your field of research\". ",
