There hasn\u2019t been any rainfall in this part of the country for the last two years (OR \u2026 since 2017) Using the verb \u2018rain' gives a better sentence than using the noun created from it (rainfall). Using one word is better than using many (here/in X rather than \u2018in this part of the country\u2019). Those were stylistic choices. Now, we need to correct the actual mistake. The grammar rule is.. FOR a period of time SINCE a point of time An easy trick to remember this.. In the word \u2018for', the letter \u2018f\u2019 in lower case has a long line through it.. suggesting a duration. In the word \u2018since', the letter \u2018i' has a dot or point on it :) ",
