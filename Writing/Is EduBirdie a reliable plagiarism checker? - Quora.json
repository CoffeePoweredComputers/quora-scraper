            "answer_text": "EduBirdie is an essay mill and academic writing service. They commit academic fraud and I doubt that their plagiarism checking tool can bring any value to the academic world. I would even never try it or recommend it to any of my colleagues or students. The usage of contract cheating websites is strictly prohibited at higher educational institutions. Being an educator, I am against any cheating. I don\u2019t consider any similar plagiarism checking tools to be reliable. I trust only the software that cooperates with academic institutions. Turnitin, Unicheck, Grammarly are some examples of such tools. ",

If you\u2019re not sure how to cite a particular source, check your grammar handbook to figure out what kind of source it is, then follow the template in the handbook for that kind of source. You learn by doing this work, not be running a program that you don\u2019t understand. Give credit to other writers you are borrowing from; take credit for your own writing. All you have to do is not confuse the two. ",
