            "answer_text": "Each cursive is distinct in appearance. The problem may be that the person that created the uppercase S needs to take more care in creating the letter. They are similar in formation but the uppercase cursive G has an extra little ridge on the right side of the letter that the uppercase cursive S does not have. Hope that helps. ",

A hand-written upper case S can have closed loops and almost look like an ampersand; however, the entire letter is on/above the line. ",
