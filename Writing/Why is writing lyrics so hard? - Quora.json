            "answer_text": "For someone who feels writing lyrics is hard, perhaps letting go of expectations is what is needed. For example, start writing lyrics without comparing to other songs.. even if someone starts out writing song lyrics with obvious rhymes, or if it sounds silly, etc. Write anyway. It\u2019s ok. Keep in mind, everything doesn\u2019t have to rhyme perfectly. Over time writing can happen much faster and easier because the skill of expressing one\u2019s self through song lyrics is worked like a muscle. The good part is, that while muscles get weaker if you don\u2019t keep working out, songwriting is more like riding a bike. Once you gain the skill, you keep it. Let me try the start of a verse.. Writing songs was hard to do When I was finally through with you Now everything I want to say Just won\u2019t come out like Poetry .. Think of a topic, merge the topic with a concept. Also, consider your mood, life experiences, beliefs, etc. These play a big part in songwriting. Be conscious of these factors. Sometimes it\u2019s good to write to later put the song in a drawer if it\u2019s not meant to be sung on stage. Sometimes, lyrics can be like a journal entry. However, sometimes, great songs happen because the person wrote the lyrics at the time they may have otherwise been too busy doing something else. In other words, to be a great songwriter ..write and write often. Rock on! ",

            "answer_text": "Lack of clarity can make it hard. Establish clarity first. Effective lyric writing is, first and foremost, a product of having a clear idea for a song or maybe a clear title for a song; a clear idea of what you want to communicate. When you have a pointed destination of what you want to communicate, the task of writing a lyric that gets you to that destination becomes a pleasure. The typical mark of the amateur is usually a lyric that meanders and strays without staying sharply on point, thus giving the impression that the writer is unclear in precisely what they want to convey, and thus having the effect of confusing and alienating the listener. Don't concern yourself with flowery language. Your first responsibility is clarity. Clarity will provide the beauty that propels your sentiment forward from verse to verse without repeating what you have already stated in the previous verse. Your destination is your chorus. Point all of your verses to the destination of your chorus, a.k.a, your song title or song idea. Having done that, punctuate your chorus with the thunderbolt statement that distills everything that your verses have been leading up to. Great popular song and lyric writing is an underestimated and deceptively difficult art form and I'm well aware that I'm merely scratching the surface of the the nuts and bolts of it. It demands a certain economy and precision. It's kind of similar to a newspaper comic strip where you have maybe four or five boxes to tell the story and then be done with it. Every box must move the little play forward - effectively and efficiently. Same thing with effective lyric writing; generally, you only have a couple of measly verses and a bridge or two to clarify and move your sentiment to a climatic point, whatever that might be. Most, if not all aspiring songwriters, quickly discover that the popular song structure can be a challenging mode of'expression. As difficult as it might be to express yourself within the confines of that structure, therein lies it's latent and potent ability: It practically forces you to distill your expression into a stripped down, undiluted art form.
