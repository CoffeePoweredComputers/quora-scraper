In other words, is the questioner hoping to have some of the intellectual work done by others? So, let me comply: who is the person you are profiling?why are you profiling them?what do you think is the most important aspect of their life that should be communicated in your profile?Number 3 is the one where the real intellectual work comes in, but no one can do it for you.
