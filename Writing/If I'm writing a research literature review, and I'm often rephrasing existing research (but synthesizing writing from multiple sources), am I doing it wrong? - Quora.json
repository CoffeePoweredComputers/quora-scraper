No, you\u2019re not. Besides paraphrasing you can even quote sources to some degree. The editor and diligent reviewers may expect you to not only cite/quote the information but also to establish a new view on the body of knowledge published so far. I assume that\u2019s what you mean by \u201csynthesizing\u201d. ",

(A good way to make sure the source is credible is to see if you can find the same information on more than one site.) By rewriting, you\u2019re avoiding plagiarism.. So no you\u2019re not doing it wrong! ",
