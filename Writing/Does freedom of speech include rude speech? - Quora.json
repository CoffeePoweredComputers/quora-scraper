            "answer_text": "Hell yes - is my BNBR reply. There are limits to every kind of freedom or duty in society. For the simple but very consequential fact that society means LOTS of people together. So freedom of speech is not some universal or natural or holy right. For instance shouting fire in a crowded enclosed space for fun is criminal and will be punished I think everywhere. Rudeness is just impolite behaviour. The use of it has its own inbuilt punishment. Religious respect is also not a requirement. But before you go all out, freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences. Depending on local law, people can snub you, answer you back, fire you, express THEIR freedom of speech, etc\u2026 Tiny example: if you are a German and you are on video declaring \u201ckind and wise Hitler would have known what to do with refugees and I would help him do it\u201d , your employer would fire you faster than you can say heil. I think most close knitted religious communities do not want to know about your atheism and if you are a dick about it they will stop inviting you. If you want to tell a rugby team loudly and graphically what you think about their gay captain, you might want to wear your running shoes. If you as a shop owner tell that shamelessly lesbian couple you don\u2019t need their business, don\u2019t be surprised your cute little shop suddenly pops up on social and other media. In fact be glad, you probably won\u2019t see any gay customers for years to come, and you\u2019ll have a pretty good idea who is closeted or has a more inclusive view on humanity: the usual customers who suddenly don\u2019t show up anymore.

            "answer_text": "Well one must consider first what defines rude speech, as what some may think is rude to others is just clear expression of feelings. Back to the topic , we no longer have free speech with all the control of the government and powers that be we no longer have such freedoms . As the governments here in North America , are more like communist then democratic . As freedom of speech is to voice each and every opinion of the people of the governments and what should be done to improve them . Instead we allow criminals to crawl in to power on the promis of lies only to steal and destroy what our forefathers had put in place . We need to have a revolution to regain our freedoms or we can forget about any freedoms of any kind . We as in each and every one together as in one body . Power by numbers . ",

The main purpose of free speech is so that people can criticize their government. Without the ability to do that, the people aren't in charge of their government. The moment you let government decide what qualifies as free speech, you no longer have free speech. ",
