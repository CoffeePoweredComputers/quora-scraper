            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t expect to make money as a writer; some people do, but creative writing is like art. Some artists make money, others don\u2019t, and their art is more of a pleasurable sideline. Focusing on money and the business side of writing, as many writers do, can make you miserable. Instead, write for your own pleasure, and to write something good. If your writing does become a money-maker, great. Bonus. Non-fiction and technical writing is another matter altogether; there is some overlap, but these non-fiction types of writing are usually embedded in a context of professional work. If you do this kind of writing, you probably also have trained to do it. Get a day job. As noted above, it\u2019s rare to make a lot of money as a creative writer. It\u2019s safer to think of writing as a leisure activity. If you\u2019re serious about it, find the type of work that pays the bills but gives you freedom, flexibility, and - above all - free time. Read. A lot of writers will tell you to read a lot, and that\u2019s good advice. Reading will do several things for you: It will subconsciously drill grammatical forms and sentence structure into you until they become an integral part of how you think.It will expose you to various authorial voices. I suggest (and I tell my students to do this) that you find a voice you like, first try to copy it, and then play around with it until you\u2019ve reworked it into your own voice.It will give you a chance to study how authors set up and sustain their stories.It will teach you to read more deeply (as authors do), not just for enjoyment, but to study how other authors write - what works, what doesn\u2019t.Practice. Not everything you write has to be published. Write simply to hone your skills, and to experiment with various ideas you have. Frequent writing helps you assess which ideas are good, and which ones aren\u2019t. Observe and Experience. Good writers pay attention to the world around them and to themselves; they are people-watchers, and they are also people who seek out new experiences. This is where a lot of their writing ideas come from. Imagine. Writers have strong imaginations, and this is how they fill in the gaps in their experience. Research. Sometimes imagination needs backup. Focus and Commit. Writing won\u2019t happen until you sit down and start doing the work. Writing is also something you really learn by doing. Understand your genre. Most writing falls into a genre (type), or is a blend of two or three genres. Genre matters because readers often choose what they\u2019ll read based on genre. Genres come with certain expectations and \u201crules.\u201d Nothing is set in stone, of course, but you need to know what expectations you must fulfill, and which ones you can alter or set aside. If you\u2019re interested in publishing, genre also helps an agent represent your work to publishers. Understand storytelling. In many genres, authors get caught up in what they call world-building. This is really just establishing the setting, which can become a very elaborate task when writing science fiction or fantasy. However, the setting isn\u2019t the story. Stories are about people and situations. Remember that your readers may not be as instantly riveted by the setting as you are, but they\u2019ll keep turning pages if you give them a group of interacting people trying to solve a problem. Plan. In order to complete a work, you need to construct a plan. It doesn\u2019t have to be rigid and unchangeable, but you do need to have a map of your project, as well as a kind of schedule so that you can stay on target. Make time. Writing is a time-consuming activity that requires mental focus. Most serious writers feel a need to write, whether they publish much or not, and they will rearrange their lives to make time for writing. Be aware that to a lot of other people this may seem selfish. Don\u2019t expect them to understand. Be wary of advice. A lot of advice about writing, especially unbidden advice from other amateur writers, can be toxic, even destructive. I don\u2019t recommend joining one of those online sites where aspiring writers read and critique each other\u2019s work. (Plus, uploading your work to the Internet is never a good idea, especially if you haven\u2019t read the fine print.) There are good writers on those sites, but there are also a lot of blowhards and bullies (mostly men, go figure) with nothing constructive to say. The sort of people who dominate meetings just to hear themselves talk, who always do more harm than good. Let go. Learn how to edit - to be your own best critic. This requires clarity of vision and honesty. Your writing isn\u2019t you; it\u2019s a piece of work that you\u2019re trying to get right. Sometimes less is more - be prepared to make beneficial sacrifices, if necessary. The more you edit, the better you get at it. Learn, also, to be an economical writer; as someone once very sagely said, \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t go in, in the first place, it doesn\u2019t have to come out, later.\u201d Be realistic & informed. Learn to weigh the strength of your work against that of others if you\u2019re interested in publishing. Study the publishing industry and its various options before you start sending out manuscripts. Learn about agents and what they can do for you. Traditional publishing and self-publishing for profit both have strengths and weaknesses (and pitfalls) you need to be aware of before you start down either path. Many people just want their stories read, and there are venues that connect authors, their work, and readers for free, online, without money changing hands. If you choose an option in which money does change hands, learn what the tax ramifications of that are. Also understand that a lot of trash gets published because it sells, while very good work goes unpublished because it\u2019s not marketable; this isn\u2019t necessarily bad, though, because publishers need to make money to stay in business, and certain types of bad writing make a lot of money, some of which is used to publish good literature.

            "answer_text": "Let's just tackle the writing. Stick to some kind of schedule. Write every day. A sentence, a paragraph, or something. ..anything. Next day read what you wrote. And start writing from there. This was Tolkien\u2019s approach. Don't fall into the trap that \u201cRobbie\u201d found himself in\u2026btw, Tolkien was called that by the Inklings. Without Jack\u2019s (c.s lewis) encouragment we might never have read \u201cLORD OF THE RINGS\u201d Never\u2026ever throw anything you've written away. Put it in a seperate file and save it. I have personal experience with that. I started a historical novel, wrote 75 pages in 2 days, and deleted half of it 5 days later. Now I'm starting from scratch and wish I had those 35 pages for reference. Patience. ..Patience. ..Patience. Writing is a craft that only comes with practice. Your first draft might look horrible. My first attempt at writing a series of short stories read like the 8 year old kid I was writing about. What I failed to write was everything that was sitting in my head. So I rewrote it. I found a \u201cJack\u201d who would read it and ask questions and offer encouragement. Be mindful. Many writers have the story wandering around in their brain. Your job is to pull out every detail and and put it in the story. Nobody knew my characters without me going into detail. Read what you wrote, find Jack and 2 or 3 beta readers and rewrite it all based on their feedback. Did I mention patience? Go back and rewrite it again. I have zero classes or courses on how to write fiction, but jack and beta readers helped me more than I can say. Stay focused. It's been said we all have a story to tell. Tell it. ",
