            "answer_text": "I cannot tell about you, but I am starting to discover my reasons. I only now realized I never had patience for people\u2019s drama. And by drama I mean anything that seems unnecessary that takes my energy away. I cannot stand friends who want to use me as means of complaining about life. Nothing against complaining. It cleans the soul, it helps you not to explode inside. But if our friendship is all that, if you do not let me complaint as well, so, I guess I do not want to stick with you anymore. When people fight someone, and they come to me for support, I refuse to help them. I mean, you made your decision to fight that person, deal with it like an adult. And sometimes I am the idiot, for one thing I cannot stand is boredom. And don\u2019t get me wrong: I am probably the most boring person I know. The difference is that there is only one way to get away from myself and I don\u2019t feel like killing myself. So I eventually hate people in silence for asking that extra stupid question in class just to show the professor you are a dedicated c***-s***** who wants attention. I feel angry when people laugh waaay to hard at something that is not that breathtaking. In sum, I know the problem is in me. But you know what? I don\u2019t feel really bad about it, because I know that people would not, and they do not, think otherwise before ignoring you whenever it suits them. As a consequence I have fewer friends, none of them are perfect, but at least I go through less s*** today than when I did back in school. And the good part of it is that the few friends who stick around actually like some part of you, and they get you whenever you are in a bad mood, even if they don\u2019t encourage it, they get it. And these are the best options I had so far. Don\u2019t feel bad about doing what you want, as long as you\u2019re not harming anyone. Society wants to shape you into what it wants. Friends who don\u2019t like when you curse will cast odd glares at you. That colleague who hates your jokes will eventually talk trash behind your back. So, yes, be yourself. If you want people to stick around you must know who you really are. There is a massive number of human beings on earth, adapting yourself to those around you is just as stupid as studying for one question at a time as soon as you get your exam. Don\u2019t study to each one, study as best as you can, learn stuff, and you will have better grades with a lot less of stress. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "I , myself, do not feel like cutting off contact with \u201ceverybody\u201d. I have not really known a lot of people, and ones I have known have not been helpful in my life, attaining my goals . I have found that the people who have been in my life, were troubled individuals and I did not share the same vision with them for my own path. When I attempted to separate from them, they began to \u201ctroll\u201d me as though I was a possession of theirs and had no right to make decisions for my own life. It was my feeling, that this was more their problem than it is mine. They have attempted to try and convince me that the tings I like, food etc are not something I have a right to enjoy. This is very disturbing. They have gone as far as to Dox me. Taking personal information and using it to attempt to convince others that I have mental problems and should not be permitted to make my own choices. This is about as toxic as people can get! Paticularly if I am living a happy life and not disturbing anyone. I have been called \u201cfat\u201d and \u201clazy\u201d Bi-polar. My own daughter and her female husband have gone as far as to lie to my own dying mother about me. Telling stories of how I threw dishes and bit fingers. There is no way I can incorporate these individuals into my current life. I live on a nice serene dirt desert road. I have pets and interest, a very nice life. The last thing I need is a busload of toxic , and angry fools landing on my front porch with all of the name calling and accusations because i won\u2019t give them money. ",
