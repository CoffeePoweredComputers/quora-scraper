            "answer_text": "Why are all capital letters inappropriate in emails? Oh, they are absolutely appropriate\u2014if you want the recipent to infer you are yelling at him or her. Like it or not, nowadays using all capital letters means you are shouting. We don\u2019t have to agree with it, but it would be foolish to fly in the face of today\u2019s common usage rule, especially this one. Furthermore, I feel it also implies the writer is too lazy to use the shift key, and, therefore, the reader isn\u2019t important enough to warrant use of this simple common courtesy. ",

            "answer_text": "They're not. They are entirely appropriate. An email is a letter like any other- it just happens to be sent electronically. You would use capital letters as you use them anywhere else: for example, the beginning of sentences, for acronyms and names. Why would you think they wouldn't be used in an email?? NB: I have answered the question as it is written. To get the meaning other people have understood from this, the question would be: \u201cIs it wrong to write an email entirely in Upper Case?\u201d Or \u201cWhy is it wrong to write an email entirely in capital letters?\u201d ",
