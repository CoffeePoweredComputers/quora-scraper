            "answer_text": "Hi, It really depends on what you are capable of. The key with blog posts is consistency. I recommend every day to every 3 days, but make sure you stick to your timetable. It can be quite easy to write and post an article every day for the first 2 weeks, but then can you carry on doing that for 3, 6, 9 months? Maybe you can and this isn\u2019t an issue, but if not, you need to have a very structured blog post timetable. This way your readers will know when you are going to post, and it will build reliability around your blog. People will not want to come back if they dont know if your blog will post in the next day, or the next month. Hope this helps! ",
