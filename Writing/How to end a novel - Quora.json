            "answer_text": "Anne Lamott gave us the answer to this in her book Bird by Bird. In novel writing the answer is Word by Word. Or to be more general- idea by idea and scene by scene. A novel, like a play normally takes place in a series of scenes. Each has a beginning, middle and end and takes the story forward in a specific way. Characters reveal more of themselves, learn something, face some challenge, engage in some conflict or resolve something. Overall every scene takes us closer to the denouement of the story where conflict and challenge are ultimately faced and - normally - overcome. That gives us the sense of satisfaction we need as the novel comes to an end. So to finish your novel you simply need to write the next scene. And the next one. And the next one. Until it\u2019s all done. But to write that scene you also need to know what the characters themselves do not yet know - what conflict or danger they face, how it\u2019s going to develop and how overcome. And that depends partly on decisions you make about interventions in the story (plot) or how protagonists will react to situations (character). But it\u2019s a fascinating journey both for your characters and yourself. Good luck. ",

That is a dramatic way to finish, and it definatly won\u2019t fit every situation, but it is a way to finish. Some more practial tips may be that there is an ebb and flow to a story. Depending on how you develop your stories will depend where there if a good time to end. Some people start with the end in mind, and they are just filling in the in between. Some people write with the characters in mind, and their story develops through the writing. Studying good stories, practicing writing and getting feedback all help to give you insight to when your story is in the right place to finish. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, Ending your novel totally depends on the writer. It needs a lot of research on how other writers end their books and what those ends make you feel. I generally let my characters take the lead. For example, I want my heroine to end up with this guy. How? Depends on the story I write and my character\u2019s choices. If you feel confused about how to end your novel, write down possible ends in short sentences. Check which one would make the readers gasp, or cry or be happy, whatever you choose, it should make sense to the story. Remember, not every story needs happy endings. One of my short stories ends in a sad way. My first novel ends on a cliffhanger where the readers have to decide what my protagonist must have done. Hope this answer helps! If not, I am open to discuss, please write a comment below or contact me on jheel.g@gmail.com ",

If it\u2019s the first one I have an article that can help here: How to sit down and write. If it\u2019s the second one, coming up with an ending I would sit down and think about a few alternate endings that are possible for your book, then pick your favourite and work towards that. As in anything perseverance is key. I would recommend that you sit down and have a hard think about why you are writing the book. Remember what got you started in the first place and beginning working to achieve your goals! ",
