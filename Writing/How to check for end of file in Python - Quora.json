If it cannot reach EOF it will raise an exception. When reading a file in chunks rather than with read(), you know you've hit EOF when readreturns less than the number of bytes you requested. In that case, the following read call will return the empty string (not None). The following loop reads a file in chunks; it will call read at most once too many. assert n > 0\u00a0while True:\u00a0    chunk = fp.read(n)\u00a0    if chunk == '':\u00a0        break\u00a0    process(chunk)\u00a0Or, shorter: for chunk in iter(lambda: fp.read(n), ''):\u00a0    process(chunk)\u00a0",
