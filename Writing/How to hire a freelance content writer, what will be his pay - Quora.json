            "answer_text": " Top Freelance content writers in India Finding a dedicated freelance writer who can cater to your requirements in the best possible way can be a pain in the ass. Every day we used to get many requests where clients asked for freelance content writers who could be entrusted with the task of writing efficiently. Thus, I have curated the list of Top Freelance Writers from India based on people\u2019s recommendation. I got more than 70 recommendations and choosing the best of the lot was indeed a tedious task. I have personally checked their portfolio, client testimonials before jotting down my Top 10 List of Freelance Writers. I think that this list of Top 10 Freelance Writers can help you with content creation, content marketing and content strategy work. I have covered all kind of writers who can handle various niches ranging from technology to health and fitness.This is not a promotional or sponsored post, I haven\u2019t charge anything for anyone. I am also not an affiliate to any people mention here in the list. 1. MUKTI MASIHMukti Masih has been writing content for more than 14 years now, starting her stint with The Times of India. Her three years of experience as a journalist taught her how to balance facts with the right blend of emotions to strike a chord with readers/customers. She has in her kitty market leaders such as Vinfotech (leading fantasy sports app development company); Akshaya Patra (NGO that\u2019s running world\u2019s largest mid-day meal scheme); LetsShave (India\u2019s Most Promising Brand award winner); InstaCar(Central India\u2019s first funded start-up and fastest growing intercity cab startup) and The Crowd Sourcing Week Magazine (Singapore and New York-based magazine on crowdsourcing economy); Sayaji Group of Hotels among others. Her strength is original content with the right blend of personal touch and a selling strategy. Since she is an avid traveller, she gets to write engaging startup stories for YourStory and travel stories for various publications. She has so far written 200+ video scripts, 100+ websites, over 12,000 blog posts and around 4,000 social media posts. She is also the co-founder of a leading video production house AVM Pictures. Why are they one of the best?Mukti is a complete content strategist who treats every piece of writing like her own personal blog. She inevitably brings out a human angle that resonates with the customers in her content. She knows that more than 1/3rd of consumer decisions are based on emotions, not facts. Her stories, articles and blogs are credible because they are well-researched, aptly source-credited and full of interesting analogies. She would invariably bring in a Batman movie reference in a startup story or a Breaking Bad reference in a big data article. This makes her content most relatable to her readers. Client\u2019s recommendationPuspendra Agrawal[Founder & CEO- MSG91]Those who know Mukti well would agree that she is a friend, philosopher and guide, in a true sense. What I appreciate most about her work is her ability to cut through the predictable politics of a project, keep the team involved and deliver the expected results and more. Supriyo Das Gupta[State Marketing Head MPCG Dainik Bhaskar Group]Mukti did a number of writing assignments during my DNA days and she was a delight to work. She was sincere and honest and met all her deadlines. She also co-ordinated well with my team of sales guys and designers to produce rich content. She is a very dependable person and a great writer. What I found the most exciting about Mukti is her zeal to add values in areas where she did not expertise.

MATHEW J MANIYAMKOTTI started with a blog in 2011 on Blogspot pivoting it later to WordPress where I rambled about things that mattered to me. Probably the best thing about me as a writer was I wouldn\u2019t mind sharing my writing with random strangers and ask them for feedback. The feedback was good and I got a few writing offers that way.To create a portfolio, I started writing for free at Inc42.com, wrote a few articles for Trak.in - Indian Business Of Tech Telecom & Startups! as well. By this time, I was charging a rupee per word for my clients.I connected with an Editor of Indian Express and 6 months after asking if I could contribute to them, they gave me a \u2018Yes\u2019. I had a column called Kickstart and Techtracker where I used to feature startups and technology respectively. Then I started writing for Yourstory.com, The Hindu Business Line (On Campus) and recently signed a contract with Entrepreneur India as well.
