            "answer_text": "Dear Ellen, I'm hoping by now that you may have received an onslaught of FB messages and twitters about my dear friend Parker who met his untimely death two weeks ago. I would have written sooner, but there are so many good things to say about this young man, that I was overwhelmed with knowing exactly what to say. So here it goes: On March 24, 2016, Parker J Leikam, a very well-known South Jefferson Central School student was killed in a head-on collision near his home on the Fuller Road in Adams, NY. He had just left his house to attend an honors convocation where he and a group of fellow students were to be inducted into the National Honor Society. State police said Larry Plummer was attempting to pass another vehicle in a no-passing zone on a hill and slammed into Leikam's vehicle. Both men died in this fiery crash. Parker loved musical theater and had just played the lead role in his school's recent production of \"Beauty and the Beast\" and last December he played Buddy the Elf in \"Elf Jr. The Musical\" with StageNotes of Watertown, NY. In addition to musical theater, he played on his school\u2019s football team, was a member of the National Honor Society and Whiz Quiz and was involved with several charities. Parker was larger than life and made a huge impact on people. One of the things that has come out of all of this is the realization that Parker made everybody feel important. He made you feel that you were one of the most important people to him at the moment when you were talking to him. He had a way about him. But he wasn\u2019t always that way. It was his bow ties that helped to give him confidence to be himself.  A few years ago, while directing Parker in a Watertown Lyric Theater production of \"SPAMALOT\" we were talking backstage in the dressing room and he noticed that I was always well dressed, and wondered why I was so meticulous. I told him about my well dressed grandfather who taught me that \u201cIf you looked your best, you would feel your best and give your best to everything you set out to achieve.\"  I felt it was important to share that message with Parker who had recently come out and was trying to \"fit in\" and was feeling awkward. I confided with him that I too had the same awkward feelings as a teen until I realized that if you are always true to yourself, your family and your friends and anyone else you encounter in life, you don\u2019t even need to worry about \u2018fitting in\u2019 because you already do! He told me how much he liked bow ties because they were so stylish and sophisticated. My grandfather wore bow ties as well, and occasionally I wear them when not wearing a traditional necktie.  Little did I know at the time that his personal fashion statement of wearing brightly colored bow ties would end up sparking a trend to mourn his death. Soon after his passing, a friend had posted on FB encouraging people to wear black. Recalling our conversation I encouraged everyone to wear a bow tie to mourn his death. In my post I asked people to take a selfie wearing a bow tie and write a comment about Parker and add #bowtiesforparker. Not only did people start wearing bow ties, but through social media, the idea grew. In addition to #bowtiesforparker, there is now a #bowtiesforparkeronbroadway movement begun by Ted Keegan, a 1979 graduate of Watertown High School who made his Broadway debut in 1989 in \u201cSweeney Todd.\u201d His other Broadway successes include being the lead in \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d on Broadway. He took a night off from the Broadway production of \u201cPhantom\u201d to sing at Parker\u2019s memorial service last week. Parker had a dream of appearing on Broadway. Many performers in several Broadway shows wore bow ties in his memory. In a recent Watertown Daily Times article Mr. Keegan was quoted \"I reached out to some of my friends in the Broadway community and asked if they would post selfies with the hashtag #bowtiesforparkeronbroadway,\u201d Mr. Keegan said in an email. \u201cThe response from the community was immediate.\u201d Performers in \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d \u201cAn American in Paris\u201d and \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d have posted selfies showing their bow ties worn in memory of Parker.\u201cHe was laying the groundwork for a lifetime in the performing arts,\u201d Mr. Keegan said of Parker. \u201cOn Broadway, we are surrounded by diversity and try to help each other create and grow into the best performers we possibly can be. That was Parker, and the Broadway community feels the loss when a light is taken from us far too soon.\u201dThe bow tie drive has helped to make us realize the effect Parker had on others. This tragedy affected not only his family, but his friends at school, in local theater groups and all the way to the Broadway community.  Parker's mother Kristen has encouraged many to write to you and has started  #ellenforparker/links on Facebook and bowtiesforparker Twitter in order to raise your awareness of this young man and to ask you to wear a bow tie in honor of Parker. That would be so amazing as he loved to watch your shows and he shared the ideals you embody and the humanitarian efforts that you ascribe to. ",

            "answer_text": "February 28, 2018 Dear Ellen DeGeneres, First off I would like to say I love watching your show. I enjoy seeing how you interact with your audience, guest, and staff. What really touches me is how you give to those that are so deserving. I would like to get to that point, and just be able to give my time, and money. Let me introduce myself. My name is Kathy Lee and I presently live in the Milwaukee, WI area. I have started a business called God Morning Coffee Mugs and Baskets, and have now changed it to God Morning Mugs and More (Gm3). I have had some good days with my business and some bad. More bad than good. Although I continue to hit bumps I am not giving up. I continue to come up with more and more ideas to expand what I am offering. I started off selling mugs only. Then I moved onto baskets. I am now offering custom candy dishes. My ideas and dreams are happening, but not as I would like them to be. I am constantly running into problems with sales, customers, and having product on hand. I am always investing in myself, but at times that is not enough. My credit needs repair, because when I try getting ahead I always run into a road block with that too. My biggest dream is to have a large school bus to turn into a large mobile business to sell my product. I would also travel from state to state different times of years so that I can get my name out there too. I would love to make your studio one of my stops. I can just imagine how many lives I could touch year round. My products are made with some form of spiritual, or positive message. My mugs are printed with \u201cGOD MORNING\u201d on each one, a scripture, positive message, or verse. You can also get a picture or logo added too. With all my gift baskets you have a choice of any theme, color, holiday, birthday, or any idea you can come up with. The same thing with all my other products that I offer. My custom candy dishes, and frames. Although I only have a few things listed as to what I offer. I am always coming up with new things. Each idea I come up with gets a good response, but the customers are just not there. I am in need of getting a bigger customer base (Website) and more. I am the only employee at this time. I would like to expand one day soon. I have four young ladies that I have given birth to and they are watching my every move. We are also looking to secure a bus with the purpose to reach young girls from the ages of 6 to 16. We are looking to have 20 to 25 girls to come at one time. Our goal is to help better those that are at risk young girls and teens. We will use our techniques for urban development and to empower the girls we meet. We plan on having the girls come once a week for a couple of hours. They will learn skills they can use in their daily lives, get mentoring, and talk about things going on around them, and in their communities. For Urban Development they will learn: 1. Sanitation and Hygiene (Housework, cooking, cleaning and childcare). 2. Health (Respect bodies, sexually transmitted infections, including HIV). 3. Self-control 4. Communication 5. Mental Health Some ways to (Empower) them are to talk about subjects that may affect them in positive or negative way: 1. Abuse and Violence 2. Role Models 3. Peer Matter 4. Early Intervention 5. Training 6. Education 7. Counseling 8. Medical care Some other things we will touch on are showing others that you appreciate them by: 1. Writing notes to those that have encouraged them years ago 2. Pick up coffee or small treats to welcome someone new at school, or work 3. Encourage them to tell someone close to them how much they appreciate them We will encourage them to stay in school, because doing so will help them: 1. Have fewer children 2. Earn more money 3. Help younger siblings I will have other ladies or people in the community involved in the program to volunteer their time. Examples of some are: 1. Alicia Thee Chef of Tasteful Events Catering also known as \u201cThe LunchBox Specialist 2. Del-Lea Atkins of Lea Locs | Quality Virgin Hair who is going to come in and teach them hair care. We will reach out to local schools, group homes, daycares, and other programs that have girls the ages we are trying to reach. We will also advertise with emails, radio, social media, and flyers. I Kathy Lee will be over the program and will be the owner of the bus. I will also be the one responsible for the bus care, and activities that will be going on. I will be the one to invite or ask for the volunteers to come in and speak with, or to teach the girls what\u2019s being offered.

We have- been donating to a local foundation here in Milwaukee called Cynthia\u2019s Breast Cancer Giving Circle. Her story as to why and how it all came about really touched me. She not only had the disease not (1) time, but she had it (3). The first year I donated (1) basket in 2015. My second year I wanted to do at least (5) and ended up doing (8) with donations from others and myself. This year I am planning on bigger and better. I want different businesses to sponsor a basket to donate. This way they can not only bless someone else, but themselves as well. I am hoping that my letter touch you or someone on your staff to give me a chance to continue improving my life. Not only for me, but for my family as well. I am a hard worker, I have a loving and giving heart. I love to exceed to see bigger and better things for me and other too. At this time I am working a full-time job as Administrative Coordinator with a company DRS Technologies here in Milwaukee, WI. I am in the process of doing a fundraiser and girl\u2019s empowerment event May 19, 2018. It is not as easy as I thought it would be. Here is what I am planning for the event: \"Pink With A Purpose,\" will be taking place on May 19, 2018 at 2053 N King Drive. We will be there from 6 pm to 10 pm for a fundraiser and girl empowerment event. The details of this event is to raise funds to take my business to next level, and help empower young girls ages 6 to 16. What do I mean by taking our business to next level? I would like to purchase a large school bus, remodel to have it function as a mobile gift shop, cafe, and meeting place for young girls. The name of our business is \"God Morning\" Mugs And More, which was founded by me Kathy Lee. What we offer on the business side is spiritual mugs, gift baskets, custom made candy dishes, glass pieces, and gift certificates. They are very affordable prices, and can order for any occasion. Most single orders can be completed within 2-3 days, and our mugs will take about 2 weeks for special orders. When the mugs are hand you can get them same day or next day, depending on the time they ordered. The cafe portion of the bus will be used for customers to come in and enjoy light snacks, coffee and other drinks, internet, some nice music, and a meeting place for young comes to come in and learn everyday skills, talk about topics concerning them, and be able to come in and be able to talk to their peers, and get counseling if needed. I will pick certain locations throughout the Milwaukee area to sit. I will be contacting schools, day cares, and facilities that have children, so they can get involved in the programs I will have. This is the main reason I would like to have on something mobile, because I would like to be able to go to more than just one location. This would also help those that are not mobile. I can come to a location a sit for about an hour or two. I have several other entrepreneurs on board to teach with cooking and learning recipes, hygiene, up keep with hair, talking about being a business owner, and abuse. At the event Pink With A Purpose we will have lots of entertainment, and door prizes. We will have: A Professional fashion show (this is where the young girls will pick a profession, dress as such, and then be announced). Hair Show by Del-Lea Atkins @Lea Locs | Quality Virgin Hair.
