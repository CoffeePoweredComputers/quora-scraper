            "answer_text": "Of course not! We\u2019re too big, dark and scary. Ooga booga! On a serious note, questions such as these are very hard to calculate and reply to because it assumes that Asian women(Native or Westernized) have a monolithic taste or preference. You could use marriage/dating statistics to conclude that they don\u2019t but, statistically, I should be incarcerated or dead at my age range for my race/gender demographic on average so statistics certainly can\u2019t be used to determine the preference of every Asian woman out there. I\u2019ve dated three American women who happened to be of Asian origin( two of them Filipino American and one Nisei Japanese American) before. My father dated some native Korean women when he was stationed in South Korea decades ago. I\u2019ve seen BM/AW couples here and there in the Metro New York area where I reside. It\u2019s not as common as BM/WW or WM/AW couples obviously but there\u2019s many more factors behind this that go beyond basic attraction such as socioeconomic and academic disparities as well as the receptiveness/tolerance coming from the Asian families(Asian man = ideal, White man = good enough, Black or Hispanic man = bad). There\u2019s a stigma towards dark skin in Asia yet there\u2019s a number of black men married to native Asian women. Are Asian women generally attracted to the average black man? The answer is probably not. However, this answer can go both ways. Black men who have little exposure to Asian women probably aren\u2019t attracted to the average Asian woman either. However, there\u2019s Asian women who are attracted to black men and others who aren\u2019t but are attracted to Denzel Washington and other handsome black individuals. So, it essence, it depends. ",

            "answer_text": "So I\u2019ll plug in and answer this because I am an African-American and I have lived in Shanghai, China for 6 years and have spent a few semesters in Beijing. The simple answer is \u201cnot really.\u201d The complicated answer is \u201cIt really depends.\u201d You pretty much have to take it country by country and culture by culture. 1.) East Asian cultures tend to have a bias for pale skin and an adoration for Europeans and white people, complemented by a bias against dark skin and a very visible disdain for Africans and black people-seeing them as poor, ugly and uneducated. Your best bet for dating success is probably Japan because of the influence of Hip-hop and the presence of the U.S military. Out of 20 Chinese women, 1 will be attracted to black men. Group 20 groups of those 1/20 women and 1 will act on it, this is probably due to cultural pressure since many women in this part of the world use marriage as a means of social climbing. So white is going \u201cup\u201d and black is going \u201cdown.\u201d Of, course these attitudes can change with exposure. 2.) Outside of East Asia, many women simply prefer to stick to and marry within their own culture because they truly love and want to preserve their own culture. If they marry outside of their culture, they seem to succumb to the color bias I mentioned above and go for white guys. Somehow, Colonialism has seemed to really affect people\u2019s preferences for mates and preferences regarding what is beautiful, or perhaps it was already there and was exacerbated by colonialism. The strongest example of this is India. The weakest examples, where black men seem to do best, are Thailand and The Philippines. ",

            "answer_text": "You should not listen to a lot of the old white guys answering the question because they often lie. They have this false narrative that Asian women prefer white skin on their men lol. If a women works hard to make her hair pretty and long, does that mean she prefers guys with long pretty hair, NO. If she spend hours a day on lipstick and make up does that mean she prefers guys who wear make up and lipstick? Tall dark, strong and handsome is an international standard in male beauty. Like the first guy mentioned many white guys feel insecure about black men because of the Mandingo reputation and the international recognition that blacks are exceptional in sports and other manly attributes. They don't like this so to protect their fragile male ego they often lie about how other groups of women feel, like they would know lol. Just look at how many African men are intermarrying in Guangzhou China. Maybe they should start wearing lipstick to make themselves pretty for their Thai girlfriend then they would really be a hit lol. Fuck outta here grandpa, don't be mad cause you can't compete. ",

I know a bunch of Asians who say they don\u2019t mind dating blacks. I saw one Asian woman with a black man and their kid at Wal Mart the other day. You have to know where to look and make your demands known. This youtuber said black men are in demand.  Here\u2019s a Filipina who expressed her love for black men. It\u2019s hilarious how alot of guys from other races got so triggered and offended.  If you ask around, you\u2019ll find Asian women who say they want black men. The perception that only white men can date Asian women is wrong. Granted, there\u2019s an exception to every rule. Overall, the whites who push that view don\u2019t want competition lol. ",

It\u2019s a preference I have dated lots of asian women all of different cultures from Japanese to Asian Americans and they are just like all women from different races and cultures if they find you attractive they will date you. I promise it\u2019s not what everyone is telling you. I promise in the real world if someone finds YOU attractive they will give you the time of day. Also not just looks it\u2019s deeper than being nice looking in a tight shirt with a nice smile. So yes Asian women do date black men. ",
