            "answer_text": "If you want a line from me, I'll deliver the literature of poetry but, intuiting that prose is ardently requested, I have not a line but a passage\u2026.the first that came to my mind with the question\u2026. \"Here at the age of thirty-nine I began to be old. I felt stiff and weary in the evenings and reluctant to go out of camp; I developed proprietary claims to certain chairs and newspapers; I regularly drank three glasses of gin before dinner, never more or less, and-went to bed immediately after the nine o'clock news. I was always awake and fretful an hour before reveille. Here -my last love died - There was nothing remarkable in the manner of its death. One day, not long before 'this last day in camp, as I lay awake before reveille, in the Nissen hut, gazing into the complete blackness, amid the deep breathing and muttering of the four other occupants, turning over in my mind what I had to do that day - had I put in the names of two corporals for the weapon-training course? Should I again have the largest number of men overstaying their leave in the batch due back that day? CouldI trust Hooper to take the candidates class out map-reading? - as I lay in that dark hour, I was aghast to realize that something within me, long sickening, had quietly died, and felt as a husband might feel, who, in the fourth year of his marriage, suddenly knew that the had no longer any desire, or tenderness, or esteem, for a once-beloved wife; no pleasure in her company, no wish to please, no curiosity about anything she might ever do or say or think; no hope of setting things right, no self-reproach for the disaster.\" This, from Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh. It was part of the prologue in which we meet Charles, narrator and main character as he was as he began his rich-yet-restrained emotional narrative and remembrance of things past, to borrow from Proust. The passage is just so redolent with hidden emotion and human beauty as Charles feels much of his life behind him and he the less for it\u2026.the poignance in the quiet, honest, sad passage is for me, one of true beauty, all the more lovely as it slips away\u2026..
