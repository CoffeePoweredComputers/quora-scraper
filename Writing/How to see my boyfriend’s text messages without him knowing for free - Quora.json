            "answer_text": "Why would you want to do that? If you suspect that he is cheating, simply wait until you have actual proof. The only way to read his text free would be going through his phone when he's not around, but that will break your trust, especially if he had done nothing wrong. Couples don't need to know what's on each other's minds constantly. Give him space ig there isn't any obvious signs that he is cheating. You can also message me or comment down below if you think some of his actions are suspicious. ",
