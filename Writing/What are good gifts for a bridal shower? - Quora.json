            "answer_text": "As a maid of honor, I just held a bridal shower for my best friend. I tried to make it easy on the guests by having a kitchen theme/gift focus and by getting the bride to set up her registries and at least add some kitchen items to them so guests could start there. If you don't have a theme or registry to go by, I would suggest thinking about the bride's tastes and needs. Will she be moving to a new place after the wedding? Is she trying to build up her kitchen, housewares, etc.? The gift certainly doesn't have to be as expensive as a wedding gift, but try to think about it being more personal and fitting the style of the bride. Some ideas:- recipe box- small appliance- bar gift set for cocktails- monogrammed towels, dishtowels, etc. Another nice idea if you already know what you're giving them for the wedding is to give a shower gift that hints or complements that (napkin rings for nice napkins, nice measuring or mixing tools for a mixing bowl set).
