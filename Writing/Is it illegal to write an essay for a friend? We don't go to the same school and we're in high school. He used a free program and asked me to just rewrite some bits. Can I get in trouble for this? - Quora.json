            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not generally illegal to write an essay for a friend, unless the essay is used to commit fraud. Plenty of people use ghostwriters to write essays and books and whatnot, and ghostwriters can make excellent money. The problem that you run into is that it\u2019s dishonest. It\u2019s cheating. You already know that your friend is using software (and you!) to do his schoolwork for him, and then he\u2019s going to turn it in as his own work. This is definitely against the policy of every educational system in the world, so when your friend is caught, he will certainly be disciplined and very likely expelled. In an effort to mitigate the consequences of violating whatever \u201chonor code\u201d is in force, he\u2019ll tell everyone that you helped him with it so that he can spread the blame. His school will contact your school, and you\u2019ll be disciplined and quite possibly expelled as well. Notes will be placed in your file, which will be right there for educators to read when you apply to colleges. This could be a problem for you both if you ever want a job more interesting and lucrative than mucking out horse stalls. (Not that mucking out horse stalls isn\u2019t honorable, honest labor, but I\u2019m guessing that that particular blue-collar career appears nowhere on your personal list of potential careers to prepare for.) So - illegal? No. Dishonest? Absolutely, and the fact that you\u2019re asking the question tells me that - at some deep level - you already understand you already understand this, although your friend does not. Which brings us to something else you may not have considered: You\u2019re earning your grades through hard work and study, but your friend is cheating. So you need to ask yourself if this is really someone that you want for a friend. Liars, cheats, and thieves never change. They may get better at not being caught, but is that someone you want in your life? Is that someone you want to work with, or work for? Many people get ahead in life by cheating, but they make lousy friends. The short answer, then, would be Hell, yes, you can get into trouble for helping a friend cheat, just as you can get into trouble for helping a friend rob a bank, steal a car, or change his report card.
