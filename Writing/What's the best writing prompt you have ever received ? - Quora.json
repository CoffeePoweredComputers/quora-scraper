            "answer_text": "One of the pieces I most enjoyed writing, was an AU (alternative universe), where my friend's character and mine were basically doing Moulin Rouge. I still go back and reread it once in a while. The story was quite basic: Pia is the star of the show at moulin rouge. Nick makes a living by blackmailing people. One of those people is Baker, who Pia works for. Barker has a major deal (unspecified, if I remember correctly) going with The Russians (which, to us, was the code word for \u2018random bad guys we didn't take time to invent properly\u2019), and needs to keep them happy (cue: use Pia whenever they saw fit). Because of a random mixup, Nick ends up in Pia\u2019s chamber, where she tries to seduce him, only to realise he's there to get money. She doesn't have any, obviously, so she sends him on his way. Only, as she does so, the man she was supposed to meet is at the door. Nick quickly hides in the room, witnessing the violent behaviour of the Russian man. Pia uses her wits and gets the man passed on to one of her coworkers, and goes with Nick to talk to Barker. Despite Barker\u2019s best efforts to get out of it, he eventually have to pay up. A few weeks later, Nick returns, this time for pleasure rather than business. Nick is pretentious by nature, and thinks nothing more of Pia than her being a basic whore, but Pia is committed to proving him wrong. Nick pays for the, er, services, but what he's really after is getting to know Pia. Because what he saw last time he was there, wasn't some naive bimbo, but rather a shrewed woman who knew how to manipulate and work the situation to her advantage. He admired that. Anyway, they get down to business, and Nick asks about her preferences, which Pia finds odd. Afterwards they just talk all night and sorta falls in love. Then they can't see eachother much because Barker\u2019s deal is being dragged out and taken advantage of, and Pia isn't very well because of it. She is bruised, fatigued, and underfed, and fakes a sprained ankle just to run away and see Nick. She immediately falls asleep when she gets there, and when she woke up in the morning, she and Nick concoct a plan to get her out of the moulin rouge. Basically, she has to poison the Russians. Things goes according to plan\u2026 well, until she's back to Nick\u2019s place, and she slowly dies from accidentally poisoning herself as well. Whoops.

Not really eavesdropping, I will hear bits of conversation that might make me think a bit. One of my very early attempts at a story came from overhearing one woman telling another something along the lines of \"He shouldn't be treating you as if you were his present.\" I ended up with a story that ended with the woman saying \"I'm not your present. I'm your past.\" ",
