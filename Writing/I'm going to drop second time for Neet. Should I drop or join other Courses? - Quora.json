            "answer_text": "I will tell you what I feel would be good for you but at the end you are the one who will ultimately decide whether you have that zeal to take complete benefit of the golden year of drop because taking a drop needs great dedication. Take a drop only if you can join a coaching and that to out of your city . No matter which branch it is of any good coaching it makes no difference if you are sincere enough to attend all the classes ,all the practice tests and complete your modules and homework on time . Go through every corner of the ncerts and never underestimate any chapter even if you are least interested in any topic or you feel it does not have much weightage. Do what your heart wants to do and since you have mentioned that mbbs is the only thing you want to do then drifting your profession will anyways spoil your career because anything done without interest will never benefit you in future also a self in satisfaction all through your life will make you unhappy someday or the other. When you don't get what you wanted to that fascinates you even more and till when will you prove yourself by words that you wanted to be a doctor . Its better to take a risk than to live with a permanent incompleteness all through your life . Without taking a risk you will never know where you could have been in future . But again reminding you taking a drop needs constant dedication . You can't afford to have a temporary fire in you . You will have to work constantly all through the year because you have to make a great difference according to your previous score . And after taking a drop give everything a fresh start . Be brave and always remember you are a fresher until and unless you get overconfident about your previous preparation. Be strong enough to face everything that comes in your neet journey. And put in as much efforts you can . Have faith in the almighty and without wasting your time start your preparation. Work hard .  Thanks for A2A! All the best :) ",
