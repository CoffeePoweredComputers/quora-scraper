            "answer_text": "This can be a *great* opportunity. Gore Vidal \u2014 Gore Vidal - Wikipedia \u2014 made it a career-shaper. But your approach depends on your audience and the nature of your hatred. First get very clear in your head exactly the nature of your hatred. Or you\u2019ll just come off as a loon. Do you hate this book because of what it says? Or the way it says it? Is your objection to its content? Or its writing execution? Or the way it conflicts with everything you believe to be true and right and holy? If you\u2019re hatred is purely visceral, and you can\u2019t figure out exactly why, stop. Figure it out. Learn from that exercise. (The advice that follows presupposes rationality on your part \u2014 and that you have something interesting to say.) Are you writing for a professor in a course? In that case, you probably want to approach this in a studied fashion, going light on the fireworks. Lay out your case. Okay to start with a lede that says \u201cthis is the worst waste of dead trees/electrons I have ever encountered\u201d or similar. But make *sure* you convincingly make your case. Throw in a few \u201cto be sure\u201d paragraphs that make it clear you are aware that others may differ. State those reasons in those paragraphs. Then go back to your killer argument. (Important: If you\u2019re going to piss people off, don\u2019t do it accidentally. Make *sure* you\u2019re doing it on purpose.) Are you writing for a publication or web site with readers whose minds you actually endeavor to change? Same as above, but let your stylistic and literary flair shine. Convince readers you are are a writer with whom to be reckoned. Are you writing for people likely to share your outlooks? (E.g., much of the highly siloed web, sadly.) Well, you can see all around you where that goes. Sure, why not, let it rip. Become the Thomas Paine \u2014 Thomas Paine - Wikipedia \u2014 of your generation. Make your mouth-foaming entertaining, of course. But it would be nice if you were also enlightening. Otherwise, why are you writing? ",
