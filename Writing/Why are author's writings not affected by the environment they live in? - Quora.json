            "answer_text": "\u2018Why are author's writings not affected by the environment they live in?\u2019 This is an interesting\u2014and somewhat strange, if I\u2019m being honest\u2014way to word this question. Perhaps it was asked in response from a quote OP read or heard? Ultimately, as it is impossible to show how something is not affected by something else, there is no valid answer to the question as stated though the corollary (\u2018Why are an author\u2019s writings affected by the environment they live in?) can be answered, and in this way some light can be shed on the question as asked. I would say that, like most things, the degree to which an author\u2019s environment influences their writing, can vary on a spectrum, from \u2018quite a lot\u2019, to \u2018not very much\u2019. Some of this influence is going to be within the writer\u2019s control (a writer can choose, of course what topic they will writing about, and some writers specifically write with their environment in mind) while other aspects (things like language, culture and upbringing) are going to be harder, or impossible to reduce or eliminate. Some writers are known for taking great measures to reduce or eliminate the role of their environment, some going as far as locking themselves in windowless rooms for long periods of time in order to write. While this cannot absolutely eliminate the effect of their environment, it can probably allow the writer\u2019s imagination to take precedence over most environmental factors. At the end of the day there is a good argument that no writer is able to totally remove their environment from their writing, though the effect might be so small as to be functionally invisible to all but the most astute reader. Simply \u2018being human\u2019 can be considered an environmental factor which colors all (human) writer\u2019s work. There are those who would argue (rightly I would suggest) that being abled, one\u2019s race, gender, upbringing and so are environmental factors that color one writing, but which so many of us hold in common as to be simply ignored in most cases.
