            "answer_text": "You may begin where you are. It does help to expand your vocabulary. As you write, if you find yourself unable to think of the right word, or you\u2019re using the same words over and over, look them up in a Thesaurus to find other words that mean the same thing or similar. Be sure the word you use is what you mean. Many words have subtle variations in their meanings. Also, do not use words because they are \u201cpopular.\u201d For example, people use \u201cimpact\u201d because it\u2019s easier than learning what \u201ceffect\u201d and \u201caffect\u201d mean. It\u2019s a lazy way, and it does not mean either one of those words. Impact means something crashed to the ground, something hit hard, a collision. Effect and affect have to do with feelings and results. How something affects you can have an effect on your life. Read well educated authors, do not get frustrated by their wonderful vocabularies; look up any new words you come across and expand your own. One of my favorite authors is Elizabeth George because of her fabulous vocabulary. My own is extensive, but I still come across words in her books I look up\u2014and then I own those words, too. Don\u2019t take for granted that you know the meaning of certain words, look them up. You will grow as a writer, reader, and speaker-conversationalist. We have so many stimulating and riveting words in our language, so much variety, and words with exact meanings and shades of meaning, there\u2019s no need to use lazy words or to bore your reader. That said, if you want to write, begin with the vocabulary you have and never fear to expand it as you go. There seems to be a market for every level of writer as long as the story is well written.

            "answer_text": "Building your vocabulary is lifelong. It helps to read anything and everything you can get your hands on. BUT, I have a significant vocabulary and I came across one book recently that had me literally looking up two words per page at least. Oh. my. gosh. It was so frustrating! These were words I had never even seen before, and I have read some heavy duty authors who have contributed greatly to literature. Do you need a vocabulary? Yes. Do you need to broaden it? Yes. Do you need to do that before you write a book? No. Read your favorite authors. You will learn and grow as you go. Happy writing! ",
