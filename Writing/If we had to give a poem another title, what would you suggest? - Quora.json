Humpty-Dumpty sat on a wall Humpty-Dumpty had a great fall All the king\u2019s horses and all the king\u2019s men Couldn\u2019t put Humpty together again While some people might not consider the above a legitimate poem, I do. If I were to rename it (assuming it had a name to begin with), I\u2019d call it Beware of Walls. Or maybe The Failure of Kings. Or how about Horses Need Hands. There are infinite possibilities depending on the imagination of the reader. You need to be more specific in asking questions if you want intelligent answers. Please try again. ",
