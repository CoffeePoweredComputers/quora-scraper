            "answer_text": "Sure, plenty of people would appreciate some good story-writing in their feed. Quora has a blog feature that you can access from your profile page. I recommend writing your own stories through the blog interface rather than the question and answer one, since writing off-topic can get your content collapsed. If your story is relevant to answering a question, great, but otherwise, your personal blog is the place to go to write stories on Quora. You can make as many different kinds of \u201cblogs\u201d as you\u2019d like on your profile, if you don\u2019t want to post everything all together. Quora has information on how to start making your own posts HERE. There is more information available on the official topic of \u201cBlogs (Quora Content). You can find the topic using the search bar, or by clicking HERE. If the blog feature doesn\u2019t appeal to you, there are several more story-oriented interfaces available online. Wattpad is pretty not bad, and allows you to read other writers\u2019 work as well. I definitely recommend it as another potential place to write stories. It\u2019s not prohibited by Quora\u2019s policies to share a link to your content on other websites for the most part, so if you choose to write on, say, Wattpad, you can put a link to it in your profile to direct your followers to more of your content. The only exception to this would be if the content is accessed through an ad link (like adfly), or is \u201cfor sale\u201d, as these could be considered spam. Whether you wrote here or somewhere else, I\u2019d be interested in reading some well-written, creative content (assuming it doesn\u2019t stray too deeply into something I strongly dislike, like hockey). Happy writing, and good luck with your stories! ",
