            "answer_text": "I participated in the Albert Barrow Memorial National Inter-school Creative Writing competition in 2015 for category 2. I stood 6th from all over India with my short story I Do Not Know My Neighbours. To get a chance to participate in this competition is truly an honour because you get to compete with the best writers from the various schools affiliated to the CISCE. The topics provided are very relevant and provide a huge scope for the competitors to express themselves. Also, the competition allows the participants to choose from different writing forms such as: essays, short stories, poetry, memoirs, one-act plays, etc. thus providing the budding writers an opportunity to augment their composition skills in order to lucidly articulate their ideas.

I\u2019ll say choose whatever form of writing suits you best and that which you usually have practised while writing your english papers in school, like for me it was story writing. Don\u2019t write something thats very simplistic or cliched, I think they\u2019ll appreciate novelty. The only tip is that you should be a habitual reader and be creative. You can derive a lot from books so reading helps the most. ",

However, I have a valuable tip to offer around punctuation marks that is thrown up in your question and that is: Never insert a full stop before or after a question mark. This is because the question mark serves additionally as a full stop. Good luck with the competition. ",
