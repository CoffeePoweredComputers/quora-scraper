            "answer_text": "A journal. It's not only your best friend, it's the best listener. You can tell whatever you feel like, however bananas your thoughts may sound to you. It will never judge you. You turn to it when you're feeling blue, or happy or excited or frustrated. Now you say you want to write it effectively. The best way do achieve so, is being brutally, embarassingly honest with it. Pour out your feelings in it. Don't focus on the correct language, the good expressions,etc. You're not getting marked for this. Just ensure that you put your thoughts, ideas, emotions in it. Also, write when you're confused or disoriented. This helps you to get your thinking straight. You don't need to write everyday for the sake of doing it, just whenever you feel like you have something to share, with yourself. Consider reading these old scribbled pages after years, you meet your younger self and realise how you've changed to become you. Isn't this nostalgia worth it? ",

            "answer_text": "First thing is don't be rigid about writing it every day. Sometimes we feel cherishing each day is going to serve the whole purpose of a journal but eventually it doesn't . It becomes like a thing we do every day and then it looses it essence. I write my journal whenever I feel like I should note down the thoughts stuck in my head. Its like when we reach out to an old friend after a long time and we just get this urge to tell everything that was important enough in that missed out period.. Sometimes I use it as a punching bag to pour my anger and frustration. But it happens very less times because I don't want to read the bad times too often..after a long time I have figured out that each thing gets sorted out after giving it some time and just rambling about it on and on each time we have some trouble makes it more regrettable in future . So less frustrating and annoying thoughts. Never ever write negative about any person unless it's really messed up. Based on my previous experience I have found that when we are angry on someone we tend to over analyse them , even then small things they do annoy us and we write about them in a bad perspective .. it only looks bad when we read it affer some time when things have sorted out. So better limit journal bitching. Write the stuff you want to be improved in your life , let that be anything then. Personally I find this relieving as if I am sending a random wish out and soon it will be fulfilled . It stays back of our head and definitely changes things slowly \u2026 Keeping suvinuors from moments you want to remember. I have this weird habit of keeping the small things which marks some day which I want to be remembered later. I have so many pages of my journals filled with small stuffs like flower petals or classroom doodles . I like having these things to look at when the time had passed and it just remains as a reference to something I want to cherish. May you figure out your own ways of writing journal effectively. Happy Journaling ! ",
