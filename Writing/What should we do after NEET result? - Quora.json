            "answer_text": "There could be two possibilities after the neet results are out. First let's talk about a successful attempt. If you are scoring good marks and you are pretty sure about yourself securing a government seat in the college you have dreamt of Then first thing GO PARTY. ENJOY the happiness of living the moment you have waited for during your strenuous and religious preparation. You have one week before the counselling starts before that grab all the required information as to how to proceed for right college preferences and along with it in this one week you can also visit for a day or two to your favourite place it could be a relative\u2019s house any city trip with your friends or it could be anything. Once the counselling begins go with the procedure and again you have almost one month till the college starts this time is fully yours do whatever you want to do Man. You will be happy because yes you know that you are going to be a doctor. Now let's come to an unfortunate unsuccessful attempt. After giving NEET exam till the date results will be out you have a quite long time. So don't waste this time waiting for results because a candidate gets a pretty clear idea (not exactly though) how's the result is going to be, right after handling the OMR to the invigilator. After checking for the answer key you become pretty sure whether you are going to be selected or not (official answer key could have one or two answers different but Not more than that generally) . So basically now you know what's going to happen at the time of results. So I would suggest you to analyse and take the correct decision of trying once more for the next NEET examination if this was your first attempt (I hv seen droppers becoming toppers) I would definitely recommend you to try once more and devote all that everything you have preparing for the exam once again. Many people think that life of a dropper is sad difficult or depressed but it is never like this because you gotta love the life you live while making the life of your dreams. Society would try to stagnate you. Relatives would compare their children to you and their success stories will torture you but take all these hurdles as your race starts and go ahead start drinking your ncerts again start celebrating the mock tests start enjoying the DC pandey and surely start learning things you left this time so that you don't have to regret again after the next NEET exam. Just keep one thing in mind that the FEAR OF FAILURE should be so tragic that It does not let you sleep more than 6\u20137 hours per day. PS : I faced the second situation last year. But now I am waiting for good results in neet'19 with my fingers crossed .. ",
