            "answer_text": "As my bio says, I\u2019ve published a lot of stuff, so I could tell you many stories. But I don\u2019t know what kind of information you seek. Another way to interpret your question is that you want to know what it\u2019s like to write aiming for a particular place to publish, perhaps upon request. Well, I almost never wrote \u201cfor publication\u201d in that sense. I wrote stuff, and then I sought places to publish it. With a few exceptions. The exceptions were generally sad stories. Like the time the ACM invited me to write a survey of programming languages. I researched this \u201cfor publication\u201d article and wrote the survey. I sent it to the ACM and didn\u2019t hear anything from them for more than a year. I finally wrote and asked them what was going on. It turned out that they\u2019d changed editors and the article was lost. I resubmitted a copy of the survey, and 11 months later (about 3 years after invitation to publish), they replied that the survey was not \u201cup to date.\u201d They wanted me to rewrite it, but I told them to forget it. I\u2019ve never written anything for ACM publication since then, and that\u2019s a long time ago. Another story. A Prentice-Hall subsidiary asked me to write an introductory computer science textbook. I didn\u2019t want to do it, but the editor assured me it would sell \u201ca million copies\u201d and also encourage the sale of my other books. I finally agreed, mostly because I was able to team up with Dennis Geller to share the work. We wrote a terrific book, but it sold only about 10,000 copies, by far the worst-selling book I\u2019ve published so far. So much for \u201cwriting for publication.\u201d <http://www.geraldmweinberg.com> ",

            "answer_text": "I have been a reporter and or features editor with the number one community newspaper in Florida for the past 22 years. (Venice Gondolier Sun) My life has been blessed in many ways but as a transplsnt from Ohio to Florida I could not have found anything better to do. Covering the city all these years has bonded me to this community in many ways as it has enriched my life. Most of my best friends in the area I have met on the job or because of the job or because I also judge figure skating . When I arrived in Fla. 22 years ago skating judges were not so prevalent aa they are today. That too has added much to my life. I even wrote a few articles for Skating magazine and also about skating for the local paper. I have also written and published 14 best selling books on Florida, including Venice specifically. Six won awards from Florida Publishers Assoc. and one won a national award IPPY) for historical writing. It is now in its fourth printing. The writing also led to many requests to speak to local groups, do signings at stores and make several appearances on local tv shows, including a popular local cooking show. Life is good, and all this has kept me happily busy. While I was primarily an artist in Cleveland I also wrote many books there with my business partner . They were all in the craft and needlework fields but writing is writing no matter the genre. Only the style changes. ",

            "answer_text": "I've written and sold poems and one chapbook of poems titled \u201cDecalmaker\". The latter is poems about my experience working in the factory as a Decalmaker for the Boeing Company. I still have some available. I spent about 4-5 years writing and selling freelance articles to Yahoo! and Associated Content. I've written and sold short stories to small journals. For reasons I can't go into, I lost the urge to submit as people tried to blackmail me into doing a variety of thing; the latest that occurs when I submit something, everyone asks, are you teaching? So I don\u2019t submit. The idea of leaving retirement after 15 years working from home, at the age of 58, to have thirty students for six hours a day talking at me is a form if horror I couldn\u2019t really tolerate. Most of my teaching experience has been to small classes for a short duration of an hour or so. I've edited book manuscripts and run small creative writing workshops. I've made presentations to large groups for an hour. I've worked with youngsters on fun items for short times and Catholic PREP. But teach full time--this is just not me. So I'm writing and looking for a publisher with low hope due to the threats I rec eive but don't really want to do a lot of work that I'm not interested in doing. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you talking about writing for hire? Or writing for submission? Because they are two different things. I\u2019ve done both. Writing for hire is when an editor contacts you with an idea for an article or a story and says that they will pay you X amount of money if you will write said article, at say, 2,000 words and have it done in 30 days. The pluses are that it is pretty much guaranteed publication, and they almost always pay you more. The minuses are that all rights belong to the publication; you can\u2019t republish your work without permission. Writing for submission, the second option, is when you have a great idea for a story for publication and you either propose it to the editor or go ahead and write it and submit it. The disadvantage there is that they could always say no, even though you have already written it. It\u2019s a crap shoot, unless you are a good writer and really know the publication. The good side of it is, well, you still own the story, so you can send it somewhere else. Over the years, I\u2019ve published over 200 articles and stories in various regional and national publications, both as work for hire, and as \u201cover the transom\u201d submitted stories. ",
