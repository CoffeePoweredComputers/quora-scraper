            "answer_text": "Original Question: Someone is willing to pay me $200 for writing an essay for them. Can the school find out I did this? Is this illegal? Paying someone to perform a service is generally legal. However, it would be foolhardy to declare this blanket statement true in all cases. Factors that could influence your responsibility could include your knowledge of the use of the essay, your relationship with the school in question (Are you a student at the same school?), and your relationship with any institution to which you\u2019re connected. For example, let\u2019s say that you have been paid to write an essay to help a student get an internship. If the internship is in part sponsored by governmental grants (which is likely), you could be charged with conspiracy to defraud per 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f371: \u201cIf two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d If you are a student yourself, you would likely be violating the school\u2019s code of conduct. While you would probably not be charged with a crime, typical consequences would be loss of scholarship or expulsion. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not \u201cillegal,\u201d but it is unethical and most certainly against the rules of the school the person who is trying to hire you attends. As a professor, I know students\u2019 writing styles. If they have already submitted a paper they've written, or done any writing in class, their professor will likely catch it. If you and this person attend the same school, there is no guarantee they won't throw you under the bus. If you DO get caught, your reputation will be damaged and you could face penalties up to expulsion. I know what it's like to be a broke college student, but I personally wouldn't do it. I know students have very relaxed ideas about cheating these days, but professors and administrators don't. I take cheating of any kind very seriously and when I catch a student cheating, it's almost always an automatic \u201cF.\u201d ",
