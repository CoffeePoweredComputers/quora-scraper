Maybe you should take your hand away from the paper after the words start to go wrong, then bring it back to the paper to finish the sentence. In this way, you\u2019d be reproducing the conditions that existed when you wrote your words well at the beginning: you\u2019d be resetting yourself. Give it a shot. Eventually you could make the hand movement away from the page smaller, until you just raise your pen tip off the page to \u201creset\u201d yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cPretty handwriting for a boy. . .\u201d  When I was in the fourth grade, my teacher passed by my desk one day while we were writing. She softly said, \u201cOh, Michael, you have such pretty handwriting for a boy.\u201d Wow! You can guess what that did to my ego. It made me practice my handwriting. I found handwriting in our set of encyclopedias that was \u201cpretty\u201d to me. I would pick a name, like \u201cWilliam Jennings Bryan\u201d and practiced until I could make it look like the picture I was looking at. Over time, I adopted that style, and now it comes natural. I guess I still have \u201cpretty handwriting for a boy.\u201d Recently, I took note of my daughters\u2019 handwriting. They write like I do. My grandson, however, writes more like his grandmother. Sometimes my handwriting changes for the occasion, sometimes because I am in a hurry, sometimes when I am tense it changes. I still practice and ply with it a lot. Don\u2019t believe everything you hear; sometimes how you say it is as important as what you say. Writing may be nearly the same. What do you think? ",

            "answer_text": "It's nothing to be ashamed of. You just think quicker than you write. My handwriting looks pretty then turns to chicken scratch. I would suggest writing your thoughts down on a separate paper (maybe a post it note) then rewriting them slowly and in complete sentences on you main paper you'll turn in. If your handwriting is sloppy altogether you may just need to practice. It took me a long time to accomplish decent looking print considering throughout my years of being in school I was required to write incursive. ",
