And it is a illegal drug one can get serious troubles including prison and this is a very depressing thing.

When you take cocaine your brain will produce so much dopamine and when you stop taking it, your dopamine levels will never go up that high. So in the end you will feel like you can never be happy again unless you have another dose of cocaine. By the way, cocaine can cause psychosis. ",
