            "answer_text": "Mental illness isn\u2019t a competition, but if you want my honest opinion, I am going to give you two answers: short-term, no, long-term, yes. Why? Schizophrenia is lifelong, whereas borderline, not. Schizophrenia needs killing drugs that kill your body, as there is currently no other known treatment.. So in a long-term sense, yes, it is much worse. Short-term, borderline is much, much worse and has a higher risk of suicide and the stigma is actually worse than in schizophrenia. There have even been people who have both schizophrenia and borderline, and they said borderline was a lot worse for them which Marsha Linehan talked about.. So you can sort of say they\u2019re equally bad, you can say borderline is worse since it kills more people, makes doctors and nurses treat you with lesser care and makes people lose opportunities and get more abused, or you can say schizophrenia is worse because it is lifelong and treatments will literally overtime, kill you. It can even instantly kill you, as sudden death is reported\u2026 So schizophrenia is worse long-term because of this:Psychiatric Medications Kill More Americans than Heroin - Drug Rehab Options, Antipsychotics - What you need to know. And it is a serious mental disorder and most people in hospitalization settings have some form of psychosis.. It can make people do crazy, crazy things if untreated and severe enough, like run naked outside. Schizophrenics have a high likelihood for incarceration because of this. Borderline is worse short-term because of this:Responses of Mental Health Clinicians to Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (worse stigma even than schizophrenia and nurses will treat schizophrenic patients much better), and also because of this:   It has the highest suicide rate\u2026 And we have intense pain.  Borderline also is related to childhood abuse, whereas schizophrenia not. This means most of us also have complex post traumatic stress disorder as myself. Short-term, borderline probably will have a worse quality of life. No med can alleviate pain, DBT takes generally 2\u20133 years to work, and the stigma really depletes life quality. People don;t ask these kinds of questions for schizophrenia:Kara Soylular's answer to If you could press a button that would kill everyone with a borderline personality disorder, would you press it?.. There is more risk for someone young to die than in someone who has schizophrenia. And substance abuse and eating disorders often co-occur with borderline which adds an even higher percentage of death. A schizophrenic in short-term, will find relief from meds and not as present symptoms. If you personally had to ask me which condition is the worst all-around, it is autism.. I also have that disorder, and there are many reasons as to why I think autism is the worst mental disorder to have (it is more neurological than psychiatric), but this question and therefore, answer, doesn\u2019t pertain to that. But in short, lifelong stigma, a guaranteed bad childhood and trauma (at least in American culture) through bullying and educational failure, often as in my case, childhood abuse (parents devaluing us for autism, being seen as the problem of the family for being autistic and being abused because parents take out things on you), lifelong sensory overload/hypervigilance, lifelong isolation, live a life where everyone misunderstands you and has expectations you cannot meet, oftentimes, you are put on lifelong antipsychotics and mood stabilizers which also kill you (antipsychotics for obsessive thinking), and it makes you super vulernable to developing other mental disorders\u2014 OCD, borderline, avoidantPD, schizotpyalPD, OCPD, CPTSD, ADD, ADHD, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, eating disorders\u2026 I have autism, and I have (diagnosed) CPTSD, borderline, ADD, schizotypal and depression, and have been diagnosed with OCD a few times before as well\u2026 It\u2019s almost impossible to not have other disorder when you have autism. Also a lifelong being 2/3 your age, and yet being expected by society to act like the full 3/3 of your age. I was BLUNTY traumatized when three years ago, I had been transferred from a child\u2019s facility to an adult one on my 18th birthday, because really, I only was TWELVE years old\u2026 That is pretty damn traumatizing, and that is the reality for people who are autistic, something not present in any other disorder. (Since people with down syndrome and low functioning autism are given more compassion and aren\u2019t expected to be adult).  ",

With BPD you run into a large emotional component with the disorder. They\u2019re in emotional turmoil all the time. Where schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions). One thing to keep in mind though is that for a person with Borderline Personality Disorder, they can experience psychotic symptoms when stressed. In my personal opinion, I wouldn\u2019t want to have either one. As far as which one is worse? I\u2019d have to say Borderline Personality Disorder is for the fact it affects both the person with the disorder and the people around them. Not that people with schizophrenia don\u2019t affect those around them, but because they\u2019re more likely to be internally suffering than to lash out. And because pwBPD can experience psychotic symptoms as well. ",

Studies seem to show that the delusions and disorganized speech, catatonic behavior and lack of normal emotional responses, to events, disrupted flows of speech, etc. presenting with schizophrenia creates a larger cognitive dysfunction in regards to memory and verbal-linguistic learning, etc. Essentially a person with schizophrenia will find it more difficult to integrate and function socially from what I have seen comparing the two in studies.
