            "answer_text": "Hi S, What topic or niche do you blog about? Where do you even begin? This is a key decision because your choice will influence just about everything on your blog. You certainly have some control over how much traffic you get, how often our posts are shared and how much money you can make. But your niche can be a key factor. So remember, you need to give proper thought and research to the niche you select. Otherwise you can spend countless hours of effort building your blog and creating great posts, offering products and more, and the result may still be very little traffic or sales. A lack of visitors may not be that important if you are simply blogging for fun, or for the purpose of delivering a message to a particular audience such as something political in nature. Although even in those case you would still want a lot of people to see it, right? YOUR BLOG NICHE AND PURPOSE \u2013 FUN OR PROFIT If you are blogging for fun, obviously you\u2019ll want to choose a blog topic you are passionate about. Be sure you have a lot of knowledge on the topic or that you are willing to take the effort to do the research to obtain quality information to share. (Although if for fun, too much ongoing research may start to take the fun out of, unless you love doing research!) If the ultimate purpose of your blog is to create income, to be profitable, then you have to know how much interest people have in that niche and if they have money and actually spend it. So these two factors really help determine the success of a blog: 1) the right niche, and 2) if money is being spent in that niche. You can make money blogging in almost any niche (some easier than others), but there are a few golden rules you need to follow when choosing your niche. 1. CHOOSE SOMETHING YOU ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT Choosing a niche you are personally passionate about is one of the most important rules for bloggers. It impacts so many things about your blog and your success. An exception to this may be for entrepreneurs who thrive on creating new blogs and new businesses and selling them. But even then, having passion will make it more fun and more profitable. Here are just some of the reasons why being passionate about your niche is important. Excitement and fulfillment. Blogging can be tedious at times. Even though it may not be hard work, a lot of people get discouraged and never put in the effort to create a really great blog. With a niche that brings out your passion, you increase the chances of actually getting the job done rather than quitting. And as you keep creating great posts, it can also help bring you fulfillment and a sense of pride. Better quality articles. You want to create articles your visitors will read and find interesting and want to share, but who will also believe it was written by someone who knows her stuff. Your articles need to seem genuine and hold up to reader scrutiny. This also helps you more easily be seen as an expert in your niche. Related: 5 Top Tips To Earn Money Blogging  Make more money. The better the articles the more money you can make. This is even more true if you are a blogger who creates sponsored posts. It can also help motivate you to keep going with your blog. So if passion is part of your writing, it shows, both to your readers and to your bank account. And really, while we may love our blog, isn\u2019t a big part of blogging about being able to monetize it? Desire to excel. The desire to excel and create an excellent blog is a great motivator and will help you produce a quality blog. Which again, will also help bring in the visitors and income. I have seen many bloggers who do it solely for the money. Because of that, they miss out on a lot of detail needed to make a quality blog. Encouragement to keep going. Being passionate about your niche, and having that passion impact the other reasons I just mentioned, will help encourage you to keep going. You\u2019ll have the desire to rinse and repeat, by either creating more and more great posts or even by creating an entirely new blog! 2. CHOOSE SOMETHING YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE IN (OR WANT KNOWLEDGE IN) At the core of your blog or website is your articles. The articles provide a base for which everything else may be structured. And blogs exist for the sharing of information. So when choosing a niche, it\u2019s important to choose one with which you are familiar. You should have some experience in the field you are talking because it leads to more informed articles and a better overall blog. However, you may not always know a lot about your topic. So the next best thing is to have a desire to learn about your new niche. You can become an expert on a topic in a few months or even less, not years. (Make no mistake though, you will need to put in time and effort.) There is so much information available online that it can be fairly easy to learn enough about a niche to begin creating quality articles on it. 3. DON\u2019T CHOOSE A NICHE THAT IS TOO SPECIFIC While you want to create a specific niche rather than being too broad trying to appeal to everyone, which just doesn\u2019t work, don\u2019t get too small either. Getting way too specific will also fail at drawing a large crowd of dedicated readers.
