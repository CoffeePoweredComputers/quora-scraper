            "answer_text": "Sort of: there is NaNo Rebels. Same challenge, just for non-fiction. See: Am I a Rebel? Find out here!  With NaNoWriMo, the primary rule is not to include in your wordcount anything written before the clock starts (one second after midnight on the morning of Nov 1st).  The contest started as fiction writing, but many do other projects, and from what I've seen at NaNoWriMo meetups, this is welcomed.  What does being a rebel mean? Does this mean I can't validate, or use the site, or participate in NaNoWriMo?Absolutely NOT! You are 100% welcome. In fact, you're so welcome we  gave you this very shiny forum, where people won't accuse you of being a  cheater or \"not doing it right.\" Some rebels validate, others don't. We  don't check, and we don't care! Some people feel that if they're not  doing it by the book, they shouldn't validate. Those people will still  get shiny green bars of completion once they hit 50k. Others feel they  worked hard, and should get their purple winner's bar and winner's  certificate.Neither is wrong! This is a self-challenge. The REAL  prize of NaNoWriMo is the accomplishment, and the big new manuscript  you have at the end. Everything beyond that is icing on the cake.  One previous team I was on had a  member who was writing a mythology/religion book, and another member who  was translating an Icelandic saga.  If it has a wordcount, and you're doing it in November, it can be adapted to NaNoWriMo. And the second part is flexible. Also legit: short story collections, portions of a novel, multiple stories/novels, and for the crazy few, lapping oneself if you pass 50k early. ",
