            "answer_text": "Legend has it that Ernest Hemingway won a bet by writing the six-word \u201cshort\u201d story \u201cFor sale: baby shoes. Never worn.\u201d making it an extreme example of what is called flash fiction or sudden fiction. Although it is often attributed to Ernest Hemingway, the link to him is unsubstantiated and similar stories predate him. If you can adapt that to a single shot, you\u2019ve got a solid start. Of course, offer the attribution as \u201cthe final image allegedly written by Ernest Hemingway\u201d. You might start with a shot of a funeral in progress that, in some visual way, indicates a woman was beaten to death by someone. Then, the camera pans 180 degrees to a small table in the back of the church, where you see two brand new baby shoes, and the hand-written sign. So, not to belabor the point, you\u2019ve structured it with Act 1 and Act 2 in the initial part of the shot, and then you pay it off in Act 3 after the pan. Or (Act 2) you show a sign against violence against women at some point either before or after the pan. As for the format, outlines and treatments are written in present tense, rather than past tense as fiction is normally written. Just tell your shot as efficiently as possible. You could include the description, \u201cAn adaptation of\u2026\u201d and the source attribution to avoid any charges of so-called plagiarism, but make sure that doesn\u2019t technically add a second shot. If you haven\u2019t picked it up, act structure is all about meaning. You set up the death of the woman (act 1), you advance her death (act 2), and you pay off or resolve her death (act 3). So, while the plot (what happens) is all about how it plays out, the meaning structure is all about what it means. Your film MUST mean something! I go into this in great detail in both books below. If it needs to be a completely original idea, try brainstorming along a similar path. Good luck. For more information on writing, I can recommend LATERAL SCREENWRITING, my own book, because it is not a \"My way or the highway\" type of book, and it has LOTS of Hollywood stories that can fill in the gaps in your understanding. After it is over, you should have a good place to start from. Also, I just published THE LAST REVEAL - Movies, Screenwriting, and the Decline of Western Cinemazation. ",

As for the format, I am shocked that an example has not already been offered to the students in the class. After all, if the instructor expects a certain format, why wouldn\u2019t they tell you what that format is? ",
