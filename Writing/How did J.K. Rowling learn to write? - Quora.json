            "answer_text": "JK Rowling started writing in her childhood. She wrote her first story at the age of 6 (about a rabbit named \"Rabbit\").She used to write early in her childhood and would read out her story to fer Sister whom she called 'Di'.So you could say she always had a knack for writing. However it is fair enough to say that she learned writing through sheer hard-work and perseverance.  She grew up surrounded by books and she absolutely loved reading.At the age of 11 she had already written a novel (about cursed diamonds and the people who owned it).Later she went to school at Wyedean Comprehensive School and then went on to study French and Classics at the University of Exeter. Her Classics studies would come in very handy later when she was thinking up all the spells in Harry Potter, some of which are based on Latin.So there you have it. She learned to write by reading exhaustively and writing  lot. Basically she practiced a hell lot and was very very determined (Harry Potter was rejected by several publishers).

            "answer_text": "She learnt to write by writing, writing and more writing. Practise really does count for a LOT in this skill. You start off writing at best mediocre stories (and often outright bad ones!) and advance from there.  Oh and read. A LOT. That should set up the groundwork in your mind as to HOW stories work and how words work. Stories are not created in a vacuum, but rather in the rich fertiliser of many stories  ",
