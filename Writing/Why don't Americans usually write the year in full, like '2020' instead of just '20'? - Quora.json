An elipsis is a figure of speech that omits words that are understood by the reader, who, by context, knows to supply them. That way, Bon Jovi didn\u2019t have the awkward-sounding, \u201cSummer of Nineteen Sixty Nine\u201d as a song title and lyric that would not fit the rest of the song. ",

If you mean why Americans call the year \u201c\u201820\u201d instead of \u201c2020\u201d it\u2019s because it\u2019s just an abbreviation. Kind of like \u201csummer of \u201869\u201d or \u201cback in \u201898\u201d. Quicker to say. ",
