            "answer_text": "There are three main ways you can get a book published A Publishing Deal with a Large or Mid Size Publisher - Write a very good book and get a Literary Agent to represent you (requires a very well written book). Then the Literary Agent will help you get a Book Publishing Deal (requires a very well written and very well polished book, and also time and patience)Self Publishing yourself - Just go straight to an ebook store or a digitial distributor and self publish. So here you yourself are the publisher (in addition to being an author)With a Self Publishing Company - This is NOT a Publishing Deal. This is what is referred to as a \u2018Vanity Publisher\u2019. You pay them money and in return they help produce your ebook and your paperback. This is quite a risky path to go down because you give a third party a lot of money and will almost certainly not make it back. Additionally the services you pay for might be over pricedNow, let\u2019s look at the options in a bit more detail  Publishing with an established Publisher You don\u2019t have to pay them anything. This is critical. If they are asking you to pay then they are NOT a Publisher, then they are a Vanity PublisherThey will take a cut of your book sales. So they only make back the money they invest, if your book sellsDepending on how good your book is you might get an advance. Amount of the advance would depend on what they think the market prospect of your book isThe advance is not \u2018free money\u2019. Your cut of book sales will first go towards covering this advance. After the advance is covered, then you will start getting royalties from your book salesWhat are the main requirements to get published via a \u2018Book Deal\u2019 with an established Publisher You must have written for a market that exists and where books sell. It must be an established marketYou must have written very well (or you must be famous and have a large following that will buy your book regardless)You must have polished the book a lot. Proper editing (by a real professional editor). Proper proofreadingWhat really helps Getting a good literary agentPolishing your book a lotOnly applying to large Publishers and medium Publishers and to very trusted small publishers and boutique publishers******************************** Self Publishing Yourself This is where you say - instead of waiting to get a deal with a Publisher, I\u2019m just going to go ahead and be the publisher myself and self publish Please do note that unless you want to get bad reviews and/or sink without a trace, you should still make sure that you Get a very good book cover designed by a professional cover designerEdit your book very wellWrite it very well. go through again and again and refine it and improve itGet it proofreadNow that you\u2019ve decided to self publish it, you can either Just go to the various ebook stores and self publish at each of them. Amazon has Kindle Digital Publishing (KDP), B&N has Nook Press and Nook Publisher, Kobo has Kobo Writing Life, Apple has iTunesOR You can work with a digitial distributor who will take a cut of your book, and in return, will publish your book on your behalf. Good ones are Draft2Digital and SmashwordsNEITHER of these parties will charge you any money. 100% avoid any ebook store or digital distributor that is asking you for money  The third option is to work with a Self Publishing company THIS is the only path on which you have to pay money to your \u2018Publisher\u2019 and this is the least recommended path There are so many possible problems and issues that I\u2019d strongly recommend choosing one of the above two options instead If you do go with a Vanity Publisher (a self publishing company that publishes on your behalf) Don\u2019t pay for 1,000 paperbacks as it is unlikely you will ever sell more than 100 and there is now Print on Demand. Just buy \u2018printing\u2019 of 10 to 100 copies of your paperbackDon\u2019t buy a $20,000 marketing package. They are not marketers. Spending $20,000 with someone not specializing in marketing is burning moneyDon\u2019t buy a $11,000 Hollywood package to get your book a movie deal. Only books that are selling a lot get a movie deal. Think of a movie deal after you\u2019ve sold at least 20,000 booksDon\u2019t buy any add ons. Only buy - cover, editing, proofreading, printing of 10 to 100 copies (never more)At every step you have to be Sure you are not buying something unnecessarySure you are getting what you paid forSo this is not a good option at all ",

            "answer_text": "There are three general routes that can be taken to publish a novel in order of increasing 'difficulty' and with some pros and cons of each. Keep in mind it generally takes presses at least six months to a year to get back to you, even for a rejection. This is a very slow process and you want to make sure you do it as well as possible the first time: But first know this: publishing can be very difficult and, if nothing else, usually takes a long time and may very well depend more on who you know and factors outside of your control then on the actual strength of your writing. SO MANY successful writers were unable to publish their first novels (or any of their early writing) and it might be just as well. If your goal is to get published I would recommend primarily to view writing and publishing as a process and one that you just need to stick to, practice and get better at. Bottom line: keep trying even if you fail, keep writing and writing at the peak of your ability. If your writing is that good then it will find its way out there. You might: -self publish. There are a number of websites that allow you to publish your novel as an e-book. Amazon has one that is very popular. The pros are that it is easy and quick. You just pres a button and it is 'there'. You have total control over the content and packaging. People can buy it online and read it. Unfortunately you have to do all the editing, marketing, promotion et c. yourself. If you are okay with that then go for it, but it is very possible that your book will be lost in the hundred thousand other e-books published every year and no one will read it. You might also DIY print a chapbook of fiction, poetry or a chapter of your book and give it directly to people or sell it for a few bucks. -publish with a small press. There are hundreds of small presses in the US and abroad that have open submissions (meaning you just send them your manuscript and a cover letter and they read it and say 'yes' or 'no'). The pros are that your novel will have the cachet of the press, the efforts of their editing and marketing staff (whatever that might be) and the book will likely be distributed in print.  There are a variety of issues that come along with small press publishing: Anyone can start a press and some of these presses are not run very well, the press could very well go bankrupt and close while your manuscript is in progress and you will have to start from scratch, many small presses are run by people with day jobs, only publish a dozen or five or two manuscripts a year and so have very low acceptance numbers. Some small presses (from my experience) work with a small and dedicated group of authors. So while they may advertise open submissions it may not really be all that likely that you will be able to publish with them. It is a sort of soft nepotism. This is sort of a problem but this can also work to your advantage: if you can meet people at a small press and impress them with your work they might offer to publish your stuff and you can form a strong and long lasting relationship. I've met more than one person who never submitted a thing and published solely through their network. Most press runs with small presses are about 1000, and for a first novel this might be all that they run, ever. If you can work it though small presses can be a great way to get in. A few things to keep in mind and work to your advantage: most small presses survive in a very small niche. You would be amazed at some of the micro-genres you will see small presses working in. So if/when you submit to a small press save yourself, and the press, some time and do your research. The bottom line is read a press' books. If you like the press, the stuff they publish and see your writing in their 'field', then you should consider submitting your work to them. There are some presses that ask the writer to pay upfront for the presses services. These are called 'vanity publishers' and they are composed of the scum dredged up from the very depths of the pit itself. If a publisher accepts your manuscript then asks you for money to publish it tell them to go fuck themselves and take your work elsewhere. You should never have to pay a press to publish your stuff. They pay you. -publish with a large press. This is the most difficult but most lucrative option and the one that will get your work the most exposure.Large presses now only accept novels from authors with agents. Do not send them your manuscript, you will only be feeding a landfill. If this is the option that you are seriously considering then you should focus on sending your work to agents. Larger presses only accept work that they expect will sell well, and so have pretty strict requirements on form, plot et c. To be accepted by a large press you will also probably need to already have some sort of following or fan base. This is not really a viable option for most first time novelists, especially if your work is in any way outside of the mainstream but then you never know. It might be worthwhile to write a few short stories and submit them to literary magazines and journals. This is a quick and accessible microcosm of what to expect with submitting your novel manuscript to presses. ",
