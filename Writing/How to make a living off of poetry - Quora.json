            "answer_text": "One of my poetry professors, Glover Davis, said all poets are nuts. He had two reasons. I\u2019ll paraphrase the first reason, which deals directly with your question: (1) REASON #1: A person must be nuts to devote themselves to an art where the only way you can make a living is to become a university professor. (2) REASON #2: Glover also told his class (and I quote): \u201cAll poets are crazy. \u201cthey have to be to devote themselves to a craft that pays so little.\u201d In his happier moments, however, Glover would confess that it was the mystery and magic \u2014 the sheer power \u2014 of poetry that had drawn him to it. \u201cIf Philip Levine hadn\u2019t been a poet, he would have been dictator of the world,\u201d Glover said. \u201cHe knew the power of rhythm to move us. He could have been the greatest demagogue ever.\u201d So \u2014 become a professor, or a demagogue, and rule the world. ",
