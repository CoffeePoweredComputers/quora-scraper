            "answer_text": "Practice, practice, more practice. Just try to write something in cursive every day. Try to repeat the lines. Again and again. Finally, you will manage to. My parents were afraid to start to teach me cursive. They thought that I would learn it at school. By the age of 5, I learned to write letters myself. I would write in block letters and start writing them from the bottom. It was ugly. And, as I already could write, it was next to impossible to make me write cursive. However, my parents succeeded, though calligraphy was still one of my biggest torments in school. It went much more smoothly with my brother. When he learned to read (at the age of 3), mother gave him a copybook of propisi (samples of writing) that they use in the first year of school. He became so enthusiastic that he would hide under the blanket in the night with a flashlight - and write in this copybook. It was not working for him but a funny game. If you manage to make it a funny game for yourself, everything\u2019ll be okay. To conclude, an old joke: A policeman stops a car that drove through a red light. A young lady is inside.- Sorry, sir, she says, I\u2019ve got to go. I am late for my work. - What is your work, ma\u2019am?- I am a teacher in school.- Really? Oh my God! How many years have I waited for this! (a vicious smile) Now, do not hurry. Go inside the police station, take paper and write ten thousand times in your most beautiful cursive: \u201cI solemnly promise I will never break the rules of the road again.\u201d ",
