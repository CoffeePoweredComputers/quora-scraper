            "answer_text": "Japanese use 3 alphabets: hiragana, katakana and kanji. if your name is foreign, most likely it will be writing in katakana for example my name kamila will be \u30ab\u30df\u30e9. however a traditional Japanese name can be written in hiragana and kanji. Hiragana being the spelling for example Tanaka will be \u305f\u306a\u304b\u3055\u3093. Names are often written in kanji which usually hold a significant meaning of the name \u1d54\u1d25\u1d54 as to how to actually write them: their alphabet hiragana and katakana are read and pronounced the same just different writing starting with a i u e o, then ka ki ku ke ko, (ga gi gu ge go) etc\u2026 ( adding a constant to a vowel) though you should know that the Japanese do not have the letters L and x. L is replaced with an R which the sound is in between L/R. Any name with L would be pronounced almost as an R. For example, Lola would be Ro-ra. \u263a\ufe0f there are 46 characters in both hiragana and katakana \u1d54\u1d25\u1d54 I hope this sort of helped\u2026 might be a few mistakes though, sorry :( ",
