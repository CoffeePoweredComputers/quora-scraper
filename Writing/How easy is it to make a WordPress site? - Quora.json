            "answer_text": "It depends on what context you are using it in and what purposes you are using it for. And if WordPress seems \u201csimple\u201d to you, I can assure you without any doubt at all that WordPress is overwhelming to most busy business owners who have quotas to meet, employees to catch up with, and staffing or inventory issues to resolve. WordPress is the Earth\u2019s most popular Content Management System. It\u2019s regularly confused with different types of hosting, WordPress\u2019s free hosting platform, WordPress\u2019s open source Content Management System, the company, their WordCamp conventions, their meetup groups, their video channel, and the WordPress \u201cecosystem\u201d and community. Most businesses want to use WordPress as their website CMS because most people who have some level of technical capability with Office or whatever else programs or platforms, can learn how to update or manage a typical site within a few hours. As someone who has taught many WordPress training bootcamps and had several WordPress meetups with the great folks at WordPress, most people do not have \u201ctypical\u201d WordPress websites regardless of what they might be told or feel. Most people have frameworks or hybrid frameworks/premium themes filled with lots of different plugins; and training someone to update that type of customization is an effort all into itself. And that still make one a WordPress developer (as in building professional-level sites). So\u2026maybe it is \u201cthat easy\u201d for you if all you have is a WordPress-built theme with minimal plugins, minimal customization and coding, and your goal is to simply update it when needed and keep it going. I have many sites that have zero plugins, load almost immediately, and require updating maybe a few times per year. Some of those are \u201ceasy,\u201d but it\u2019s a very relative term and depends on what you\u2019re doing, your goals (if you have some), and what you\u2019re trying to reach. WP is \u201ceasy\u201d to manage and update as long as it\u2019s not tricked out to the max. ",

            "answer_text": "How to Make a WordPress Website in 5 Steps Creating a WordPress website is easy and does not require coding or development expertise. To create your WordPress site, you need to get hosting, choose your theme, and design your site. When you\u2019ve created and designed all of your pages, posts, widgets, and site elements, then you can add additional functionality via plug-ins. Here is how to make a WordPress website in five steps. 1. Sign Up for Hosting A host is a service that \u201cstores\u201d your website\u2019s files, and typically also allows you to register your domain name (Home) and business email accounts. While you can use most major hosts to set up a WordPress website, a few have the WordPress CMS pre-installed. 2. Choose Your Domain Name Next, you\u2019ll choose your website domain \u2014 like YourBusiness. Most businesses prefer to use a .com name since it\u2019s the most popular and best-known extension. If your top choice is taken, consider adding an extra word, like your city name. Lastly, you\u2019ll enter your payment information and finalize your order. Keep in mind that to get the best pricing, you do need to pay for three years upfront. However, you can also cancel within 30 days for a full refund. If you aren\u2019t happy with how your website turns out, cancel and try a different option. 3. Access WordPress Through Your Bluehost Account Once you\u2019re registered with Bluehost, you\u2019ll be prompted to set a password and confirm your email address. After this, you\u2019ll reach the Bluehost welcome page. Before you begin working on your site, there are three quick steps to complete: Manage your WordPress website. To start, click \u201cMy Sites\u201d on the left panel, then \u201cManage Site.\u201d Find the \u201cSettings\u201d panel. In the box that says \u201cSite URL,\u201d change the temporary URL to the one you purchased. This ensures your new domain is linked up with your new site. Now click the \u201cSecurity\u201d tab. In the box that says \u201cFree SSL Certificate,\u201d click \u201cEnable.\u201d This will change your website to an \u201chttps,\u201d or a secure website that encrypts the transfer of data, which is better for search engine rankings and protects user information. Once those steps are complete, click \u201cLog in to WordPress\u201d to start working on your site. 4. Choose Your WordPress Theme After installing WordPress, you need to choose a theme. A theme is a predesigned website template that you personalize with your own text and photos. It\u2019s much easier than starting from scratch since you get to follow a visual template that is editable with the next text and photos. To create these, we analyzed how visitors are using business websites in 2019. Customers often browse from their smartphones and are looking for quick information at a glance, like operating hours, phone numbers, or street addresses. As a result, we designed our themes to look great on both mobile and desktop and provide this essential information up front. To design your website, you need to input your text and photos. There\u2019s no programming required, although you can modify just about everything like fonts, colors, and formatting from the simple customization menu. 5. Customize Your WordPress Theme & Design Your Site When you first log into WordPress, you will reach your WordPress dashboard. This is the main \u201ccontrol center\u201d of your website where you\u2019ll design your pages, make edits, add blog posts, and other elements using the menu options on the left side: Here\u2019s a quick rundown of each of these menus: Posts: If you want to add a blog to your business website, \u201cPosts\u201d is where you\u2019ll go to write, edit, and publish new blog post articlesPages: This is where you create website pages like your About, Contact, or Pricing pagesAppearance: This is the main menu for editing your website\u2019s style\u2019 under \u201cAppearance,\u201d you can choose between different themes and then customize the colors, fonts, and other formatting options for your websitePlug-ins: These are additional features you can add to your websites like contact forms or e-commerce carts; some plug-ins are free while others charge a one-time or recurring feeThe steps for setting up your website will vary depending on your theme, so it is recommended that you choose a theme first, then finding specific instructions for that theme.
