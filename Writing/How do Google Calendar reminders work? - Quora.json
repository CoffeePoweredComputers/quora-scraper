            "answer_text": "Your question really interested me, so I ran a test in my office with two people who I share a calendar with. In the test, I made an appointment on the calendar we shared and set the individual appointment up to email a notification ten minutes in advance. With my two colleagues,  I asked one person to ignore the invite and the other to accept the invite.  Neither one got the email reminder.   The person who accepted the invite already had a default reminder to receive pop-ups 10 minutes before appointments made on the calendar. This overrode my email reminder, but it is in line with Google's statement about notifications. \"Please note that when you make changes to the reminder settings for events on your calendar, the changes will only apply to you. Invited guests or those who have access to the events will receive reminders according to their own Google Calendar reminder settings.\"For the person who ignored the invite (saw it in his calendar, but did not accept invitation) this person did not get any reminder. This person had no default reminders set into this calendar.I, as the appointment maker on the shared calendar, go the email reminders 10 minutes before the appointment.  Hope that helps you with your question. It really helped me with this problem since we have had some people say they have not been getting meeting reminders and now I know why, when I was blaming it on email filtering before. ",
