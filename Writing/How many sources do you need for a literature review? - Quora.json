            "answer_text": "It depends on the field and the context. If your subject matter is very narrow, there may only be a few sources to use. If this is for a class, there will usually be a problem statement or subject that is given to you that is reasonably narrow. Just find what you can. Pay specific attention to the papers that everyone seems to cite; if EVERYONE is citing a paper or series of papers by J. Doe, figure out why and spend some time on the paper(s) in your review. If the review is for the introduction to a scientific paper, write the introduction, explaining what you are doing and why, adding support as needed. Presumably you\u2019ve been reading articles as you\u2019ve gone along with your research and will have some familiarity with the field. If the review is for a chapter in a thesis or dissertation, cover what is relevant, straying into some side areas just to say \u201cand in this similar thing\u2026\u201d. It may help to look up examples of whatever it is you are trying to do. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer: It depends for what purpose you are reviewing the literature. Clearly, the literature source to access for the review will be broader if you are reviewing the related-literature for higher levels of academic studies, such as a PhD, studies or a Master studies, compared to the purpose for undergraduate studies or usual undergraduate assignments. For example, if you are reviewing the literature for a PhD research program, students may be required to assess a multitude of sources, which may be anything from 25 to 40 sources. For me, I think I accessed as many as 40 sources, spending countless hours on the internet for the purpose, but then I was an eager-beaver, wanting to read up as many literature sources as I could, for my review. Since, culture and ethnicity formed an important part of my studies, beside the core of my studies, which was on the topic of service recovery, in the field of service management, my related-review was invariably a little broader. Frankly, it is really impossible to give a definitive answer in terms of number of sources, and it may vary from people to people, from courses to courses. Some students, who were eager-beavers, not as informed on the research topic, and with less prior knowledge foundation on the field, and minimum professional work experience, may want to read very widely, and may sometimes stray out of reviewing only related-literature or out of the list of literature given by the supervisor (PhD adviser). Really, it is up to the student concerned. But bear in mind, the important tasks must be about reviewing \u2018related-literature\u2019 on the topic for the research, which depending, can be wide in term of sources. Irrespective, students must be very disciplined and discerning in accessing the sources and not wasting time unnecessarily. Moreover, pertinent references and literature must be noted after each review, particularly, any quotations taken verbatim. Be sure, to note the literature source, title of tge literature and including the exact page no after each review - your reviewing task is not done until you do that (I am speaking from experience). This will help you immensely during the writing phase of the dissertation, say for a PhD or for that matter any project. A category of literature which you have reviewed, with notes written, must be kept in your data bank with a few reserved copies to ensure all the hard work done is kept safe. What may be the sources of literature say for a PhD studies, which I assessed? They are basically any literature which are to be included in my PhD dissertition/thesis. These included, literature on the background of the topic for the studies, the literature reviewed that led me to identifying the gap of knowledge for the studies, particularly accessed from to-date extant literature; why the particular research had been done , as pertinent, and significant, the methodologies that others had used, and why you had adopted for the present study and the justifications, and importantly literature on theories and concepts underpinning your current study, your adopted theoretical and conceptual frame-work, or any models/diagrams borrowed from literature. Note that the literature review chapter is not a compilation of literature reviewed but, relevant literature used to support your studies. Of course, the relevant literature in the methodology chapter must support and help you justify the methodology adopted for your studies and likewise your discussion chapter of the thesis are referenced. So how many literature sources must be assessed, will depend on the purpose of your studies and clearly the number of literature sources accessed must be \u2018sufficient\u2019 to support your dissertation/thesis. The key is that any ideas, you have borrowed from others, which are not yours, and have used for your current work, must be referenced, including your past work you have authored. Hope this helps. All the best. ",
