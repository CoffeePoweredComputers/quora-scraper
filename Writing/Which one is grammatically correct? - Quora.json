            "answer_text": "Both of them seem correct to me. However, you made a mistake by placing the \u201cwas\u201d in the incorrect order in the first statement. Let\u2019s analyze it: When you say: \u201cShe asked him what was it that made him so much stronger than any other man\u201d \u2014 you used \u201cwhat was it\u201d, it means you wrote it in the question form, therefore, since you use \u2018was\u2019 before the subject \u2018it\u2019 you are declaring that the statement is in the question form; which is made by placing the to be verb in front of the subject: He was there - affirmative; He wasn\u2019t there - negative; Was he there? - question; Was he not there? - negative question.Since you wrote it in the question form, you should have added a \u201c?\u201d in the end of the sentence. \u201cShe asked him what it was that made him so much stronger than any other man\u201d. This statement seems to fit more adequate, since you wrote it in the affirmation form; which is made by placing the verb to be after the subject \u2014 \u201cwhat it was\u201d. Therefore, I upvote the second statement, seems more adequate in my point of view, as you wrote in the affirmation form and didn\u2019t add any \u201c?\u201d. So it turns out being the right one. ",

            "answer_text": "Both are incorrect. 1. 'Don't' can only be used after plural subjects when talking in third person. First person:Singular: I don'tPlural: We don't Second person: Singular: You don'tPlural: You (all) don't Third person: Singular: He doesn't, She doesn't, It doesn't (replace pronouns with any nouns) Ram doesn't sing. Sita doesn't dance.Bulletproof glass doesn't break easily.Plural: They don't (replace pronoun with any noun) Dreams don't portray reality. 2. Dream cannot be used in this manner. In this sentence, it appears as though Dream is a proper noun, a name of something or someone, which is wrong. It can be: 'A dream doesn't work' OR 'Dreams don't work.' ",
