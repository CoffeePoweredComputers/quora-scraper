            "answer_text": "Personally, I write reviews when I feel strongly about something, whether it\u2019s a restaurant, a nail salon, or a product on Amazon (all things I\u2019ve written reviews about fairly recently). When an experience is associated with a strong emotion, either positive or negative, it is easy and fun for me to express myself about it. I quite enjoy being creative and finding a way to get my point across in a whimsical, unique manner. For instance, I just wrote this review; it\u2019s for a replacement brush for our robot vacuum (from the \u00fcber-hub\u2019s point of view because it\u2019s his Amazon account), and I had a ton of fun doing it. I also believe it communicates valuable information to potential customers of the same product; see if you agree. Our Deebot 901 (\"Lola\") is the third being in our marriage, and perhaps the most popular - she brings so much joy and order to the home in which our six feline overlords graciously allow my wife and me to serve them. She has always sucked, in the best way possible, until now. Lola has been with us for about nine months, during which I have replaced the brush twice with official Deebot brushes. Her sunny disposition and efficient cleaning continued unabated. This time, in a fit of uncharacteristic thrift, I ordered Lola's replacement brushes from Bettawell. Bad decision. Suddenly Lola doesn't suck! She wanders around the house looking purposeful but not actually accomplishing anything; this Bettawell brush doesn't turn at all. Now there is cat litter strewn in front of the mats and hairball tumbleweeds drift forlornly down the hallway. I can tell she doesn't feel the same way about me after I bought her such a cut-rate brush that doesn't tickle her fancy. Because the brush doesn't turn, not only does it fail to agitate dirt and debris; it actually impedes the flow of air, causing less effective suckage than if it wasn't there at all. Epic fail. While it is nice to be reminded of the excellent suckage she normally provides to my home, this depressive slump of Lola's is taking its toll on our entire family. The feline masters, who had gradually adjusted to Lola's presence and even learned to dance with her on occasion after hitting the old catnip, now shoot her contemptuous glances when they think she's not looking. This item is cheaply made and shipped from China; the brush doesn't turn. Highly not recommended. Sure, it\u2019s not the most concise way to give the pertinent details about the dang robot vacuum brush, and that will probably irritate some people. Those people inevitably won\u2019t read past the first paragraph, which will leave them shaking their heads and wondering why some people are allowed on the interwebs at all. Those people are not my people. My people enjoy a little pizzazz, a little drama, in their reviews. Thinking back to the opening line of this Yelp review I wrote in 2014 makes me smile every time. Dr. Bhakti is a sadist with the personality of a psychotic ferret. I broke a back tooth last night eating gummy bears (I know, I know). With it being a Friday night, I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to see a dentist until Monday, and that just wasn't going to work because I was seriously hurting. So when I did a search for a dentist on my insurance company's website today and saw an option near my home with business hours on Saturday, and they were able to work me in at noon, I was so happy! I did not know what I was getting myself into. The eighth circle of Hell, as it turned out. I should have waited until Monday. Heck, I should have had my husband pour some peroxide over the needle-nose pliers from his tool chest and been done with it. But I'm not that smart, and I went to Dr. Ravindra Bhakti at Dental Plus instead. The office was sparse and the rooms were dingy, with visible dirt on the floorboards and a short, dark hair on the extending arm of the exam chair. The tools looked clean, though, so I told myself it would be okay. The dental assistants and the guy who explained the out-of-pocket costs to me were very pleasant. Unfortunately, the doctor was the one with his hands in my mouth, and he was decidedly NOT. He approached me from behind without warning and stuck a gloved finger in my mouth, then inserted something before I had time to register that he was even there. When I jumped and squealed, he withdrew the finger and snapped, \"We're going to get started now, if that's all right with you!\" It was a sign of things to come - he never told me what he was doing or what to expect. He showed no compassion or concern for my comfort beyond acting annoyed when I grunted in distress while he yanked for what seemed like hours on the offending tooth. (\"Did that hurt? Oh, it was just the pressure? Well, that's just what you're going to feel, so breathe through it and let me do my job.\") Do not go to Dental Plus. Please, don't make the same mistake I did. Chase a bottle of Tylenol with shots of tequila to survive the weekend and go to a real dentist on Monday. I\u2019m sure other people write reviews for other reasons, but this is why I do it. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, let me start by saying thank you to all the people that write reviews. There are not enough people writing reviews. This is the chicken and the egg problem: everyone wants to read reviews (to make an informative decision) but not many are willing to give their feedback back to the community and businesses. On PlanetRate, we do see reviewers that fall into one of these categories: People with strong emotions: satisfied or not satisfied. Most of them do not describe the pros and cons, positive or negative. They are one sided.People who write balanced reviews because they want to share their experiences with others (by the way hat off to these type of reviewers). They do not expect anything back.People who are incentivized. These reviewers usually get an incentive, gift or reward for writing a review. Often times it could be an incentive given by the business itself (which I do not personally agree with), or the review platform like PlanetRate, where the platform gives points to their users to encourage them to write reviews. Then they can redeem the points they collected for different rewards (gift cards, discounts, products). For those familiar with gas station points or AirMiles this would be similar.Fake reviewers. These are the most dangerous ones. Purposes for writing fake reviews range from search engines optimization (SEO), bashing competitors, writing paid reviews, etc.I hope that more and more people will write reviews for the products they buy, for the services they use and anything else. We need more balanced reviews! ",
