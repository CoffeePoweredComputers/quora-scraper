            "answer_text": "It\u2019s due to a combination of ignorance, political marketing, and Bernie\u2019s historical political alignment. Many political and economic illiterate Americans have been misguided into thinking anything from welfare to taxes are \u201csocialist\u201d, and that European countries are \u201csocialist\u201d when they\u2019re really capitalist economies, some of which like the Nordic countries are best described as \u201csocial democracies\u201d. The ideology Bernie Sanders espoused during his political campaign was close to \u201csocial democracy\u201d, or what Noam Chomsky described as \u201cNew Deal liberalism\u201d. One can only speculate why Bernie Sanders called himself and his political positions \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d during his campaign, but it isn\u2019t to difficult to understand why he did: if he hadn\u2019t, he would have been derided as a \u201csocialist\u201d by conservatives in the media, by calling himself a \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d he preempted this outcome and stood out from the other candidates. In the past, Bernie Sanders actually did espouse socialist views by calling for public ownership and democratic management of the economy. Whether or not he\u2019s still an actual democratic socialist or not we can\u2019t know for certain; either way, much of his policy platform and his ideology is now pro-capitalism and liberal. ",

            "answer_text": "He is labeled as a socialist because he has given himself that label. He adds \u201cDemocratic\u201d in front to distinguish his brand from the authoritarian versions. It is an odd thing to do since he is really more of a Social Democrat, which is a form of capitalism but it just has higher income taxes. It makes little difference however since if you take enough of someone\u2019s income you might as well take the means of production as well since the effect is the same. Given our current President I would vote for Sanders even though I don\u2019t agree with much of his approach. He would still have Congress to deal with and much of what he talks about wouldn\u2019t make it though Congress. He is less corrupt, more competent than Trump so I\u2019d willingly make the trade. I\u2019d support Singer Payer healthcare but that\u2019s about it. Eventually (hopefully) people will realize that there isn\u2019t enough wealth to redistribute, given the large population, to make much of a difference on a per capita basis and the only result would be to make everyone poorer and to remove the part of the economy producing the growth since no one is going to continue to outproduce everyone else if you take that wealth. You can\u2019t eat the rich, it makes no sense to kill the goose that laid the golden egg. People just need to get a grip on envy and jealousy. If people could work together there could be a little more of a safety net for those at the bottom of the economic ladder. That\u2019s all that is needed. ",
