            "answer_text": "Pfff\u2026 I should admit this is one of the most difficult question I've ever encountered in my life. But still I\u2019ll give my best to give an appropriate answer. Hmm let\u2019s see: 10-) Alice Nakiri - Shokugeki No Souma  White hair: Check. Red eyes: Check. Arrogance: Check. A little bit devilness: Check. Cute voice: Check. What can a man want more?  Bonus Point: Aloofness come with Chibby version:  9-)Echidona - Witch of Greed - Re: Zero The number 9 of our list is one of the main heroines of Re: Zero Season 2: Witch of Greed - Echidona\u2026 Even just her name reveals much about what kind of beauty she is. Echidona\u2026 A perfect Belladona..  Damm! Dat side profile look\u2026 How a character can look to camera like that!   Don\u2019t deceive by looks at these pictures. She is a pure soul in her heart actually. 8-) Mei Terumi - Naruto Shippuden Our 8th number in this list goes to our thicc and fluid like kage:  Really this character had such a potential when I first saw her. I really had high expectations from her. But they just literally wasted her at show. Such a shame she didn\u2019t experience much more screen time\u2026 :( But of course it's natural though things like this because as we know there is no place for such a goddess like this at those gay romance shows like Naruto.  At this single scene a man fell in love with a woman. Specially after that wiping excess lava from her mouth\u2026 Oh my Lord, Give me strength for fighting with this seductive, curvy, sexy- evil incarnation of succubus.  Her talents don\u2019t end with just setting fire on men\u2019s hearts. She, at the same time can freeze the 'one' with just a single breath of her if you know what I mean.. 7-) Akeno Himejima - High School DxD  I think that smile can tell much more than I can write here..  She is a demon. She is an angel. She is a miko. But most important She is our Akeno-senpai!  Just one word to melt down your brain: \u201cAra ara\u2026\u201d (Of course with closed eyelids) 6-) Erza Scarlet - Fairy Tail  Really, for redheads there is always a special place in my heart. They are my biggest weakness. Really, sole reason for placing Erza at number six is the low story factor of Fairy Tail. If Erza were in another, better show with a more interesting background she probably would go up to top 3 easily. Again such a shame all good redheads goes with bad shows\u2026 :(  Well I'll admit medieval European type armors definitely goes well with Erza but still I prefer her with more traditional oriental clothes, like these:  Ahh there is not more beatiful hair colour than scarlet red in this entire universe\u2026 5-) Yoruichi Shihouin - Bleach  A not enough appreciated character again.  I really liked Yoruichi\u2019s unconcerned, easy-going persona and her relationship with Uruhara Kisuke. And of course at the same time I envied that motherfucker Uruhara cause of his closeness to Yoruichi-san. Fucking lucky bastard!  God I love the women who has confidence..  And can fight.. And of course that brings us to..: 4-) Esdeath - Akame ga Kill  The only Ice user who I can put above both fire and lighting users with peace in my mind! Both Sadistic and Psychopath, Cute Goddess of Frost:  Just how a bandana can suit perfectly to a person?  I know there are a lot of people who don\u2019t like Esdeath but come on.. Wouldn\u2019t you want to be in that man\u2019s place right now, right here? No? Well I would give my damn arm for being at there right now... 3-) Saeko Busujima - High School of the Dead  I don\u2019t want to talk about this girl. I just want to her stab me from my heart with her katana, turn me to a zombie, put a collar on my neck and then take me with her to wherever she goes till forever like Michonne from Walking Dead did.  For Saeko Busujima words are meanningless to describe her. Only pictures can give us just a little a bit clue what kind of girl she is:  Do i need to tell you more? 2-) Senjougahara Hitagi - Monogatari series Well to understand why this character at number 2 you have to watch Monogatari series. I can\u2019t make you understand at here.   \u201cAgette agette Koyo-koyo. Choco wa mada mada aru no yo.\u201d If you watched this scene you know what I\u2019m talking about.  She is even breaking 4th wall! What do you want more?  \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 ANDDDDD The Number One of our list! Goddess of among all Godesses. Cold, cruel, pragmatic, oppurtunist, ruthless, toughened up with hardships of warzone, disciplined, undisputed leader of Hotel Moscow: 1-Sofiya Pavlovena (a.k.a Balalaika) from Black Lagoon  Ex captain of Vozdushno-Desantnye Vojska(air assault troops), also known as the VDV, paratrooper and a veteran of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. She has no parents. She was brought up by her grandfather, a general in the Red Army of the USSR. A fine marksman and sniper, she received the nickname \"Balalaika\" (one of the Soviet army's slang terms for the Dragunov sniper-rifle). *cited from Balalaika* Cold Blue ruthless eyes, White-Yellowish long hair with a wide ponytail which extends till thighs, Battle scars which start from eyes and follows through neck, upper chest, breasts and finally end at legs, Talented, athletic, curvy body which can squeeze the life out from you in just 5 seconds, An unrivaled talented sniper, That \u201cfucking single mole\u201d right under her left eye: GOD I don\u2019t have smallest resistance to that\u2026 Firm stance which shows her authority over everything her surronding, An unyielding, unbending, unbroken iron will,  (Just tell me you can subdue these eyes\u2026just..tell..) A fearless apathetic look toward life and death, Undisputed loyalty from subordinates and towards subordinates, Toughness coming from deepest part of hell. She is Balalaika. Only woman who worths unconditional loyalty, fidelity, devotion, worship. Just one word from her mouth and I would even fight with a Vladimir Putin on a fucking bear.  Oh GOD Is there a real version of her in this fucking world or another world anyone knows? I am ready to jump between parallel worlds and kill my own versions at them and replacing them for such a woman. Hmmm.. When looking at the list from a little bit afar, it's seems like a little masochist screams and trying to reach surface from the depths of someone's mind isn't it? ",

            "answer_text": "To me, the word \u201chottest\u201d makes the question a little more specific. It\u2019s normal within anime to design characters with a certain brand of attractiveness. It\u2019s really more the exception rather than the rule to make characters, male or female, attractive in accordance with some particular variety of tastes. This can include things that are attractive in a generic sense (by generic, I mean according to highly common tastes), but then there are those who are designed to appeal to more specific tastes like \u2018lolicons\u2019 or \u2018meganekko\u2019\u2026 but beyond that, you have categories of attractiveness. I consider \u201chot\u201d to be one such category that involves not just being designed as attractive, but also having a character that exudes factors of sex appeal. I\u2019ll expand on this a little later, but to begin with, let me at least explain what I don\u2019t consider \u201chot\u201d specifically. To me, characters like Kuriyama Mirai from Kyoukai no Kanata would qualify as \u201ccute\u201d, but that is not the same thing as \u201chot.\u201d There\u2019s an appeal to her cuteness and it also adds to the comedic value of the series that she is as cute as she is, but that is not \u201chot\u201d in my view.  And likewise, a character like Violet from Violet Evergarden is what I\u2019d consider designed as \u201cpretty\u201d rather than \u201chot\u201d per se. Quite a lot of her appeal is also bolstered by the utterly gorgeous artwork in the series and thematic aspects that just make her transformation as a character a bright spot in a dark story\u2026 but again, it\u2019s not necessarily \u201chot.\u201d  I also include Violet in this comparison specifically for a reason, though. Violet has a lot in her design that draws a considerable degree of similarity to Saber from the Fate series, as you can see below \u2014  Now Saber as a character does have at least one of the characteristics that I associate with \u201csexiness\u201d of a female character (namely, the air of strength), but the thing is that other aspects that make for a character who I\u2019d call \u201chot\u201d are NOT part of her character. The idea of a sexy Saber in alluring poses with gratuitous fanservice doesn\u2019t really work that well because it\u2019s just not what makes up Saber the way her character is written. Again, doesn\u2019t fit the mold of \u201chot.\u201d So when I think about the female characters who are \u201chot\u201d in the majority of anime I have watched, I think of a few things. And for any one character who makes my list, they may not necessarily have all the qualities at once, but at least has some combination of them. For one, there\u2019s the actual physical component, which I feel is fairly obvious. Characters who possess some of the basics aspects of physically attractive women would fit this mold. Now it is normal in anime for many of these things to be scaled up beyond the limits of reality, and what I generally prefer fall within some bounds of reason, at least as far as anime itself has the potentiality to offer. In much the same way that anime eyes are typically scaled up in order to give more room to those expressive elements, often times, characters who are meant to exude sex appeal of some kind will have those physical characteristics exaggerated. Likewise, there are characters who are just comically over-the-top to the point of being objects of ridicule let alone actually presenting some sort of sex appeal, so characters like those in shows like Eikenbu Yori Ai wo Komete are not really within consideration. Other forms of this physical appeal include an air of strength, which could be embodied in the character\u2019s actions/behavior (as it was with Saber), but could also be a product of an athletic physique. Might be a personal thing, but I find strength really sexy. Given that this is a subjective question by nature, it\u2019s only inevitable that personal opinions are part of the picture. Secondly, there is the demeanor and behavior. There has to be something about the way the character acts that draws the viewer in and/or speaks to their nature as a sexual being. A number of people have included, for instance, Mikasa from Shingeki no Kyojin. And while her athletic physique and strength are things I find undeniably sexy, sexuality is not a part of her character. There is no component of her behavior or demeanor that aims to appeal to anyone on a sexual level, so I actually don\u2019t quite count her in the \u201chot\u201d group unless we\u2019re confining solely to the physical component. That\u2019s just not part of her character. On the other hand, a few people posted Nakiri Alice from Shokugeki no Soma. While sex appeal is not part of her agency as a character, the fact that she frequently cops seductive expressions, and shows confidence in a form that leans almost dominatrix-like, albeit without the more fetish-y components of the same. A bit of an odd one is Satou Sakie from Demi-chan wa Kataritai. She is a succubus, and she quite literally oozes sex appeal according to the storyline, but at the same time, she is trying everything in her power to prevent that. Anyway, having said all that, here are a few characters I put on the list of \u201chot.\u201d Granted, there are probably several others I could put up there, but since we are talking about the top, I have to limit my list. Also, sometimes, the quality of the show plays into how I view the hotness of the characters. It\u2019s all well and good to take a character like Saeko from Highschool of the Dead just on pictures and call her hot, but the show itself is so ridiculous that it makes it hard to watch, which in turn kills it for me. I mean\u2026 prehensile breasts that can somehow dodge bullets? Yeah\u2026 sure. Whatever. So here are two classics I have to include \u2014 Faye Valentine from Cowboy Bebop   and Mine Fujiko from Lupin III   I include both of them together because they both fit into the list for more or less the same reasons. In both cases, they are physically attractive, but they are also sly and clever as both are basically thieves and cons on some level or other. The thing about behavior/demeanor \u2014 both of these ladies, while they do engage in combat from time to time, their principal weapons are their charms. They aren\u2019t merely sexy, but they make use of that sex appeal in productive ways. Also, there is something to be said for the classics. Fujiko, in particular has this title of being \u201cthe original\u201d hottie of anime series, and for good reason. Sure, the dated art style might make her look a little weird compared to more modern designs, but it\u2019s hard to hide what she\u2019s all about. Faye is a similar story. When introduced, she is using her charms to play cons back and forth and even as one move fails, she just plays another one. Sometimes, she\u2019s foxy and sometimes, she is tricky like a fox. Now getting a little more up to date, I have to include two characters from the Ikkitousen series. Okay, it\u2019s kind of a given the Ikkitousen is one of those animes that is all about fanservice, sexy ladies, NSFW camera angles, and mysteriously self-destructing clothing. So as far as characters carrying themselves in ways to play to their sex appeal, that\u2019s almost a forgone conclusion. The two that I pick both hold certain qualities that stand out from the rest. First of them is Kan\u2019u Unchou (Japanese reading of Guan Yu [Yunchang])   Ummm\u2026 I rest my case. In all seriousness, the extent to which she oozes sex appeal is entirely physical. It\u2019s not just that she carries herself and dresses in revealing clothes and repeatedly loses them in combat. She\u2019s also a super-powerful character within the series who stands head and shoulders above several and carries a commanding presence among those characters that effectively makes her the center of attention. Also, there\u2019s a geeky factor in that she\u2019s supposed to be the reincarnation of Guan Yu, who holds a sort of unrivaled fame for being touted as the God of War in Chinese history. So her strength and commanding presence is a reflection of that name. Similarly, her long raven hair is a reflection of the fact that one of Guan Yu\u2019s defining characteristics was a long beard. The other character I include from Ikkitousen is Kaku Bunwa (Japanese reading of Jia Xu [Wenhe])   There are a number of sexy characters in anime who are teases and try to mess with the protagonist in various ways. But I include Kaku on this because she isn\u2019t merely a tease \u2014 she is seriously using her own sexuality as a tool. Her historical counterpart in Chinese history is Jia Xu, who was often lauded as an advisor who always found the most pragmatic solution to everything. Kaku as a character is much the same. She posseses nowhere near the mythical combat strength of many of the other characters in the show, but she knows how to use what she does have to good effect. She manipulates and gets in the good graces of people mainly by using her charms, and yes, her body as well. The point is that she\u2019s the sort of character who is written such that she\u2019s not just \u201chot\u201d, but she\u2019s hot and she knows it. Moving on, there\u2019s another character who I\u2019d liken to Kan\u2019u, in the sense of her being attractive on a physical level, but also carries a commanding presence as a result of her overwhelming strength. That would be Erza Scarlet from Fairy Tail.   One thing I love about her character is that she is just as prone to fight with her superhuman strength as she is to let loose and be an ordinary woman from time to time. She has her mythical warrior qualities as befits her presence in the show, but also has typical human qualities. In a lot of ways, it adds to her appeal in that she becomes a little bit more relatable and not just a collection of tropes. So far, though, I\u2019ve had to go back at least a few years, if not decades in the first two cases. Keeping in the range of very recent anime, though, there\u2019s one character who just oozes sex appeal in a way that makes it seem natural for her character. That would be Fubuki from OnePunch Man.   So this is a good example of what I was referring to with the demeanor and the devilishly alluring way in which she presents herself. She\u2019s not explicitly trying to bewitch people with her looks, but she is trying to present a confidence and a sense of standing above people (which is kind of a facade, but it is part of what she does), and that just adds to it.
