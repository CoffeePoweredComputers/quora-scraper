The author did a magnificent job developing characters with a psychological side that is so well described that we feel inside their minds, follow their fears and cheer for their success. The plot is very intelligent and will keep you entertained throughout the book. Full of twists, this book will keep you awake until the turn of the last page.\u201d --Books and Movie Reviews, Roberto Mattos (re Once Gone) Women are turning up dead in the rural outskirts of Virginia, killed in grotesque ways, and when the FBI is called in, they are stumped. A serial killer is out there, his frequency increasing, and they know there is only one agent good enough to crack this case: Special Agent Riley Paige. Riley is on paid leave herself, recovering from her encounter with her last serial killer, and, fragile as she is, the FBI is reluctant to tap her brilliant mind. Yet Riley, needing to battle her own demons, comes on board, and her hunt leads her through the disturbing subculture of doll collectors, into the homes of broken families, and into the darkest canals of the killer\u2019s mind. As Riley peels back the layers, she realizes she is up against a killer more twisted than she could have imagined. In a frantic race against time, she finds herself pushed to her limit, her job on the line, her own family in danger, and her fragile psyche collapsing. Yet once Riley Paige takes on a case, she will not quit. It obsesses her, leading her to the darkest corners of her own mind, blurring the lines between hunter and hunted. After a series of unexpected twists, her instincts lead her to a shocking climax that even Riley could not have imagined. A dark psychological thriller with heart-pounding suspense, ONCE GONE marks the debut of a riveting new series\u2014and a beloved new character\u2014that will leave you turning pages late into the night. Book #2 in the Riley Paige series is also now available! ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. Well, there are too many great books of this genre if you have the eye for it. However, I would suggest you few of which I have read. A Crime in the Neighborhood by Suzanne Berne - I have recommended this book many times to most of my friends. For me, it is a novel that uses suspense in the best possible way, not by having a character confront one obstacle after another in a mindless stream of action, but by creating an atmosphere of deep moral peril in which the culminating tragedy seems as inevitable as one can be. The title is very apt and you will understand this once you are over with the book.Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier- In addition to instilling a deep-seated fear of housekeepers in generations of readers, du Maurier\u2019s Gothic classic reminds us all that a narrator doesn\u2019t need a name to carry a story. Soon you, too, will be muttering, \u201cLast night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\u201dSharp Objects by Gillian Flynn- If you think Gone Girl is as dark and twisted as it gets, think again. In Flynn\u2019s debut, a reporter fresh out of a stint in a psych hospital returns to her hometown to cover the murder of two girls. Suffice it to say, this is not a book about puppies and rainbows.Dan Brown's novels- An unconventional sense of mystery surrounds his novels. The plots are highly intriguing and you will always be at the verge of breakthrough and yet craving for more. The Da Vinci's code is my personal favourite.Every secret thing by Laura Lipoman- Lippman writes about the things that we aren\u2019t supposed to talk about and she does it so very well. There are few writers who can write a compelling, emotionally gripping story about children who murder another child. Lippman does and tackles perhaps the hardest question of all: What happens next?Decide which is your best pick and then go on a reading spree! Happy reading :) ",
