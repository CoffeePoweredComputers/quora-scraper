I will share works in progress (WIP) with a select few trusted fellow authors I exchange things with, but I usually only do this when I am looking for advice or affirmation that I pulled something off I was trying to do. I learned a long time ago to not trust people with a partially edited draft. If you are just asking an opinion, they\u2019ll probably try to edit all the mistakes for you. If you are asking a small publisher who is over zealous, you may find it published before you were ready. If you show a partial draft to someone who is really excited about the idea, they may never stop bugging you about when it will be done. (Not good for someone like me who likes to juggle a lot of projects and back-burner some for months at at time.) OR\u2026what if I decide not to finish it at all? I don\u2019t even like to share my ideas for future ones with my wife anymore. \u201cWhatever happened to that one you were going to write that was bigger than Game of Thrones but set in space?\u201d Yeah. Not writing that one. Bad idea to start with. (That wasn\u2019t the actual idea, btw.) There are a couple that she just won\u2019t let go. Not going to write them, Dear! I generally don\u2019t like to share anything, even if I am co-writing and exchanging chapters of a WIP with another author, until I am satisfied that it is \u201cgood enough\u201d if it got \u201cleaked to the public\u201d. Not that that would ever happen. I\u2019m not that famous and I trust the people I work with anyways, but it\u2019s kind of an \u201calways put your best foot forward\u201d thing. I did have something published I wasn\u2019t ready to let go of (more than once actually) and I just don\u2019t go there anymore. ",

Most often, my agent is the first person to read it. When you over-saturate people with whatever you\u2019re writing, they will get bored of it. The story isn\u2019t theirs, so reading it so many times over is just going to kill it for them. Another reason I don\u2019t is because people like to think they are editors. Most are definitely not. When I was in school I let a few of my friends and teachers read my very first manuscript, and got back so much feedback it was impossible to sort through it all, and a good majority of it was useless. You should add dragons! I don\u2019t understand this word. Can you put me in the story? Where\u2019s my character? I don\u2019t like omniscient point-of-view. I think you should rewrite this whole section to include fairies. And then there are the people who get immediately obsessed. They will harass you, hound you, beg you for more pages. They want inside information now! They want to be included in the story. They want a dedication. They want to know everything about everything to do with the story, regardless of whether you want to reveal it or even have it planned out. They will get upset when you tell them no. They will get pissy when you don\u2019t write full chapters in a day. For me, it\u2019s just not worth the trouble. It\u2019s your work; allowing other people into it often invites unneeded criticisms and involvement. That\u2019s why, while I may talk about it to my husband or my trusty old friend, no one reads it until it\u2019s published, outside of my professional team. ",

Any type of sharing messes it up. Strangely, I find the same thing in my personal life. If I tell someone about a relationship that has just started, it seems to jinx the affair! Once a manuscript is finished: shaped, corrected, ending, beginning, all loose ends tied together, I\u2019ll share the manuscript with a trusted friend or peer and always get an input I didn\u2019t expect and can often incorporate. I have conducted writers workshops for many years and I have been a member of many many. In a workshop you read perhap 5 pages of a manuscript, then everyone discusses it aloud. If you don\u2019t have thick skin, you hate this. People also write on the manuscript you read from and a passed-out. I\u2019ve kept every manuscript I ever read in a workshop because the comments occasionally are invaluable. You don\u2019t understand what people are saying when you start. You don\u2019t exactly understand what: \u201cTurn up the heat in the kitchen means.\u201d Sometimes, you are so embarrassed, you can\u2019t even hear! What writers are like bread, they are only dough until they get heat in a workshop, then they thrive. ",

I admit that I have let my children read some of my stories and I have let my girlfriend read one or two, and of course, guess what happened? I received glowing reports of my brilliance. Bullshit! I wax a bit like Hemmingway here, but bullshit. Really! No one is brilliant right out of the box. A publisher will usually tell you the truth about your writing and best listen to it but even then, they have an agenda. To sell what they publish, but they also know what will sell. Selling is not always in line with creative thought. So, if I were you, I would have a pristine, edited, grammatically correct manuscript and then let the world have at it. It better be good, because the public is mean-spirited. Christopher Hitchens once said, \u201cEverybody does have a book in them, but in most cases, that's where it should stay.\u201d Be a skeptic. Question everything in your life and what you think you know. Use the bywords of Honor, Truth, Reason, and Logic in your life and you will be much happier and more fulfilled for doing so. ",

            "answer_text": "I wait a bit until I\u2019m well into a first draft before sharing. And at that stage I only share with fellow writers in a small writers\u2019 group . Like many other writers I find early comments distracting. I take to heart Coleridge\u2019s experience with his poem Kubla Kahn. A friend visited him while he was writing and he lost the vision that had stimulated the work. Agonizing later, he wrote: \u201cCould I revive within me Her symphony and song, To such a deep delight \u2019twould win me, That with music loud and long, I would build that dome in air, That sunny dome! those caves of ice!\u201d But he lost that thread and we\u2019ll never know what the poem may have been like. Such is why I write as I do, a pantser who writes by the seat of my pants. I can go back and gussy up what I have written but never accurately recall what I didn\u2019t write down. I do trust the perspicacious writers I know who can comment effectively after the fact. One friend, a retired screen writer, rescued me from some too-florid prose in my recent Vietnam War novel, A Shepherd to Fools. His view was invaluable, coming early but not intrusively. So my advice in a nutshell, share only when you are ready and when your idea is already well begun. ",

Why: early feedback on the central ideas (how relevant, interesting is it), on the method etc. The layout is still messy, the structure is not there. 2. Working draft (things are being added, the key contributions are there but it\u2019s working the form, building a structure) Who: several rounds with the co-authors. When I have something I consider decent, I may also send it to close friends that are in the domain. Why: During this process, I try to highlight what has to be read, the key changes in the new version (it does not always work, co-authors never read or react to the part you expect them to). Sending it to close friends is for external feedback and because I value their opinion. Also, the work may be of interest for them. 3. Submitted manuscript Who: finally submitted phew! I feel ok sending it to people requesting it and it\u2019s generally on a preprint server such as arXiv. Why: sure, it has not been reviewed and edited so it\u2019s not perfect, but I value science in the open and transparency, showing the work done has some value to others, signals the topics I am working on and I am ready to accept small typos for this.

Maybe something will come out of this like advice, examples to consider, possible extensions, etc.When the writing is done I put on arXiv.org e-Print archive for people to see. Arxiv provides by itself a proof of authorship. I wait typically 10 days after this preprint submission before submitting to a formal journal. In that period, I may receive useful comments and invitations to submit.Therefore, the strategy is when doing sharing not to expose oneself to potential trouble and be cornered into impossible situation.

My preference is to wait until I have a substantial chunk of material for which I want critical reader feedback \u2014 perhaps 100 pages or more, though it depends on the nature of the work. It\u2019s got to be enough to let readers know the premise of the work and the way I\u2019m handling it in terms of language, structure, intent and development. I share the material with close connections I consider beta readers. These are thoughtful people. They\u2019re competent readers who will challenge the work when necessary, regardless of the nature of their connections with me. In other words, I can trust them to give me meaningful feedback before I get so deeply into the work that major changes would be problematic. I\u2019ll take their comments and criticisms into account in revising what I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019ll then come back to them down the road when I have more (and more developed) material for them to look at. Ultimately, you\u2019ll have to handle the business of \u201cearly readers\u201d in a way and at a time that makes you comfortable and provides you with the sort of feedback you need.

Most of the nonfiction authors I work with tend to share their work when it\u2019s fully written. Sometimes, they\u2019ve asked friends or family for opinions or shared the book with beta readers to get feedback, but often I\u2019m the first person to read the book. After our first collaboration, some authors prefer to share their second books part-way through writing to get feedback sooner. I might be biased saying this as an editor, but seeking an objective editorial assessment from an experienced, knowledgeable editor who understands the market and the target audience is likely to add more value than asking friends or family.

Once I think I know what\u2019s to be done, I either get on with doing it, or at that point I may involve an editor. This is a slow way, in terms of elapsed time, to produce a book, but it work for me. Hope this helps. ",

To be honest, though, I don\u2019t get much out of sharing things before they\u2019re finished. A good workshop group, however, can be a great help when it comes to finding plot holes. They often ask questions that help me to develop my characters, so manuscripts are also not \u201cfinished\u201d yet either. ",
