            "answer_text": "I put \u201cmonth/yr to month/yr\u201d for places worked on a resume. If I\u2019m writing how much experience with a piece of software or computer language, I would probably write 1 year experience with it if I had 11 months. One difference being that if the software is part of the job in a technical environment I will be tested. Another is that 11 months with most software is about the same as 1 year. But the other situation, how long you\u2019ve worked at a particular place, will probably come back and bite you on the ass if you don\u2019t keep it as correct as possible. If they background check you, they may decide that you had fudged the truth and then you\u2019re going to have to explain when they ask you about it. That\u2019s not the kind of question you want. ",

            "answer_text": "I normally recommend just putting the years that you worked in places. It is simpler, takes up less space and easier to read. Most companies don\u2019t ask for the months of employment only the years. So they don\u2019t care either. Of course if you worked for a few days from December 31 to Jan 1, you put down 2017 to 2018 and it looks like you have over a years experience. ",

If you are just referring to lengths of experience, then it\u2019s your call. Some employers might see rounding up experience as cause for termination. Some might see it as creativity, and applaud your effort to pad your resume. ",
