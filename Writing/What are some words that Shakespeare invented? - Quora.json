            "answer_text": "Shakespeare was the master of literature, producing pieces that made landmark in the history of literature. There are over 70 phrases and 100 words that are supposedly invented by Shakespeare. Some of the famous phrases are  All that glitters is not gold (The Merchant of Venice)(\"glisters\")All's well that ends well (title)Dog will have his day (Hamlet; quoted earlier by Erasmus and Queen Elizabeth)Jealousy is the green-eyed monster (Othello)Love is blind (Merchant of Venice)What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. (Romeo and Juliet)The world's my oyster (Merry Wives of WindsorSome of the famous words are accommodation (Othello)accused (n.) (Richard II -- first known use as a noun, meaning person accused of a crime)bedazzled (The Taming of the Shrew)hoodwinked (already known from falconrmalignancy (Twelfth Night, seems possible)The popular book Coined by Shakespeare acknowledges that it is presenting first attestations rather than certain inventions. For example, \"alligator\" appeared for the first time in print as an English word in \"Romeo and Juliet\", but it has Spanish antecedents, and only the terminal \"-r\" seems to be new with Shakespeare. \"Puke\" appears as a vulgar term for vomiting in the near-contemporary \"Duchess of Malfi\", and it seems well-known; so Shakespeare's use in \"As You Like It\" seems more likely just a first attestation. The region of Dalmatia is as old as the Roman Empire, and obviously Shakespeare did not coin the adjectival form. Words like \"anchovy\", \"bandit\", and \"zany\" are just first attestations of loan-words. By contrast, in \"Troilus and Cressida\", Shakespeare seems to have been having fun introducing new forms of old words, even though \"orgulous\" and \"deracinate\" never did catch on. ",
