Personal observation: I don\u2019t follow closely what the worldwide Pandemic situation is or will be anytime soon regards covid19 However the corona epidemic in america is beginning to wain in several areas. And everyone will be back to work in less than ten months. Best guess. And I\u2019ll give even odds to no more than six months. I didn\u2019t say it would be gone. AIDS isn\u2019t gone MRSA isn\u2019t gone Alzheimer's isn\u2019t gone Pancreatic cancer isn\u2019t gone Heart disease isn\u2019t gone But we go on. And don\u2019t forget, an almost identical flu like illness that was just as deadly called SARS-CoV-1 isn\u2019t much of a thing anymore in because it\u2019s just gone, worldwide. Of course at the moment there is the sequel to get past: \u201cSon of SARS-CoV-1\u201d (alias SARS-CoV-2, alias covid-19, alias novel corona virus, etc) ",

Even without a vaccine, SARS-coV-2 may eventually run out of victims. And, with luck, it will evolve into a less mortal and fatal version. The \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d applies to viruses as well as every living thing: some mutations adapt better to an environment than others, and those adapted version survive better. Let\u2019s cross our fingers and be hopeful that, once it\u2019s circulated through most of the population (or we have a vaccine), a mutation that is less virulent wins the evolutionary lottery. Our adaptive immune response to coronaviruses are against us (immunity to them usually lasts 3mos.-1yr.), but nature may give us a boost. At the very least, it buys us time to develop a vaccine that we can adjust when a nastier mutation appears again. ",
