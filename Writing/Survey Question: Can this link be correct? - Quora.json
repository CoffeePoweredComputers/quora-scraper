            "answer_text": "I'm doubt about how the survey had been done, what the samples are, and what their criteria of being religious are.  I am Indonesian who is living in Bangladesh since 2 year back. In my concern, Bangladesh and Indonesia are secular (at least they declared themselves as secular countries).  If you look at the big cities such as Dhaka and Chittagong, they are more modernized and open to western ideas. Meanwhile, the young Bangladeshi who live there are more expose to different western culture (clothing, language, etc). You can certainly find people who wear western clothing as well as shalwar and panjabi (typical South Asian clothing), head scarf for women, and even some women who wear full burka. A lot of people are going to mosques which mostly men because most of the mosques here are only for men. However, if you go to the rural area, you will find a lot of people even more 'devoted' and 'religious' at least from the way that they dress and their conversation about religion. Many times when I met different people from various social classes and background, they ask me same question: \"What is your religion?\"  Indonesia is a secular country (at least the government declared that it's a secular country), but I can't deny that religions still play important role in various level of the governmental sectors. Religion is written in the National ID card which doesn't happen in Bangladesh. In both countries, they have different political parties who run in the name of religion. Both countries also have fundamentalist people who do 'some acts against certain ideology.'  The difference is Indonesia has more diverse religions and people are mixing easily (I assume), where in Bangladesh, it's not really the case.  ",

            "answer_text": "So, I compare Indonesia and Turkey for comparison. Because I rather doubt about Bangladesh.  So, I think Turkey is the way more secular. As I know, Turkey think that religious tradition is not really mater compared by Indonesia that religion is very important. I conclude that assumption after one of my friend had experience while visiting Turkey. And Pew Research Center survey proved it true and representative.  In Turkish Drama, there are scene about people drinking alcohol, a couple had intimacy. So, imagine if Turkish drama is broadcast-ed in Indonesia. The scene of alcohol is getting blurred, kissing scene is censored (or even blacked out) because that's not appropriate for our so-called Eastern culture. ",
