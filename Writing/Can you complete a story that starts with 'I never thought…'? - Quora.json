I could have stood inside the bus station\u201d, Ananya was angry on seeing her brother. \u201cYou are returning after one month. Many things have taken place here since the time you left. Inside the bus station, many bad guys roam around so it is not safe. Here due to this guy, nobody would come!\u201d He pointed at the guy sitting. \u201cWhy?\u201d, Ananya was surprised. \u201cHis sister got kidnapped & raped at this very place. After that he has gone mad and he sits here every day. Their parents died long ago. Now some NGO's take care of him.\u201d Her mind's tornado was suddenly arrested by sympathy!! She seized his glance in her mind like a caged bird. It's symphony ignited a spark in her heart!! With schintillating eyes and a subtle smile, she went with her brother.  \u201cWhy are you standing in this bus stop, Ananya? Let's go.\u201d, Sidharth grabbed his wife's hands. \u201cJust 5 minutes!!\u201d, She stood there. \u201cWhy did you decide to marry me even when I was a mad guy who would always sit at this bus stop?\u201d, Sidharth asked. \u201cYou lost your heart and your soul was bleeding. On that day, being a doctor, I only saw that.\u201d He broke down into her hands, as those moments of bus stop and hospital floated around him with her smile bringing a dawn in his lonely dark horizon!!  Thank you for A2A, User-9436304335710962542 & Shreyash ",

This can not end! \" But was this really the end? The drops of tears hung by the eyelids, the stains of blood had colored his hands red, the sadness, the emptiness, the remorse, of leaving Monica alone, surrounded him. It all had him caught up in an ugly position, he couldn't help himself out of this void, but he had to get up! He just had to! Because it was time. Remember? He searched his pockets, looking for that envelope, he had always wanted to see what was in there, but now when he was going to do it, he did not want to do it. With shaky hands, trembling stained fingers and a blurry sight, he unfolded the envelop, took out the note and somehow gathered the strength to get started into reading it out. It was a worn out old yellowish paper, with a long text scribbled on it, the blue ink dried out to being an almost black, as if written under some pressure. \"Hey Ross!\" First words, and he couldn't go on any further. He could hear her in those words and it isn't a good feeling to hear the dead speaking up again. The emotions, the memories, the love, the past. It was all hitting him very hard. He was crying like a mad man, a man madly in love, he was acting like a lost child, a child crying helplessly. He even thought of throwing away this note and try not to hurt himself any further, but how could he? How could he let go of this last memory, this last note, this last conversation, maybe the last wish! He wiped of his fears and emotions and continued. \"I know if you are reading this I'm probably dead or maybe fighting for life. Now that I am gone, with no explanation I suppose, with all your questions about me still unanswered.Here you are, still trying to know me, still trying to know why you fell in love with this woman. Honey, here you'll get the answers. I'm scared you might hate me for this, maybe you will think I did too much and I ask too much out of you, but you will help me, won't you?Because you're the only one whom I have actually loved, it was always difficult for me to trust someone, but I did trust you Ross, and I will trust you over this note also because I love you. \" It was getting hard for him to go any further, The words were piercing right though his flesh, he was falling apart, but he had to continue, it was too late to back off now. It was time. \"Do you remember the man we killed in Connecticut?The other man in the hat who we killed in the deserts of Sahara?The little guy who was sunk to death in the river?We were on a killing spree, weren't we?Why did you never question me who they all are?Yes you should trust me alright, I trust you too, but why didn't you ever ask me who they all are?Scared that I would never open up and shut you up like every other time?Well you were right in this, I would never have told you if you would have asked.But here we are, I am about to tell you what you never asked!\" To be continued.. Feeling like missing something? Here is the previous part of this fictional account: Akshit Arora's answer to Can you write a story starting with the line \"You love me, don't you?\"? ",

She was really taken aback. Two days ago something had deflated inside her when he had said that those were not true. But the next day..as she was coming out of the school washroom ,he was there near the aquifier filling the water bottle and had said; \u201cIt wasn\u2019t true then..but it is now\u201d. Aashna couldn\u2019t get what he had said. She was an idiot in these things.Her knowledge was so vast but how couldn\u2019t she get this simple sentence? So she asked him sheepishly; \u201cUmm..what do you mean..I didn\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat Aashna..you get so good grades in your test..and you can\u2019t even understand the meaning of this simple sentence?\u201d She pouted adorably and said\u201d I DON\u2019T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN AND THAT\u2019S WHY I AM ASKING YOU..IF I HAD KNOWN WHY WOULD I ASK YOU?\u201d \u201cOkay..calm down..I will tell you something tomorrow\u201d ,he said,smiling a little. The next day as Aashna was coming out of the school campus,he came running to her and gave her a piece of paper. Aashna took it and as she started reading it,her eyes widened. She stared in disbelief and she was really taken aback, for in that sheet,it was written \u201cMy friends always come to me and say that they have fallen in love..I didn\u2019t believe in it..In Love..but as I came to know you ..I finally knew what love is..I have never felt so strongly for anyone ever..I have never loved anyone..But I don\u2019t know why,seeing you makes me smile..I love you Aashna..and yes..sorry for the bad handwriting..took me an hour to write this!!\u201d Aashna smiled when she read this. She was so happy but she was quick enough to wipe her smile and say \u201c You know right..what happened to me..I don\u2019t believe in love anymore..what if I say \u2018No\u2019 to you?\u201d \u201c Then I will keep loving you more and pestering you until you finally say yes..even if I become a ghost..Mind you.. I will be a handsome ghost.\u201d This time Aashna couldn\u2019t stop her laughter. She loved him so much\u2026 TO BE CONTINUED.. Edit :Visit my answers to : Can you complete a story starting with \u201c I never knew\u2026\u201d and Can you share a romantic/ sad story and this is the first story of the three. and this is the first time I am writing stories..so please forgive me for any mistakes.

            "answer_text": "I never thought that one day I'll loose faith in something called 'being nice' . My hands quiver, all along the thoughts that run in my mind right now. It was one of the routine nights. As usual, I was driving home. Half way down, I noticed people crowded around a seemingly middle aged man, who was unconscious. I stopped my car beside. That man was drenched in blood. I heard a voice saying, \u201cSpot! Spot dead!\u201d I kneeled to look at him. \u201cHe's alive! He's alive!\u201d I shouted. Yes, I felt his pulse. Next few minutes where like battling against a flock of sheep, who never give way to do something needy. These people never change. Nobody came forward to even help me carry him to the car. \u201cHold on! Hold on, brother! Be strong!\u201d I mumbled in his ears. Soon, I drove to the nearby hospital. The staff responded quickly. An I.V line was started. Resuscitation procedures were done. The Doctor whispered, \u201cToo late! But, we'll try our best!\u201d I stood numb. My sight went hazy. I've no idea how next few minutes went. I opened my eyes to see fee people dressed in white around me. I heard a voice, \u201cYou, ok? Feeling better? Clearing my eyes, I whispered, \u201cYeah!\u201d Little later, I got into my senses. I rushed to enquire about the person. \u201cFractured pelvis and skull. Internal bleeding in the abdomen. Absent light reflex. Very difficult!\u201d They announced. I was shattered. Soon, the memories flooded in my eyes. How I met him in school- how we shared precious moments together- how we promised each other not to leave our sides, whatever might be the consequences- how we excelled in our respective fields. He's a Doctor, who works day and night just to see a smile on his patients' face. Oh sorry! He never addresses them as \u2018patients\u2019, he says \u2018my people\u2019. He has zero enemies. I've no eligibility to even say a word about his kindness. \u201cHe's no more! I'm sorry!\u201d The Doctor, who was trained under my friend's guidance for past two decades, announced. All I could do was utter, \u201cYou're a cheat, my friend. You didn't keep your promise!\u201d I cried. I cried. I cried. But, he never came back.  It's fiction. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cI never thought this would happen again\u201d, Samaira exclaimed. Danish was alert. What would never happen again? Why is Samaira so tensed. Danish and Samaira started going out three years ago. It was love at first blink!(Yeah, that happens). They got married two years later and shifted to a new house. They had really happy times until that one day. It was Danish's birthday. Weird things started to happen. Danish's files were flying off the shelves, samaira's clothes were off the hangers. And that was not it. The basement was completely upside down. It seemed like you have entered a different world. These continued for days. Things did not come to rest. They called a priest and exterminated the entity in the house. Or so they thought. Another year went away and the same things started to happen again, only violently. Samaira was scared. She couldn't believe it was happening again. She was pushed in the shower and hit her head. While making dinner one night, she was forced to slice her palm. Even Danish wasn't spared. Every morning, his car would be covered with crows and their droppings. And his tyres would be slashed. His files would be shredded to bits and would be floating around the house as if their is no gravity working on them. This couple decided they had to do something about it. They tried a lot of things- holy water, prayers etc. But nothing seemed to work. It only worsened the situation. Losing their hope, they decided to leave their house. They thought after that night they would have a goodnight sleep from then, every night. It was around 3.15 am. Samaira woke up. She could hear water dripping from the taps. She turned and was going to wake up Danish only to find him missing. Her eyes drifted towards the closet where she thought she saw her husband. But there was a shadow. A shadow of a man with bloody red eyes and a crooked grin. The shadow was holding something. Samaira screamed on top of her lungs to see her bloodied husband's head in his hand. There was blood everywhere. He was coming for me. She was next. She tried to run and call for help. Everything became black all of the sudden. She could feel blood in her mouth. *Next Day* News: the stories of Maplewood creek hauntings seem to be true. The police found a severed head and body of the husband living in the house. There is a message written with his blood on every wall of the house. We'll meet again. The wife residing in the house is missing and only her toes and hair are left behind. On further investigation, the cops found the basement is completely upside down and it has split into two pieces. ",

            "answer_text": "I never thought Desire would try jumping off from our terrace. Desire is my 1 year and 9 months old Labrador. If it wouldn't have been for a platform under the edge from which he dived, I can not imagine what would have happened. I took Desire to our rooftop. The weather was cloudy and it could rain anytime, so instead of taking him for a walk outside, I decided to bring him up there. He is a mischievous dog, just like the ones they show in movies. He is super energetic and it's usually hard for me to hold him. Once, he jumped directly from our terrace to our neighbours\u2019 without even getting a support from the wall in between. He enjoys doing that. So, I keep him tied to his leash to make sure he doesn't run away from there or even get hurt. We were pretty sure he did so because he was aware that there was a flooring on the other end and wouldn't hop around near any other edge. There were a bunch of monkeys around who kept his attention towards them intact. He was making me run along with him and kept howling like crazy. We did go to the edges, but just to get the view. That was when he pulled me at one of the corners and jumped across the wall. I'd not even try to dramatize it, just to make you understand. My heart did skip a beat, it really did. Thankfully, there was a concrete platform where he landed. I clearly do not know whether he was aware about that or not. I guess he wasn't. And that was the moment when I couldn't be any more grateful for everything. Luckily, brother was nearby and as I started screaming for him, he reached there immediately. I held Desire tightly by his collar and even his hand as I feared him slipping from there. Brother jumped over too, lifted Desire up ( Which again becomes hard as he's a restless dog) and placed him on my side. I did scold him a lot after coming home. But I cannot expect him to understand the seriousness of the situation, can I? We often overlook situations where we've been blessed deeply and keep on complaining about petty stuff. I'll never ever forget this incidence. To even imagine the other side of the story becomes a nightmare for me. Now I understand why we should be grateful for everything, at every point. ",

The words of her parents echoed in her mind and were piercing into her heart like a ferocious sharp knife. She sat on the bench of park, gasping heavily for breath. \u201cWhy did it happen? Why me?\u201d She cried while her throat choking. The lights in the park were turning on and off. Dark clouds invaded the sky. The wind blew harder and harder and slapped her gentle face. Boughs of trees swayed heavily and surrendered their dry old leaves to the mighty wind. Silence fell upon the park. Children left the park along with their parents. Holding their hand tightly. She looked at them and remembered how she used to run towards her parents and cry whenever the winds blew. The sky shook with thunder and unleashed torrent of water. She sat still, her eyes burned due to bullets of water drops. Suddenly, she saw something shimmering behind a tree. Her watery eyes stared at the blur image of shining object. She walked up to the tree and found an abandoned bejwelled tiara. An image flashed in front of her eyes. Her mother was setting the tiara on her head telling her how she was the best and most precious princess. The beautiful reminiscent was broken again by the sharp words. \u201cYou're adopted and not our biological daughter.\u201d she uttered her parents' words in melancholy. But if they had hated me, they would never have treated me like a princess. Image of loving days with her parents started to unfold in front of her eyes. She thought to herself if being biological kid really matters. They never made me feel I was adopted. If they had, I would have guessed this long back. But I never even got hint of this! They loved and protected me more than anything else. Her eyes were filled with shades of many emotions. There was pain, but more than that, there was love. Love surmounted everything. Just when she held the tiara close to her heart, someone tapped on her shoulder. There were standing the two people whom she adored the most. She hugged them tightly and apologized for running away. They tightly hugged her back and said, \u201cHoney, it's OK! We understand what you're going through. But remember, we love you more than anything.\u201d \u201cAnd I love you the most!\u201d Leena said as her heart was filling up with love forgetting the pain. They looked up at the sky as the rain had stopped. Today, the moon was at its best. Starts felt to be glistening more brightly than any other day, may be because of the bond that Leena had with her parents became stronger than ever. ",

What kind of question is that Kavya?\u201d \u201cI\u2026 I... Am sorry.. I don't recall...\u201d \u201cThat's rude! We were inseparable for years. I left to go out of the country and you forget my existence?\u201d \u201cListen, there must be a mistake. I am not the Kavya you are......\u201d \u201cKavya Iyer, St Theresa convent. Roll number 28.\u201d Kavya stared at him open mouthed. \u201cPlease tell me who you are. I can't recall you.\u201d \u201cYou don't? Really?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThen you find out. I didn't expect this from our strict no-nonsense class monitor. Give me a call when you remember. But you will not have my number, as I just returned from US. How will you tell me then?\u201d \u201cI don't know..\u201d Kavya said meekly. \u201cJust the same old Kavya! I don't know.\u201d He mimicked her. \u201cGive your phone I will give you my number.\u201d \u201cNo. Is this some scam?\u201d \u201cScam? I am not taking your number I am giving you my number! Idiot! But no, you are the same old Kavya I used to hate in school. Bye.\u201d He turned around to leave. \u201cWait. Give your number.\u201d \u201cNo. What if you harass me? Men can't even complain to the police!\u201d \u201cShut up. Tell me your number.\u201d He blurted out and she typed. She gave a missed call on his number. \u201cThat's mine. I have class photos I will call you by tonight. I am good with remembering faces. I don't know what's gotten into me now.\u201d \u201cThat's Okay, Kavu! See yaa!\u201d He turned around and crossed the road. He went inside a cafe and headed to a group sitting nearby. \u201c987654321 her number!\u201d He revealed boastfully! \u201cWhat the hell? How did you do it?\u201d \u201cYou shouldn't just look at girls. You should hear their conversations too.\u201d He said. \u201cMeaning?\u201d One of them asked. \u201cShe was talking about school life the whole time sitting at the next table. I wasn't just admiring her looks, I was also listening to her conversation. Kavya Iyer, St Theresa, Class monitor, strict and roll number 28 was all that I needed to get her number.\u201d Want to know what happens next? Look up here. Shefali Naidu's post in Fiction Please!

And now I don't know what future beholds for me ?\u201dshe was out in space last night. She got married six years ago, and was expecting the love like Mr. Kit and Cinderella have for each other in the fairy tale, and now she learned life is not a fairy tale at all, it's a cruel reality. She tolerated everything, which she doesn't deserve, but she did it for him as she wanted his love. She was hoping for a miracle. Now She don't want it anymore, because she know he never loved her truly, he has always doubted her for nothing. Yes!! For nothing. Being a Woman, being a mother and his wife she did nothing wrong. But he doubted just because she questioned \u201cWhy you are unemployed, why you are so much irresponsible, for what you have this MBA degree, why you doesn't have time to talk about our life and our kid's future. Though I don't have any problem if I am taking care of your expenses, but I need to spend time with our kid, I want you to work. I want to know you, share what's there in your mind, share if something is troubling you.\u201d His answer use to be \u201cLeave me, if you don't like me. I will be like this.\u201d She thought he will be by her side on that disastrous night, but NO, he was there to blame her for something she haven't done. He left her helpless at that night of her birthday. He was her husband, but behaved as a rapist. She so wanted to make things work again, just in a hope that he will change and for their son too. But his ego and as he say 'mai mard hu' (I am a man) has ruined everything. That has taken away a child from a mother, they are judicially separated now and soon will have the divorce certificate. She ended up as a Mother with no kid.  This question has been asked by Shreyash Singh Chauhan today, approx 4 hrs ago. I know this might not sound like a story, but this is what I wanted to write as an answer to this question. The female in the content above is me. Yes its 14th June today, the 6th wedding anniversary and the first after the separation\u2026\u2026. ",

And you used those things to put me in trouble? Payal said \u2018No\u2019. Because you subverted her mind.\u201d It was going to be a great day for Rajesh, as he was waiting for 6 months to tell what he felt about Payal, a co-worker in the company. He used to tell everything to Karan, his close friend. Even, Rajesh told Karan about his family background, the sad divorce of his parents and the life he lived since then. Karan had initially shown some sympathy to Rajesh as he wasn't interested in Payal at all. But as the time changed, Karan started having some feelings for Payal. Now, he used to tell wrong things to Payal about Rajesh. Poor was Rajesh, who didn't know this sabotage going behind him by his trusted aid. Karan falsely told Payal that Rajesh was a womanizer. Payal, innocent enough to fall in the trap of Karan, believed what he said about Rajesh. So, today, when Rajesh was to express his feelings for her, Payal slapped him and said, \u201cI would die single than having a cheap person like you with me. Karan is hundred times better than a womanizer like you. With a broken family like yours, how can you expect me to spend a single moment? Better, forget me and don't ever dare to communicate with me.\u201d The family thing was only told to Karan. So, more than her rejection, it was the family thing that hurted Rajesh the most. And he directly went to Karan, with a knife in his hands. Guess the further scenario- whether Rajesh attacked Karan? Or Rajesh cut his own vains? Or Karan attacked Rajesh?? Just a story\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I never thought of living without Shruti even for a moment, and here, I stand today, having spent 2 years of my life without the hint of her presence. The train\u2019s speed dwindled as it approached nearer to the platform. I was standing at the gate, feeling the mild breeze gushing through my hair. I closed my eyes and tried to recollect some of the most beautiful memories I have of the city. I grew up here. It whiffs of my childhood, my adolescence and of Shruti - the girl I was ever so in love with. I still am. I tried not to think about her. But, as the train passed through the city, the sight of every little thing reminded me of her. The over-bridge where we had once sat together and smoked for the first time under the half lit moon, the grand \u2018Landmark\u2019 hotel where we had gone for a valentines evening, even the railway tracks looked familiar - somewhere on the same tracks, we had sit together innumerable times planning our future, her hand in mine.  The train gradually came to a halt at platform number one. I glanced at the board stating \u201cWelcome to Gwalior\u201d in bold letters. I wanted to feel welcomed but I didn\u2019t. I recollected Shruti screaming at me to go away from her life, once and for all, leaving me with no other option but to abide. I reeled on the platform with a heavy baggage and an even heavier baggage of nostalgia and reminiscence. I hired an auto and asked the drive to take the longer route to my home, because the shorter one passed by her home and I didn\u2019t want it to trigger a flood of memories, which anyways had already been triggered. I looked around as the auto drove through the hushed streets of the city. Gwalior is a city where nothing much changes. I have seen this city for 20 years and very little had changed over the time. And inside me, everything had changed in less than a couple of years. I was left barren and recluse. I don\u2019t know where Shruti is, whether she is still unmarried or a mother to a daughter as beautiful as her, whether she is living entangled in those unfulfilled dreams alike me, or has already moved on and living our dreams with someone else, whether she still has my number and types a text umpteen times and discards without sending, or has deleted and forgotten my number long back. I wish I could ever find the answers, if the odds are in my favor. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201c I never thought that I was lucky enough to taste this dish again. Even my hopes of encountering with the same was dead long ago. You know, it was one of my most favourite dishes my mom used to make.\u201d She said as she took first bite of a surprised dinner her husband had planned for her. She closed her eyes and begun to enjoy it. \u201cHow does it taste? Do you like it?\u201d Husband asked. \u201cIt tastes like nostalgia, brings back all those sweet memories of my childhood and teenagerhood. My mom used to make exact same dish on holidays. It has the same taste, I must say. You should be very proud of yourself right now. Not most of husbands get appreciation from their wives.\u201d Wife said with smile as she took another bite from the dish. \u201c Hence proved I can cook more than tea. Now, never raise your finger against my cooking skills ever again.\u201d \u201cOkay\u2026. Baba\u2026. Okay\u2026 I will never doubt your skills again.\u201d She said holding her ears, asking for fake apologies. \u201cIs this the big surprise that you were planning for me?\u201d she added. \u201cIt maybe or may not be. Right now, why don't you just enjoy the food? Keep your brain on power saving mode and let your stomach do thinking.\u201d He said with a smile on his face. \u201cBy the way, I am making tea. Would you like to have some?\u201d \u201cNo..No\u2026No.. I am fine. You help yourself. I will just finish the dinner then will take a bath.\u201d  \u201cWhy is there two mugs besides tea-pot? I did say no to tea, remember?\u201d Wife asked out of curiosity when she noticed a couple of used cups of tea on the table as she got out of bathroom. \u201cYeah. That's for me. I want to drink two cups of tea. I had headache.\u201d He said holding his head. \u201cThat is so silly. You can drink twice from the same cup. You don't need two cups. That is idiotic.\u201d \u201cYeah. Idiot, that's me.\u201d \u201cYou know what I think, we should call an exorcist. I think you are possessed by some unearthly spirit. First you made a fabulous dish for me and that also without being confused between sugar and salt. Then I found the house as clean as heaven, I can literally see my reflection through floor tiles. Everything is arranged perfectly and exactly on places where they should be. You have even folded our blanket and made our bed perfectly. That's not it, even every fan, bulb and tube lights are dust free and our toilet\u2026\u2026 awwww\u2026. It smells so gooooood. THIS IS SO NOT YOU.\u201d \u201cAre you done with your deductions, Mrs. Sherlock? As far as I remember I haven't given you any birthday gift.\u201d \u201cHuh! So, what about it?\u201d \u201cRemember, the game you used to play in your childhood. The one in which your mom uses to blindfold you and tell you to find something and you always ended up finding your most\u2026.\u201d \u201cYEAH, \u2018My most desirable things'! Actually my mom used to put it there. WAIT.. WAIT..WAIT.. I don't remember revealing this to you. How\u2026\u2026\u201d \u201cDon't interrupt me wife. Today we are going to play the same game. I am going to blindfold you. Now seat tight on that sofa and don't move until I say.\u201d He blindfolded her and told her to stand up after completing count to ten. She did the same and then started roaming in the room with help of her hands. Suddenly, her hands came in contact with a body, a human body. \u201cOh it's you. So, you are the surprise. I really expected some million dollar diamond necklace, my naughty husband. Well, I am gonna enjoy this gift whole night, hubby.\u201d She said with naughty accent before removing her blindfold. Her eyes filled with tears as she saw the face of a person standing in front of her and then she heard laugh of her husband from behind. IT WAS HER MOTHER! \u201cWell, aren't you gonna hug your birthday gift, girl?\u201d Her mother said. \u201cHow?\u201d She asked with teary eyes and chocked voice. \u201cI got news that your step brother had sent your mother to an old-age home and I think you are aware of this. This was why you were upset. I tried to talk you out but you one stone-hearted never share your feelings. So, I decided to bring your mother to our home and to surprise you on your birthday. FROM NOW ON, SHE IS GOING TO LIVE WITH US.\u201d She was just staring at the face of his husband, being sure of that \u2018Angels do live among us'. ",

Well, you too told me that you love me like everyone used to tell me. Where are those words now?? Not your fault though, I have lost myself amidst of finding pleasure in my journey but - Everyday I go towards the mirror, try to look myself in the eyes of my VIRTUAL IMAGE but suddenly I take a turn, without touching my image, ignoring the same black eyes staring at me, asking me - Are you the same girl? Then out of fear, I lie down on my bed holding the green spinner, watching the cyclic motion of fan for hours, then I switch to watch the same ceiling which I don't think has changed, after hours and hours trying to escape from my VIRTUAL IMAGE, I muster all my courage and again walk towards the mirror. This time my eyes are wide open, trying to expell all the fear and I gave her a fierce look, but- Did I say she gave me the fiercest look? Again my courage got vanished. Then the series of watching same moving plates of fan, green spinner and same white ceiling starts. Did I mention how many times I did this?? Uncountable! Hours wasted, days wasted, months, years...I failed to win over my image! I never thought this mirror will squeeze the soul out of me and throw myself to the walls of reality that is full of truth, no lies, no virtuality, no another ME Did I say this loss of self -esteem is also termed as depression?

            "answer_text": "\u201c I never thought\u2026. we will fight ever\u201d, thought she. Tears were streaming down her face and soaking the pillow\u2026 Three months into marriage, theoretically they were still in the honeymoon phase, or that's what she thought. Till now, she often wondered why couples fight when they are so much in love. She was confident that such a situation won't ever arise in her case, as they were a perfect example of loving, caring and understanding couple. She was in total denial about the situation that happened that day, two hours back, when both of them yelled at each other. She was surprised as she had never seen him angry\u2026 and so was he. It all started with a very trivial matter. She had a bad headache since afternoon. In the evening, she didn't feel like cooking dinner. So, she called him\u2026. but he didn't pick up the phone. Thinking that he must be busy, she messaged on WhatsApp, about bringing something from the takeaway for dinner,on his way home. But, the grey ticks never converted to blue. He finally arrived quite late. On opening the door, seeing him empty handed, she was pissed off. He told that he was busy in an important office meeting. Her complaining in loud voice and a bad tone, resulted in yelling , shouting and more shouting from both sides. After this sudden storm of quarrel, she went to the bedroom while he settled in the drawing room. There was no offering of cold water and hot tea followed by chatting and giggling about each other's day\u2026while holding hands together. While drenching the pillow\u2026she dozed off to sleep\u2026and after a while she woke up startled. She looked at the wall clock. It was already 11:15 pm . \u2018 he must be very hungry', she thought all of a sudden, I think I should fix something for dinner\u2026 something quick like sandwich or bread omlette. Then she went to the drawing room, wondering what he was doing, as she heard the sound of television. He was fast asleep\u2026. over sofa. She looked at him. He was having a frown over face and was snoring softly\u2026 and looked like an oversized baby rather than an adult. \u2018 I shouldn't have started the fight', she was filled with guilt. She had a sudden urge to cuddle him, but she restrained herself, overpowered by ego. Then she went to the kitchen and thought of making some dish which was his favorite. Kadhi chawal( a dish made with gram flour fried balls dipped in curd gravy, eaten with rice) would be fine, she thought. In fifteen minutes, it was ready. She served it at the dining table and woke him up. Quietly they had dinner. He asked for few more helpings of the dish which she served. \u2018It's really very tasty', he told with a smile. She- 'so adamant and unapologetic\u2026.you can't even say a sorry\u2019. He- \u2018 sorry?\u2026. but why?\u2019 She- \u2018 for the fight\u2026of course\u2019 He- \u2018 but you were shouting all the way\u2026. so you should say sorry'. She-' oh\u2026really\u2026. but what were you doing\u2019. He - \u2018 I was just looking at your face\u2026. never knew you would look so beautiful when angry.\u2019 She- (with widened eyes)- \u2018 really\u2026. was I?\u2019 He - \u2018 yeah\u2026 your whole face was flushed, cheeks light red.\u2019 She ( happily) - \u2018 oh\u2026.\u2019 He- 'but the most remarkable was your nose\u2026it had turned tomato red with anger\u2026 making you look like a clown' (laughing heartily). She (pretending to be angry while trying to control smile) - \u2018 you are the meanest person on the earth\u2026 and I regret marrying you.\u2019 She threw a cushion towards him. He - \u2018 but you are the sweetest person on the earth\u2026 and I am lucky to have found you.\u2019 He caught up the cushion and threw it back towards her. The cushion fight made them to forget the real fight. The ice of ego melted ,and the pathway of love was clearly visible! A perfect marriage is not a myth\u2026. but it's all about accepting each other's imperfections and flaws\u2026. and never giving up on each other and never keeping scores, no matter what. \u2014-Dr Shashi ",

Something was intriguing me, something that extracts your peace from inside, something subtle. It\u2019s just headache, I made myself believe. My family was concerned. I too was. Now it was 12 pm in the morning. I had just come back to Campus from home. I must be looking more like a dead person than the sleeping one. Phone bell rings. Soha was calling. \u201cAre you good\u201d she, unusually, forgot to say hi. \u201cYeah off course!\u201d (Somewhere in my heart, I really wanted her to hang up the call). \u201cAnd what about your boy?\u201d She added. Okay so my boy had been my weakness for a long time. I love him. I love him till the bigger infinity. It felt good upon having \u201cmy\u201d boy talk. \u201cHe is hawwwtt man\u201d, I giggled in sleep. \u201cAre you serious about him?\u201d She asked me something that she asked often. \u201cyeah! I am planning to work hard for our future to be together\u201d \u201cIs he, too, serious about you? \u201cher questions were getting annoying now. \u201coff course Yaar. What\u2019s the matter? Why are you talking like that?\u201d I tried to hide my anger. \u201cThe truth is , he has another girlfriend with whom he is serious and have planned even the marriage.\u201d \u201cSoha! Why should I believe you\u201d? I wasn\u2019t feeling bad. Everyone used to say such things about my boy. Everyone used to call him play boy. Only I knew him more than what they know about him. My boy was un comprehensive for them so they declared him bad. I was relaxed. Soha too would have heard this from somewhere and now she was suspecting my boy. I laughed somewhere inside me and slept again. He texted me few minutes later. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten anything since the morning, come asap\u201d. \u201cComing baby\u201d, I left my sleep in the corner of my warm blanket and got up promptly. His unusual mood was telling how much he would have missed me. \u201cyou okay?\u201d I teased him. \u201cI want cigarette\u201d mood remained the same. He always had cigarettes when something kept on disturbing him, I knew. \u201cOkay! Let\u2019s have one.\u201d We went to \u201cQaashi ciggerete shop\u201d to make his mood good. Nothing was being said during the whole walk. He was silent. We had out lunch together without uttering even a single word, unusual? Yeah too much. \u201clet\u2019s talk\u201d he said. \u201cabout what?\u201d \u201cOkay! Leave it. so, what should be my punishment now?\u201d he looked straight into my eyes.  To be continued\u2026..

            "answer_text": "I never thought\u2026.the real meaning of life lies in the hardships of each day we live. It's not about tears only, it's not about smile only\u2026.life is a box of treasure. These treasures are our family, friends, career, health, failures and so much more. Stop criticizing of not having this and that, pay attention to those small things. From fan to air conditioner.From simple dresses to branded clothes.From scooty rides to car drives.From talking to few friends to texting in so-called whatsapp group.From sitting in the balcony of home to having dinner at lavish hotel.\u2026.don't forget at the end of the day you are living your own life. Each moment you are creating a story. For me, a story should be worth living as well as worth dying for. Few I NEVER THOUGHT moments are...  I never thought.... the midnight silence would be so acceptable to me. Sleepless nights not always signifies the pathetic emotional condition but they are the enlightenment to accept this very life as it is. Novels are the only mates who can talk to me, diary is the only friend who can listen to me. I finally understood such lonely moments are hard to tolerate but once they are lived trust me somewhere within we are changed... a change for betterment.  I never thought... the dawn is not only about silent sun rise. It's a start of a new chapter of our life's book. To wake up happily and wishing your parents is more soothing than receiving good morning texts from the virtual list of phone. To look into mirror and admiring oneself is more beautiful than wishing appreciation from others.  I never thought...people's behavior, words, promises eventually turns out to be absolutely fake and become the reason of ache. Pain of being left out is nothing but a stupid thought. I think the idea of making yourself worth achieving is wonderful. So not anymore let others be the reason of nuisance in your life. Bid them a goodbye and carry your life irrespective of others absence. Our own friendship with us matters a lot. So be your own good friend. Loneliness is horrible but that's what made me to differentiate between the true absence and fake presence.  I never thought....unreasonable, random, unexpected people and talks are more amazing than those whom we give reason. Go with the flow strategy is not bad after all. Enough of trying to hold the tides, let yourself flow and enjoy the ride. The day it will stop accept it and again get yourself get ready for new offering of life.  I never thought...what ever we endure is what makes us more strong, mature and lovable. Be happy for what you have suffered. Enjoy yourself\u2026 no one can ever steal your spirit of liveliness. Make your each day worth countable.  I never thought.... Life could be that much painful yet seems so beautiful now. :)(: ",

Please wait!\u201d,he ran after me and held my hand, \u201cPlease! Listen to me.\u201d He looked at me with a furrowed face and teary eyes. \u201cI don't want to listen to anything.\u201d I yanked my hand off and left.  I saw him at the supermarket the next day. Messy hair. Baggy clothes. Puffy eyes. I wanted to talk to him. I wanted to hug him and tell him how much I loved him. But how could I? He had agreed to marry someone else. Days passed without talking. I wanted closure. In fact, I yearned for it. I also wanted to collect all my stuff from his house. I still had the key to his house. So the next day I broke into his house. As I scrounged through the living room I heard frail mumbling coming from the bedroom. I walked over to the bedroom only to find him sitting across from a girl. \u201cYou're gonna marry her?\u201d, I said in the calmest tone possible while standing in the doorway. He got up, surprised. \u201cHow did you.... Uh... I... I'm sorry\u2026\u201d, he broke down. His parents who were in the next room heard us and came running to see what had happened. \u201cWho is she?\u201d, exclaimed his mother. \u201cOh! She's your mother, right? You both have the same I-am-surprised voice.\u201d, I said, sarcastically. \u201cTell her to leave.\u201d, his dad intervened. He paused for a moment, clenched his fists, stepped forward and held my hand. \u201cNo.\u201d, he said, firmly. \u201cWhat? You heard your dad. Tell her to leave!\u201d, yelled his mom. \u201cNo!\u201d, he yelled back. I looked up at him. Tears rolled down his cheeks. \u201cWe've chosen the best girl for you. You even agreed to marry her and she is way better than this girl.\u201d his dad said, pointing at me. \u201cI agreed to marry the girl of your choice just because I care about your happiness. But apparently you don't care about mine.\u201d \u201cWe care abou-\u201d \u201cNo, you don't!\u201d, he cut his dad off, \u201cI'm gonna marry her!\u201d, he said, lifting my arm like I had won some kind of championship. \u201cLet's go! Let him do whatever he wants.\u201d, his dad exclaimed, looking him dead in the eye. He hugged me as soon as they left and cried like a baby. \u201cI thought I'll lose you. I was scared. I'm sorry.\u201d, he said after he recovered. \u201cIt's okay. We're good now. But your parents might not talk to you for a long time.\u201d \u201cI know but it's fine as long as you're by my side.\u201d he said and kissed me.  Sidenote: Boys are allowed to cry. In fact, it's really cute when they cry. ",

And how could I think of this when I was aware only about the world I have seen around me- my farmer papa who works on the fields of others , my Amma doing more household works of Jamindar Kaka than ours and milking our buffalos, our small hut , small village who has only few houses. My daily routine starts from waking in the morning to sweep the floor made out of cow dung and than eating roti with onion and lassi , and then Seema gave me the call and we take our buffalos and goats to outside the village for grazing than to pond to bathing them and us playing with our dolls, decorating them , braiding their hair , and sometime we give a knot to our duppatas so that it can become saree like and we try to wear it , laughing on looking at the reflection in water , playing with five stones and talking about the things we know and see in that space, sometimes about the coming festival preparation and sometime about the memories of taste of ice cream we ate in last mela . Now we talk about breaking the glass ceilings but let me tell you there are girls exist , even now also who doesn\u2019t have even a glass ceiling , all they have is ceiling made of concrete or iron where you can\u2019t even see what\u2019s happening in other side of world. I was one of them or even worse I didn\u2019t even think that I had a ceiling at that time , I was fully ignorant and content in that activities. But as only one torch is enough to show you the path , in my case it was Sulochana Madam who become the light to show me the darkness I was being embedded. She came to our village for enrolling of girl child from the nearby town\u2019s school and seeing her personality and talking ability something struck me. I wanted to be like her from that moment nothing more nothing less. and now as you hear me as the principal of the same school I once started in the dream of becoming the one like madam, garlanding our chief guest Sulochana madam , this is very emotional to me and my life has completed a full circle here.

Months passed. But that sadness never left her face. She looked cheerful only when Raj called her from US, but that too happened rarely. Apart from that, she used to stay silent & lost in her own thoughts. Her health was deteriorating day by day due to her age or her loneliness, I don't know. She was admitted in a hospital also, but destiny had sealed her future already\u2026 Raj was not happy as he regretted for leaving her there alone for the sake of establishing himself in the US. \"I never thought I gonna lose my mom. I was planning to take her to US but.. but\u2026 it's all over\" Raj uttered in a low tone. Misha(Staff of old age home)- Raj\u2026 You lost her that day when you left her here all alone. And you know what she used to wish\u2026 that her son will never go through the pain that she was going through. Her words pierced his heart but deep down he knew she was right... He ignored his mom for a career and now nothing left except guilt. He cried heavily but his mom was no more there to wipe his tears in her aanchal!!! ",

            "answer_text": "I never thought hope would take me places but here I am sitting in some aloof terrace top restaurant looking at hope. My mind goes back in time suddenly when she smiles at me. I am a 15 year old watching my neighbors peeping through their windows to hear my father shout at me and my mother. He was a beast at night and he smelled of rotten fruits. I run up to the terrace to find air and scream internally. I look around and decide to watch airplanes on their approach to land. It had become my hobby to identify the aircraft, identify the airline and cross check it with the airline schedule to find out from which city it took off. I can still hear my father scream but his voice is momentarily shut down by the planes that pass over me. I thank Delhi airport for being such a busy airport. My mind is back to her now. I am sitting in front of her like a jet-pack ready to be fired. I can see fire-crackers in her eyes and I want to burn my hands in them. My mind wants to travel back in time again but the song on the dilapidated speaker changes, and I decided to hear it and focus my vision on her eyes. The sky in her eye was lit with the grandest of crackers possible and I wanted to be a privileged spectator. I'm not a stranger to the darkHide away, they say'Cause we don't want your broken partsI've learned to be ashamed of all my scarsRun away, they sayNo one will love you as you are[1] I am a 21 year old traveling in a general compartment from Agra to Bhopal. There are around 150 people stuffed in the compartment for only 64 people. I am hanging near the door and people are struggling to get inside the toilet, and every time someone opens it, I feel like jumping out of the train. I had no clue why I was here or where I would go thereafter. In the distance, aloof from the dry valley the train was passing through, the sun was setting and spreading saffron on us immortals. Something inside me hurt but I have no hint as to where and why? My mind is screwing around with me. I came back to the present and the song is still playing in the background. She was not there anymore, I looked around but there was no scent or visual. I sat down and called the waiter to order more food. Another round of bullets hits my skinWell, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink inWe are bursting through the barricadesAnd reaching for the sun Yeah, that's what we've become I have no clue how old I am but I am walking in a jungle with a torch in my hand. I was in the jungle of seven sisters. The locals had told me that it is haunted and I wanted to experience horror to numb the pain I had inside me. I sat on a rock and waited for a ghost to come, I wanted to be scared so that I could forget everything for a moment but just like my fortune, the ghosts betrayed me. I did not sleep the entire night and kissed the first rays of sun with gloomy eyes and a sore back. I wanted to stay back in the hope of seeing a ghost to overcome the the ghosts of my past but I walked away towards the village below. She was back while I was mindbogglingly boggling inside my mind. The smile rested in front of me. The fire crackers had stopped but I could see blue skies in her eyes, it was calm and serene. She said something but I could not hear as the song was too loud. I am who I'm meant to be, this is meLook out 'cause here I comeAnd I'm marching on to the beat I drumI'm not scared to be seenI make no apologies, this is me The year is 2034. I am on the top of a mountain holding a pen and paper. At my feet, a few puppies are eager to lick my clothes and in the distance their parents are fetching ball. The sun is rising and with it I rise from my seat. Behind me is a small cottage with wooden logs at the entrance decorated on the steps. The morning had an aroma of happiness and the dew on the grass were reflective. In one of the drops, I saw that smile again. I immediately turn behind, her hair has a shade of grey but her smile has not died a bit. She kissed me on the forehead and looks at the script I am holding in my hand. The puppies shift their attention to her, she was the mother of everything around here after all. I am back in my seat and she is still talking like I am the only person who exists around her. I interrupt her to order a drink. And I know that I deserve your loveThere's nothing I'm not worthy ofWhen the sharpest words wanna cut me downI'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them outThis is brave, this is bruisedThis is who I'm meant to be, this is me \u201cI just saw the future and I saw that I was really happy in it. Can I hold your hands please?\u201d She did not move or speak so I held her hand anyway. \u201cYou were in the future, in mine and I was in yours. I know it was just my mind playing games but I guess now I am letting my heart play games with me. I have no hint as to what you will do next but I think there cannot be anything better than you giving me a free show of fire crackers in your eyes every evening throughout my life.\u201d She just nodded. I never thought\u2026 Footnotes[1] https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greatestshowmancast/thisisme.html",

We've been so strong that even the strongest storm in the world can not separate us from our love for each other. I've been with you through thick and thin. Light and dark. Black and White. And thus I've seen every part of you,every side of your nature yet I think there's so much left to explore. So much more to understand and so many things I'll never know,for eg, Why you prefer black coffee over milk coffee when it's so bitter and you absolutely love sweet. Why you sleep hugging your pillow.\u201d \u201cHey!!! Stop sneaking a look at me while I'm asleep.\u201d She frowned. \u201cCreep.\u201d She laughed. \u201cBut seriously,I love black coffee because I love people the way the are,raw and bitter, just like I love you without any filters. Adding milk to coffee eradicates it's true nature upto some extent thus making it fake. I like real and raw.\u201d She looked at him in the eyes. Had those eyes not been mirroring his love for her, he would've thought that his love was too passionate and too true. But seeing the same feelings in her eyes, he knew it was not enough. \u201cI hug my pillow when you're away. I need someone to hold on to. It had been nothing when you had not been around. But with you, it's just you.\u201d He looked at her and say those eyes gleaming with fresh tears. He knew her past and she knew his. Stroking her cheeks,he kissed the tear away.

I never though I would be deserted like that\u2026sigh\u2026 I start driving; I don\u2019t have any other option. I am just looking here and there, hoping to find someone or rather someone I knew but the road was just empty. \u201cYour destination is on your right\u201d \u201cHuh...\u201d I was just so absorbed in thought that I didn\u2019t even realize that I had reached my destination. I looked to my right. There was some sort of a shack. I went up to the door and knocked. No one answered. I don\u2019t see anyone inside either. I decide to call Deep. \u201cShit, there is no signal here.\u201d Now that I look back at that moment, I think I could have messaged him but I was just stupid. \u201cOoh, I\u2019m not the only stupid one here\u201d exclaims Bryant. \u201cWhatever anyway let me continue?\u201d \u201cSure, Grandpa\u201d I remember I had some tools in my car, I get back to my car and pick up a spade. I had decided to break open the door. I take a few steps back and charge at the door with all my might. I hit the door as hard as I can. It starts crumbling. I take another hit and the door collapses. I look inside, there is no one. \u201cUgh! I can\u2019t believe Deep left me all alone\u201d I start heading back to the car and thinking that I would have to frive to Delhi all by myself when something caught my idea at the corner of the room. It was a shotgun. I decide to investigate it. Looks in good condition. A bit heavy than that what it seems in video games but it will do. I also spot some ammunition and dump all that in my car. My new friend, the shotgun is sitting in the front seat with me now. It had started getting dark. I glance at my watch. 1900 hours. I decide to stay over at Chandigarh today and head for Delhi tommorow the first thing in the morning. I eat some chips, scroll my phone untill I finally decide to sleep. It was probably the longest night of my life. I wake up at dawn. I remember how I used to wake up early to study before examsas. \u201cAhh, those were the days...\u201d I see my phone. 4:08 am I look outside, still hoping to see someone but all I see are some birds fighting over food. I decide to start the journey to my penultimate destination. I get on the highway and spot a grocery store. I pick up some food. The electricity, surprisingly was still running. I immediately charge up my electronic devices. Something weird happens. A car stopped on the highway as soon as I was about to leave. A person gets out, wait...It\u2019s not a person...  ~Kayvour ",

You always entered the class room carrying an umbrella with you. On a fortunate day you came to me and asked \u2018do you have an extra pen, I have lost mine\u2019. The day which brought me a friend for life -at least I thought so. We started sharing bench, then food, then all our secrets and in no time we became best friends. We were always there for each other. We laughed together, bunked our classes together, got punished together. Whenever I cried I have seen you crying with me. You were the only solution to all my problems. You were my everything. Then one day you just left without saying anything to me, to your best friend .I read your suicide note next day in newspaper. Do you have any idea how I felt. I never knew you had so much hidden inside you, I thought I know in and out of you. But I was wrong. You lied to me. Everyone started asking me \u2013why Swati committed suicide? And I was not having anything for them. Two days after the incident I found your last note for me in my bag it says- Never change yourself for anybody, always be the way you are. You are the only best thing ever happened to me. I have to leave. Sorry. BFF Swati And then I cried, but this time I was crying alone, you were not there. I realised you left me forever. I have lost you, I have lost my everything. I need you and I miss you. Some nights I can\u2019t sleep because my mind is consumed with the thought of how much difficult your life was and what made you do this. And how I am sorry I couldn\u2019t help you. ",

            "answer_text": " \u201cI never thought I would see you again.\u201d Samar spoke in his mind while looking at Sana his ex girlfriend at the restaurant. She was with her new found love holding hand in hand. Seeing Samar staring at her with a deep grief on his face, Sana acted more goofy, getting more closer to her new boyfriend. Samar was standing there staring for few seconds but soon he realised her worth in his life. \u201cShe is dead for you Samar, move on man.\u201d His mind spoke firmly. He finally walked off and sat on a table alone remembering all those happy days with his past love Sana. He controlled his anger, faught his tears and smiled seeing Sana happy with her new found love. Suddenly, a sweet voice came from behind echoing in Samar's ears like someone pore honey into it. \u201cExcuse me, can I sit here as there is no other place left to sit around.\u201d A girl spoke in a sweet, polite tone. Seeing her standing with a tray in her hand, Samar lost instantly in her mesmerising charm. He nodded his head and she sat in front of him wearing a bright white t-shirt with a tiny mole near her lips which made her beauty compare to those shining distant stars. Both looked at each other like they have met before. She smiled and greated him while Samar also wore a slight pleasent smile on his face. \u201cLife isn't that bad it seems.\u201d Spoke Samer in his mind seeing this new girl sitting in front of him who rejuvinated his notion of love once again. Yes, life gives a chance again, hence remember whatever happens, happens for the best. ",

As I always wanted to write about something, but writting was so difficult for me. In middle School, i never focused on such thing and that same happened in the high school too. And yet, here I am, trying to be better at writing. How ironic. I had such a hard time writing that I majored it in during my CAT journey. I felt that if it couldn't help me, nothing could. I still continued to struggle to write even basic pieces. THE EXACT REASON FOR MY WRITING STRUGGLES. Here was the problem: I would spend most of my writing time not writing. I would stare at the page, lost in thought, Trying to come up with perfect sentences before I wrote them down. And if I couldn't come up with those perfect sentences in my head, I would skip off to scroll FB. This is still true, by the way, I often still struggle to write even a few hundreds word a day which I'm not familiar with it takes me far too long to write anything. I sometimes make it my goal to simply write 100 words per hour. That means to finish a 500 words article, might take me as long as 5 hours. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cI never thought I would agree for an arranged marriage, but I had to\u201d Siri\u2019s loathing of arranged marriage was palpable. Siri had been dreaming about love marriage, thanks to the inspiration from her favourite movie Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, but those dreams were shattered by her parents\u2019 You-know-nothing mindset. Bharat Matrimony app\u2019s notification flashed on Siri\u2019s father\u2019s mobile screen. \u201cMatches suitable to your requirement\u201d said the notification. He opened the app and went through all the matches suggested by the app. His wife was also helping him in selecting her to-be-son-in-law. They would see the profile picture first, next they would scroll down the details and at last they would see the score of his details to their requirement. It seemed to Siri the entire process as an election for MLA seat, where Election commission was Bharat Matrimony, Candidates were the persons registered in Matrimony site, the voters were Siri\u2019s parents and finally, Siri was the Seat. It also appeared to her that entire process was similar to shopping in Amazon, where we look at the picture of the product first, next we scroll down to features and at last we see the rating of the product. However there are two differences, one, in Matrimony you don\u2019t have reviews as appear in Amazon and product will not be delivered to you, you have to go the product. Finally, they liked one profile as it was almost satisfied all their requirements i.e. Job, height, food habits, horoscope etc. They dialled the number given in that profile and put forth marriage proposal. Siri kept open slightly her room door to eavesdrop the conversation. After cutting the call, they called Siri and informed about the guy in that profile. They showed her the profile picture. Not bad not good she thought. \u201cMeet him in person. Spend some time with him. If you say ok, then only we will proceed further\u201d Siri\u2019s father words echoed in the small dining room. You didn\u2019t allow me to love anyone as you said it clearly before joining in college. You ruined my dream. Now, you are asking me to betroth the guy of your choice. You are asking me to meet him, spend some time with him and tell my opinion. How can I tell my opinion on a guy in one day? 40 years life dad, how I can decide in such short span of time She wanted to shriek out the words but she only managed to mutter out \u201cOk, papa\u201d. She was waiting in a shopping mall for her to- be-affianced. His name was Sravan. She was looking at the picture in phone and looking at the people coming into Caf\u00e9 Coffee day continuously. Sravan was in black blazer, black pant in profile picture. She was imagining how he would show up today as today might be his biggest day. \u201cIn ground floor. Two minutes\u201d a message flashed on her screen. Her adrenaline was shooting up. She was looking at the door unblinkingly. Door was opened by a somewhat familiar person and came towards her and sat before her. He wore a black short and white t-shirt, hair was dishevelled. She was perplexed. \u201cHello\u201d Sravan greeted in a formal tone. \u201dHe\u2026ll\u2026ooo\u201d greeted back Siri. She thought he would come in a nice dress but what he wore now shocked her. \u201cHave you ordered anything?\u201d Sravan took the menu card. \u201cNnnnnnooooo\u201d Siri was still in baffled state. \u201cWhat do you want Siri?\u201d Sravan looked at Siri, who was looking at the phone and scrolling left and right continuously. She looked up and said \u201cVanilla Cappuccino\u201d. He again went back to menu. She was looking at him and looking at the pictures continuously. \u201cOne classic cappuccino and one Vanilla Cappuccino\u201d He ordered. He kept menu away and looked at her and she turned her sight away immediately. \u201cDon\u2019t be confused between my profile picture in Matrimony app and my appearance now. This is original me. I wanted to be truth and honest to my would-be. This is my 6th meeting. I appeared only like this in last 5 meetings. Some liked me and some didn\u2019t. The Sravan in that picture is after wearing a nice dress, after combing hair neatly, after applying filters in Photoshop. That pic was artificial and I am real. I told my dad to remove the picture but he didn\u2019t. I like being natural.\u201d a detailed explanation from Sravan brought Siri to normalcy. \u201cThat\u2019s great\u201d she said after a long deep thought. \u201cAm I looking good or bad in person when compared to me in profile picture?\u201d Sravan asked her with a smile on his face. \u201cNaturals are always look good than artificials\u201d She replied him with a warm smile on her face. A round dimple was formed. Beverages were served. For the next one hour, they talked about their jobs, families and future plans. Sravan felt bored of that topics. \u201cI am bored of these topics. Shall we change the topic?\u201d Sravan frowned. \u201cHmm. Yes. Ok, tell me do you have any past?\u201d Siri asked her most interesting question as she loved love stories. \u201cNo\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cNo\u201d \u201cNot even girlfriends?\u201d \u201cNo\u201d Who on earth doesn\u2019t have past now a days. Now only you told that you would be honest to your would-be. I fear you are not She wanted to tell him on his face but couldn\u2019t. \u201cMy philosophy is very simple Siri. At the end of the day, I have to marry only one girl. If I love anyone, there will be no guarantee that I would end up in marrying her, particularly now a days where break-up ratio is more than love marriage ratio. I talk more with my sisters. They are my best friends. I talk with girls in my office as it is necessary to do my work. I have my best male friends, with whom I go to movies, shopping, tours and everywhere. I wanted my wife should be my lover, best friend and everything. That\u2019s why I am single\u201d again another detailed explanation from Sravan clarified her doubt in mind. Sravan got a call when Siri had decided to ask another question. It was from ICICI bank customer care, pestering Sravan to take a home loan. \u201cSorry Mam, I don\u2019t have the requirement as of now. I will be getting married in another six months. After marriage, if I require home loan, I will definitely approach your bank. Thank you for letting know me the offer. Have a good day. Bye\u201d Sravan politely finished the call. \u201cIf they are pestering like that, why don\u2019t you cut the call on their face?\u201d Siri shot another question. \u201cIt\u2019s their Job Siri. They have to do it like that only. They have targets to accomplish, otherwise, they will get scolding and less hike. One of my sisters was working in a call center temporarily two years back. One day, one customer was insolent to her when she tried to convince him. He cut the call on her face. On that day, she called me and cried and sobbed for almost thirty minutes. It\u2019s not their personal nature, their job made them to pester like that. From that day onwards, I started to be polite with them just like I was few minutes before\u201d another detailed explanation from Sravan made Siri understand him as a mature guy. \u201cDo you\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. drink?\u201d Siri asked him hesitantly. \u201cNo. But I will after marriage\u201d Sravan said immediately. Siri was shocked and it was palpable on her face. Sravan smiled and continued \u201cOne of my dreams is to drink a beer on first night along with my wife. Another dream is to help my wife in cooking. There is no meaning in sitting in a hall and watching movie when my beautiful wife is preparing food in kitchen\u201d Smile appeared on Siri\u2019s face and Siri started liking him. \u201cI have been asking questions continuously from beginning. Don\u2019t you have any questions for me?\u201d Siri moved back in chair and sat straight as if she was sitting before interviewers. \u201cNo\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI believe my gut feeling. It is saying you are made for me and we will make a good pair. And, my gut feeling has never proven me wrong till today\u201d \u201cHow does your gut feeling come to this conclusion?\u201d \u201cVery simple. The primary logic is your qualities and mine are perfectly matched in Matrimony site. Another one is you are the only one who sat for more time than the previous ones\u201d She started liking him. \u201cIf we get married, you should bear my questioning attitude\u201d Siri told cutely. \u201cThere it is, third one\u201d Sravan smiled wholeheartedly and continued \u201cof course. I will happily bear. After all, you are a journalist and I am a psychiatrist\u201d  Thank you for reading Vema reddy G ",

It was dark so I couldn\u2019t see very well. I squinted my eyes and\u2026 Saw a Girl\u2026.. Lying on the other side of the road\u2026..I could hardly see what was going on. There was a boy on his knees right next to her, shaking her vigorously asking her to wake up. I could see the diluted blood everywhere\u2026. Seeping its way across the road. I thought I should help\u2026 Ran towards them screaming, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong\u201d. The boy ignored me Trying to calm him down, Looked at him sympathetically\u2026.. I was shocked to see that it was my brother\u2026 My own flesh and blood. Chotu? I thought. Confused and Horrified.. I looked down at the girl lying dead\u2026.. It was ME.

His hypothetical alter ego interrupted this thought of his; he spoke to snap him out saying, \u201c Enough appreciation for the self. We\u2019re discussing something serious here.\u201d He got the jolts and came back into the conversation saying, \u201c Yes, you\u2019re right. What were you saying? Can you please come again? \u201d His alter ego let a heavy sigh of exasperation and replied in a cold dispassionate tone, \u201c I said you think you\u2019re never good enough to do something; but what you don\u2019t realize is that, you prove that by thinking you\u2019re not good enough and subsequently avoiding action, you\u2019re in fact great at thinking and implementing the thought that you\u2019re not good enough every single time! which means you\u2019re good enough to implement your thoughts, so then why are you consciously not indulging in the act of thinking that you\u2019re good enough and act accordingly?\u201d Now, after having heard that from his alter ego with a penetrating stare and in an emotionless tone, he was convinced that he needed to think why he always curbs his instinct to \u201cTHINK\u201d about which he\u2019d never thought before. So, he again prompted himself to think why was it exactly that he never thought about \u201cThinking\u201d seriously? His alter ego was now convinced that he had planted the right seed in it\u2019s subject\u2019s mind and that he\u2019ll now ruminate over it and eventually get to an answer so he gradually faded away as his subject continued to ponder on the question raised in his mind\u2026 ",

Your body trembled a little bit, you were scared. I was confused too. You weren't expected to come, your friend was! So why were you here? It wasn't time or place for you to be here, you weren't supposed to see me or anyone here. Your friend was. You looked at me, you saw me before, but, I don't think you remember me. You were young when I saved you, so young that you barely knew how to talk. That was when you met me for the first time, but I knew you before that, I knew you since you were born. I mean, I was assigned to look out for you and your future, to guide you through dark and give you hope. But still, I didn't want to see you here, I wasn't even expecting you! Your friend was supposed to be here, in front of the gates with me. But I had to tell you where we were and who I was. It's better if I tell you, your guardian angel. ",

Today? \u201c Adi\u2019s voice echoed shock. \u201cNOTHING\u201d Shreya could not stand Adi beyond that and she disconnected the call. Adi and Shreya study in same college in same department. With the lesser strength of class, it was not a wonder to know each other soon. They seldom texted each other. But a boring day with a boring presentation, created incident for Adi and Shreya text each other. It never took time for both of them to share common interests from movies to books. Soon, texting each other and briefing of daily happenings became an everyday task. Shreya felt herself getting possessive of his friends spending time with Adi. Few misunderstandings started cropping in. Adi could also not comprehend the change in behaviour of Shreya. Adi tried to talk to Shreya but in vain. Shreya convinced herself that she is needlessly worried about Adi\u2019s friends and Adi cares her more than them. But Adi never expressed his feelings for her. It was an unusual day when Adi told Shreya that he wants to treat her for lunch. Shreya couldnt turn down his call and accepted his offer. Shreya least expected him to present her earrings and confess her he loves her more than she loves him! Shreya couldnt believe she is in reality and nodded her head. Shreya\u2019s mobile screen flashed Adi\u2019s name. Shreya looked at her mobile and hesitated to pick his call. She couldnt forgive him. But her anger subsided after few rings from Adi. \u201cTell, I m busy\u201d, Shreya burst out. \u201c Shreyaaa, its difficult to remember all days\u201d, Adi said worriedly. \u201cI never thought you would forget, the day we texted each other.. Dont talk to me\u201d, Shreya reacted playfully.Adi cluelessly agreed and cut the call after 2 hours. ! ",

She was at the reception of a reputed Hospital in Delhi. \u201cI must get away from here,as soon as possible.Jagath sir will just have to excuse me for this time.\u201d She just made a move,when she heard that voice,his voice,calling her. \u201cMeethi Sharma?\u201d \u201cShit yaar!\u201d.She turned,with a nervous smile plastered on her face. \u201cHere he is.All the same\u201d, she thought, when she saw the 6-feet tall ,mouth-wateringly handsome figure walking towards her. \u201cIs this the Meethi Sharma I know?From St.Xaviers?Oh my god!\u201d \u201cAs if he doesn't know me\u201d, she thought. \u201cNo Mr. I am her doppelganger.Duhh!What the hell are you doing here?\u201d \u201cWow. So rude. It is something personal. Any complaints,Ma'am? Meethi chose to stay shut.She knew that this guy, Karan, once hers, was capable of stealing her heart once more. \u201cYou are still the same, Meethi.\u201d \u201cI am not. I've already said that.Everything is\u2026fine. I'm fine.\u201d \u201cWho are you kidding? What do you want to prove, Meethi? That you are happy without me? That you currently have a boyfriend? Then I'm sorry to burst your bubble,sweetheart, I don't believe in any of that bullshit. You are the same Meethi with whom I shared a special bond. We were the ones who read The fault in our stars together, and we were the ones who discovered a new universe in each other\u2019 s eyes. We were the ones who stole glances in class, and imagined a new life of stars and fireflies. Why did it have to end, Meethi? Why did you go leaving me alone? You owe me an explanation. Meethi couldn't be more desperate. He didn't know how she wanted to run into his arms and sob. He didn't know what she was going through. \u201cI can't.\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy? Damn it!Why can't you just say it?\u201d \u201cBecause I have uterine cancer!I'm a cancer patient, Karan, and I didn't want to be a grenade. \u201d Meethi looked up. Karan\u2019s eyes met hers.Her eyes fluttered down. Nothing is ever gonna be the same again.She has lost him again. She is a grenade. \u201cYou're not. You're not a grenade, Meethi. You will never be. My heart was, is and will be with you. It is an honour to fall in love with you, Meethi Sharma.Will you be mine again? Meethi\u2019s eyes overflowed, this time, with joy. But she pouted, and shook her head in denial.Karan looked flabbergasted. \u201cFirst, buy me an ice cream, na. The tender coconut one. Missed it more than I missed you.\u201d \u201cAahan?\u201dhe challenged. She blushed. She was right. Nothing is ever gonna be the same again. Everything is gonna change. For good, this time.

Please don\u2019t ruin our beautiful friendship.\u201d Aman replied. \u201cI am sorry Aman! But it\u2019s over. You already know that I am commited to Raj, then how could you do this? I am really sorry.\u201d Divya said. \u201cAre you going? Thank you so much.\u201d Aman replied (tears in his eyes) \u201cAre you crying?\u201d Divya asked. \u201cNo! I am not, I just want to say that just keep smiling. Your smile is one of the cutest thing I have ever seen.\u201d Aman replied. And Divya left him without any good bye. On a next moment Aman opened his mobile phone. His tears making mobile's screen wet. \u201cYou are my best friend, never dare to leave me.\u201d \u201cI will kill you, if you tried to ignore me again.\u201d Aman typed last message. \u201cWhat was my mistake?\u201d And he deleted her chat and blocked her. Don\u2019t fall in love with your best friend. You lose two persons in one moment. Keep smiling :) ",

Two minutes later, in a strict tone, Raj said, \u201cCry as much as you want,\u201d Meera felt surprised when she heard those rude words from Raj. For a moment, she paused and looked at her husband Raj. All suddenly, Raj turned his angry face into a happy face, took a hold of Meera\u2019s hand and added, \u201cBecause, after tonight, I won\u2019t let you cry, ever!\u201d Those words delivered a smile to Meera\u2019s face and she hugged her hubby. The eighth vow of marriage was taken after the vidai ceremony. ",

I didn't escape those terrorists to hear this. Ma! You are the inspiration that kept me going , this much that I forgot to look back because my country needed me on the front.\u201d Vinay could only say this. \u201cBeing a soldier is not simple, and being the mother of a soldier is very tough. It's not only the soldier that sacrifices, it's the family too who has to sacrifice a lot too. Living with the fear that any moment can bring the news of his son's martyrdom is not a simple task either.\u201d Kaaya Devi almost sobbed. \u201cPromise me something ma..\u201d \u201cWhat..?\u201d \u201cIf something happens to me in the battlefield, you will encourage little Rohan to serve the nation too.\u201d \u201cDon't speak like this son!, My son is very brave, it will require more than just a bullet to kill my son, it will require the barbarity of Satan to kill a soldier. I still have faith in humanity.\u201d \u201cSay yes or No Ma!\u201d \u201cYou have just come from duty, and you are talking these silly things. Let me get something for you to eat. You must be hungry. It's been long since I fed my son.\u201d \u201cI was on a mission Ma! A mission to save my innocent brothers in Kashmir from getting brainwashed, and those who are brainwashed to get them back home. They\u200b have this misconception that they are fighting for a cause, my mission is to make them realize that the only cause they should have is the nation, and their selfish bosses are just using them. Nothing else . Now promise me you will let my younger brother Rohan join the army after me.\u201d \u201cYour clock keeps on ticking at the same place. Ohk! Baba, I promise I will encourage Rohan too. No one will be more prouder than me when both of my sons will be in Army.\u201d She said with a big smile. \u201cThat's like my mother\u201d Vinay hugged her. \u201cNow I'm very hungry, go get me something to eat.\u201d She happily entered the kitchen, when her mobile phone rang. \u201cHello! Is this the home of Captain Vinay Kaushik?\u201d The voice on the other side asked. \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cMa'am with a heavy heart we inform you that Mr. Vinay Kaushik is no more . His body was found near Forests in Kupwara in a mutilated condition. The terrorists tortured him to death.\u201d \u201cWhat rubbish you are talking? He is at his home. Wait let me give the phone to him. Vinay beta!!! Look , someone wants to talk to you.\u201d She stormed out of the Kitchen only to find him gone\u2026 ...\u2026. That's it. It's my first time writing a story. Dedicated to all the soldiers and\u200b their families behind. Follow Smriti for more. Till then Happy Reading. ",

I never thought that I would see my angel in death pain due chemos over chemos. I never thought that I would see her losing her hair due to injections and radiotherapy. I never thought that we would see her in intensive care unit. I never imagined that my mother had so much of will power to fight the deadly disease called cancer. She was indeed a warrior who fought death with only love for us. Can someone take so much of pain ? Yes, mother's can. Anybody can fight cancer and be a survivor, all that we need is a will power and support. As my father was my mom's back bone. I hope and pray every cancer patient has a support. And our team will support you. If my mother can fight, you all can fight. Let's live our life as survivors, as warriors.\u201d Her speech ended in a \u201cFighting against cancer camping\u201d as the crowd cheered. As her proud mother and father stood in a corner as audience. Listening to their daughter as an oncologist. Cheers :) ",

Why she is not able to accept the fact that he was also no different from the others. Thinking about Prateek , she dozed off.  On the other side, Prateek was fighting up his will to message Sejal. He was thinking.. What he did was not acceptable , but what would he say to her.? Will she allow him to apologize for this behaviour?

            "answer_text": "\u201cI never thought this would happen again\u201d, Layra exclaimed. \"What happen\", asked Arohi (Best Friend) Arohi was alert. What happen again? Why is Layra so tensed. \"I hate love\", Layra screamed \"From last one year, I am listening same\", Arohi said. Layra was madly in love with a best guy but had a break up due to some unforeseen situation. \"What happen now, you have many other proposals pending. Why can't you accept anyone?\", Arohi asked. Arohi knows, Layra needs someone. But Layra don't want to move on or accept any proposal. \"CAN LOVE HAPPEN TWICE?\", Layra asked (surprisingly) \"Yeah. But I don't know why its not happening with you\", Arohi replied. As (one of Arohi's friend) Abhi loves Layra unexceptionally but Layra seems confused. \"I started loving Arnav\", screamed Layra. \"What? Can you repeat it again\", Arohi asked Arohi is shocked as Abhi was doing everything to make Layra happy from last one year & she never fell in love with Abhi. Arnav meets arohi last month & in this one month, Arnav never did something to make her special than why Layra loves Arnav. \"Are you sure?\", Arohi asked again Tears start rolling down from Layra's eyes \"Yes. I love him\", Layra said Arohi questioned herself \"What is love? How someone fell in love just in one month while not with another person in one year.\" Love smiled in corner after listening conversation. \u201cLove happens unexpectedly anytime. It never seeks for anybody's permission nor time bounds love\u201d Finally both understands Blithe!! ",

I was sure that there didn\u2019t exist a thing over which both of them would agree. The differences seemed stark, and their relationship irreconcilable. Would they ever get together? I had lost all hope. But when all seemed frosty, they found faith. It was cold, their equation hard, but then Kelvin walked in with a 233.15 and magic happened. \u2018Minus forty?\u2019, cried Celsius, eyes glittering with anticipation. The words had struck like lightening. With lips trembling, \u2018Eureka!\u2019, cried Fahrenheit. Tears of joy froze before they fell. But, it no longer mattered, their embrace was warm. Both Celsius and Fahrenheit were finally at peace. Kelvin smiled from a distance. ",

Going back to what has happened a month ago, Ram was a 3rd year btech student from a college which is in the outskirts of the city he lives in. He hails from middle class background while his friends are from rich and upper middle class families. The friends gang decided to buy sports bike for each one of them and all of them being rich could afford them. Every member of the gang now has a bike except Ram. Out of peer pressure, he started getting into arguments with his dad every now and then for a bike. But his father refused to buy him a bike not because he dint want to, but he is still paying EMIs for a house which he bought 10 years ago. \u201cAakhir aakhir baap baap hota hai\u201d. After a week long arguments, fights, Ram's father bought him a bike similar to what his friends had. Things were all set and it's been a week since Ram is the owner of his bike and it was celebration time for the gang. They decide to throw themselves a party in a farm house in the outskirts of the city and the celebrations were on. In the middle of the night, they realised they were out of drinks and wanted more. Ram decided to go out and get the drinks from an outlet nearby. He had to rush because the outlet would be close by 11:00 pm and it was already 10:45. He started his bike, after reaching halfway he realized he forgot to get the money. The time which he had was very less, so he started razing towards the place to get the money in the wrong direction. His senses couldn't judge a bus coming from the opposite direction and he hit the bus. He fell unconscious lying in the pool of blood and bike shattered to pieces. He woke up in the hospital bed to see himself with an oxygen mask on and broken leg. After a month long efforts by the doctor he felt better and was discharged from the hospital. His mother hugged him and said, \u201cI never thought I could see you again\u201d. ",

One fine day my brother came home and told me school got completed and I need not go to school. I felt so happy. I thought that I completed my education and need not go to school at all (such a dumb kid I was). I started enjoying holidays like there is no tomorrow. One day when I came home after playing, my mom was talking to a neighbour that school will start again from tomorrow. I got numb for few seconds and my whole world seems to shatter. It took me some more years to understand how dumb I was. :-P ",

I was never happy with my salary. So one day I finally decided to quit my job and do something of my own. Today I am working as a freelancer and earning 80\u201390 k per month. I am not bragging about it. I am just saying we should always do what we love. Hard work always paid off. Getting a freelancing project is not easy but I had decided I will have to get good projects and a respectable amount of money for myself. ",

Everyone seems to be happy and deep inside I was happy too, but here I was standing in a corner with a heavy heart. Suddenly my friend noticed me and tried his best to make me feel better but his efforts had no effect on me, and then I brust into tears. Deep inside I was happy for her, but\u2026. I don't want to let her go, every single memory flashed in front of my eyes. Her eyes was searching for me, and somehow she managed to find my presence. I noticed she had tears in her eyes too.
