            "answer_text": "Yes, but it is unlikely.  Antidepressant drugs have an entire range of effects which can be deadly in some cases, but some of these effects are pretty uncommon or rare while others are common or even very common but not usually leading to death when they occur. Because there are many things to watch out for, it is not as simple as warning about one or two things, and statistics don\u2019t give us an idea of who will or will not encounter such problems. When taken as prescribed, particularly when prescribed and monitored by a high quality professional, some risks of use can be reduced. There are, to note, risks introduced by the drug itself (the active ingredient and everything else) and risks introduced by how drug use is managed. Some risks are unavoidable, and outcomes are always unpredictable. Awareness is important, but one should not become destructively preoccupied with the dangers of drug use.  If you are asking about a one-off dose or very occasional use (whether recreational or therapeutic), the chances of a fatal drug effect are lessened unless you are combining drugs or taking unapproved doses. However, periods of dose and drug changes are more risky and less stable, which can be particularly significant if someone uses multiple consecutive doses or is using antidepressants chronically rather than a few times a year. If you are asking about overdosing as a suicide attempt, SSRIs overdoses do not usually result in death. Literature suggests that less than 20% of escitalopram-involved overdoses end in death, and only a minority of those cases occurred when escitalopram was the only drug being taken. It can be dangerous, painful, and sometimes require emergency medical intervention, but it is not a reliable or comfortable way to try and die. It is not recommendable, and can leave survivors with persistent problems or damages.  Unfortunately, many deaths caused by antidepressants are never reported or tallied as being caused by antidepressants, meaning the information we have on the incidence and likelihood of particular risks is biased and incomplete. Even in the premarketing clinical trials run by drug companies, some antidepressant-caused deaths were obscured in an effort to make drugs such as SSRIs seem safer than the research showed them to be. Irresponsible, inconsistent, and longer term use all involve an increase in the riskiness of taking antidepressants. Taking multiple psychotropic drugs instead of just an antidepressant, using antidepressants without capable and well-educated professional support, and combining antidepressant use with pre-existing medical conditions can also increase the risks involved in taking antidepressants. Especially because some potentially fatal drug effects are very common rather than exceptional or rare, how we respond to those effects can sometimes make a big difference in the outcome. Risk awareness is not just about knowing that things like internal bleeding and seizures are a problem in some cases\u2014risk awareness includes understanding what to do if something starts to go wrong, and preparing for contingencies.  So, there are many ways in which antidepressants can cause fatal effects, yes. The majority of people do not die from using escitalopram or any other prescription antidepressants as prescribed, but serious and potentially fatal effects are always a possibility no matter how careful someone is. The prescribing information packet for escitalopram will list some of the potentially fatal drug effects, but most will not be explicitly stated as causing death for some patients. Being aware of the additional risk factors, and using antidepressants only as an emergency measure or when all safer and more appropriate approaches have been insufficient, can help minimize the number of deaths from antidepressant use. Preventable harms and deaths are a big problem with antidepressants in part because neither doctors nor patients have been taking them seriously enough, and drug companies are not the ones who pay when unethical or illegal behaviors cost lives.  For more background into antidepressants, including certain contexts mentioned above, I recommend these psychiatrist-written guides and a Quora post I made about escitalopram overdoses: Antidepressants: A Guide to Depression Medication Side Effects of Antidepressants Mark Dunn's answer to Are 7 10mg tablets of escitalopram fatal?

            "answer_text": "Of course you can. Technically you can die from anything and, if you start taking large amounts of chemicals of any type, odds of that happening increase dramatically. If the question is, can I kill myself by taking an overdose of this drug, that is not the place to answer that that or give specific information. In terms of risks, barring allergies and the like, the most dangerous one is serotonin syndrome which can in fact lead to death in extreme cases. I\u2019m not a doctor nor am I here to give medical advice but kids, don\u2019t take your medications without consulting a physician and always tell your doctor what other drugs, supplements, OTC and prescription you\u2019re on. Watch out for interactions&be safe. ",
