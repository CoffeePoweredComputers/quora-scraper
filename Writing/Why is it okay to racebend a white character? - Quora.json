            "answer_text": "I believe it's ok when race is totally irrelevant to the character, or when it makes sense when the plot of the movie/book is set in a time and place where the race of the character makes sense. But IMHO, it's not ok when it obeys to the militant obsession of certain groups that push their ideological or political agendas. A notable example of this is the current controversy about the future James Bond. There are people demanding a black James Bond. But it doesn't end there, there are people who want him to be a woman. So why don't we make them all happy and convert James Bond into Jane Bondwalli? Let's make her black or Pakistani, and to avoid riots out there, let's make her lesbian and Muslim. Of course, the script authors would have to go through hoops and jumps to fit this character into a story previously reserved to a bon vivant agent of the secret service with aristocratic roots. I wonder, wouldn't it be better to create \u201cnew\u201d characters from scratch? Let's make them black, gay, transexual, Muslim, etc. Leave James Bond alone! I want him white, arrogant, misogynist, politically incorrect and trigger happy, as usual. And pass me the pop corn! ",
