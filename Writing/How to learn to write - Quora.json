            "answer_text": "Great question. For writing, to best way to improve is to simply write.  Here are a few ideas to help you more easily engage in the writing process: One of my daily practices involves writing early in the morning following my meditation practice. After I\u2019ve meditated for 15\u201320 minutes I grab my iPad and using the DayOne app I write down the thoughts that came to me during the time when my mind was quiet and still. I find that what mostly comes up are feelings of thankfulness and optimism and sets the stage for a better day than had I not chosen to journal. If this is something that has been absent from your life it is something you can start doing as soon as today! Additionally, this routine serves two purposes; it allows you to start the day with a clear head after having expressed yourself and keeps you actively working on your writing skills.Another exercise that can help you become a better writer is to deliberately write in a different tense. In the case of journal writing, you mostly write in first person and either present or past tense; recounting your past experiences or sharing your perspective in the moment. Try describing the events of the day as if it were a story being told about you instead of by you. This will exercise your \u201ccreativity muscle\u201d and assist you to find entertaining ways to tell your story.Read fiction books or short stories that interest you. But, do it with a twist. Read them from the perspective of understanding their format and presentation. Analyze the arc of the storyline. Pay attention to how the author introduces new characters, foreshadowing and plot development. As you do this you will see that there is a distinct pattern that translates to any type of story that you wish to tell. Whether it\u2019s a thought-out blog or Facebook post or a book you\u2019re writing there are clues that show you what you can do to create great work for yourself.Lastly, enjoy yourself! Allow it to be something that you find joyful by creating an environment that makes it easy to write. Allow the ideas to flow from you without care of spelling and punctuation. There is time for editing and it\u2019s not during the creative writing process.I have kept an active journal for most of my adult life. It has been a blessing as it has served as a record of my experiences, my emotions and the ups and downs of life. If you take only one thing from this answer, I hope that it\u2019s to establish a habit of writing in your journal on a daily basis. -BP ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, there's a fallacy in your post. You have taken elementary writing courses, or else you wouldn't be able to write well enough for me to read your post.  I could understand what you wrote, and as someone who has taught college level writing courses, it is a relief for me to read. You are doing better than many of the students I have worked with, including those who are native speakers of English.  What I would suggest is that you begin supplementing your basic skills by reading a lot in English and in Arabic. The reason why I say both languages is because I've discovered that many  students who  read and write well in their native language can also learn to read and write well in English once they learn the grammar and other rules. It's not always true, of course, but I have seen students who made the transition to English easier than those who didn't read and write very well in their own language. It's better if you start out with reading material that interests you and challenges your mind at the same time. As you are reading, notice when you don't understand something, and write questions about that in a notebook, or highlight the sentence or passage with highlighting marker if you own the book. When you get tired of reading, go back to the part that was confusing to you and try looking up the words, or research the subject matter. Then close the book. It works better if you promise to read at the same time everyday. You might be wondering what this has to do with writing. It has everything to do with it. The best writers are copious readers. You can't separate the two skills. The brain processes writing patterns, and recognizes the structures even when you don't consciously know what they are.  Then, practice writing by composing letters to the authors of the books you read. You shouldn't send them; they are for writing practice only. But pretend that you are directly asking the author questions about the book or article. This will help you understand how to organize your thoughts and write them down. When you feel ready,  take a college level beginning writing course at a community college. Be sure to find an instructor that you feel comfortable with, and don't be afraid to drop the course if you don't think you will do well if that teacher's methods. Community college is cheaper than any other classes or workshops. If you can't find any classes that appeal to you, look at some courses through learning extensions, which are operated by universities and probably cost a lot more money.  Or there might be online classes that offer basic college level writing courses. The purpose of taking classes is to get practice with writing for an audience, which means writing so that your readers will understand what you are saying on the page. ",
