Four have recovered the land; Forty gone down together Into the boiling sand. Ring, for the scant salvation!

How they will tell the shipwreck When winter shakes the door, Till the children ask, \u201cBut the forty? Did they come back no more?\u201d Then a silence suffuses the story, And a softness the teller\u2019s eye; And the children no further question, And only the waves reply. ",
