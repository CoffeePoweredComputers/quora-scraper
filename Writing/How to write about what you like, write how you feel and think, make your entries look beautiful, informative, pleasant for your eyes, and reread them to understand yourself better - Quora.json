            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if I can answer the full scope of this question. I can certainly chip away at some of it, though. I started blogging around 2004. I read about bloggers and signed up to Google\u2019s \u2018Blogspot\u2019. Here is that blog, although there is no need to go there to understand my question: gangwon notes. I started the blog, or signed up for it, added a profile pic and so on, and then thought, \u2018what to write about?\u2019 And it took a while. I was living in a foreign country in a region with few English speakers and wanted to share my experiences of the country and of my specific region. I tried to write about South Korean politics. My writing was the opposite of what this question asks for. But in making the attempt I learned first that I didn\u2019t really care about politics - I couldn\u2019t vote in Korea so I wasn\u2019t being apathetic on a relevant subject, I think. And when I wrote about local travel and nature, my writing and design became at least more pleasant for the eyes. In finding subjects to write about I learned that I like writing about those subjects. I mean I knew I enjoyed them but not that I enjoyed writing about them. So that was where I started. As an ESL instructor and university professor I began writing about my research. Wait, that is an exaggeration. I was a university \u2018professor\u2019, granted by courtesy that title but not doing original research. I did teach for-credit classes but it would be pretentious for me to pretend that was my correct title. Still, I did want to be a better instructor and did share my experiences. And so on. When I wrote about a subject a few times, I noticed that each time I did so, I was more informative, knowledgeable and confident. These were my subjects. My writing had value. So in noting what I wrote often about, I wrote more often about those subjects. In writing about subjects that I didn\u2019t care for, my apathy or dislike was more apparent and I moved on. Writing has made me more me, more like Brian. ",
