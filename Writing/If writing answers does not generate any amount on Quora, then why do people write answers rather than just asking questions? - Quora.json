            "answer_text": "It's true,if one receives nothing as remuneration, honourarium, then why do people spend their time and energy and money on recharging phones and charges for accessing internet etc. But once they start to answer the question belonging to the field of their interests,it become their habit. They are addict to the practice. At least, in my case,though I don't receive any money but I find a kind of satisfaction of utilizing leisure in answering the questions, clearing the doubts of the people may be facing genuine difficulties in the subjects. It may be somewhat way of spending free time to the people advanced in age as I have been. There is no price for the favourable things or interest of one. ",
