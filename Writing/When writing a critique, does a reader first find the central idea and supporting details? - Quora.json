            "answer_text": "It depends. There\u2019s no established procedure or format for critique, but if you\u2019re doing a critique for a fiction writer, their expectations will be different from those of a non-fiction writer. In either case, different writers have different expectations, so it\u2019s best to ask them what they\u2019re looking for in your critique. If you\u2019re taking it upon yourself to critique work for some purpose\u2014a review blog or \u201cresponse\u201d to a work, for example\u2014then all bets are off, and you can choose what you want to focus on. Most works\u2014fiction or not\u2014will have some central idea and supporting details, but it\u2019s not essential to find them first, or to even focus on them in a review, unless that\u2019s what you want to do or what others expect of you.
