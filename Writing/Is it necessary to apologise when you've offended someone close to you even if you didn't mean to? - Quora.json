            "answer_text": "I believe it is, if you intend to salvage the relationship. This happened with my little sister over the last few years. Even though i apoligized and asked what it was she refuses to forgive me or tell me specifics and her husband has told me i am Toxic and am poisoning their family. I am never around them. I only talked to her via text which she misinterpereted several times. I am not allowed to see my niece or nephew and even though she says my husband and daughter can see them she never presents opportunities for that to happen. Its very disturbing because of the bond we had no less than 5 or 6 years ago before she had children. Even if you apologize for whatever it is, don't count on a reconciliation. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. An apology isn\u2019t an admission of intentional wrongdoing. It\u2019s an acknowledgement that something you did hurt someone. If you\u2019re walking by the pool and you accidentally bump into someone, causing them to fall in, would you seriously think you need do nothing because it wasn\u2019t intentional? If you were pushed into a pool by a stranger, whether or not it was accidental, I suspect you\u2019d want an apology. In fact, not apologizing makes it look like you did it on purpose and are therefore not sorry. ",

But as soon as we connected the next day, I gave her the Three Sorries\u2026.this is what I did, I shouldn't have done this, I'll never do that to you again. She said she didn't know what I was talking about!!! I think she was being kind\u2026. ",
