            "answer_text": "I think this goes back to Roman times. When Lucretius wanted to write about atomic theory (and a few other topics), he called his work \u201cDe Rerum Natura.\u201d That is, \u201cOn the Nature of Things.\u201d Or, if that\u2019s not clear enough, you could translate it verbosely as \u201cSome stuff about the nature of things.\u201d That title leaves open the possibility that other writers could come along and write some different stuff about the nature of things. When Copernicus wrote his great book about the solar system, he called it De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres). Francis Bacon\u2019s essays have names like \u201cOn Truth\u201d and \u201cOn Death,\u201d so the tradition extended into the English language. I think it was entirely natural for Darwin to name his book \u201cOn the Origin of Species.\u201d He had about two thousand years of tradition to follow. Interestingly, however, he didn\u2019t follow the same tradition in \u201cThe Descent of Man,\u201d \u201cThe Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals,\u201d or \u201cThe Power of Movement of Plants.\u201d ",
