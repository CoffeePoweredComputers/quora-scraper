            "answer_text": "Assuming you are talking about academic degrees, you should use the indefinite article except in cases where someone holds a unique position. In other words: John is a professor of anthropology (one among many)A doctor at Clemson developed a new testing device (identity unspecified)Mary is the lecturer in subatomic physics at Pembroke College, Oxford (she is the only lecturer in that field at that college)Anouk is the Willsforth Professor of Ethics (a reference to specific position or endowed chair)This is true of any title, and the normal rule for definite and indefinite articles. If you are talking about something singular and specific use the definite article (the president of the United States); if you are talking about something plural and ambiguous use the indefinite article (a president of a nation).

Usage of \u201cdegrees\u201d with \u2018the\u2019: The faculty of Science decided to confer the degrees on meritorious students only. Usage of degrees with \u2018a\u2019 + determiner: He shifted his pencil to the right by a few degrees. Hope these help. ",
