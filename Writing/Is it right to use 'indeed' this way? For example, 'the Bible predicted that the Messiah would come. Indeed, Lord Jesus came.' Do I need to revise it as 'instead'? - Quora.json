With \u201cindeed\u201d the statement is an affirmation that Jesus came and was the Messiah. With \u201cinstead\u201d it means that Jesus came but was not the Messiah. ",

In order for your example to mean what you want it to mean, you must use \u2018indeed\u2019. If you say \u2018instead\u2019, you are saying that \u2018IN PLACE OF the messiah, Jesus came\u2019 and you would therefore be saying that Jesus was NOT \u2018the messiah\u2019, but that Jesus came INSTEAD - in the place of - the messiah. I don\u2019t think that is what you intend to say. ",
