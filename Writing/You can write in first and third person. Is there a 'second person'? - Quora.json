Jemesin, author of the Broken Earth trilogy (image sources [1] [2]) In the first book of the trilogy, The Fifth Season, the author uses all three points of view \u2014 first, third, and second \u2014 as a way to keep three different story-lines separate. There is also a nice twist to that, which I will not spoil. So \u2014 yes \u2014 it is indeed possible to write from a second person perspective too. It is unusual, and hard to pull off.

Once again, the biggest indicator of the second person is the use of second-person pronouns: you, your, yours, yourself, yourselves. You can wait in here and make yourself at home. Writing in the second person requires use of the pronouns you, your, and yours. This point of view is used to address the audience in technical writing, advertising, songs and speeches. ",
