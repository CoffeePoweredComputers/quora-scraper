            "answer_text": "During this summer, I got very into journaling. A few things I\u2019ve learned: \u2192 Get supplies you like to use If you have a nice journal and pens that write nicely, you\u2019ll be more motivated to write in your journal. This is something I\u2019ve found to be worth investing a little bit in.  \u2192 Don\u2019t compare your way of journaling to any others A journal is a pretty personal thing. However you do it is the best way, I promise. Don\u2019t doubt or second guess yourself because it\u2019s not the way other people may do it. \u2192 Figure out why you\u2019re writing a journal Do you want to record what\u2019s going on in now life so you can look back and compare 20 years into the future? Do you want an outlet for your thoughts and dreams? Figuring out what you want to do with your journal will help it be closer to what you\u2019re looking for it to be. \u2192 Find inspiration online If you\u2019re looking for ways to make your journal fancier, Pinterest is your best friend. There are plenty of ideas out there, and one might be just what you had in mine.  \u2192 Enjoy it! Everyone does journaling a little differently. If you don\u2019t like writing long entries, don\u2019t! If you feel like doing it differently some days, do that. If you want to number your pages, do that.  Color coding? Go for it! Fancy markers? Absolutely. Plain old words on paper? Fantastic. Hopefully this was helpful! :) ",
