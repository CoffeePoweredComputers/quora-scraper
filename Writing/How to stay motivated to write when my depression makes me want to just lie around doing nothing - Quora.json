            "answer_text": "Thank you for your A2A\u2026 How do I say motivated to write when my depression makes me want to just lie around doing nothing? OMG, I can so relate to your problem! I lived for years who so much depression that I tried to end my life several times. Today I am depression-free. I really believe that journaling saved my life. First I would like to point out that when you are depressed you are almost completely incapable of doing anything. Even breathing is a chore. People would come around and try and cheer me up by acting all happy and positive. Ugh, it makes you want to shoot them, figuratively speaking of course. I hated comments like, \u201cYou need to get out and get some fresh air and visit friends.\u201d Like I really wanted to be with others! The LAST thing we ever want to do is drag others down into our hell. So we often try to stuff it in and smile. Acting like everything is fine. This takes a lot of work! I love this photo. It described me to a tee.  This is exactly what you face with journaling. Originally I started journaling as a way to document how I was feeling and what was going on in my life. I was always kind of picky as to writing stuff that made sense. I guess I was thinking that one day someone would read my journal, so it had to be somewhat well written. I think I spent my whole life trying to keep up appearances. I had to look like I had it all together, but inside I was a total mess. So even writing my thoughts in my journal was hard because I was trying to be honest with myself but at the same time, I didn\u2019t want anyone to know how screwed up I really was. I do want to point out that the source of my depression was because I was struggling with a gender identity conflict. I didn\u2019t realize it at the time. Eventually, it led me to realize that I was born transgender. Journaling helps me to get the courage I needed to transition and be myself. About a month after I started journaling I realize that people might take what I write wrong so I went back to the beginning and wrote a warning. Warning: The thoughts expressed here are only here to help me understand myself. If I write anything that seems hurtful to others I am very sorry. If for some reason, I don\u2019t survive I want to let everyone know that it was not them. The problem was entirely me. My struggles and fears finally got the best of me. When you are depressed really bad, it\u2019s IMPOSSIBLE to be creative! I found just by going back through my journal that a lot of the stuff I wrote was junk. In fact, if it wasn\u2019t for the spell checker, people would think it was written in a different l language. I would just write, \u201cI really feel like SHIT today! Why can\u2019t I get it together?\u201d Yes, stuff like that. A lot of stuff like that. Basically, I didn\u2019t try and make any sense out of what I was writing. I was just writing what came to my head. If I changed thoughts I just wrote the new ones. I don\u2019t think half the time I even went back to read them. I was just trying to get them out of my head and on paper. Here is an example of what I wrote on 2/28/2017. Becky drug me out to see her father tonight. He offered to make a drink but I really felt way to low already and knew alcohol would just make me more depressed. If that was even possible. He made dinner for us but I couldn\u2019t eat, I just wanted to get out of there and go home. God, just being around them makes me feel like shit. I honestly don\u2019t know how much longer I can go on this way. The more I try to please Becky and her family to worse I feel. I don\u2019t think I can describe it better than I just fell like crap! I just find myself constantly praying for sleep. It seems sleep is the only way I can find peace from my depression. I am always so tired but I just lay in bed staring at the ceiling. I can\u2019t silence the thoughts in my head. So I decided to write some out. I got another panic attack today. God they suck! I don\u2019t have a reason to be unhappy, but I am\u2026..Why? My problem is I am so damn dense. This is probably why I never realized why my brain was in opposition to my body. I hate myself. I spent my whole life trying to adapt, by either resisting or appeasing my thoughts instead of fixing the problem. I was so short-sighted I couldn\u2019t see the solution. Maybe I was just lazy and didn\u2019t think that a physical change would have solved the problem because I wasn\u2019t really aware of what caused the problem in the first place. Maybe I felt that I was not strong or capable enough to make the change on the outside and was totally afraid. I think the latter was the real answer because I lived in denial. I avoided the first solution because I was afraid of having to deal with the second. It is like trying to break into a house by digging a hole underground, shoring up the tunnel and coming through the floor, when all I had to do was open the front door and walk-in. God, I feel so stupid sometimes. I really believe is it important to write everything that comes to your mind. No matter how crazy it seems. Healing comes from getting it out of your head! Once it\u2019s out you can try and make sense of it later. Sometimes you can\u2019t but it really doesn\u2019t matter. Just get it out and don\u2019t be afraid of what others might think about what you write. If you use a computer password lock it. That will help a bunch in making you feel like it is safe from the eyes of others. I wish you the best. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question. Having suffered from severe depression that led to bulimia, cutting and suicide attempts I feel that writing out your thoughts and feelings is vital. Or just creative writing where you can express yourself through a story. These types of writing really help alleviate the crushing depression. But how to stay motivated? You just write a little at a time, every day that you can. If you\u2019re too depressed to write a lot, try just writing a little. Start with simple topics or stories and work your way up from there. Try writing more days than you don\u2019t. It gets easier with practice. I have been severely depressed for many years. The source of my depression is my gender dysphoria. Being in the wrong body ravaged my mind and soul. It sapped my will to do anything creative or writing-related. So I definitely feel you on your conflict. But if you try to write a little every day, eventually it gets to be second nature, like breathing or blinking. My favorite exercise when I feel particularly depressed is online role-playing. It\u2019s a collaborative storytelling exercise that you can do with others. It combines socializing and writing, two very important avenues for depressed people who wish to express themselves with their words. If you don\u2019t feel like visiting friends in the concrete, your writing buddies are always there, and it can make you feel worlds better. Another type of writing you may wanna try is journaling. You can write your deepest thoughts and feelings, you can write about your day, you can write a silly poem. Anything you want! But the key is to pace yourself and not push too hard to see immediate results. Depression is a killer, literally, and you can\u2019t force the creative process. When I was in jail I wrote on a piece of paper and drew pictures. Drawing can also help motivate you to write. In the margins of the pictures, I would write poems or even a person\u2019s name or the word \u201cLove\u201d and that helped me get through being locked in solitary for weeks at a time. Just keep on trying and don\u2019t give up! Pace yourself, find a style of writing that uplifts your moods rather than downing you, and always remember that your depression isn\u2019t the boss of you. You are the boss of you. You got this. When you\u2019re fighting depression, everything seems hopeless, but don\u2019t despair. You can write about whatever you wanna so you may even write about these feelings of despair and hopelessness keeping you from doing what you wanna do. Anything you want is fair game to write about and your writing is your own world, for your eyes only, or the eyes of others that you choose. Thank you. ",
