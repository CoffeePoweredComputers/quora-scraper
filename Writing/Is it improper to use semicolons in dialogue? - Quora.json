            "answer_text": "I once talked to a guy who spoke in beautifully sculpted parallel clauses. There\u2019s no way you could reproduce that in print without semicolons. - If you list three or more things in series, and one or more of the things includes a comma, then you have to use semicolons. Thus: \u201cWhat kind of sandwiches did I bring? I brought ham; turkey; and bacon, lettuce, and tomato.\u201d That sentence is a natural one; it doesn\u2019t sound stilted or weird; it is perfectly good dialogue; and it requires semicolons to be represented in print. (If I were writing that last sentence as dialogue, I would probably replace the semicolons with periods so as not to offend people who don\u2019t think semicolons are natural. But maybe not, because, you know, screw them.) - As a general rule, you want your written dialogue to evoke the way people actually talk. You don\u2019t want your reader to think, \u201cnobody would actually say that.\u201d So, arguably, you want short sentences, sentence fragments, sentences that trail off, garbled sentences, mistakes and corrections, and frequent interruptions. Which would make for a lousy read. If you\u2019ve ever read a transcript of a conversation, you know how offputting reality is. So the compromise is to keep sentences short\u2014which means you don\u2019t need many semicolons\u2014and to avoid the wall-of-text by interrupting every three lines or so to, say, let another character speak or to do a physical action. - Some people will say that not using semicolons in speech is a rule. Often enough, those people don\u2019t know how to use semicolons anyway. I had a woman tell me once, in a critique group, that she didn\u2019t want to see a semicolon in fiction. Not just in dialogue, but anywhere in fiction. I refrained from telling her that she should keep her affliction to herself. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it\u2019s fine. Subtle changes in tone of voice might suggest two sentences are connected. Written language doesn\u2019t have tone of voice, so we have to translate that into some other communicative device. In this case a semicolon works fine. Always bear in mind that because so much of our communication depends on nonverbal cues like body language, or subtle variations of tone and timing, if you simply transcribe exactly what is said, word for word, you will not be capturing the flavor of the original conversation. The goal of dialogue is *not* simply to produce an accurate transcript of a conversation, but to find a way to capture all that is being communicated. ",
