Check their website for information on how to obtain documents from them. If that information is not available, determine who you need to write to. If that information is not available, telephone them and tell them what you are trying to do and ask to whom you should write. Write the letter stating as clearly as possible what you need without burying them in detail. Be polite without being obsequious and thank them. You may need to enclose an envelope with postage for the documents. Sign letter and mail. If they offer an email address, use that instead of snail mail. ",
