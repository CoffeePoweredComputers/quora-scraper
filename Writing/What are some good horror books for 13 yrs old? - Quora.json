            "answer_text": "Other folks have pointed out some good adult material, Stephen King, Dean Koontz, etc. I\u2019ll mention one of my all-time favs, a sadly overlooked writer today: Christopher Pike. Pike started in the mid-80s and wrote through the 90s (he\u2019s still writing today, but mostly adult fiction). He played second-fiddle to RL Stine, at least in terms of sales. Which is unfortunate, because as much as I like Stine, Pike is a far superior writer. In many ways, Pike\u2019s teen novels foresaw the future YA market: books written in an adult style that didn\u2019t talk down to kids and dealt with legitimate mature themes and situations. There\u2019s plenty of violence, sex, abuse, alcohol, etc. in Pike\u2019s work, as well as heavy concepts like teens dying from cancer and teens dealing with abortion. Now take all that, and throw in the fact that Pike wrote some killer stories. Fast-paced, creepy, inventive, Pike really knew what he was doing. These may be hard to track down today, because they\u2019re mostly out of print (although some of Pike\u2019s trilogies have been re-released in single-volume editions), but here are my favs: The Last Vampire series (re-released as the Thirst series)MonsterRoad to NowhereDie SoftlyChain Letter 1 & 2Master of MurderThe Midnight ClubWhisper of Death",

            "answer_text": "One of the most surprising horror stories for me was Lost Boys by Orson Scott Card (not to be confused with the movie, The Lost Boys). This is a novel that chronicles the relatively unexciting life of a programmer and his small family. The story itself is interesting, but what got me was that when the horror happens you don\u2019t know it. There is no suggestion that anything is out of the ordinary, and it\u2019s only towards the end of the book that you discover it, which completely changes everything you\u2019ve read to that point.
