            "answer_text": "There was an experiment performed, admittedly with college students, where cameras were set up to detect where someone was actually looking without the subjects knowing it. The subjects were supposedly there for a psychological questionnaire. They were greeted and given the questionnaire by an attractive member of the opposite sex who spent a short time with them during which they would turn their head so they couldn\u2019t see the subject. On the questionnaire they asked the subject various personal questions then asked them where they had looked and what they had noticed about the person who had handed them the questionnaire. The men were pretty honest, they looked at her face, bust, butt legs & etc. The women, whether they were in a relationship or not, usually lied even though the whole experiment was anonymous, perhaps without even being aware of it. They said, eyes, hair, hands, smile and they did look at those things, but they also took fleeting looks at the guy\u2019s crotch and butt and when they knew he couldn\u2019t see them they took longer looks. So that\u2019s what college age women do with attractive members of the opposite sex anyway. ",
