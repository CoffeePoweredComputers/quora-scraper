            "answer_text": "You just show them how to walk safely and also show them what it is to fall down the stairs yourself. You mah literally have to go through the motions of both multiple times for your child to understand the cause and effect of it all. Running = Slipping = BooBoos This may be the most simple answer, but yet with my children I found that the simplest answer for the question was the best one for them learning. My oldest had no fear of stairs. She\u2019d run head first toward the top of the landing and I\u2019d literally have to dive bomb to catch her before she ran completely off the top step. She was two at the time. I always carried her up and down the steps. But I also slipped one time when carrying her and made a gasp sound and squeezed her a bit to be certain I wouldn\u2019t lose her if I did fully fall down the steps. I watched for the first time her reaction change from disinterested, to alarmed and extremely focused. She didn\u2019t cry. She simply focused intently on my face. I spoke to her and showed her exactly the step I slipped from and why, I was in a hurry. I showed her how lucky it was I had a good grip of the handrail. Further showing by me holding it and leaning steeply to show her I was holding it tightly. She didn\u2019t speak. She just stared and I could see she was truly focused solely on what we were talking about. After that I started letting her walk up and down the stairs with me. Me holding the rail. Her holding my hand. And we would count our way down. A year later we still do count our way down. 1,2,3,4. One foot down. Second foot down to same step. So both feet hit every step. Not going from step one to step three with left foot and step two to step four with the right foot. Big strides mean being more wobbly. We haven\u2019t had any issue doing it this way in the last year. She hasn\u2019t ever fallen. I just speak to her to step easy and go slow. When for whatever reason she isn\u2019t able to go on the stairs with me I taught her that when we go down we \u201csit on our booty\u201d and scoot down one step at a time keep our feet always on the lower side. When going up she goes up on a side closest to the actual wall where she can put a hand to steady herself and she goes up leaning forward toward the staircase with one hand on wall and one hand on the next step up. Still only going to the third step after both feet are on the second step and so on. And yes I showed her multiple times by me going through it myself. So what if you look silly. Sure it\u2019s a longer way for kids but it\u2019s worked for us and was the only thing I could think of to do, my only other option was I was going to sell the house and buy a single story. I\u2019m not that old (mid 20\u2019s) but having a bad knee myself I\u2019ve taken a tumble down the stairs several times and it\u2019s painful for me. So I know for a toddler it would be even more so. Being so fragile and small not able to necessarily catch themselves mid fall. ",
