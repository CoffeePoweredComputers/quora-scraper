            "answer_text": "Most writers whose interviews I have read recommend writing every day. This isn\u2019t because you might lose a lingering thought, but because it is always good to be persistent with what you are good at; in this case, writing. In my case, I ensure that I write something every day. It could be a diary entry, a poem, or a single-line thought that struck me. I have observed that ideas and inspiration often strike when we slow down in our otherwise busy lives. ",
