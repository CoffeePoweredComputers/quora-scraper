            "answer_text": "The actual writing \u2013 putting pen to paper or fingers to keyboard \u2013 will likely only be a fraction of the total time that it takes to complete a book at a commercially acceptable level (i.e. that\u2019s good enough to publish and sell). What kind of non-fiction are you planning to write? If you are writing about a subject that you are already knowledgeable in, I\u2019d suggest that you start by taking an online course (or study in some other way) to learn about some basic considerations, methods and approaches for distilling your knowledge into a good book. Then apply what you\u2019ve learned and what you already knew in the writing of a first draft. Edit the draft and then give it to an agent, an editor or a friend; basically someone that will give you honest feedback, preferably someone who has also read a lot of books, hopefully someone that is able to give feedback in a manner that gives you something to work with. After that, if this is your first attempt at writing a book, you will likely need to start again at your beginnings (and never breathe a word about your loss ;) \u2013 writing is hard and it takes time to learn how to do it well. If you are already writing at a level that enables you to produce sellable work you likely have a good idea of how long it takes you to produce material of a certain length. Without knowing what kind of book you are intending to write I\u2019ll just throw a ballpark figure out there and suggest that it takes somewhere around 500 hours to write a normal length generic book, including time for research/planning and writing your way from a first draft to a finished manuscript. Most writers will agree that when you write actively you should keep at it every day, and preferably at minimum an hour or two \u2013 or if you have the time until you start to notice signs of fatigue (for me it\u2019s when I need to search for the \u201cright\u201d word longer than a few seconds or so). If you are not able to keep writing at a somewhat constant pace you run the risk of becoming estranged to your work, which will likely lead to it becoming incoherent in one way or another. It\u2019s a bit like working with hot iron I guess, when the material is red hot you need to keep banging away \u2013 it\u2019s not possible to pick up at the exact place you left if the material has cooled down. However \u2013 the cooling down, or the estrangement to your own text, is desirable when the time comes to edit. Therefore another recommendation that most writers will agree upon is to give a draft some time to do just that, to \u201ccool down\u201d. What\u2019s really meant is off course to give yourself some time to clear your head and come back refreshed, see it all with new eyes, when it\u2019s time to start editing. Writing is rewriting. I think that many that have not written much themselves imagine that writing is like a journey from A to B; that you start at the beginning and you write to the end. Usually however, writing is more akin to painting a complex and layered painting. You would start by sketching the most basic lines of your motif. You would then start to fill the sketch with more detail, to begin with in the places that you have a more clear idea about how you want them to look. Then you successively work out the details of other parts of the canvas as well. You\u2019ll notice along the way what works and what doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ll change your mind; edit and correct. With the aid of your sketch you\u2019ll start applying paint, to begin with in broad strokes and by the time you reach the end of the process you might be working with the most miniscule details of the reflection of light in an eye, trying to achieve just the right kind of sparkle that\u2019s needed to convey the message you are aiming for. It\u2019s useful to remember that everyone\u2019s first draft is shit. It should be. It\u2019s just a pencil sketch meant to support you in the creation of the masterpiece to come. Do not judge your writing as you write, you\u2019ll just cramp up and the iron will cool off. When you do judge your writing however (when editing that is) be relentless towards the text, but also be kind to yourself. Everyone\u2019s first draft is shit. Writing is rewriting. ",

            "answer_text": "How long is a piece of string? The answer to this question depends on so many variable factors\u2014the word count, the topic and its complexity, the author\u2019s typing speed, the author\u2019s knowledge level, the amount of research needed, how much time the author has to work on the book, and so on. As a nonfiction book editor, I\u2019d say that no two books and no two authors are the same, so there\u2019s no standard amount of time to write a nonfiction book. I\u2019ve seen some authors take a month while others have taken years. One author had spent the best part of 40 years honing his book, and it was less than 10k! Generally speaking, if you\u2019re planning to write a comprehensive 80k book on a complex subject, you can expect it take far longer than a simple 10k \u201chow-to\u201d e-book. If you can only spend an hour a day writing, then it\u2019ll take longer than if you have solid block of free time to write it. If you have to do stacks of research, it\u2019ll take longer than if you already know all the content. If you want to speed the process up, make sure you have a clear plan and outline before you start writing\u2014and be very clear on the reader\u2019s problems and goals. You might find that dictating the book is quicker than typing, though this can mean spending more time editing later on. To get an idea of how long it\u2019ll take you, set a timer as you write the first chapter, then calculate roughly how long it\u2019ll take you to write the whole book based on that. Good luck on your writing journey! ",
