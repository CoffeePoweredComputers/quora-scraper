            "answer_text": "Fanfiction tends to be the go-to for lazy writers because such lazy writers can just insert a character into an already existing universe. But if you do it right, fanfiction can definitely help teach you the basics of plot structure, character development, and descriptive language. It can help you examine the kinds of concepts used in writing (which ones the original creator used, and which ones you decide to use). To be able to use fanfiction as writing practice, you have to approach it like a writer. If you\u2019re writing fanfiction, please, PLEASE don\u2019t deviate from the canon of whatever world you\u2019re in. Some people think that\u2019s the point of fanfiction, but in my experience it\u2019s never done well. The more implausible it is, the lazier the fanfiction. All the lore has to remain the same. Work within the already-established boundaries, and if you want to go beyond them, provide logical justifications as to why. I stopped reading fanfiction years ago because it\u2019s often rife with implausible ships, self-insert characters, deus ex machina, bad plots, and general bad writing. The thing fanfiction does not do for you is worldbuilding. Worldbuilding can be fun, but it\u2019s difficult to create an entire universe from scratch. You have to do it, though, if you want to write about anything that doesn\u2019t take place in the real world. I\u2019d say the best practice platform for this is role-playing games (table-top or live action). The way to create your own worlds/stories is to read a lot of other people\u2019s stories and throw them all into a melting pot. You\u2019ll get better at it as you go along. Everybody starts out by copying other people\u2019s worlds, stories, and ideas. That\u2019s fine, for a while, but if you want to be a serious writer, at some point you have to make the leap. You\u2019re going to learn a LOT more about how to write by actually writing your own stuff, because original work is much harder and takes much more time. ",

            "answer_text": "When it\u2019s Canon: If your setting is canon (accepted as officialy part of the original story), you will likely focus on the character. At this point, you can choose if you want to write in first person or third person\u2019s perspective. One of them have their advantages and disadvantages. The best thing to do is experiment. When it\u2019s Alternate Universe: Then you\u2019ll learn more about the setting of your story. What, for instance, you want to write about Harry Potter in another world, another fairy tail? In Alternate Universe (AU in short), the setting is yours. It\u2019s your world. But to be fair, the challenge is how to make the readers imagine the same world like you. Write more about AU so if you want to make a novel in fantasy genre, you will gain a helpful lessons by consistently write here. It\u2019s not; In fact, if you find yourself enjoy writing fan fiction, that is the time when fan fiction is no longer improve you. You can solve this problem by challenge yourself. Maybe you always using the same genre. Try another. Make your favourite character dead by drowning. Write a scene you don\u2019t want to happen. Make a list about lovely character on your fandom, and streak the name when you already write a story about their death. Kill them, kill them, kill them. Another way to solve the problem is by stop writing fan fiction. When you get so many reviews said the readers love your story, whatever it is, when you write in Canon or in Alternate Universe, when you write in fluffy-but-cliche high school romance or dark suspense or painfully tragic, you have to stop. And write original story. That\u2019s your start. ",
