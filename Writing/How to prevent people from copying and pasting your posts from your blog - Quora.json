            "answer_text": "After reading previous answers, I can only conclude that the problem of stealing content is very common. Unfortunately, the majority of bloggers are not aware of possible ways of dealing with this issue. First of all, there are two types of content scraping - manual (copy-and-paste) and automative (with the use of special software or parsers). The last one is even more annoying, as your content could be copied a few minutes after its going live. Bloggers know, that it's too risky for your SEO. Sometimes copied content could range better than original, so it leads us to next practical steps that should be taken to prevent content scraping. 1. Define who steals your content If scraping has already happened, you need to know which websites have stolen your content. Possible ways of detecting this: Manual search through search engines. If you use Google, you can use special search operators, or specify the time of results you're interested in (last month, last week, etc.)Plagiarism detection software. Choose plagiarism detection tools, that work online and could provide you with a list of links to websites, that used your blog posts. There are a lot of paid tools on the market, but if you're a newbie blogger on a tight budget, you could use free tools such as Unplag free plagiarism checker or DarkWriterTool (another free plagiarism detector, that works online)If your blog is on Wordpress you can use Trackbacks to understand who is using your content.2. Claim the removal Contact owner of blog, who is stealing your content and ask to remove your content. 3.Other preventive measures Use DMCA protection badge on your blog When people will see this badge, they will understand that you're ready for battle for your content. Disable right click and content selector on your blog - when you'll do this, nobody could copy&paste your blog posts manually. Besides, you could do the same for the source code. ",
