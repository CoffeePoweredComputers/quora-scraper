The computer screen was giving him nothing and the first draft was due in a week. The cursor seemed to mock him as it blinked at the beginning of the first line of his novel. You. Are. Worthless. You. Are. Worthless. You. Are. Worthless. \u201cThis is crazy!\u201d He said out loud to the empty room. \u201cI need coffee.\u201d Furious with himself, he stood up fast and headed for the door. Too late, he discovered he\u2019d hooked his foot in the computer\u2019s power cord. He turned and watched in horror as the entire system came crashing to the floor. After a solid two minutes of cursing and stomping he confirmed that the computer was broken. Wait! His novel would be about a man who wanted to write a novel and then couldn\u2019t because he broke his computer! Ooh, ooh! he thought. I need some paper, a pencil, anything to write this down. He searched the room, but found nothing to write with; not a pen, pencil, crayon, or even chalk! Good God, what am I going to do? Okay, clever opening accomplished. The point is this: make conflict that needs to be resolved. Many writers begin with a beautiful setting, people it with characters, and then make everything fine. Everyone gets along with each other and aren\u2019t people great? Yeah, every publisher has a special file drawer for these stories. It is often round, sits on the floor, and periodically gets emptied into a dumpster. Or they get stuffed back into the SASE to sent back to the writer. The other thing that takes a bit to learn and even figure out what it is: the actions of your characters must be in reaction to either events or other characters. She isn\u2019t spreading marshmallow paste on the chair because it\u2019s fun and she feels like it. She\u2019s spreading marshmallow paste on the chair because her least favorite person in the class is blindfolded and playing a birthday party game. I have discovered why writing is so powerful to humans. It is because words make our world. Without words we are more like a pre-Sullivan Helen Keller. Words literally (heheh) create our world. And because of this, that is all we are, all we have. Disagree? Don\u2019t think that story is all we are? Okie Doke, what have you ever done, said, seen, or ___________ed (fill in the blank) that is NOT part of your story? See? Now to the point of this paragraph: EVERYONE IS THIS WAY. The novel that holds us is about the pursuit of resolution to obstacles. Give your protagonist an intention. Then create a character who presents an obstacle to what your hero desires. Put them together and watch them duke it out. You want your reader (don\u2019t forget them!) to ask, \u201cThen what happened?\u201d Once you have that in place, we (your readers) have to care what happens. Otherwise it\u2019s a big Ho-Hum, move on to the next book. Has she lost her father, her mother? Both? Is his wife a hopeless alcoholic? Something that most people can relate to since it is something we have thought about. Something that falls into the musing hour, like what if my husband dies and I have to raise the kids on my own? We relate to struggles, especially ones we all have to go through. I personally don\u2019t know how I would survive the death of either of my children, so I have a soft spot for characters that have been through anything remotely related to this. A suggestion which I wish I heeded when I started is this: If you have 10 writers in a room, you will probably get 12 different views on how to write. Adopt a habit or workflow that functions for you. It doesn\u2019t matter how successful the advising writer is, if it doesn\u2019t work for you, don\u2019t heed it. In general, listen and weigh all advice and then use what you can and politely don\u2019t use what doesn\u2019t. Put the conflict into your setting and you can stop thinking you have a story. You will know it. Good luck and keep writing. ",
