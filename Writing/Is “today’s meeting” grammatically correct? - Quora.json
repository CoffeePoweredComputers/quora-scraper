(WRONG)  The sentence \u201ctoday\u2019s meeting is postponed\u201d is correct because it expands to \u201cthe meeting of today is postponed.\u201d Use of \u201c[apostrophe] s\u201d is grammatically correct if and only if at least one of the two possible expansions is correct. If both expansions are Incorrect, then the use of \u201c[apostrophe] s\u201d is incorrect. For example, consider the sentence, \u201cThe car\u2019s were going fast.\u201d The two possible expansions of that sentence are: The car is were going fast (WRONG)The were of car going fast (WRONG)The correct spelling is \u201cThe cars were going fast,\u201d without an apostrophe.

            "answer_text": "Yes, that is totally acceptable. I can provide an example in a sentence structure for you: We will discuss about the potential sales in today\u2019s meeting. (Correct)Today\u2019s meeting is a possessive form in the genitive case. It has an implication that the meeting belongs to today.We will discuss about the potential sales in our today\u2019s meeting. (Incorrect)As mentioned earlier about the genitive case, the meeting does not belong to ours, but rather belongs to today.The fundamental grammar does not support double posession within the same word element. It will be like saying \u201cI walk run to the store\u201d, which is a double verb and does not make sense.We will discuss about the potential sales in our meeting today. (Correct)I refer back to the genitive case. The meeting belongs to ours, whereas today takes its function as the chronological period, and does not belong to anyone or anything. The word element has its independent function.I wish to clarify the overview instead of just providing a short answer. ",

A similar but non-standard construction that I have often heard in East Africa \u2014 and perhaps it occurs in many places in the world \u2014 is \u201cOur today\u2019s meeting.\u201d Using two possessives (our & today\u2019s) \u2014 which are \u201cdeterminers\u201d like the article the \u2014 to modify one and the same noun (meeting) just doesn\u2019t work. Compare it to fusing \u201cmy book\u201d and \u201cthe book\u201d into *my the book*. But let\u2019s not create a rule such as \u201cnever use two possessives in a row.\u201d That can happen when the possessives modify two or more different nouns, as in \u201cmy brother\u2019s wife\u2019s mother\u2019s house,\u201d which is perfectly acceptable and easier to produce than \u201cthe house of the wife of the mother of the wife of my brother.\u201d Today\u2019s lesson has been longer than necessary, but I hope it helps.

            "answer_text": "Is \u201ctoday\u2019s meeting\u201d grammatically correct? This form of punctuation is called the possessive apostrophe. It is used to show the ownership (or possession) of one thing by another. The owner is the one with the apostrophe and the owned object is the other word. This is best demonstrated with examples of people: The girl\u2019s book (owner = the girl) The man\u2019s house (owner = the man) The wife\u2019s gift (owner = the wife). Thus, with your phrase \"today\u2019s meeting\", it should follow that today is the owner of the meeting. This is correct because the meeting is taking place today, not any other day. ",
