            "answer_text": "It certainly depends on the type of novel, but here are some suggestions that should work for any book: 1. Complicate. There are likely points in your narrative where the protagonist must do something simple to progress from one scene to the next. Make it not so simple. Throw up obstacles in their way: speedbumps that slow them down, hurdles that they must make an extra effort to jump over, roadblocks that stop them dead in their tracks and force them to take an entirely different way around. Pulp writers used this as perhaps their most common tool. It doesn\u2019t have to be a physical obstacle, though. Social, mental, and emotional complications work too. Even in a purely intellectual literary plot, this can be, and is, done to great effect. The trick to avoiding a hack-ish feeling of bolted-on additions to your plot is to make it organic. Devise a block that arises due to an earlier action the protagonist took; make sure that they could just as readily have chosen an alternative instead. When problems arise from conscious choice, the story feels real and becomes engaging. Or make the problem arise from something that the protagonist noticed before, but ignored or discounted due to a personal flaw. Overcoming this flaw could become its own subplot. Bottom line: When a character\u2019s goal is harder to get to, it makes the reward sweeter and helps you show how committed they are to completing their goal. 2. Expand. Give one of your supporting characters a secret, and a believable reason to hide it. Make it something that drastically changes the landscape once it is revealed. Perhaps something that sheds a new light on what has come before, re-colors the picture. If you can somehow make it known to the reader before the protagonist finds out, that\u2019s even better. It creates a natural source of dramatic tension. But don\u2019t write the first secret that pops into your head. Let an idea develop, and work its way into your world and background story naturally, finding its own shape, until it feels like it was always there. 3. Escalate. Raise the stakes. Put things in peril. Not just a life. A career, a family, community, trust, respect, reputation, friendship, love. Something that the character has put a lot of investment into, something that the character still wants to grow further, and something that, when gone, would change their whole world for the worser. Remember that there are fates worse than death. Just don\u2019t make it a meaningless macguffin. 4. Create subplots. Make mini-plots or side stories. Get your supporting actors engaged in their own events. Layer these like a cake, and, if you\u2019re daring enough, try to interweave them so they are inextricably tied together. You don\u2019t even have to create new scenarios. You can simply detail events that previously were happening \u201coff-stage\u201d. Or relive an earlier event, from a different point of view. You can even do this multiple times, as in Rashomon. Remember, different characters notice different things, and will take away different meanings from the same event. Beware: These subplots need to be every bit as engaging as your main story, or you risk bogging down your whole book. 5. Whatever you do, do not insert random paragraphs of scenery description to pad things out. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "For me to expand a storyline I just keep adding things that pop up like I don\u2019t kill of the evil until I know I have a good book I\u2019m my hands. I\u2019d say just keep adding conflicts you know like battles, people missing. I know it can be hard to expand storylines but just do you best. ",
