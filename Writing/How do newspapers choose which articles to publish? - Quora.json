            "answer_text": "As another respondent says, sadly for many newspapers these days it\u2019s really a matter of a skeleton staff trying to get together enough words and pictures to fill the pages, rather than finely-honed news judgement. But - historically at all large papers, and even today at a few that strive to maintain standards - the following would be among the important criteria: \u2022 The very first consideration is geography. Does your newspaper cover a city? A state? A whole country? Whatever its circulation area, stories from outside that geography will automatically be lower-priority and in some cases would never even be considered at all. For example, a national paper will probably cover major international news, but a city paper may not cover anything outside the city and its immediate area. Even at the national paper, an international story most likely has to be more significant than an equivalent story from its home country. \u2022 Some stories are no-brainers. A significant political crisis, the outbreak of war involving your country or a major ally/nearby nation, a large-scale disaster - you don\u2019t even have to think about covering these, they will unquestionably be your front-page lead story (main article). However, I\u2019d estimate these account for (at most) 10% of lead stories. And even then, there is difference on what constitutes a no-brainer. The death of a major music star might be a no-brainer for a popular tabloid, but hardly covered at all by a financial daily. \u2022 Then there will be stories from the main beats - that is, the main areas that the newspaper considers routinely newsworthy. These would likely include politics, crime, education, environment and so on. There might be, perhaps, a dozen such core areas for a large paper. Exactly what they are can differ a great deal depending on the paper\u2019s target market. Each will have one or more reporters assigned to follow them full-time and their coverage will form a substantial part of the paper\u2019s content every day. \u2022 Then there will be stories you feel you have to cover because everyone else is covering them and you don\u2019t want to look like you missed them. If you\u2019re thinking this leads to some circular logic (everybody covers them because\u2026everybody is covering them\u2026) you\u2019d be right. \u2022 Then there will be stories that particularly interest your readers. For example, perhaps you know that you have a high proportion of young professionals reading your paper (hollow laughter, as if any young professionals read newspapers any longer\u2026). In that case, a story on city-centre apartment prices might be of interest to them. It will be much less important if your readers are mostly retired suburban people. \u2022 Then there will be, frankly, stories that particularly interest your editors. ",
