            "answer_text": "Literally anything is a debate topic if there are at least two opposing opinions on that thing. You can debate about which is the best way to binge the Star Wars just as well as you can debate about gun control. Of course, some topics are less up for debate than others. For instance, flat vs round earth is a non-argument, as there is unquestionable evidence for team round. In general, a good debate topic is a subject that allows for different opinions that are all valid. It also has at least a few pieces of evidence for either side. If you want to find a good debate topic, simply think 'What do people disagree about' and, chances are, it's good argument fuel. ",
