Set a small goal with a deadline of 12 daysPut a reminder on your mobile calendar which rings after 15 daysFast forward 15 days\u2026 Where do you find your goal? Finished, almost finished, still working or untouched?Don't like 15 days? Okay.. Write 5 small goals in a paper which would take 1 day each to finishStart working on the first one right nowFinish it; check the box \u2714 & go to sleepTomorrow start the second oneAfter 5 days check your positionThose are the strongest and honest ways to check yourself. Didn't like them that much? Okay.. ask yourself these questions: What am I doing the whole day from start to finish?How much time it would take to finish a small goal? 1 month? 3 months? 6 months?What would happen if I fail to meet the deadline?What's actually stopping me to work upon my goals?What do I need to start working on them right now?Hope that helps.. Feel free to ask me again.. ",

If you are getting results but not feeling satisfied, then you are committed and working, but not towards \u201cYOUR\u201d Goals. What are your Micro and Macro Goals? And are you devoted to \u201cYOUR\u201d Outcomes? Because Goals must lead to Outcomes, and outcomes will lead to Self satisfaction. So, this is how you are confirmed that you are towards your goals completely. If you are not feeling that feeling of Achievement even after your successes that means somewhere Something is missing. Something is not yet in line with your goal. Trace it out through Critical Thinking and move towards it to finish it. ",

            "answer_text": "Say a student decided that this academic year he/she wants to secure more than 90%. What would the student have to do then? The student would have to ensure that any exam (unit test, practicals, viva & main exam) he/she appears, he/she would have to secure more than 90%. Only then the aggregate performance at the end of the year would be more than 90%. similar to this example, every goal can be split up into various milestones/achievements so that one can measure one's own performance. In this process, if you find that you haven't reached where you thought you should be as per your initial plan, you can say that something is missing from your side. The fact is, those who really want to achieve something in their life does not waste time in finding answers to questions about their own confidence. Rather, they ask something about what they are doing. It also may be a case that one already has started working on something but is not confident enough about the self-efforts. under such circumstances, rather than revealing your own failures, better is to do self introspection & look for where one is falling short. Observers can only talk about what they can see with their open eyes, but they cannot judge your very thoughts running inside your head... ",
