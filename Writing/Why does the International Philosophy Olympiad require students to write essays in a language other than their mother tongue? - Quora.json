            "answer_text": "Matt Westwood\u2019s answer is correct, but I think there is more to the answer. It is also a simple matter of fair competition. Allowing writing in any language the participant prefers would be unviable, as it would be impossible to find enough appropriate examiners for all the languages. Even if it was, it would result in an inherent bias, as the examiner would in most cases be marking a student from their own nation. Choosing one, or a few, prevalent languages would result in a necessary and practically unchanging advantage for the native speakers of that language (as with, for instance, the World Schools Debating Competition, where the language is English, and only English-speaking nations have been winning ever since it was established). Hence the fairest option is for everyone to write in a second language (with 4 world languages being available). Sure, there will still be differences in command of the language, but they are much smaller and vary only individually, not nationally. And sure, there will at times be bilingual kids who may speak their \u201csecond\u201d language on a practically native level. But in my experience, that has not given anyone enough of an edge to succeed on that factor alone (or even any significant edge, as it is a small proportion of participants). More importantly, it is also a matter of randomness and thus will never result in a permanent advantage for any nationality. ",

            "answer_text": "A philosophy student who is unable to communicate in only one language is hampered by the fact that he/she can think in only one language. Different languages support different perspectives. To be a well-rounded philosopher, one needs those different perspectives. Also, an inability, or unwillingness, to learn another language is an indicator that one is not really cut out to be a philosopher, whose dictum could be described as \"learning for the sake of learning\".
