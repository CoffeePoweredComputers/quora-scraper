            "answer_text": "I\u2019d add to the answers already posted and say that publishing a book on your own gives you some much more creative control. You can find the right editors, the right cover designers, and market it the way you want to without having to rely on a publisher to give the okay on anything. You can make a book free, give discounts, give review copies, and choose teh categories you want your book listed under. You can go in and make changes to the ebook, make changes to the sales page, and add content if you need to. A publisher is not going to let you do that. ",

            "answer_text": "The benefits and the drawbacks are, actually, the same. One benefit is that you\u2019re guaranteed to get your book out there, without the pain of going through editors and rewrites. One drawback is that you\u2019re guaranteed to get your book out there, without the benefit of going through editors and rewrites, so your book might be misspelled, poorly organized crap and you\u2019ll never know it until it\u2019s too late. One benefit is that self-publishing online means your book exists in e-book format, the most modern way to read a book. One drawback is that self-publishing online means your book exists in e-book format, and not in a nice hardcover, bound-paper kind of book, and so you may miss a large group of potential readers. ",
