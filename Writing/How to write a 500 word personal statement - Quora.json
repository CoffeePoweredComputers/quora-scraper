            "answer_text": "Getting everything covered in 500 words only is quite a struggle. Moreover, if you wish to strike the admission committee, you will probably want to mention all of your achievements, skills, remarkable personality features, and a lot more. How do you cope with this task, in such a case? A promising personal statement writer service is your first option. Such websites usually have experienced experts who are masters of creating a striking PS. They will take all of your requirements into account, prepare a draft, and proceed with further editing after your approval.  If you\u2019ve decided to do everything on your own, however, these tips can make it a bit less disturbing: \u25cf Avoid wordiness. No one likes reading the same idea on a loop. Try to convey a single message in one or at least two sentences. \u25cf Make an outline. Nicely outlining the structure of your PS will help you think through all the key ideas you would like to touch upon. Spend a little bit more time at this stage. \u25cf Eliminate quotes. While this simple step helps you comply with the word limit, it is also a winning move in terms of authenticity. The admission committee is tired of reading borrowed ideas, even if they are conveyed through the prism of your vision. \u25cf Cut, simplify, and reorganize. Spot the largest phrases or sentences in your paper. Ask yourself, \u2018How can I cut the information without losing the initial meaning? Is it possible to combine these two ideas in one sentence? Can this phrase be simplified?\u2019 \u25cf Proofread several times. Reading through your PS a few times will help you spot its weak points. Pay attention to linking phrases, transitions, adjectives, and pronouns. At times, we tend to use those excessively. \u25cf Let others have a look. Perhaps, another individual can assist you in getting a new angle on this task. Working on the same piece of writing for a long time makes you learn it by heart, which is dangerous. In such cases, you are just unable to detect errors.  Reading through successful PS samples is another valuable tip. Try to focus on the way that ideas and arguments are presented. Evaluate the structure of such papers. How is the paper organized? Is anything missing? What do you have in your PS that this sample does not include? Perhaps, you can adjust your assignment accordingly. Believe it or not, a huge number of your ideas are completely unnecessary. Try to answer the most crucial questions only. Do not proceed with a detailed description of your candidacy. Avoid the overuse of adjectives. Get your topic narrowed and hit the center of the target only. ",

For something more business-oriented there\u2019s advice here. How to write a personal statement for a CV and here How to write a personal profile for your CV in 2019 | CV-Library [better IMO] I would advice not succumbing to the advice to remove all pronouns - such statements look ridiculous as well a being grammatically dubious. (See the example below*.) My first piece of advice (actually in the light of the above it\u2019s going to be the second,isn\u2019t it?) about writing a personal statement would be that if you can avoid doing so, do just that. If you can\u2019t, lay your hands on a good guide to writing fiction. \u2018Personal statements\u2019 have invaded the world of commerce and also that of academe. The vast majority of these are effectively carefully-crafted sales-pitches and, like most marketing material, are pretty economical with the truth, at the very least prone to major exaggeration. I know some recruiters who say they rely on these for a first \u2018sift\u2019 of applicants and others who skip over them and go straight to the main content of the CV: unfortunately they usually find a \u2018personal statement\u2019 where a helpful summary used to be. Except in the case of more mature individuals (and not always then) the one thing a \u2018personal statement\u2019 is not is \u2018personal\u2019. They are invariably a team effort. In the case of students they will be contributed to, critted and honed by teachers, mentors parents, well-meaning friends, uncle Tom Cobley and all. So don\u2019t be afraid to enlist whatever help is available - it\u2019s really not cheating! There are plenty of websites offering help in this area, some better than others. (Suggestions above but a Google search will provide dozens of alternatives.) * I found this appalling example on one recruitment site, supposedly offering guidance on how to put together such a statement (as you\u2019ll see it is staggeringly inept. Not only is the first sentence ungrammatical but the second is a fallacy - you don\u2019t have work experience as a \u2019former\u2019 editor but as an editor!) :- \u201cRecent graduate with a degree in English from Bath University. Practical work experience as the former editor of Bath University student blog and magazine. Looking to start my career in journalism in a role where I can build on the skills gained at university and through my editorial experience.\u201d Great: a would-be journalist who can\u2019t write! You can\u2019t do worse than that even if you try\u2026 Good luck! ",
