My childhood has very few if any, good memories. The daily beatings for mostly imagined \u201cmistakes\u201d did not weaken me in any way. I endured electrical shock treatments by my father to \u201clearn\u201d to accept and develop strength, to be locked up for days in a closet, with nothing to eat but crusty week old bread and one cup of water. This also included a wash tub for me to go relieve myself and also NO clothes were permitted as per his directives in order to teach me humility and gratuity in being released in a weed because of having to go back to school. I never enjoyed Christmas because I was not allowed toys or candy, he and his beastly wife took it all, either ate the candy or threw away the toys. I dreaded summer vacation for 14 years as I spent three months in a hell spawn home, beaten, tortured, and ridiculed for being who I was or what they both perceived me to be. My father was a true coward in every sense of the word, he was my personal monster that no one but me and my brother and two sister ever saw. He was completely without emotion, accept pure unadulterated hate for being \u201cemotionless\u201d. He raped and tortured me, my two sisters and left my little brother untouched and to this day I have no idea why. But know this, because he was such a human monster, I knew I could never be like him, because I felt what he could not, I understood what he could not, and I loved what he could not. I am accountable for all my actions, not him because that gives him power over me, even in his death, so I am everything he wasn\u2019t. This is fact, not fiction. Read it and learn or delete it, your choice. Have a great weekend!!! ",
