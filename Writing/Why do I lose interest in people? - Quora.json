            "answer_text": "Sometimes it's not your fault \u2014 sometimes it's just how time passes or how people change. Sometimes it may be down to something you do, distancing yourself, or hurting the other person, which leads them to zone out of the relationship. But unless they give you a reason why, the important thing is to not be too rash if your partner looses interest. \"Regardless of the reason, what's important is that the person 'left behind' because their partner lost interest does not try and change themselves as a result,\" relationship coach and founder of Maze of Love, Chris Armstrong, tells Bustle. \"I once told a client 'if parts of you drew your partner away, maybe it's time to look within but don't make sudden changes over one person losing interest'.\" So if you feel like there's a pattern of people you're dating losing interest, maybe it's time to look inward, but remember that there are so many reasons things can happen. 1. It Was Lust, Not Love, After All Oops. You know how sometimes people warn you not to rush into anything because you can feel so intensely about someone but it wears off? Yup. That happens. Sometimes if they loose interest because, unfortunately, it was never really there in the first place. The lust fades and there's no foundation to back it up. It sucks, but it's true. \"The initial excitement and energy that their partner brought no longer exists. It can be common for people to put their best foot forward upfront, only to fall back to their natural self as the relationship progresses,\" Armstrong says. ",
