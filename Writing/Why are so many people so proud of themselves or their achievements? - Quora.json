            "answer_text": "Well my friends,I am a marketing person, so my mind works in that way. There s a theory known as Maslow's hierarchy. Which states there are 5 types of needs 1physiological2 security3 social4 self esteem5 self actualisation Physiological are your basic needs food shelter clothes, (now mobiles as well) etc..Security are your secure needs like bank balance, job etc..Social needs are the needs to be accepted by society..Self esteem are the needs which portrays their successSelf actualisation comes when a person has achieved all the above and feels there is more to life most successful people are in actualisation state..This theory follows hierarchy after a mans physiological needs are met he thinks about safety needs like permanent job, bank balance and so onNow for an individual to meet his social needs is to be accepted by society. But after this need is fulfilled he feels the need of esteem. So to meet his esteem needs he hangs to his achievements. Which he feels proud about and he feels it increases his esteem. After this need is fulfilled. He goes to meet his self actualisation need. Many of the achievers DO NOT portray their achievements after a stage. Eg: mother Theresa never said how many people she served, bill gates never says anything about his achievements, Nor any of the top business tycoons. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it makes them happy!We, the humans, feel happy by our achievements and are proud of it because we know better than anyone that how hard it was to achieve.Like I sometimes feel proud of a simple algorithm I implement, just because I am the real witness of those efforts made by such an ignorant person :D Also, in a broader sense, it is fuel to human civilisation. Being proud of ourselves motivates us to do better and more.In fact, it is the thing that made Bill Gates and Einsteins. Though, some external factors and inabilities to control out emotional flow, brings out excitement in a rude way. ",
