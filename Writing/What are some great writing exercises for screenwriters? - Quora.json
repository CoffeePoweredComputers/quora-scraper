            "answer_text": "Have any of you done the famous writing exercise suggested by television writing genius David Milch? The exercise is practically guaranteed to improve your writing as you embrace Milch\u2019s philosophy of having \u201can open mind and a humble heart.\u201d  David Milch Rift Fournier concisely outlined David Milch\u2019s writing exercise (in a wonderful article from \u201cWritten By\u201d Magazine, November 2002 issue, entitled \u201cProblems of the Spirit, When David Milch lectures, it\u2019s a call to worship writing.\u201d) For your benefit, here are the article details. \u201cIn his seminar David Milch did present one profoundly basic tool for writers. David suggested a writing exercise to prepare the writers' spirits for how one separates oneself from their work and develops writing muscles without conscious effort. The exercise was simple: Commit to writing for 20 minutes and not more than 50 minutes each day at the same time using two distinct voices. David laid out two rules for the exercise: No names for the characters and no descriptions.\u201d Voice #1, Voice # 2, Just dialogue, nothing more. You have the opportunity of writing 15 of these exercises total.\u201d (Commit to doing the exercises for 5 consecutive days, then take two days off. Repeat for 5 more days, then take two more days off.) \u201cFor the final week, David suggests five more exercises with a twist: adding a third voice as a story-organizing element, (Voice #3).\u201d When I did this 15-day exercise, I was encouraged by David Milch (at a Sherwood Oaks College event) to send the material to him personally, which I did, of course. So, did he read it? To this day, I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t follow up because it was never about Milch. It was about me improving my writing mind. In fact, some of what I created is going into a current script that I am now writing, so the exercise was supremely beneficial to me. I would suggest putting all the completed exercises in one envelope. Then mail it to someone you know, (but not me). Call the recipient to indicate the envelope is coming and what is in it. But they are NOT to open the envelope; they are to hold it for at least 90 days, then return it to you unopened when they next see you. This is about \"writing with a humble heart\" and giving up the material to the universe. It\u2019s a physical thing and a metaphysical thing. Rift Fournier continued, \u201cThe exercises have nothing to do with writing television or movies\u2026 It is a more profound lesson in getting one's self into a natural rhythm and in being in a place where one's spirit is prepared for a vision. Milch made this point by quoting the late Billy Wilder: \u2018The muse has to know where to find you.\u2019\u201d When you finally look at the exercises again in 3 months, perhaps you will realize that your writing has magically improved, or perhaps not. But why not try this and see what happens? I suggest this exercise to all my writing clients and many other writers as well. I am always surprised when so few writers see enough potential benefit to actual try the exercise. What doesn\u2019t surprise me is the feedback I get from the most committed writers who do the exercise. Every one of them felt the experience benefited them as writers. If you determine this was beneficial to you, I'd appreciate you letting me know. Good luck! Also, I encourage screenwriters to follow me on Quora for craft and career advice as I will be posting answers frequently. (You might find some of my previous answers helpful as well.) ",
