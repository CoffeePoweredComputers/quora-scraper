            "answer_text": "First, I have to clarify. You said they're trying to make you jealous. Do you mean jealous, or do you mean envious? Jealousy is a fear of losing what you have. Envy is a desire to have something you do not have, that someone else has. So which is it? Second, is this person actually trying to make you jealous/envious? Or is that simply how you're responding to their innocent behavior? This can sometimes be judged by whether they say things that are calculated to ratchet up your anxiety level. If the jealousy or envy is strictly your response, and not based on deliberate provocation, I would suggest cultivating a sense of satisfaction with what you have, gratitude for what other people do to serve you (even when you're paying them to do it), and/or confidence in your close friends not to betray you; whichever attitudes are most appropriate for the situation. If someone shows you some new bauble they've received, choose to be delighted for them, even if their new thing eclipses yours. If someone engages your bf/gf in conversation, even if it's flirty (while still innocent enough) take pleasure in the fact that, after all that, he or she still returns to you and wants you to be the light in their world. On the other hand, if someone is deliberately doing and saying things that are unmistakably calculated to cause you jealousy or envy, that's a character flaw. It is not nice to instill fear or emotional anxiety in someone else for your own entertainment. Such a flaw might be only in the surface, and if the person in question is important enough to you, you may be able to \"buff it out\" by having a heart-to-heart discussion about the behavior. Or you may be able to extinguish the behavior, at least with respect to you, by not responding to it. (Again, the attitudes of satisfaction, gratitude, and confidence will come in handy when you start to feel jealous or envious but don't want to show it.) But the flaw might be deeply ingrained in the person's fundamental being, and if that's the case, your best strategy at eliminating the behavior may be to simply avoid being with that person to the extent possible. Kind of a vague answer. I could do better with more details to work with. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the first thing you need to consider is whether you are already jealous, and whether this person\u2019s behavior is simply exacerbating those feelings. You have to be honest with yourself before you can begin to take any actions that will alleviate how you feel about this situation. If you aren\u2019t willing to do that, then all you are going to get out of reading responses here is making yourself feel justified in whatever way you presently feel. That is not progress, that is patting yourself on the back and considering the other person to be the only one in the wrong. There is clearly a backstory here motivating your question. Something happened between you and this person, whom I will call Mark. You and Mark had some sort of relationship, and something happened. Now you perceive Mark\u2019s behavior as manipulative, specifically doing things he knows will get under your skin, threatening you with abandonment of some sort or waving success in your face, something like that. Regardless of all that, remember that all you can control is your own response. Whatever the scenario, you are responsible for your actions. You can\u2019t make Mark stop doing all of this. You can make him be reasonable and fair. You can only choose either not to respond at all, to respond in a way that makes things worse, or in a way that makes things better. Let\u2019s go through what those responses might look like: Do not respond at all.If someone is bullying you (purposefully trying to making you jealous is a form of bullying), one of the best ways to shut down that behavior is to simply ignore the taunts. Bullies thrive on getting the reaction they want out of you; giving them what they want is satisfying to them, so they continue. So if you simply demonstrate that Mark\u2019s behavior is not having the desired effect, perhaps he will give up.I would not recommend this approach if Mark has been a friend in the past. This reaction would tend to demonstrate that you simply don\u2019t care and are unaffected by the possibility presented by his attempted-jealousy-producing behavior, which might make matters worse. Indifference to the damaged relationship is not a good message to send.Make things worse.This would look something like lashing out violently, either verbally, physically, or social-psychologically. This is where you manipulate back, trash talk, undermine Mark\u2019s other pursuits, etc. This is making vindictive moves aimed at getting back at Mark, perhaps even making efforts you think will make Mark jealous.This is obviously not the high road, and not likely to either restore your relationship with Mark, or at least convince him to stop trying to manipulate you.Make things better.If you are going to improve things with Mark, or at least get him to leave you alone and stop trying to make you jealous, the adult, mature, loving thing to do is to try to have a person-to-person, face-to-face conversation with Mark. Lay out how his behavior is affecting you, clarify how you actually feel if his behavior is not making you jealous, and perhaps even attempt to address what made things bad in the first place.This is what I would recommend doing. Addressing things head on in a patience, kind, and loving way that seeks to reestablish the relationship and own your part of what made things bad in the first place is the most mature thing you could do here. A little humility in owning any wrongdoing you might have done in the friendship will go a long long way in making things better.I hope this helps. ",
