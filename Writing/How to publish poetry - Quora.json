            "answer_text": "Published usually means in a printed supply as in books, magazines, anthologies. Getting a single poem isn\u2019t really the aim of a poet. To be a poet is to take part in a separate journey that could last for decades and leave behind a legacy that lasts for centuries. If not aiming for such potential rewards then that\u2019s a personal choice. So for just a single poem, how many do YOU want to reach? A hundred or a thousand, a million or a billion? People can create quite a stir on websites like YouTube. It isn't a written-to-be-shared experience on the same level as books or sold as books are, but the poem could reach billions of visitors over the years. It would help if you were famous already. My poem Giant Panda is on YouTube as well as on the poemhunter website and my wildlife art poetry blog. This doesn\u2019t mean anything fantastic is likely to happen. Nor may that be so for the 2,800+ poems on the poemhunter website or downloading the free ebook for these on that website or from here: Denis Martindale Poems - Poems of Denis Martindale - Poem Hunter So look through QUORA answers for a place to include your poem here. Upload it to the poemhunter website, too. Add a free stock image like I do every now and then. Or don\u2019t publish anywhere and just submit a poem to a poetry publisher\u2019s upcoming anthology. The choices are there for just a single poem, but for poetry collections, I prefer the poemhunter website. We can visit a web page and send a link by email to ourselves and to others, too. We can view the text-only web page to avoid the adverts. What you decide may not be based on what\u2019s available but overcoming the initial fearful stages of sharing anything. Ross Taylor. Let us know what you will do. Publish or not. Share online or not. Go into business in some way or not. Even so, use Grammarly to get the text checked\u2026 You may be blessed by using it here with the Google Chrome browser and the Grammarly add-on or extension or just by registering with their website. Free photos from websites like unsplash, pixabay, gratisography, picography and pexels. Some are absolutely beautiful\u2026 and you can enrich and enhance your poetry using resources like these\u2026 and QUORA\u2026 : ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I am an as yet unpublished poet, but I have a fair handle on how it goes. Publishing is like dating. You are trying to get someone to notice you, and that someone usually turns out to be a great many someones. It's important how you know these people. It's important how you approach them, what you say to them, which sides of your personality / expression you put forth. Like dating, your chance of success is higher if you know something about them beforehand. Knowing what they like / are looking for / tend to favor in a partner is a huge bonus. So research and observation will help in determining whether a publisher will even be interested in your work. Read sources that publish poetry. Looking your best helps. In fact, in the publishing world, if you have a single hair on your head in (unintentional) disarray, you're finished. If you're not a master of the language in which you're writing poetry, don't bother. If you're not among the few people you know with the broadest vocabulary, the best sense of grammar, punctuation, spelling and word flow, don't bother. I'm not telling you to give up on poetry \u2013 please never do that. Just realize that only the best of the best tends to get published. You will get rejected. You will get rejected constantly. Think about walking into a bar and asking random people who don't know you for their numbers. What percentage of them will be interested? It's important to know the scene. It's important to know people who know people. It's important to have a reputation. It's important to feel like you know what you're doing. A good place to start might be a publication you already have connections with. Do you attend a church that puts out a newsletter? Do you work for an institution that publishes regular updates / digests for its employees? You're more likely to get published via these channels. If there's any established publication you read regularly, that's also an excellent place to start. You will have a better understanding of what they're like and what they're looking for. Published poets tend to be tortured souls. They tend to be people who find meaning in this desolate existence through examining the Rorschach test of their blood on paper. But who knows? The simple answer is the best way to get published is to try. ",
