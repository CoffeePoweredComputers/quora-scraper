            "answer_text": "Let me suggest a couple of classics. O Henry is widely considered to be the king of short stories and you may even have already read quite a few. A collection of his works is a must have for anyone who loves short stories. Another remarkable writer of the short story is Guy De Maupassant who is once again considered to be a master of the genre. If you are looking for something lighter, you can check out Jeffrey Archer\u2019s various collections of short stories. Though they may not qualify as serious literature, Archer\u2019s stories are always delightful and often have a unique ironical twist to them. My personal favourite collection is \u2018To Cut A Long Story Short\u2019. ",
