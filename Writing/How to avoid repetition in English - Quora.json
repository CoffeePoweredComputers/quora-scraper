            "answer_text": "The keyword here is SYNONYMS! One word in the English language has so many other words with the same or similar meaning. For example: BIG large, sizeable, of considerable size, substantial, considerable, great, huge, immense, enormous, extensive, colossal, massive, prodigious, tremendous, gigantic, giant, monumental, mighty, stupendous, gargantuan, elephantine, titanic, epic, mountainous, megalithic, monstrous, whopping, mega, humongous, astronomical, ginormous\u2026 Although some of these words slightly differ in context, connotation and formality, most of them can be used to replace repetitive words. So instead of saying, \u201cI have a big house beside a big tree in a big city.\u201d You can now use synonyms and say, \u201cI have a large house beside a massive tree in an enormous city.\u201d If you want to find synonyms, you may just google \u201csynonym big\u201d and they will provide you a list. Even better, buy a THESAURUS. ",
