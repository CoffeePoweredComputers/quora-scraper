            "answer_text": "There\u2019s three words that answers your question. Promote-promote-and promote some more. This talk to build your audience as a newly published writer, that depends on many circumstances. Do you have a publicist? Do you have a literary agent? If not, then you start to build your audience through social media platforms. Posting good and interesting content. You will also have to promote some of your posts to get them out to a wider range of people. The average post on a social media platforms such as Twitter, only lives on someone\u2019s newsfeed for maybe 10 to 12 minutes. After that they have to scroll so far down to see it most people normally don\u2019t. so you have to find a balance of not posting too much, and not posting enough. You have to try and reach out to your local newspapers to see if a reporter is willing to do an article on you. Establish a website. You can also do press releases on your books with the hopes that someone may contact you for an interview. If you have a publicist, a lot of that work will be done for you by your publicist. However, I understand that most publicist charge anywhere from $12,000-$20,000 for a four month contract. This is a brief answer to your question. It gets far more detailed than that. Far too much to put in a simple answer. I received these types of questions numerous times through my website from new and inspiring authors. So much so, that I have created a set of tutorials on the topic on Udemy.com. Please do not misunderstand me, I am not trying to sell you into buying one of my tutorials. I am only telling you about it because it\u2019s too detailed and an answer to just answer on this one. There\u2019s so much involved it\u2019s incredible. If you want to preview my tutorials just go to Udemy.com, type my name, Caesar Rondina in the search bar, and you could see all my tutorials and preview them. You could also do a search on Google and find many of your answers there. I hope this helps answer your question. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, for starters, assuming a literary agent will help promote you is ridiculous. Agents don\u2019t promote, they sell. Period. Not you, but your books. That\u2019s how they make their living. So far as publicists go, that, too, is ridiculous, at least it is if you\u2019re a typical \u201cnewly published writer,\u201d which means you have ZERO dollars available for promotional budgets. If you happen to be a newly published writer whose last name is Kennedy and whose home address is somewhere in Hyannis Port, no problem. Otherwise, let\u2019s get real. If you want to build an audience and have no existing fan base, write. Write well. Write well and distribute. Write well and distribute everywhere. I\u2019m talking blogs. I\u2019m talking forums. I\u2019m talking social media, online magazines, print magazines, advice columns, Amazon book reviews, white papers, newspaper editorials. Whatever. If you can publish something anywhere and get a by-line attached to your work, do it. You may get paid a minimal amount in some venues, but more than likely you\u2019ll be contributing your time and talents gratis. That\u2019s okay. If you want to build an audience, the Internet is your oyster. Harvest and shuck it. Oh, and if you have an opportunity (and the talent, temperament, and ability) to do some local newspaper reporting, go for it. Local papers (including online editions) always give by-lines in lieu of well-paid reimbursements. You may only make a few bucks a story if that, and your time will hardly seem worth the effort. But every time a story of yours runs, so will your by-line, increasing both your audience and your prestige. The bottom line is that you want to get your name \u201cout there\u201d in the publishing universe as often as possible. And keep getting it out there. In time, when you can afford a publicist, you may well decide you don\u2019t need one. Or, if you do, you can at least afford to be choosy enough to pick the very best available to deliver the most bang for your promotional buck. And that will help spread your name around all the more. Hope this helps. ",
