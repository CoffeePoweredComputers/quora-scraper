            "answer_text": "Ah, a question for writing instructors. That\u2019s me! Who knows, if you\u2019re going to an online university, I might be your professor! At any rate, I\u2019ve been teaching composition and argumentative writing for a solid 15 years, so this should be helpful if it\u2019s not overwhelming. To start, this is too general a question\u2014what you need to do depends heavily on what the assignment or project requires. I\u2019ll try to take that into account as I answer, though. So, Step 1: Read your assignment/project instructions, very VERY carefully. Make sure you understand the main objective of the assignment/project, identify any questions you\u2019re required to answer or ideas you\u2019re required to respond to. Look at formatting requirements\u2014MLA? APA? Chicago style?\u2014and make sure that you understand how many sources you\u2019re required to use, as well as what kind of sources you\u2019re expected to use. Step 2: figure out what overall point you want to make in your essay. An argumentative essay needs to have a claim for a thesis, that is, a declarative statement that takes a specific stance on some kind of debate. So identify the debate you\u2019re addressing, and then figure out what your stance is. This should just be a working thesis at this point; stay flexible on it, as there\u2019s a chance it will change as you do your research. Step 3: assemble your data/evidence. What exactly you look for here will vary depending on the topic you\u2019re writing on. If you\u2019re writing on current events, look for data\u2014statistics from reliable, unbiased sources that give information about what actually is happening\u2014and expert analysis of that data and the larger cultural context. If you\u2019re writing on literature, by contrast, your main evidence needs to come from the work(s) you\u2019re writing on (this is called close reading; you point out parts of the text that are catching your attention, and explain why they\u2019re doing so as it relates to your overall thesis). Step 4: see if the evidence you\u2019ve found fits your working thesis. If it does, great. If it doesn\u2019t, revise your thesis until it works with the evidence you have. Sometimes, you will find that the evidence actually leads you to the conclusion that the opposing argument is stronger; that can be a weird moment, but trust it. Don\u2019t let confirmation bias confine you to a weak stance on an issue/debate. Step 5: decide how to make your argument. This, again, requires checking the instructions/requirements and/or considering your overall goal\u2014how you make the argument (whether you\u2019re trying to just win the logic contest, trying to persuade a neutral audience, trying to persuade a hostile audience, etc.) will often be tied to what you\u2019ve been asked to do in the project/assignment. You also need to figure out what your audience\u2019s level of knowledge is likely to be; you will use different language and terminology when writing for a specialist audience than you would when writing for a general audience. Step 6: Draft the essay. What you do here depends on how you work. Some people do better just drafting it all out at once and then revising once they have most of what they need, while some do better at creating an outline (in which they write out the thesis and the supporting points that need to be made to make the case for that thesis) and then drafting. Figure out what works for you, and do that. Step 7: Review and revise. This can be a tricky step, and it\u2019s really best to let it rest for a day (or at least a few hours) after you complete the draft. Most of us revise more effectively when we come at our drafts with fresh eyes. This can also be a good point to bring in a second reader\u2014observant friend or family member, a tutor\u2014to help you figure out what is and isn\u2019t working, what gaps there are in your logic, etc. Do make sure that this is all right with your instructor if you\u2019re writing for a class. Things to remember in this step: your main goal, as a write, should be clarity. You\u2019re writing for other people, remember, not just for yourself, so you need to make sure that you\u2019ve laid ideas and claims out in a way that others can follow. This means bringing in specific evidence (not big huge chunks of quotation) and fully analyzing that evidence for your readers (tell them what is important about the evidence and how that ties into your overall point); using clear topic sentences that help readers to identify the main point of every paragraph; making sure that every paragraph\u2019s topic leads logically to the topic of the next paragraph, and that you have transition sentences to help readers see those logical chains; and giving clear overviews in the introduction paragraph and concluding paragraph that either introduce readers to the basic skeleton of your argument, or help them review that basic skeleton. Step 8: proofread and edit. This is the very last step before submitting the essay because all the previous steps can change up your writing enough that you might actually revise out entire passages. Since you don\u2019t want to waste time polishing up writing you don\u2019t keep, don\u2019t do the editing until last. Again, this is a place where having a second pair of eyes can really help. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful, and not just overwhelming! This is a pretty big question, so it needs a big answer. ",

            "answer_text": "An argumentative essay can be organized using the following sections: Introduction, 3 Body Sections, and Conclusion. Generally, your Introduction is structured as follows: Provide a \u201chook\u201d such as a compelling, brief anecdote (story), a rhetorical question, or a startling fact. Offer background information about the issue at hand. Present your thesis statement, generally near the end of your Introduction. Remember that the thesis statement is an opinion that you are going to support throughout the rest of the essay. Different terms exist for talking about the opinions you present in an essay; I will use the term \u201cmajor claim\u201d to refer to your thesis statement and \u201cminor claims\u201d to refer to the reasons for your major claim. For example, let\u2019s say your major claim (your thesis statement) is: \u201cPeople should not drive cars.\u201d Your three minor claims (reasons) could be: 1)Vehicle emissions are bad for the environment, 2)Car accidents are common, and 3)Driving a vehicle prevents a person from getting exercise by walking or riding a bike. In your 3 Body Sections, you will explain each minor claim in turn, one minor claim per section. Integrate rhetorical appeals such as logos, ethos, and pathos. Logos refers to logic. We all have a need for things to \u201cmake sense\u201d logically. Using facts and statistics can help your audience connect the dots and agree with your minor claim. Ethos refers to your credibility as a writer. As you cite your sources using a citation guide such as MLA, APA, or another style guide your instructor (or employer) has provided, you show your reader that you are a credible voice in the conversation regarding a particular issue. Pathos refers to emotion. Discussing a personal vignette about how the issue affected you or someone you know can raise emotions in your reader such as sadness or sympathy, which can lead them to ultimately agree with your major claim. You should also acknowledge and respond to opposing voices. If you can find a source that disagrees with you about one of your minor claims, you should present their objections in a civil manner. Respond to their concerns. If you can easily or with a little research find objections to a minor claim, you should address them in your essay. Certainly, if objections are substantial, you may want to rethink your minor claim. This discussion should typically go in your 3 Body Sections unless otherwise instructed by your teacher or employer. The Conclusion section presents your thesis statement again, invites readers to action, and provides a compelling final thought. Remember to cite all your sources in a Works Cited page separate from your essay. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "A good introduction in an argumentative essay acts like a good opening statement in a trial. Just like a lawyer, a writer must present the issue at hand, give background, and put forth the main argument -- all in a logical, intellectual and persuasive way. Start With a Hook Start your introduction with a sentence that gets the reader interested in the topic. To pique the reader's interest, you can begin with a quote, a personal story, a surprising statistic or an interesting question. For example, if you are arguing that smoking should be banned from all public places, you can start your introduction by referencing a statistic from a verified source: \"Tobacco use kills more than five million people every year -- more than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, according to the World Health Organization.\" This strategy grabs the reader's attention while introducing the topic of the essay. Include Background Providing readers with background on the topic allows them to better understand the issue being presented. This information provides context and history that can be crucial to explaining and arguing your point. For example, if you are arguing that there should never be a military draft in the United States, your introduction can include information about the history of the U.S. draft and the events that led to it being abolished. State Your Thesis The thesis is the essence of an argumentative essay. In a single, clear sentence, it sums up what point you are trying to make. The thesis statement should assert a position on a particular issue -- one that a reader can potentially argue against. Therefore, the thesis cannot be a fact. For example, if a professor assigns the general topic of war, you can formulate the following thesis statement: \"The United Nations must be redesigned because it is currently incapable of preventing wars.\" The rest of your essay serves to explain and provide evidence in support of your thesis statement. What to Leave Out A good introduction should not be describing arguments or providing analysis that belong in the body paragraphs. Your introduction should introduce and set up your point, rather than lay out evidence to support it. Also, while your intro is a road map for the rest of the essay, you shouldn't explicitly announce what and how you will be arguing: \"I am going to prove to you that ...\" This type of set up does not add any pertinent information and only serves as filler. You can check this article here, which is written by our professor. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written answers to a variation of this question quite a few times, so I hope you\u2019ll look at related questions to get input from a variety of respondents. In those other responses, I\u2019ve gone through the mechanics of structure, types of persuasion, use of rhetorical devices, means of researching and selecting what you\u2019ll include, as well as the common advice to spend about 40% of your effort reviewing, refining, and proofreading your essay. What, then, makes a persuasive essay \u201coutstanding.\u201d (I\u2019m not a fan of the term \u201cargumentative\u201d because it implies that your primary purpose is to be difficult or oppositional. The \u201carguments\u201d you develop should have the purpose of persuading, which is a more demanding task by far than simply arguing.) Understanding your audience: Who do you need to persuade that your thesis is valid and your argument is convincing in demonstrating that validity?What are their existing beliefs?What kind of evidence persuades them (appeal to emotions, appeal to data, appeal to the authority and expertise of those cited\u2026 or of the writer)?What kinds of counter-arguments might they propose?What is their level of knowledge about the topic?What might be their prejudices wrt any evidence/argument you might present (e.g., cited experts that the audience might not trust)?Using solid information: Research is your friend. Before you make a claim that you\u2019re sure is true, verify that with an open mind. It\u2019s crucial not to overstate your case and to know that you have accurate information that you can back up with a citation.Be sure that any expert opinions you present are from someone who is truly an expert in the subject matter related to your essay. Does the information come from a reputable source (e.g., a NASA astrophysicist on space travel, an art historian on cubism, an experienced educator with a degree in education on pedagogical methods)?Recognize the difference between opinions and facts when applying content that someone else has written. This goes both ways. There are people who claim that facts are \u201cjust opinions\u201d when they are actually facts. (Often this happens when the naysayer knows little or nothing about the data/evidence/analysis methods but wants to believe something other than what the data/evidence/etc. clearly demonstrates. If such people are your target readers, good luck!) The flip side is for you to be careful that you do not take opinions for facts. If the writer or speaker states an opinion without convincing (accurate, factual) information and solid reasoning, that person is not a good source for your essay.Knowing your audience, make a deliberate decision about how you will present your arguments so that it is easy for the audience to read without becoming defensive; you want them to \u201clisten\u201d to your argument with as much of an open mind as possible. Apply all the fundamentals of writing persuasive essays, using the classical rhetoric of sound reasoning\u2014 avoiding at all costs the use of rhetorical/logical fallacies. (If you don\u2019t know about these, you can find the information in places like Purdue University\u2019s OWL writing website.) ",

            "answer_text": "I'll assume that you didn't wanted something like a \"step by step\" or a flow-chart or a \"good argument\" in the sense of a convincing argument (if you mean the last one, pay attention to William Smith's answer).  First: what is a good argument? Philosophers talk about what constitues a good argument:  Valid logicTrue premisesPremises that are more plausible then their negativesSo, essentially, insofar you have all the three things above, you got yourself a good argument. Now how do you get those?   Valid logic means essentially \"premises that folow logically one from each other till reach the conclusion\"\u00b9. So an argument with valid logic is one that, if the premises are true, the conclusion is necessarily true (in the deductive way; if you want to argue for a conclusion that is only more probably true, an inductive argument, then you may have an argument with broken logic, but it sill must make \"inductive sense\" as in, for example, 1) 90% of new yorkers love chocolate. 2) Marry is a new yorker. 3) Therefore, Marry loves chocolate)In order to get true premises, you need to know what you're talking about. It's very difficult to know the truth of something if you didn't do your homework of studying that issue first. So once you gather some knowledge, you probably will be capable of starting writting some good premises.To be honest, I never understood this last requirement properly, so I prefer to say nothing about it. :) Hope that a professional philosopher may appear here to complete this last requirement.And of course, it also helps to remember: Keep em mind the true meaning of your words, specially those which are key words in your argument. E.g. if you want to argue for same-sex marriage, you need to know what is \"sex\" in this context as well as what is \"marriage\"; otherwise you are doomed to fail. Try to advance some criticisms of your argument's premises while you're still building your argument. It may prevent some headche of finding too late you are actually defending some nonense.  \u00b9: That maybe is not the best way to say what I mean, but I hope you will understand anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "An argumentative essay is a writing piece meant to persuade someone to think the way you do. Though it's usually organized as an essay. There are some specific elements that are needed in an argumentative essay. The first and most important element in a persuasive essay is the position, or what side the author is on. The purpose of this type of essay is to fully investigate an issue or topic. This involves extensive research covering all aspects of the topic and gathering information on all involved points of view. The main reason someone chooses to write an argumentative essay (other than the fact that their professor told them to!) is to attempt to sway another person or group of people in their opinion on a subject. Pick an issue that is interesting to you. You'll be spending a lot of time researching and writing this paper. So it is important for you to choose a topic that you find interesting from the start. Find a peer (preferably one that holds an oppositional view) to discuss your argument with. This process will help you refine your thinking and develop new ideas to support your judgment. An important aspect of writing an argumentative essay is understanding your audience. It is essential that you understand all of the factors in the situation surrounding your issue. All rhetorical situations contain five basic elements: the text (in your case, the essay), the author (in this case, you), the audience, the purpose or purposes of the communication, and the setting. Create a catchy title. Come up with a thesis statement. Your thesis statement will be a concise idea that sums up your view on the issue. Write an introduction. Write the body of the paper. Carefully present information that supports both your argument and opposition. Write a conclusion. Collect details from custom essay writing service and read the samples. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat is your strategy on writing an argumentative essay?\u201d Above all, be intellectually honest. Appeal to evidence and logic. Don\u2019t fudge your evidence or employ dishonest arguments to make a rhetorical point \u2014 that\u2019s disrespectful to your audience. It\u2019s not enough that your assertions be plausible or convincing, they must be true to the best of your ability to discern the truth. Cite evidence from trustworthy sources. Use primary sources when possible. Don\u2019t regurgitate talking points. Learn the common formal and informal fallacies and resolve to never use them. Do not misrepresent anything. As a lawyer, there\u2019s nothing I like better than being able to tell the court my opponent has misrepresented the facts or the law. (On this point, see my answer to When researching, do lawyers read through all of the relevant cases that might be a precedent?) Don\u2019t insult the intelligence of your readers by resorting to strawman arguments. You\u2019ll only fool the ignorant. Everyone else will conclude you\u2019re not to be trusted. Be honest when discussing the other side\u2019s arguments. Don\u2019t just say they\u2019re wrong, explain why they are, objectively. Where the other side\u2019s arguments have genuine merits, acknowledge them. Defang those arguments, but do so honestly \u2014 point out they might not be applicable in this situation, for instance. Tailor your argument to your audience if you can, but that is not a license to pander to your audience\u2019s prejudices. Strive to develop a reputation for intellectual honesty. This may not seem important on a school assignment, but it really does matter whether you make a living with argumentative writing or just want to be respected on Quora. ",

            "answer_text": "The best strategy for any essay is to know your audience, and tailor your essay to suit their tastes. If your audience is, say, a middle-aged male teacher, then you should have that in mind while writing the essay. Don\u2019t write it like you would an essay to someone your own age or a friend. What does your audience care about? Make sure their concerns are addressed. Younger people tend to care more about things like freedom and equality. Older people tend to care more about things like safety and stability. If you were one of my students and were arguing for, say, allowing students to leave school for lunch, the freedom argument wouldn\u2019t work on me. I don\u2019t give a damn about how free students feel. I care about their safety. You\u2019d want to address that concern first. The next strategy for an argumentative essay is just like live debating: take away your opponent\u2019s argument before they even make it. You should know both sides of the issue you\u2019re arguing about. Pick your side, state your best argument for your side, then explain why the best argument for the other side is wrong. That\u2019s the step many people forget. Here\u2019s an example of that kind of \u201cpre-rebuttal\u201d tactic: Matthew Bates' answer to Why is school choice generally opposed by liberals? ",

            "answer_text": "Put your pen down and think for a moment. Decide your side.Mentally map all the points that you want to cover. If possible, group similar ones together.Stick to the same side throughout, whether you are for the topic or against it. Remember, you are presenting an argument. Don't switch sides. Choose your argument carefully and stick to it.The basic format of the essay remains the same. The introductory paragraph should be concise and clear. The body can be divided into two to three paragraphs depending upon the word limit. The conclusion should be brief and crisp.Avoid extensive vocabulary, complex and run-on sentences, and figures of speech as far as possible. Anecdotes and idioms are acceptable provided you limit the quantity to about two of each.Your argument should be clear, informed, and precise. Avoid over the top language as it may break the flow.Indent your paragraphs despite what your teachers might say. Reading blocks of text is boring. Indentation makes your essay look formatted.Last but not the least, be confident in what you write. Nervousness, confidence, arrogance; these can be detected from your writing.Thank you anon! I have my English exam tomorrow and you have given me a quick revision. Hope this helped. Happy writing! ",

            "answer_text": "Understand the purpose of an argumentative essay. The purpose of this type of essay is to fully investigate an issue or topic. This involves extensive research covering all aspects of the topic and gathering information on all involved points of view. Understand the methodology of an argumentative essay. To prepare yourself to write an argumentative essay, it is crucial for you to fully immerse yourself in the subject material. Understand the desired outcome of an argumentative essay. In the end, the main reason someone chooses to write an argumentative essay is to attempt to sway another person or group of people in their opinion on a subject. Selecting a Topic Choose something that fits the format. Remember that an argumentative essay will argue in support of a particular view in a debatable issue. As such, it is important that you do not choose a topic that is not arguable.Pick an issue that is interesting to you. You'll be spending a lot of time researching and writing this paper. So it is important for you to choose a topic that you find interesting from the start. Test your argument. Find a peer (preferably one that holds an oppositional view) to discuss your argument with. This process will help you refine your thinking and develop new ideas to support your judgment. Keep your audience in mind. An important aspect of writing an argumentative essay is understanding your audience. Are you writing the paper for a class, in which case your audience is your professor and your classmates? Or perhaps you are writing it for a presentation to a larger group of people. Regardless, you must think about where your audience is coming from in order to lead them to your desired outcome. People's backgrounds and experiences often influence how they will react to views different from their own, so it is helpful for you to be knowledgeable about these factors. Understand the rhetorical situation. It is essential that you understand all of the factors in the situation surrounding your issue. All rhetorical situations contain five basic elements: the text (in your case, the essay), the author (in this case, you), the audience, the purpose or purposes of the communication, and the setting. Structuring Your Argument Create a catchy title. Developing a creative, original title is a fantastic opportunity to hook your reader into wanting to reading more of your paper before they even get to the introduction. A good title will act as a \"preview\" for what your paper will be about. Many titles for academic papers come in two parts, separated by a colon. The first part is often a catchy hook that involves a pun on your topic or an impactful quote, and the second part is usually a sentence that sums up or provides details about your argument. Come up with a thesis statement. Your thesis statement will be a concise idea that sums up your view on the issue. The thesis usually appears at the end of the introduction paragraph. Having this idea in mind early on in the reading process will help guide your reader through the rest of the paper. You can refer Essay writing service to get help. Avoid the standard three-part thesis often taught to beginning writers. This format is constricting and limits the shape your ideas can take to being contained in three basic body paragraphs. Write an introduction. This section should briefly explain the essay topic and include relevant background information to familiarize the reader with the topic. As previously mentioned, your thesis statement should appear at the end of the introduction. Write the body of the paper. Carefully present information that supports both your argument and opposition. Acknowledge evidence that supports the opposition, but utilize powerful evidence to assert your claim. Write a conclusion. The aim of this section is to reassert your argument and persuade the audience to support your claim. Try to connect the essay topic to the interests and values of the audience. Be sure to review your main points and restate your thesis. But make sure not to introduce any new information in the conclusion so that you can effectively wrap up what you've already said. ",

            "answer_text": "Writing an argumentative paper means you are picking a controversial topic and writing to prove your viewpoint. ---- Here are two different example. A political example:Recent judicial ruling illustrate that every couple whether they are marrying the opposite sex or the same sex has every right to do so. It is time to inscribe gay couples rights to marriage in the constitution. A literary example:Jostein Gaarder's \"Sophie's World\" Jostein's Gaarder's \"Sophie's Workd\" illustrate teacher's inaptitude to teach effectively by manifesting a year's worth of history lessons in a single exciting novel. ---- The standard practice for writing any essay is the five paragraph essay.  1: Introductory ParagraphYou need a hook sentence, two or three at most. Then you briefly write the idea of your essay. Your last sentence should be like one of my examples, creating a sentence tying your whole essay together. 2: Detail Paragraph 3: Detail Paragraph 4: Detail Paragraph 5: Conclusion ParagraphThis might be the hardest paragraph to write. You do not want to add anything to your essay here. If it is a new fact or detail do not put it here! You only want to reword what your essay was about and tie in you description paragraphs together.  Since you are writing an argumentative essay you should write two description paragraphs that prove your view. The third paragraph should be proving the other side of the argument wrong.  Example: You are writing about legalizing gay rights in the constitution. 1: Stastical facts. Facts in general. Etc.2: An important quote. Answer why it should be legal. 3: Prove your point against a counter argument. People who want it to stay illegal are saying that the next thing you know people will want to marry animals if the US allows gay marriage. Tell us why that isn't true or if it's a good point have a counter argument to theirs.  --- Never use a fact or a quote without a reason. The next sentence that follows a fact or quote must directly relate that information to your argument. Never use information that does not directly prove your point. You always want to pick a fact or quote by someone or an organization that is important in that specific topic. Generally you don't want to use any more than 3 quotes at most. Be concise. Don't wander off your topic. You don't nenessarily have to write five paragraphs but it is simply a standard practice for those who are learning. You should only break the standard if you already mastered the skill. Or you are at risk to totally butchering your essay. Lastly, argumentative essays are written ALWAYS in the third person view point. Never write in first person or second person if it's essay for a teacher unless specified to do so. For example, do not use the words \"I\" \"She\" \"he\" \"your\" \"they\" Unless those words are in a quote. Good luck. --EJ@JenkinsWritings ",

            "answer_text": "There are, the three parts to an argumentative essay are: Introduction; Body; Conclusion. The introduction to an argumentative essay must be like any other introduction. Punchy and attention-grabbing. While keeping true to the issue at hand. An introductory paragraph that flows naturally into the main body of the text is essential to maintain the reader\u2019s interest. Aside from grabbing the reader\u2019s attention, the introduction also offers background information on the issue to be discussed. However, the most important element of this paragraph is, no doubt, the Thesis Statement. Let\u2019s take the concept of a Thesis Statement and break it down, because it is single-handedly the most important part of the essay writing process. What is a Thesis Statement? You probably have opinions on a lot of things. From the most trivial things, like the colour or shape of new cars, to more sensitive issues like animal testing, the death penalty, and so on. Some of these opinions will be more subjective than others, according to your background, upbringing, financial or social position, etc. But the main takeaway here is that these are your opinions and views on the matter. Your opinion or view on a particular subject is the Thesis Statement. It is a one-sentence statement that lets the reader know your interpretation of the subject being discussed. Think of the Thesis Statement as a one-sentence summary of the argument you\u2019re about to make in your essay. It is your interpretation of the subject, not the subject itself. Let\u2019s take an example of a perfectly workable introduction for an argumentative essay, including a Thesis Statement, to make your writing life just a little bit easier. In fact, we\u2019ll give a bad and a good example of a Thesis Statement, so you can see the contrast between the two. Bad example Imagine you\u2019re writing an argumentative essay about, say, the internet. Specifically, how the internet has improved the lives of so many people. A bad example of Thesis Statement related to this would be: The lives of many people worldwide have seen a great improvement due to the internet. Now, this is bad, right? Not only is this sentence vague and imprecise, but it is also very lazily written with passive voice all over the place. Furthermore, it raises a lot of questions: How was this achieved? Whose lives, are we talking? About exactly? Good example Consider this instead: The advent of the internet heralded a new era of worldwide unity, enabling instant, real-time communication with anyone, almost anywhere on the planet. Better? Right. ",

            "answer_text": "Establish need for the argument you intend to make with a statement that seems counterintuitive or which demonstrates a recent large change. Back this up with strong statistics from a reputable source. Make at least three argumentative statements concerning the topics you\u2019ve broached. Finish with a thesis statement that describes exactly what you intend to demonstrate with your paper. As for the rest, discuss each of your three (or more) argumentative statements in their own section, in the same order they appeared in your introduction. Finish the paper by summarizing your arguments, again in the same order, along with a summary of the material you\u2019ve provided to support them. I also used to finish papers with another strong argument tying the three main arguments together. Also, try to anticipate how your arguments will be attacked, and compensate for this: play devil\u2019s advocate. Finally, don\u2019t fill the paper with quotes, paraphrase wherever you can, and only quote sources that say things in a way that you could never improve upon. Also, I would caution against beginning your paper with a quote, because people who do this tend not to focus on what is being said as much as the name recognition of who is saying it. This is innately counter-intuitive, because the simple fact that someone is widely-known does not mean they are an expert in the field they are commenting on. For example, Jeff Bezos and Jack Ma routinely answer questions on a ridiculously wide variety of topics, and because they are internationally well-known and respected ecommerce billionaires, people listen to them. However, if they are being asked about anything other than ecommerce, I\u2019d take what they have to say with at least a small grain of salt. ",

            "answer_text": "Original question was on finding a topic for an argumentative essay, not on how to write one. I do have a comment on the revised question. If you are in high school or in your first year of college, the teacher assigning something as important as an argumentative essay should be spending a class or two \u2014 maybe more \u2014 on instructing you. A teacher should have, and probably does have, lesson plans on essay preparation, at least as handouts. The fundamentals of thesis statement, organizational structure, honest use of sources, and acceptable documentation should be presented in class. After Freshman (college) year, you should be on your own, but presumptions about your readiness to write fact-based essays seem unfair, given the diversity of backgrounds in most college freshman classrooms. Original inquiry: finding a topic for an argumentative essay It depends. Some argumentative essays can be written on topics within your own range of experience, such as advocating a change in the drinking age from 21 to 19 or advocating limits on high school Advanced Placement courses, often being paid for by increased property taxes. Other topics might require thorough research, like making a prediction about increases in drug-related violence as an effect of cutting drug supply. I think argumentative papers on \u201cunintended consequences\u201d are very compelling. Raising the drinking age encourages binge drinking; bad publicity about for-profit fundraising has hurt charitable organizations; cutting the drug supply invites violence. Be careful. Do the do-able. Once, a student was working on a paper espousing the merits of \u201csafe tanning.\u201d She couldn\u2019t find any corroborating sources beyond a couple of glamour magazine and had to abandon her paper.

            "answer_text": "Hi! As a student, I\u2019ve had to write a lot of argumentative essays. Here\u2019s what I do to get A\u2019s on my papers. Don\u2019t go with the usual introduction. Your english prof is going to have to read how many dozens of papers and I\u2019m sure s/he doesn\u2019t want to read a similar introduction in every one. Although it is tempting, steer far away from the usual \u201cThis is the book title and author, brief summary of argument/plot, thesis\u201d. I would recommend finding a unique point/personal anecdote that also can be incorporated into your essay. For example, let\u2019s say I am writing a paper about dogs being the best pets. I might say something along the lines of: \u201cMy dog, Blue, is an Australian Shepherd. He and I have been best friends for the sum total of seven years (49 for him). Though he can be a handful sometimes, he has fully convinced me that dogs are the best pets.\u201d. And then you can go on with your thesis/rest of introduction. My other big tip would be don\u2019t do the \u2018fun-fact\u2019 introduction. Please do not start your essay with \u201cSource A demonstrates that ___% of people prefer dogs over any other creature\u201d or something like that. Though it\u2019s an opener that a lot of people are taught to work with, it oftentimes shows an inexperienced writer. Make sure you clearly introduce what side you are arguing. Don\u2019t waffle. Don\u2019t sit on the fence. Take a firm stand and stick with that through the rest of your paper. If you are qualifying (showing the good and bad of both sides) make sure you still take a stance. A qualifying paper is not a qualifying paper if you do not take a side. Aim for clarity in your argument and a good thesis statement and I\u2019d say that you\u2019re good to go!

These two are basic ways. If you are a rookie then go for these two options. But there is another way where you can show your writing skill and perspective. The conclusion can be surrounded by the premises. You can use your witt to be sarcastic and humorous in justifing your view. In this way you can use less words to say what you want. But few things you should always have in handy before going for argumenting essays. The premises should be clear and worth convincing. You can give hidden assumptions too that will be hard to find. People will easily point out thinking it as your mistake and that will be show time for you to make them realise their low witts. I hope I made you understand everything. All the best. ",

Once you describe the \u201cother\u201d side, give your own point of view together with evidence to prove your position is correct.

Answer and defend \u201cWhat is the best reason Charlotte helped Wilbur in Charlotte\u2019s Web?\u201d Charlotte helped Wilbur for several reasons. Those being procurement of food, to keep her web and egg casing safe and out of friendship. Charlotte helped Wilbur for easy food procurement. When Charlotte spun her web over Wilbur\u2019s pen, it was an ideal location. Pigs eat many types of food and generally are kept in a muddy pen. These conditions are hugely beneficial to the fly population. Therefore, Charlotte was in an ideal location to easily catch flies in her web. Charlotte helped Wilbur to keep her and egg casing safe. A pig sty is rarely cleaned and the corner she picked was in a warm dark place further hiding her web. Also, the web was protected from the elements unlike spiders who spin webs outside. Damage only occurred when a fly was caught instead of being shredded to pieces by a wind storm. Therefore, Charlotte was in an ideal location to protect her web and egg casing. Charlotte helped Wilbur because of friendship. Charlotte cared about Wilbur. When we first meet Wilbur, he is alone and scared. Charlotte calms him and in that moment, she begins to have a fondness for him. That fondness blossomed into true friendship when he was going to be slaughtered. Out of friendship, she wove into her web, \u201cSome Pig.\u201d The friendship between Charlotte and Wilbur blossoms to the point that Charlotte leaves her egg casing in his care when she dies. The friendship became the paramount reason that Charlotte helped Wilbur. As outlined above there were several reasons why Charlotte helped Wilber. Those reasons being to catch flies easily, to protect the web from the elements and because she loved Wilber as her friend. Of these reasons, her love and friendship were the most important reasons why Charlotte helped Wilbur. ",

Lastly, the less you\u2019re trying to convince someone of the easier it is to do so.

            "answer_text": "Imagine you\u2019re telling a person they\u2019re wrong in a civil, long-winded way that they could not refute if they tried, and start with the formal version of an \u2018excuse me, you\u2019re wrong\u2019. Your essay body is \u2018these are all the reasons why you\u2019re wrong\u2019, and the conclusion is \u2018so therefore you are in fact very wrong: let me just briefly remind you why exactly you are an idiot\u2019. The introduction should include a very short answer to the question and a sneaky peak of what you\u2019ll be looking into (imagine the start of a documentary in which they say, \u201cI\u2019ll be travelling to such and such places, meeting a llama and finding out the meaning of true happiness\u201d or something like that). The middle should have about three paragraphs in order of how strong the arguments are. You should always include in each of these paragraphs a very good argument for the other side of the debate just so you can tear it apart, and make sure to add references (if you\u2019re writing an academic essay) just to show that you\u2019re clever and all the professionals agree with you too. Then the conclusion should include a \u2018so you see, this is why I think this\u2019 as a summary of the essay at the end. And there you have a good essay. A good idea if you have a word limit is to roughly give each paragraph a word limit of its own, just so you don\u2019t stray too far from the original word limit. (And now I\u2019ve stopped procrastinating on Quora, I should get back to my essay.) ",

            "answer_text": "To write a killer argumentative essay, begin with a strong thesis statement that makes a claim about an issue about which people may disagree. You can choose one side or the other to argue. Example: Technology, such as cell phones and the internet, are ruining people\u2019s ability to communicate in person. Then determine at least three reasons why this is true. Provide reliable evidence to support these reasons, such as statistics, statements from experts, historical or scientific evidence, specific examples, and/or results of case studies. Use rhetorical appeals. See this link:  Conclude the essay with a call to action which may be either for the reader to act, to change their mind, or to research and decide for themselves.

It doesn't matter if you have to stretch the prompt a little, make sure you're invested. If you care about what you're writing, you will instantly have a good paper.2.) Forget about writing. Argue. Pretend you're just talking. Yeah, you need a little bit more organization than a casual conversation, but you should approach all arguments as if you're simply discussing your opinions. Formality is overrated. Whether you're writing for an English professor, a physics professor, or for the general public, everyone would rather hear a concise argument than one that sticks to the 12 step paragraph. ",
