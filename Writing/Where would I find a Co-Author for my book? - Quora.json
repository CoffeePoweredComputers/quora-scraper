            "answer_text": "First of all, read David Carew\u2019s answer very carefully. All the serious writers I know (and I know quite a lot of them) are of the same opinion. They don\u2019t need anyone to bring ideas to them. They come up with plenty of their own. In fact sometimes those ideas come at very inconvenient times, like when you\u2019re struggling with the muddle in the middle and this juicy idea comes along to tempt you away \u2026 Second, you need to understand that co-authoring a book is an extremely serious commitment, as serious as marriage. If you manage to publish the book and it does well, you will in most senses of the word be married to that person. Your financial fortunes will forever be tied. Therefore, if you\u2019re going to co-author a book with the plan of publishing this book, you have to put together a legal contract that outlines not only who\u2019s responsibility is what and how you\u2019re going to use and divide the proceeds (are you going to forward a certain percentage to funding future projects together? Split it 50/50 and do what you want with it? etc.) but you also have to decide how a parting of ways will look. If you part ways before the end of the project, who will \u2018own\u2019 it? Can one person \u2018buy\u2019 the other half from the other, and how much would that cost? What about future books based on the same idea or world or characters? Can you write spin offs or series individually, or do you always have to work together? There are other complications. Who has \u2018final say\u2019 if there\u2019s a stylistic dispute? A characterization dispute? Who writes what? Are you going to outline together, or will one person be mainly responsible for the outline? How detailed will the outline be? How about character \u2018control\u2019? If you\u2019ve divided up the characters, can the other person take control of your character to finish a scene, or do you have to literally write together? Do you alternate chapters? Will you both work on revisions? Will you have working deadlines? What if one person writes faster than the other, or one person has a serious writing weakness that impairs the work? Will the other person fix any problems, or will the two of you hire a developmental or copy editor to work with you? How will you cover expenses in that scenario? What software will you use? Will you have a style guide (like the Chicago Manual of Style) or use a program like Grammarly? These are not the sorts of things that you want to work out on the fly. You may want to read articles about co-authoring, and maybe talk to some co-authors if you happen to find an event like a convention or a library event where authors tend to have readings and talk about craft. Hopefully this will make it clear to you that you can\u2019t just find some random person whose writing you like and form a business partnership with this person. You\u2019re going to have to get to know someone. I haven\u2019t read this book, but it\u2019s the only one I found with a quick search and it might be worth reading, since the reviewers agree that they cover the basics. Co-writing a book: Collaboration and Co-creation for Authors - Kindle edition by J. Thorn, Joanna Penn. Reference Kindle eBooks @ Amazon.com. Where can you meet writers? I recommend the forums, mainly the K-boards Writer\u2019s Cafe and The Absolute Write Water Cooler, and Nanowrimo (National Novel Writing Month, though that\u2019s a bit of a misnomer because it\u2019s international now. The main event is in November.) I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "You have to broadcast in writing groups. Wattpad, Google plus, facebook. There are always people looking to co- write with you. This is the public way. But the problem is you wont always find people you would like to work with. It will be hard to explain what you meant. But if you are serious enough you can keep looking. Other than that if there is any writing clubs near your residence, you can always look there. Libraries are a great place to start your own writing club. ",
