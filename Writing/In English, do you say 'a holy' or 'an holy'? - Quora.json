            "answer_text": "It depends. In the UK, officially, all \u2018h\u2019 words are treated as if they start with a vowel - an hotel, an historic moment, an holy night. That\u2019s because \u2018h\u2019 isn\u2019t exactly a consonant, it\u2019s more of an additional breath before the vowel. If you listen to people speaking \u2018RP\u2019 or \u2018BBC English\u2019, which is basically the standard UK upper-middle-class speech that you\u2019ll hear up and down the country with only a relatively minor variation in regional accent, they\u2019ll usually speak it that way, especially if they\u2019re being careful to speak \u2018properly\u2019. But almost no one else will do it. Some regional accents drop the \u2018h\u2019 altogether, making it more like \u2018an \u2018oly night\u2019, often elided into \u2018a noly night\u2019. And when people do voice the h, they\u2019ll usually treat it as a consonant: \u2018a holy night\u2019. Generally, using \u2018an holy\u2019 will make you sound rather self-conscious unless you are in very formal circumstances. Alan Bennett wrote a famous comedy monologue mocking pompous religious sermons that starts by quoting the Bible verse: \u201cMy brother Esau is an hairy man, but I am a smooth man\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "A simple rule describes how to deal with words beginning with the letter \u2018h\u2019. If the \u2018h\u2019 is aspirant (that is you can hear it, as with \u2018hotel\u2019 or \u2018history\u2019) then it is preceded by \u2018a\u2019. If the \u2018h\u2019 is silent and you hear only the vowel that follows it (honour, honest, hour) then it takes \u2018an\u2019. \u2018Holy\u2019 has an aspirant \u2018h\u2019. Some dialects, particularly those in London, don\u2019t aspirate words when they should. This is called \u2018dropping your \u2018h\u2019s\u2019. Other people do the reverse. ",
