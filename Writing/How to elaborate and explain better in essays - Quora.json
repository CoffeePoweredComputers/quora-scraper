            "answer_text": "Elaborating on points is simply providing more details, more thoughts behind the point you\u2019re making. Essentially, you have to approach the writing from the audience\u2019s perspective: what questions does the reader need to have answered? It varies depending on the kind of essay you are writing, but the key is to try to write to a specific audience. Students tend to write to the teacher which is fine, mostly, unless they tend to be a bit too literal and decide that they don\u2019t need to elaborate for the teacher because the teacher knows all. I\u2019d tell my students to write to a teacher who hasn\u2019t read the literature and is not familiar with it. So they would have to be very clear about what happened in the story, who the characters were, why the character\u2019s actions or thoughts or words were important, and so on. Sometimes it helps to set up a dialog with yourself as you are reading the paper. One of the participants in this is the reader/audience: Writer: \u201cRomeo brought about his own destruction due to his impulsiveness.\u201d Reader: What do you mean by destruction? Writer: His death. The death of his love for Juliet. Reader: Which is more important to the play? Writer: His death because Juliet dies because she finds him dead. Reader: Does his love for Juliet really die? Writer: I don\u2019t know. Probably not. Reader: What do you mean by impulsiveness? Writer: He acts without thinking. Reader: How? Writer: Well, he puts himself between Mercutio and Tybalt and that results in Mercutio being stabbed. Reader: Anything else? Writer: Just falling in love with Juliet and getting married was pretty rash. Reader: How so?. . . . Sometimes you have to dialog every sentence to pull out the ideas that matter. Elaborating shows a deeper understanding of the material you are presenting and dialoging sometimes helps draw out more information than you need, but that\u2019s okay in the long run. If you cannot dialog the essay in your head, you can talk out loud\u2014 one of my students actually recorded himself talking through his essay. I think it started for him as a joke, but it did help him writer better. Certainly if you can\u2019t do the dialoging by yourself, many universities have writing centers where someone can help you talk through the essay and figure out if you\u2019ve covered all the bases. Good luck. The last link here is aimed at teachers, but it\u2019s got some really good advice.

            "answer_text": "The first step in developing a story or essay is learning to add sufficient information. In many classrooms, the recipe for improving support and elaboration is to \u201csprinkle\u201d a piece of writing with more details. But randomly adding details without relating them to the overall purpose of the writing rarely improves quality. Students often have difficulty elaborating on action in their narratives. Many beginning writers rush through the action in a story, condensing it into a few short sentences. Just as slow-motion replay helps television viewers understand the action in a sporting event, good writers can slow down a moment, breaking down an event into a moment-by-moment replay of the action. Although most students would rather watch the movie than read the book, books have an advantage over movies because they let the reader inside the characters\u2019 thoughts and feelings. Beginning writers, though, often neglect to include either their own or their character\u2019s thoughts and feelings when they write. ",

Though you can use a help from a professional essay writer on this site http://assignmenthelpers.com.au/essay-writer/ and he will help you to elaborate points better, I\u2019m sure. Firstly, I think that a good research can actually help you understand the topic and each point of it, so do it. Secondly, you can train to describe and explain easy things to yourself, or friend/Gf/bf. Finally write more essays or other paper, because the practice is the main thing in every direction. ",
