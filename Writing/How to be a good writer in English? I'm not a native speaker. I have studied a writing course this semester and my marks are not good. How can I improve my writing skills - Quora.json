            "answer_text": "I have a technical background. \u2018I think a lot of people get into technical subjects because they don\u2019t like to write. Paradoxically, people get higher positions in Technical areas if they know how to put together well written proposals to get money for projects. After I was out of the country for several years, I wanted to speak better and write better. I was not interested in literature or history or in writing about them. I was interested in writing generally or from a scientific perspective. One professor at USC asked \u201cWhat is \u2018good\u2019 writing?\u201d He concluded that good writing is what people considered to be good writers do. There are a number of books to help us to become better writers. I also learned a lot after I did a lot of writing and taught writing. At one point, I was on a writing project and another person on the project said \u201cwhatever Don says, use that because it is what we want to say.\u201d A US Navy captain gave me the text to edit and he made the changes in the word file. Oh, do some editing. It is easier to edit the writing of others than it is to edit our own writing. The process is to write something, let is rest for a few days, then edit what you wrote. Edit then rewrite for about 5 or 6 times. Then let someone else look at it. Others may have some objective views on what you wrote. One last thing\u2014be more concerned that your ideas are clear to you. The grammar and spelling can be reviewed by someone who is a better speaker of English than you. It takes years. Read a bunch of stuff, edit some writing. (Some books are not well-written.) Read some advice on writing critically. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d recommend reading, speaking, and writing in English as much as possible. Reading will show you how accomplished writers shape their words. But the key is not to copy what they do. For example, reading the classics is a great help in building your knowledge and vocabulary, but a lot of the \u201cclassics\u201d were written decades or centuries ago so the language is old-fashioned and the styles very distinctive. Your own writing still needs to be your own. I\u2019d suggest reading current popular writers as well as the \u201cclassic\u201d authors. Practicing your spoken English, with native speakers if possible, will also help a lot. Most people write very much like they speak: that\u2019s how it comes out sounding natural. Just keep in mind that spoken English can be informal, so sometimes your writing might need to be more formal. Most importantly, keep practicing your writing! Writing well in any language is hard and English is particularly hard. If you can, ask a native speaker to read your writing and ask them how they would have written it. Grammar and style books can help, but a real reader can best tell you if your writing is clear and readable. ",

It doesn't help everybody but it does help some people. Write sentences. Just sentences. Writing courses usually don't start with sentences. They ask for essays but you can't write a good essay if your sentence writing isn't strong. Write ten sentences every day and have someone edit them for you. Write simple sentences until you're getting them correct and then move on to compound sentences. Write ten separate sentences - not a paragraph - about the perfect birthday party. ",

Also if you can get your hands on back copies of the London Review of Books and the Times Literary Review; or for a US approach, the New York Review of Books and the New Yorker magazine. Newspaper and magazine websites are usually subscription only. However, the Guardian can be generous, as is the New Statesman, both politically left of centre. . . or the Spectator, right of centre.

Hope you will deal with this ;) ",
