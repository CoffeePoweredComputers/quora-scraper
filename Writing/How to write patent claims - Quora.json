            "answer_text": "Claims are the most important part of the patent application. Claims decide the scope of the invention and what exactly the inventor will receive as protection. Claims are broadly of two types: One part claim and two part claim. Both One part and Two part claims describe the independent claim however two part claim use the term \u201ccharacterised in that\u201d in the independent claim where the text after characterised in that is considered as the actual invention which inventor seeks protection on. One part claim is used for US patents and Two part claim is used for EP patents. Also, in India two part claim is preferred. Claims have Independent claim and dependent claims. Independent claim covers the most essential part of invention without which the invention won't function. Dependent claims cover additional features of the invention. To write claims, one should get hold of key features of the invention. Out of the key features select, most essential features that will go in independent claim and rest in dependent claims. Different people follow different startegy for claims. Some prefer claiming the entire system in one independent claim and the entire method/process in another independent claim. Some prefer claiming invention from device perspective such as host device, receiving device. Refer to some granted patents of the jurisdiction you plan to file a patent in, to get hold of certain patent related terms. Further, makes sure the claims clearly convey 1. Inventive step 2. Novelty 3. Industrial application, as these three are essential for patent grant. Keep practicing to get good at drafting claims. Get in touch if you face any troubles.
