            "answer_text": "Yes, it is possible. Is it probable or even remotely likely that what you write will be any good\u2026 I\u2019d say no. Famously, Stephen King wrote one of his books (The Running Man, writing as Richard Bachman) in 72 hours. That\u2019s 3 days flat. But then, this is Stephen King we are talking about, one of the most prolific writers of our time, writing at his most insane speed. Personally, I took 3 months to write my book. But that was after 2 years of thought marination, prep, and scribbles. And I took those 3 months off work and life. And it took another 4 years of editing rounds by me, my agent, and my publisher, before it was finally out. But maybe I\u2019m just slow. A novel can have between 50,000 to 150,000 words (going from the slim ones to the fat ones; not counting the super-slim or super-fat ones). Let\u2019s say you\u2019re aiming for 50,000 words in a week. That translates to 7,000 words a day. If the novel is ready in your head and just needs to be typed out, then that\u2019s nothing. Even at a slow typing rate of a 1000 words an hour, you\u2019ll pull it off in 7 hours. If you need to think it up from scratch, 7,000 words can take weeks. Finally, a novel is like food. There\u2019s a certain joy to a dish that has gone through marination, prep, slow cooking, resting etc. And there\u2019s a certain convenience to a microwaved plate of mush. It depends where your priorities lie, I guess. ",

            "answer_text": "This question begs other questions, so please forgive my equivocation. A typical novel is between 60,000 and 80,000 words, give or take. Let\u2019s assume 70,000 words so the math is simpler. That means 10,000 words per day for seven days. I\u2019ve had good days where the words flowed from my fingertips, and I may have even reached 10,000 words on my best day. But that\u2019s dumping straight from brain to keyboard, never pausing to edit what I\u2019ve just typed. And sustaining that for seven days would be very difficult bordering on impossible. But let\u2019s say you can do that. What do you have after a week? 70,000 raw words that will require numerous editing passes before the work gains any credibility. So, it depends on your definition of \u201cwrite.\u201d Dump 70,000 words into a computer? Yes, as long as your brain doesn\u2019t freeze up and you maintain yourself with food and rest. Generate a credible product? No. By the way, National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) is held each November, challenging folks to write 50,000 words over thirty days, not seven. If you\u2019re serious, I recommend attempting NaNoWriMo and see how that works out for you. Best wishes for numerous sequential 10K days. ",
