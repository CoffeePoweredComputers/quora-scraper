            "answer_text": "I wrote this an hour ago for part of my present novel..curious as to what others think\u2026still needing feedback on my style, and especially my dialogue and punctuation. etc\u2026 \u201cEzra, how would you describe what a Nazi is?\u201d Michael looked over his desk at his patient. The boy had spent nearly three years locked away from the world. Old at fourteen, Michael could see how Auschwitz had aged him. Aged him in ways that would never go away. Yet he saw hope in the boy\u2019s eyes, the reality of where he was; real now. The past was a nightmare of sorts, one the boy wasn\u2019t sure wouldn\u2019t come back. \u201cDoctor, I\u2019m not sure I understand the question.\u201d \u201cEzra, call me Michael. We\u2019re going to have a lot of these conversations, so we need to get comfortable with each other. \u201cThanks doct\u2026eh..Michael\u201d. They smiled at one another. \u201cIs Adelaide coming to pick me up today?\u201d \u201cI think so, she wanted you to see your new home. Maybe spend some time there with her.\u201d \u201cI know, but I don\u2019t really know her. It\u2019s a bit strange, this whole situation, one moment I\u2019m in a Nazi camp, and then; well I\u2019m here.\u201d \u201cTime will heal you Ezra. Your brother is a loss you have to deal with, and Adelaide as well, since she was married to him for so long. Now let\u2019s get back to what we were talking about. We can discuss your other concerns as you continue to see me.\u201d Ezra went silent, looking out at the court-yard to his right, the windows looking out on the greater New York skyline, repeating Michael\u2019s question. \u2018It was a hard one,\u2019 wondering to himself where to start. \u201cWhat is a Nazi? I\u2019m not sure i can describe what a Nazi is. When I was younger, I think I was seven when I first really paid attention to what my parents were talking about. In the beginning a Nazi was just a man or woman, even some of my friends in the youth camps that were springing up everywhere. One day we were in boy-scouts, and then on another day they were disbanded, and some of my friends were in the youth camps, not letting us join. In the pause Michael stopped writing his notes. \u201cDid you join any of the Nazi youth camps?\u201d No; but I wanted to, and then my parents explained, that they wouldn\u2019t let Jews join, even if I pretended like others did, my parents weren\u2019t going to let me join.\u201d \u201cDid many pretend?\u201d \u201cNo I don\u2019t think so. I realize it was fear that drove so many to hide in plain sight. Some I know joined the army, knowing after some time they could not get out of Germany. A lot of us tried to get out in 1940 when the Germans invaded our home in Belgium; but it was to late. We just went from farm to farm, the growing resistance underground was some help, and some of the American and Allied relief organizations did get some kids out; but both my brother and I were to old. The youngest, those that could not fend for themselves were first; but there were so many, that we quit waiting, and just started running and hiding.\u201d Michael waited. \u201cI know, I\u2019m skirting the question. Smiling as he said it. One of his first Michael thought. \u201cA Nazi is just a name, and in the beginning it was just a party to follow or not. My parents laughed at them in the beginning, though within a very short time; I think when they took over the brown-shirts, that was when we all started to fear what was happening. It wasn\u2019t just another infantile leader yelling at the top of his voice. The economy was bad, the reparations from the first world war, were destroying our country, and people were looking for a scape-goat. We Jews have often been the first casualty when the social purging\u2019s start.\u201d \u201cIs that something your father said, or you.\u201d \u201cNo, my father said it a lot, so did a lot of people I knew. When the Germans had us in the beginning it was just German soldiers, doing there duty as they saw i,t rounding up all the Jews and sending us to processing centers. We were told that we were being deported; but where we didn\u2019t know. Others; the non-Jews, were conscripted to use as slave labor in the factories as the war grew, and confronted the rest of the world. We were hit, and beaten; but the real abuse started when the Gestapo showed up. That was when I started to see what a Nazi was. The hand of the Fuhrer; Adolf Hitler, laying his hand on us for the first time. First they separated us from our parents. I was eleven at the time, my brother; Adhemar, was I think fourteen.\u201d \u201cThe same age you are now: Right Ezra?\u201d \u201cA tear slid down the boy\u2019s face, still dealing with the loss. It was nearly forty years since the war ended; but for Ezra, it had only been weeks since his escape, and in the process of his escape, his brother had died; Adelaide\u2019s husband of over thirty years. \u2018Ezra was right,\u2019 Michael thought, this whole situation was so surreal. Ezra\u2019s voice continued as a monologue that seemed to be pushed out, by the pressure of his grieve. \u201cNazi\u2019s became real to me when I saw one hit my father across the back of his head with his rife. That was the last I saw of him, or my mother. Adhemar fought them off for a second, and I jumped in also; but I was so much smaller than my brother. I was just picked up by one of the soldiers and taken as I watched them drag Adhemar away. Addy was bleeding; but fighting them every step of the way. He was wonderful; but of course we lost the fight and both of us were locked up in cells. Separate cells. The beatings and interrogations went on for several days, with little food, and of course it was mid-winter, so it was cold as well. I just remember it like a dream now. Eventually we were put on a train and shipped to Auschwitz. I knew what the Nazi\u2019s now were; but up until then I don\u2019t think I really did. I started to understood , as they were shoving us up the ramp and packing us like sardines in the train cars. The smell of cattle was strong, and when I heard one of the German officers, talk about needing another car for the rest of the animals, I knew what they thought of me; really for the first time. I suppose that\u2019s my answer to what a Nazi is Michael. It\u2019s a person that does not, or cannot feel empathy for those different from themselves. I don\u2019t know how they cannot feel or see the spirit of life within us; but they didn\u2019t. There were some soldiers, that you could tell that it bothered them; but they did what they always do at home with so many homeless bums on the streets, they turned there heads, and looked the other way. I suppose that\u2019s the first step of becoming what a Nazi is, the ability to turn away from those you see in need. I grew to know the Nazi mind, as I watched several children around me in the dark of the train-car suffocate from the pressure of all those around us. The ones that froze, the old and sick, they all stayed on their feet in death surrounding the living, as the pressure of the bodies around them would not let them rest even in death. I was in the corner, when Addy saw me shoved up the ramp, and fought his way to the car I was pushed into. The solders didn\u2019t care so long as you went in. Without him to protect me I would have died like so many others in the car.\u201d The boy was in a daze, the memories choking his spirit, were boiling out like some festering malignancy. Michael had seen it before, specializing as he did with the Jewish community, so many refugees or prisoners from the camps. \u2018But never one so young.\u2019 \u201cI think I went numb in the train car we were in. Addy was holding me, pushing back against the pressure of those around us, as one by one they died around us. He put his jacket around me to keep me warm; but also to blind me to those faces that just kept stared at me. We were in that car for nearly three days before the attack came from the underground came, stopping the train and helping many escape. We were separated, as the Germans started to shoot at us. Another man pulled me back from the door, saving me then, even as I thought Addy had died. I cried, I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d Tears welling freely again at the memory. \u201cYou want to know what a Nazi is, a bit of a bite in Ezra\u2019s voice now. It\u2019s an evil you cannot describe, you can only list their perversions. A Nazi is a man or women; we saw both at the camps, who can shoot a child our of his mother\u2019s arms and just get thrown them in a hole. A Nazi is a malignancy that can target practice on women and children as they walk around the camp starving. It\u2019s woman, who can walk past the wires looking at a five year old looking back, starving, and laugh at what they see.\u201d Michael uncrossed his legs and sat up, the noise breaking the haze that Ezra was in, slowly coming back to himself. \u201cEzra that\u2019s enough for now, Sarah\u2019s waving out the window that Adelaide is here. Let\u2019s go to lunch, she\u2019s paying;\u201d he quipped. Ezra shook his head for a moment, and Michael give him time to take a breath and breathe out the anger, and some of the pain with it. They both stood up, Michael putting his hand on the boy\u2019s shoulder. He could feel the bones underneath, the near starvation still showing from his recent experiences. They walked out to the women waiting outside. \u201cHi Adelaide, ready for lunch.\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019m famished Michael,\u201d smiling as she ran her fingers through Ezra\u2019s hair. Why don\u2019t you come with us Sarah?\u201d Both Michael and Ezra chimed in for her to come. They were both a bit enamored by Sarah. Ezra for being the normal; if somewhat damaged fourteen year old; but Michael for the reminder she was to his dead wife, and her sister. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s really quite simple: you write a villain protagonist. See, a protagonist doesn\u2019t mean the hero. The protagonist is simply the person through whose eyes the audience sees the story. They\u2019re the ones who change the most during the story, and their actions drive the plot. Nowhere in that description does it say that this protagonist is a good person. Villain protagonists are rare, but they do have a proud legacy. Take one of my favorite villains ever, Macbeth. We watch him go from an honorable general to a treacherous, paranoid monster, and yet we still feel connected with him throughout, because his flaw exists in all of us. The same applies to characters such as Michael Corleone.   Now, as to how I would go about this? Challenge your audience, make them feel uncomfortable. As terrible as it is to admit, many normal people, over the course of the Nazi regime, participated in horrific atrocities. I would make your protagonist not some evil sociopath, but a normal person, with a family, interests, and people he loves. Have him, over the course of your story, slowly grind away his own doubts about the Nazi regime, rationalize more and more evil, until the fundamentally good person we saw in the beginning is gone, replaced by another cog in the machine of genocide. Monsters aren\u2019t born, they\u2019re made; using a Nazi protagonist to remind a reader of the potential for evil that exists in us all sounds like an excellent idea to me. ",
