            "answer_text": "If you are simply trying to learn the basics of screenwriting, then no. Although, if you are considering this prestigious school, then I have a few criteria that you should look for: The screenwriting instructor should not give you the worn out piece of advice: \u201cWrite what you know\u201d, because when you write what you know, there is a high probability that you may be writing what the audience has seen like a zillion times already. The instructor should encourage you to write what the audience knows on whatever topic your script is about. It's kind of like writing an academic essay where you find out what your target audience (the reader) knows about the topic and what new information you can bring to the table. Same with your script. What is something new that you know about your film that your audience doesn't know about the film. Think long and hard about that.The screenwriting instructor teaching the class should encourage you to come up with quality ideas rather than just take an idea of yours and help you write the screenplay. Industry readers and critics alike are purposely looking for anything and everything wrong with your screenplay.The screenwriting instructor should set up workshops that will allow you effectively formulate descriptions that are visually concise, and that will leap off the page so that your storytelling capabilities using words keeps the reader interested.When the first class commences, the instructor better not ask the question: \u201cWhy do we watch movies\u201d. Why do we watch movies? This is a screenwriting class. The more appropriate question/discussion within the class should be: \u201cWhy do we tell stories\u201d. You might want to refer to the heavily popular book: Sapiens.As an alternative and as a cheaper option, I would recommend you consider visiting the website of ScreenwritingU | Screenwriting Classes, Services & Products (ScreenwritingU) and learning more about the screenwriting course they offer, because the founder is an expert and the course is based on what the founder refers to as an expert model.

            "answer_text": "Screenwriters craft blueprints for the material manifestation of imagination. Our work is done at the friction point between the formless and the physical.  USC\u2019s rep as a preeminent film school is well earned. One of the best, no doubt. The teachers, the equipment, the legacy \u2014 somewhere in the world\u2019s top 5. To this day, I rely on insights from remarkable teachers like Howard Rodman, David Howard, Jack Epps, on and on. They\u2019re the real thing. If your question is, \u201cDo I need to go to film school, USC or otherwise, to become the best screenwriter I can be?\u201d The answer is probably, No. If your question is, \u201cWill going to a top film school like USC open doors in the film industry?\u201d Unfortunately, the answer is maybe. Some might even claim there\u2019s a bias against USC film students using their degree as a calling card. In some instances, they might be right. Why this bias? It\u2019s common for fresh graduates from top film schools to come off as \u201cbetter than\u201d by the fact of the program\u2019s exclusivity. Keep in mind, many successful filmmakers didn\u2019t get in or couldn\u2019t afford a school like SC. If you trigger egos in the industry, you\u2019ll get push back every time. More unfairly, the \u2014 \u201cUSC stands for University of Spoiled Children\u201d joke \u2014 is pretty much ingrained despite USC\u2019s objective excellence as an educational institution. The recent scandals of the wealthy buying their way into USC didn\u2019t help matters. Regardless, USC\u2019s exclusive status will get eyeballs on your script. The question is \u2014 is the price worth the read? Maybe. To say about film degrees, \u201cNo one in the industry gives a sh**\u201d might be a bit harsh. Yet, I\u2019ve heard that more than a few times. We all learn right away the gap between film school and real world filmmaking is about the difference between playing football at a top prep school and the NFL. Firstly \u2014 all anyone will care about is if your script is good. Secondly, they evaluate \u2014 can we work with this person? Benefit of film school If there\u2019s truth in what I\u2019ve said, then why would anyone want to goto film school? What are the benefits? The main value of going to film school is to meet other filmmakers. Paraphrasing USC alum John August \u2014 you goto film school to meet your collaborators, your support group, your rivals, your life-long friends, your life-long enemies \u2014 you go to find your community. You go to form your tribe. Your ability to garner and foster working relationships will be the determining factor of success as a screenwriter. An introvert such as myself hated to hear that way back when. I stubbornly clutched onto the delusion that my scripts will be so brilliant, my talent so undeniable, that I won\u2019t need to network, market myself, or approach my career as an entrepreneur building a business where the sole product was \u2014 me. Despite being an expert in screenplay structure, you haven\u2019t heard of me as a screenwriter, right? There you go. Talent is not enough. In the pros \u2014 everyone is talented. Everyone can write. \u201cIt\u2019s not who you are, but who you know that matters,\u201d is a half truth at best. Who you know may open a door or two, a time or two \u2014 but it\u2019s who you are that determines if you stay in the room. In the old days, you goto film school for access to the technology \u2014 for a chance to make a film. This has not been the case for decades. How many films has Soderbergh made on his iPhone by now? Didn\u2019t Sean Baker make his Sundance darling Tangerine on a iPhone 5? Not 11, not 10 \u2014 iPhone 5. So if going to film school to learn screenwriting may not give you the best ROI (return on investment), what BA degree would be most helpful in a screenwriter\u2019s career? In this screenwriter\u2019s opinion \u2014 Marketing Internet marketing to be more precise. Learn to market yourself. Learn how to garner and foster relationships. Learn how to pitch an idea. Learn how to sell an idea. Learn how to sell yourself. Learn about IP (intellectual properties). Learn about contracts. Learn about contract negotiations. Learn how to monetize your emotional labor. Learn how to monetize your words, your art. A degree in a marketing related discipline could be a source of income across lifespan. For the first phase of your career, you\u2019ll likely be working for the privilege of pursuing your art. If you can support yourself through means that generate passive income, you\u2019ll earn more free time to devote to a career path that will be predicated largely on back pay rationalizations. John August said this about finding agents and managers \u2014 \u201cRather than asking \u2018how can I find an agent or manager\u2019 ask \u2018how can an agent or manager find me\u2019?\u201d Great advice. How? Marketing. How did Diablo Cody get discovered? Look that up. Marketing. Do you have the skills to grow a significant internet presence? If you do, you\u2019ll stand above the fray and earn notice. Consider the odds What is the employment rate for screenwriters? The WGA website has all those metrics. Please look those up. Know what you\u2019re getting into. Meryl Streep said of acting (paraphrasing) \u2014 If there\u2019s anything else on Earth you can do, do that. For her, she had no other option. Acting was the only way she could fulfill her soul. Same goes for screenwriting. Writer or filmmaker? If you love writing for the words \u2014 meaning you love novels, poetry \u2014 you\u2019re a word smith, you love expressing through the literary art \u2014 consider this truth about screenwriting \u2014 The words of the screenwriter are not meant to be read by the audience. If you can paint emotive visuals like Cormac McCarthy through poetic descriptions, or reveal trans-generational trauma through a five page description of a grandfather clock like Stephen King \u2014 consider that those elements will be the first trash bin edits you make in your screenplay. Not the right medium. If you relish the perfection of a well crafted, grammatically true sentence - consider that screenplays are written in present tense, often grammar-violating fragments, at a 9th grade complexity level for optimal functionality. It\u2019s not about the words. It\u2019s about dramatizing actions and emotions. \u201cIt\u2019s not motion pictures, it\u2019s E-motion pictures,\u201d said a USC prof. We are creating blueprints to be interpreted and manifested by the director and crew. We are part of the filmmaking team. Features or Television? Feature film is a director\u2019s medium. Writers are often expendable. For every film that makes it to the theaters, there\u2019s likely many writers who were not credited. Television is more a writer\u2019s medium. The writers rule TV. So if screenwriting is your only option, strongly consider going into television. Employment opportunities far out number features. The caveat \u2014 TV writers work in teams. You have to play well with others. How apt are you in working in groups? Office politics? How apt are you in selling your ideas? How good are you at \u2014 marketing yourself. All comes back to marketing. I\u2019ll offer suggestions for learning the craft independent of film school. Scriptnotes podcast and I strongly suggest listening to the Scriptnotes podcast by two insanely successful screenwriters \u2014 John August and Craig Mazin.  John has a website that is a wealth of generously gifted information. You can search your question on film school for screenwriters on that site. Both John and Craig have strong opinions on that very topic. If anyone would know \u2014 those two would. If fact, I highly suggest you listen to every episode of Scriptnotes before making your decision. Get it from top industry, award winning, altruistic professionals. Get it straight from the source. John and Craig pocket not a dime from their podcast. They made it \u2014 and they want to give back \u2014 period. Rare. Role Models No need to reinvent the wheel. Choose role models in filmmakers with qualities you want to emulate. Choose role models more similar to yourself than not. Compartmentalize your role models for the specific quality you wish to develop. I\u2019ll go into detail of role model specificity as an example \u2014 Mindset role model: Justin Lin (Notice the specificity of the qualities I\u2019m role modeling) I refer to Justin Lin as the Kobe Bryant (RIP) of filmmaking. That guy can make a billion dollar juggernaut from concept to completion in two years. That is insanity. He made Star Trek Beyond organically, forming the script as he shot \u2014 as if he were making an indie. Fearless. (Notice how I\u2019m accentuating the specific targets of improvement) Justin has a warrior mindset, an engine that won\u2019t quit. No one out works him. He elevates those around him \u2014 because the better they are, the better the film. Show the same passion and work ethic, he\u2019ll give you a chance \u2014 because work ethic and passion are a film\u2019s life blood. Get in the way of the filmmaking, he\u2019ll dunk on your head. It\u2019s all about the filmmaking. Dedication, fierce desire to grow, no excuses \u2014 just get it done. I chose Justin as a role model for our commonalities. He\u2019s Taiwanese-American, he\u2019s close in age, from southern cal. Relatability in choosing role models is the key. I could have chosen Steven Spielberg (my filmmaking idol), but relatability would be an issue. It\u2019s too easy for me to say, \u201cYeah, but he\u2019s Steven Spielberg \u2014 the legend. I\u2019m nothing like him.\u201d By choosing a role model I share characteristics with, the realm of possibility focuses. In Justin, all my excuses are invalidated by the fact of his existence. When I feel like I\u2019m too old, I say \u201cJustin\u2019s my age.\u201d When I\u2019m too tired I say, \u201cJustin works till wee hours and is running miles before next day\u2019s work.\u201d More examples, in less detail \u2014 Emotional Intelligence role model: John August John\u2019s the guy they bring in to work with titans of the industry. He\u2019s not intimidating, but not the least bit intimidated. John is similar in age, not straight, and is not the ruthless assassin many feel they need to be in order to succeed. John is an example that kindness, decency, and integrity are strengths rather than deficiencies in the industry. Artistic role model: Ang Lee Again, he is Asian-American, from the same culture, got his break later in life, faced the same unique challenges that Asian filmmakers struggle with. Relatability. Trade knowledge role model: Ernesto Foronda Producer, writer, filmmaker, festival programmer. That guy sees and reads everything. Prolific in consuming and retention of content. My age-ish, Asian-American, etc. Relatable. Screenwriting role model: Chris Nolan Similar sensibility and cognitive approach to screenplay construction. I watch one of his films and I can almost see the ink strokes of his blueprint. I can go on and on. One relatable role model for each characteristic I\u2019m trying to develop. I have close to 30. Permission to write bad screenplays Writers write. If you\u2019re not writing screenplays, you\u2019re not a screenwriter. At the end of the day, you learn screenwriting by screenwriting. Give yourself permission to write bad screenplays. Write ten bad screenplays. See what happens. You learn from your mistakes, from wasting hundreds of hours going down blind alleys and story beats that belong on the editing room floor. Your success will be a function of your experience. How do you get experience? You make every mistake imaginable and learn from them. Great work if you can find it The odds are against you. The competition is fierce. If you can carve a career path in screenwriting, there\u2019s potential for a type of artistic fulfillment that is altogether unique. Screenwriters craft blueprints for the material manifestation of imagination. Our work is done at the friction point between the formless and the physical. It\u2019s one of the toughest jobs on the filmmaking team. You\u2019re starting from a blank page. The entire team from producer to intern is relying on your execution. It\u2019s terrifying and at the same time thrilling. \u201cScreenwriters are not special people, but I believe the craft of screenwriting is.\u201d (Craig Mazin). Doing it at a high level is as difficult as composing an orchestral piece, l\u2019ve heard musician-writers claim. Screenwriting is an art form unlike any other. If there\u2019s anything else on Earth I can do, I would. Do your art Lastly, read Seth Godin\u2019s, The Icarus Deception.  We are past the Information Age, moving into the Age of Connection. Connection is created by the conduit of art. Art is created by emotional labor. It\u2019s a new world. And the world is ready for \u2014 Your art. Thanks for the A2A. It\u2019s an important question for a big decision. Thanks for the opportuntiy to share. Grateful. ",
