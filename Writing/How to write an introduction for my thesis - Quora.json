            "answer_text": "You should be seeking guidance from the school you attend, not looking here or anywhere else online. I'm assuming just from the way you phrased your question, that you're writing a thesis you will have to defend in an post-secondary academic setting.  If that's the case, how would any of us \"helping\" you to write any part of it, be at all benefical for your future?  Hint, it would not. Please seek help from appropriate people at your school, including your peers.  What you are essentially doing asking by asking here, is wanting us to do your homework.  For your sake, I sincerely hope no-one gives you the help you're asking for. ",
