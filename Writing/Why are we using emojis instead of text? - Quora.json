            "answer_text": "Either we are lazy to text or it is just that we love emojis to express our feelings. Most of the people love to send emojis to their close friends,family members or any other special person in their lives whom they feel important because we send emojis to show our love and affection towards them in a special manner and that shows our love towards them. Even I love to send emojis to people whom I feel who are close to me .So there is nothing wrong in sending emojis rather than texting. Just that the person whom we are sending the emojis should not take it in a wrong way . For ex- any girl who is friend of yours you send her kissing emoji and she takes in a wrong way. That should not happen.Another example that I would like to share is that when we chat to our very close friend. He cracks some joke or sends any meme which is quite funny and we send \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 this emoji because we liked it. So it all depends upon our emotions and so emojis plays a great role in our lives and shows great bonding between two people which can\u2019t be expressed through texting. ",

Texts can be misunderstood sometimes and come across in a way I didn\u2019t intend it to. sometimes you aren\u2019t sure how to answer or what to say but you find a perfect emoji to talk instead of you. for example when I don\u2019t hear from someone for a few days instead of asking a question sometimes I put a \ud83d\udc40 emoji.. you know what I mean ?
