            "answer_text": "In my opinion: Wingsung 698 - I've written about this pen before in other answers, and I genuinely feel it's an amazing pen. You can get a beautiful pen with a smooth, slightly springy nib, and a piston filler for about $15! And some silicon grease to boot! How awesome is that? What's more, you can swap nibs from the Pilot Metropolitan/Kakuno into it, for a greater variety of nib choices. It's probably not the best option for a beginner pen since it's a piston filler, but it's great for pen users who are curious about different filling mechanisms and want to be able to dismantle their pens for easy cleaning and maintenance. Simply put, I cannot recommend it enough.Moonman M2 - there are a wide variety of nib sizes in this pen, including stub nibs for those who do calligraphy or simply enjoy that effect! For the adventurous, I have seen others swap TWSBI Eco nibs into this pen too, though I've never tried it myself. Personally though, I have never felt the need to do so, as the stock nib writes beautifully, even though I bought the EF nib! It's also a beautiful demonstrator eye dropper pen, which is uncomplicated to fill, stores a lot of ink, allows for easy checking of ink levels and gives you the pleasure of watching your ink slosh around in your pen as you write! Another fantastic and affordable pen to take note of.On the cheaper side, Jinhao pens are generally good, being both aesthetically pleasing and smooth. The QC on them is quite bad, but if you get a functional pen, Jinhao pens are unlikely to disappoint! They're cheap anyway lol, costing $2\u20133 for the most part excluding shipping, so I think it's not a bad pen to try!Of course, what top pens under $20 list could be complete without the Pilot Metropolitan? They are really smooth, if slightly stiff, writers which look much more expensive than they really are, and offer you a wide selection of designs to choose from. Personally, I really like the feeling of the Pilot fine nib on paper as well, it feels like writing with a smooth needle!Other more affordable brands you could look out for are Wingsung (like the 3008), Hero and Penbbs (though these are kinda pricey compared to the rest). Hope this helped! ",

            "answer_text": "If value is your overriding factor, no pen can beat the Platinum \"Preppy\" which comes in a variety of nib widths and ink colours. In the U.K. it retails for less than \u00a33. Replacement cartridges are more expensive than others, and you can only use Platinim cartridges in it. Its nib quality, especially for the money, is outstanding. More expensive, but a better pen all round, is the Lamy \"Safari\" from Germany. Good nibs here too. Both of these inexpensive pens have huge followings. Well inside your $20 limit. Slightly more expensive than your stated limit is the Taiwanese TWSBI Eco. It's a solid piston-filler with massive ink holding capacity and available in a variety of nib widths. It comes fitted with a German nib. I have several of all these three pens. But I use the Ecos most often (out of this trio, anyway) For all these I suggest you begin with a Medium nib. Those suit most people's needs well. ",
