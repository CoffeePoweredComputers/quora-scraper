            "answer_text": "Sekiro opens with one of the best cinematic scenes in a FromSoft game. Everything about that opening is different, the visuals are sharp and clear, and you can just feel that you are entering a new world. Once the game itself begins, it has that signature FromSoft style. The graphics are a welcoming sight to return to, though that is where the familiarity ends. The character of the Shinobi moves a lot more swiftly, but not once does it feel like the game controls will fly off the handle. The camera functions well even in small spaces, though it becomes an issue during boss fights. ",
