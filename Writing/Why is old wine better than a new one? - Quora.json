            "answer_text": "The taste of wine is dominated by a combination of sugar and acids, but most importantly, tannins. Tannins are phenolic compounds found in the stems, seeds, and skin of red or black grapes. A surplus of tannin is the reason why younger wines tend to taste so bitter. They bind with proteins that absorb your saliva, making your mouth dry and chalky, imitating the effect of eating a green banana or an unripe mango. Tannins are actually defensive compounds that deter fungi. They are tenacious preservatives, and despite making an unripe grape taste really nasty, they can make a bottle palatable for over 40 years.  Because the characteristics of a wine depend equally on the amounts of all its contents, the bottom line is that how well a wine will age must be determined by a ratio of all these compounds. A glass of oxidized wine is certainly more flavorful than a glass of suffocated wine. In the company of oxygen, tannins mature more conveniently to please our cheeks, gums, and tongue. Temperature changes also alter the characteristics of a wine. Wines are very sensitive to temperature, because increased temperature fuels oxidation, causing the wine to age prematurely and rendering it undrinkable. Rocky mountain barrel company is a very known name in the wine aging barrel industry. Visit the website to know more. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have stated, old wine is not always better than a new one. It is very subjective to begin with as you may personally prefer a more exuberant wine and therefore ageing will not be your friend. White and red wines can both age very well, but it does not guarantee improvement. This is a continual issue - we get asked regularly, \u201cwill this wine age?\u201d whereas the better question would be \u201cwill this wine improve with age?\u201d The suggestion that reds are your best option is short-sighted at the very least. Some of the finest aged wines that I have tried have been white wines: Zind Humbrecht Riesling Clos Windsbuhl 2001, Huet Vouvray 1986, Kistler Chardonnay 1996\u2026In terms of reds, again big heavy reds only is complete nonsense. The wine needs both acidity and tannin which you can think of as the spine of the wine. If sufficient, then the wine has the potential to age beautifully - so red Burgundy, & Barolo for example - and both are very light when it comes to colour. Ask your local wine merchant for advice - they\u2019ll be only too happy to give it. ",
