            "answer_text": "Google random plot generators and experiment trying to make a story from that. Like this one : Random Plot Generator While I\u2019ve never used them, and I think there\u2019s more blog-site generators than just site generators, they and any other randomly generated lists might help if you\u2019re having a frustrating blank-out bit of writer\u2019s block about what overreaching story arc to try to explore or a character\u2019s specific quirks to include as just part of them. Or if you need less help with plot and more with other occasionally frustrating details to think up without a base to start from, this is my go-to generator for specific real-world names: Fantasy name generators. Names for all your fantasy characters. Their sister-site, Welcome to Roll for Fantasy, has a few helpful guides for everything from combat to speech to even writing a story in a story. Odd place to get help or advice from, I know and I only use a fraction of the generators they\u2019ve got to help anyone stuck in a rut, but it\u2019s there if you want it. Writing about details or events that happen in your own life might be better, getting a random generator to give you points to start at might be more your thing, or even just picking up a piece of paper and a pencil and going to town on them by trying to describe a color in as many ways as you can without using the name of it might end up better for you. There\u2019s no real \u2018right\u2019 way, unfortunately. There\u2019s many possibilities, and more than have worked for others and yet more still that never will work for a specific individual because that\u2019s simply not how you work. Equally as unfortunately, if you\u2019re anything like me then English Literature or any other writing classes you might be able to get are not geared for you to use in your own writing. They are more designed to hit the broadest strokes of any class, to be comprehendible and help the greatest number of students rather than all of them. Not everyone, so if you feel the way you\u2019re being taught and the way you want to write is different\u2026 it might just be. The best anyone can do is try by doing. And then immediately try again, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard of an author that liked the very first thing they ever wrote even a few years after they wrote it. I sure didn\u2019t.

            "answer_text": "It depends on the type of book you would like to write. If you want to write a long novel then I'm not your guy but I've had a idea growing in my head for a while now that I may execute any day. The Book of Dreams Yes yes yes, generic, boring, overused blah blah blah. I'm quite an avid dreamer and I can go from the mellowest of dreams where I am just taking a walk through a forest to random ones where I'm racing my Gran through New York. As most people know you can have a great dream, tell people about it all day then forget by the next day. What if you took these dreams and documented them, overexaggerating if you must, and published it for everyone to see in the form of short stories. This way you could do one dream per day, one short story per day. Not even having to worry about inspiration and literally doing it in your sleep. Even if you don't want to publish just having it as an exercise to write fiction is an experience itself. HAPPY WRITING! ",
