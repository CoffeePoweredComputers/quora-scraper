            "answer_text": "Who are these people who \u201cdeserve\u201d to be homeless? In the United States there are 2.5 million children who are homeless. I have been a high school teacher for nearly 30 years and during that time I have had numerous students who were homeless, struggling to keep up with their studies while living out of a car or spending nights in a homeless shelter. I have volunteered at homeless shelters, where many, if not most, of the people I encountered were families. On any given night 1/3 of people experiencing homelessness are families with children. Of the 36 most developed nations in the world, the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty, with 1/4 of our young people living in poverty. Do these children \u201cdeserve\u201d to be homeless?  Image  Image Domestic violence also contributes to homelessness. Sixteen percent of the overall homeless population reported experiencing domestic violence. Research from a study in New York City indicates that one in five families experienced domestic violence in the five years before entering shelter. Among families that reported domestic violence in the prior five years, 88% reported that it contributed to their homelessness. Half of homeless women say domestic violence was an immediate cause of their homelessness. Do battered women \u201cdeserve\u201d to be homeless?  Image Many other homeless people are those suffering from mental illness, unable to get treatment. Thirty-nine percent of homeless people have some form of mental health problem. Do the mentally ill \u201cdeserve\u201d to be homeless?  Image There are about 60,000 homeless veterans in the United States, making up 12% of the homeless population. Many suffer from post traumatic stress disorder, disabilities, or substance abuse. Many of these veterans risked life and limb for America. Do these former warriors \u201cdeserve\u201d to be homeless?  Image  Image According to figures from 2017, more than one in every eight Americans is living in poverty (40 million people). And almost half of those are living in deep poverty, with reported family income below one-half of the poverty threshold. Are we really to assume that 1/8th of the American population is simply lazy? Many poor people in America are \u201cworking poor.\u201d Of the nearly 9 million families in America below the poverty line, approximately 60% have at least one family member who is employed. The U.S. has a much higher rate of working poor than other developed countries.  Graph Do people who go to work everyday, yet still live in poverty, \u201cdeserve\u201d to be homeless? The main cause of bankruptcy in America is due to a major illness or astronomical medical expenses. A catastrophic illness, especially involving a family\u2019s primary breadwinner, can wipe out a lifetime of savings and even put that family on the street. Do those who experience catastrophic illness \u201cdeserve\u201d to be homeless? There are many reasons for homelessness. Almost none of them involve laziness, a lack of ambition, or a desire to cheat taxpayers in order to live the easy life. Homelessness is not a punishment most people \u201cdeserve\u201d for some character failing.  Graph It is certainly easier to dismiss the poor as people who live in poverty because of their own moral defects. Otherwise we have to ask ourselves difficult questions about fundamental problems in our economic system, as well as our own personal responsibility for addressing greater societal issues. It is much more comforting to just think of these people - many of whom are battered women, veterans, the mentally ill, or children - simply as bums who deserve their fate. The uncomfortable alternative is to wonder, \u201cthere, but for the grace of God\u2026\u201d  Image UPDATE: Los Angeles County reports that their homeless population increased by 12% this year, with Los Angeles proper seeing a 16% increase. Overall 59,000 people are sleeping on L.A.\u2019s sidewalks. So, ask yourself, does 16% of the population of L.A. suddenly \u201cdeserve\u201d homelessness? Or, is it more likely that wage stagnation, combined with a shortage of affordable housing, is causing the rise in homelessness? According to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, \u201cSkyrocketing rents statewide and federal disinvestment in affordable housing, combined with an epidemic of untreated trauma and mental illness, is pushing people into homelessness faster than they can be lifted out,\u201d Los Angeles homelessness rises sharply as housing crisis deepens ",

            "answer_text": "It's this kind of thinking in our culture that prevents us from supporting programs and policies that ensure all humans get treated as just that\u2026 human. So many times, I see that the issue of whether or not a person is \u201cto blame\u201d for their situation affects whether others think it's right or wrong to allow or provide a service. Americans will generally support the idea of giving housing, food, and medical support to a person who can't hold a job because they are blind, but not someone who can\u2019t hold a job because they do drugs. Some say overweight people should be forced to buy a second seat on airplanes because they view obesity as a choice and a lack of self control. Others argue obesity can be a medical condition beyond the victim's control, therefore the seat should be free. There are even some who would allow a woman to get an abortion if she were raped\u2026 but not if she were a slut. (Horrifying way to phrase it, I know, but this is literally the mindset. ) So you really need to ask: are all human beings entitled to certain basics, such as food, housing, accomodations for disability, and abortion (or, conversely, should the life of the baby be protected regardless of its mother's guilt or innocence in its conception?) Or can we say, \u201cWell YOU don't get it because it's your fault you\u2019re in this situation\u201d? Let's look at that list again. Food. Shelter. Disability accommodation. Right to control over your own body. Or the baby's right to life. And we're going to grant or deny that based on how deserving the person is? Your question brings to mind a solution to homelessness and unemployment a couple centuries ago in England. There were these things called workhouses. People who could not work/afford a home, be it through disability, financial ruin due to poor choices, or general lack of employment opportunities, could check into a workhouse. They received food and shelter, but they were not given real work. There was not significant real work for them to do. But they could not simply be allowed to NOT work. Oh, no. Just to make the population feel like poor people weren't getting handouts for free, they were given menial tasks, like picking nits, to keep occupied all day. Let's compare this to Finland's solution. Finland is currently distinguished by having virtually no homelessness, while other EU nations are struggling with record highs. How do they do it? By giving all the homeless homes, with NO qualifications for who does and does not deserve one. This means that the very same day a person becomes homeless, they can go to the office and immediately be placed into a flat\u2026 not a group shelter or dorm but a cheap yet acceptable personal apartment. This is a permanent home. There are no emergency shelters or waiting periods. Nobody is questioned on why they are homeless. They are simply given a home immediately and without question, because to Finnish people it is unacceptable for any human being to be without a home. And it works great. Many of these people thrive once stable living conditions are provided. People who have not worked in years find steady employment, people struggling with addiction are able to more reliably attend rehabilitation services, and people who could have been ruined by a few months of homelessness during difficult times are able to keep their lives on track. Sure, some Fins are probably kicking back in their free flats and playing video games all day, but nobody else minds. The overall effect on society has been an improvement, with less crime, less unemployment, and less cost overall for human services. (Yes, building homes and paying utilities for homless people results in lower government costs overall than the costs incurred when homeless people are handled the traditional way. For example, an individual living in a home visits the hospital less than if they were living on the streets.) So what do you think? Maybe we can try an approach that's grounded in compassion and respect for all human life? Or do we have to lie awake at night grinding our teeth over the fact we're working a hard job for our home and some lazy bum out there is living for free? Would we really ask ourselves what people \u201cdeserve\u201d if the permeating message throughout society were that all of us, every single one of us, by virtue of membership in the siblinghood of the human race, is deserving of dignity, security, and compassion? What if all we could think about was how to lift each other up instead how to tear each other down? ",

            "answer_text": "Wow, that's a hot-potato! But yes, I do believe some homeless people deserve to be homeless, but only in the sense that we are all responsible for the decisions we make, whether stupid or out of fear or ignorance. Choices have consequences. It might not seem fair, but it's how life works. If I choose to buy drugs and alcohol with my money and not pay rent, do I \"deserve\" to be homeless because I'm a bad person? No. I would be homeless because of bad decisions. \"Deserve\" is a word that speaks to a person's character and smacks of a statement or judgment about a person, not about their actions.  Some homeless people are forced to make choices - like, do I want to buy my medication, the stuff that keeps me alive every day, or do I want to pay rent? Most choose life on the streets rather than no life at all. Do they deserve to be homeless? No. Did they make a bad decision? No. They made the best decision they could. When you start asking if people deserve something, you set yourself up as judge and jury. Unless you know a person's story and the reason they're homeless you can't really know what happened, and therefore you can't really judge them fairly. Many of the alcoholics who are homeless became homeless after losing a loved one, a child, a spouse. They turned to alcohol to self-medicate their pain. They didn't/don't deserve to be homeless. They encountered unbearable grief and did the best they could with the resources and information they had. They don't deserve it, but as a result of choice and consequences they have what they have. Being \"deserving\" is about punishment and reward. I'm not comfortable saying anyone deserves to be homeless. I am all about pointing out to the homeless that bad decisions got them where they are, and good decisions can get them out. We all have varying degrees of the ability to make different decisions to change our lives. I believe empowering the homeless with the decision making skills they need to change is more effective than deciding if they deserve what they've got or not. ",

            "answer_text": "The Homeless? A few thoughts and a couple of experiences I\u2019d like to share. I graduated from the Los Angeles Police Academy in May of 1977. My first division of assignment was Central Division and my first job, there, was walking a foot beat on Skid Row. It was the area east of Spring Street toward the L.A. River, and south of 3rd Street to around 7th Street. This was a time before the word, homeless was used to describe the people living there. Transients was the operative term for the many men and few women who lived there. Alcohol, drugs, mental illness, and often times, the combination of all three were the primary reasons for people being there. Sprinkled among the shivering denizens of the area were a few predators. The ones whose drinking or drugging habits were either fairly manageable, or non-existent. They knew there was money to make from desperate alcoholics and addicts, and flesh to plunder of the almost comatose women\u2026and men\u2026who could not fight off sexual advances. There were, back then and as there still are, church-based missions. Organizations who could feed, shower, and sometimes offer a cot and blanket to the men who lived on the street. There was one which only assisted women. Still another which could take in children with women, located elsewhere. But there were times I\u2019d ask a guy on the street, \u201cDid you try the Mission?\u201d Only to have him reply, \u201cNo, they have too many rules, I\u2019d rather be out here.\u201d That conversation would happen more often than the offer to be taken to a mission was accepted. In any conversation about the homeless mentally ill, inevitably, the name Ronald Reagan is brought to the table by today\u2019s (so-called) progressives, blaming his presidential actions on the tsunami of mentally ill people who suddenly found themselves on the street. Having lived in California my first 50 years, I can tell you it was wielding his pen as California\u2019s governor which set them loose. Those same, Reagan-haters always seem to forget that it was the California Legislature, being urged on by those who (supposedly) advocated on behalf of the mentally ill, compelled Reagan to set free the ones who were, \u201cnot a danger to themselves or others and not gravely disabled\u201d. Most mentally ill people fall well below that line, yet they are unable to navigate the paths usually followed by the mainstream populace. SIDE NOTE: I wonder how it is that people call the police to deal with the homeless and/or mentally ill and seem to expect a miraculous outcome of some sort. The cops get called and we\u2019re supposed to have a shower, a warm bed and a hot meal within 30 minutes of contact, along with employment and secure storage for all their earthly possessions? This person\u2019s issues have gone on for months, years, perhaps decades and in 15 minutes the cops are supposed to solve what parents, teachers, doctors, nurses, and mental health workers have been unable to prevent or fix prior to the call to 9-1-1. I always want to know, what the CALLER did, prior to calling. You\u2019re angry at the cops because they \u201cdid nothing\u201d or \u201cdid the wrong thing\u201d. What did you do? What services did you refer the person to? Did you even ask them their name and get their back story? You\u2019re so compassionate \u2013 what did you do before you made the decision to call the police? As my career went on, as the general population of the city went upward, so did the amount of street people who seemed to be finding Los Angeles to their liking. Greyhound Therapy, created by both social service and law enforcement agencies in other parts of the country, found that buying a one-way ticket to Los Angeles for problem people seemed to be a pretty good deal. \u201cWinters here are so cold and snowy, James. Wouldn\u2019t you like to see Los Angeles, Venice beach or maybe Hollywood, where it\u2019s sunny all year?\u201d Soon, more individuals and families were on the streets, now joined by immigrants (legal and otherwise). In the 90\u2019s the homeless of Los Angeles were as diverse as the general population itself, with many languages and cultures represented. Some quick anecdotal experiences: Hiroshi was an exchange student who failed to adjust to college on the east coast, deteriorated in mental health and ended up on the streets of L.A. After learning his back story I was able to return him home to his family, in Japan. He had been gone seven years, and they had not heard from him in four. They thought he was dead. I learned his father broke down and wept upon seeing his son return home. Hiroshi\u2019s treatment seemed to help his condition, diagnosed as autism spectrum, after a few weeks home. Richard was in a wheelchair, on Western south of Santa Monica. Someone told me he\u2019d been on the street for weeks. As I approached him he began to roll away, as if in fear. I told him I wanted to help him. He said that most the time the cops just told him to \u2018move on\u2019. He got off the bus at the wrong stop and then lost his bus pass. He was an unreported missing person. I got the contact info for the assisted living home he stayed at. Two quick phone calls later, Richard (African-American) was in a cab headed back to his home in Long Beach, after being gone six weeks. Donny was barefoot, and had dried blood on his arms and head. He was in front of the check-cashing place on Hollywood at McCadden, at about 6:30 a.m. I asked if he was okay, and was there anyone I could call to arrange him getting home to. He told me he was from Chicago. His family was there. Every Monday and every Friday morning they wired him $250. He loved living on the street, being free of rules, even if it meant getting beaten up every so often and waking up in strange places. He wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Valerie lived in her car behind the McDonalds on Western near where I\u2019d found Richard. One day we transported her to a senior citizen\u2019s service center near our station. She met with a caseworker to arrange housing. I drove her back to her car. She swore up and down I\u2019d never see her again, living in her car. She was back a week later. Too many rules. She\u2019d rather be on her own. Dawn from Mississippi had left her double-wide after becoming enamored with Star Trek \u2013 The Next Generation\u2019s Capt. Jean Luc Picard (played by Patrick Stewart). Picard may have been conversing with other characters on the screen, but his subliminal messages were aimed at Dawn. She heard him say that she needed to come to Hollywood and await his arrival. She parked herself in one of the southern exposed alcoves on Melrose, near Gower. She did not eat. She did not drink. She never left to make use of any indoor bathroom. She did not protect herself from the sun. She just waited for Capt. Picard. Almost dehydrated and very sunburned with blisters, I took her in to have her evaluated by LAPD the Mental Evaluation Unit. Determining that she was \u201cno danger to herself or others\u201d I was told she was free to go. I was amazed and drove her back right to where I\u2019d found her. Then I read an article about a new L.A. County task force making on-scene responses to incidents with the mentally ill. I called them after finishing my reading. They were very interested in her. Not only was Dawn gone within 24 hours. Her story was in the Los Angeles Times touted as the reason this new task force existed. I heard the LAPD detective who told me to take her back was embarrassed by reading the story in the paper, to the point of altering his notes in case his bosses found out what had happened. Mark from Arkansas \u2013 after promoting to sergeant and being entrusted with the (then) newly issued cell phones, I met Mark in an alley near USC. His accent betrayed any pretense of being from anywhere other than a southern state. I ask him about his presence on the street, offering to mail & receive a letter for him, or even allowing him to use the cell phone to call family. He thanked me, but declined as he stated he had, \u201cno one to call.\u201d Sakke the Finnish Postman was enjoying his winter vacation in L.A.\u2019s Echo Park, where he eschewed showering, shaving, sleeping indoors and solid foods. He really preferred to drink all day and night with other homeless park-dwellers. It seems that Sakke always wintered in Los Angeles, overstaying any visa. In the spring, upon figuring out that Helsinki was probably thawing out, he would surrender himself to US immigration authorities for voluntary deportation, so he could get back to work. His superiors HAD to hold his job for him. Thinking about it, Finland\u2019s winters were probably as rough for postal workers as they were for invading Soviets and Germans. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d have rather invaded Southern California, as well. Sakke always returned to deliver mail, washed, shaved and rested, saving money for his next plane ticket to L.A. I wonder if he even bothered to pack for these journeys. So, folks, when we speak of homelessness we have to expand our presumptions about just who they are and why they are where they are. If society is diverse in regards to colors, genders, creeds, sexual orientations and national origins then the reasons for homelessness can be just as diverse. Just as there are victims, there are volunteers. People who have decided that their course is outdoors and away from rules imposed by others. We really could build shelters and serve three meals a day, give them cable TV, and let them choose from a dessert tray, even. Yet, someone will stay on the street for the freedom from the norm, and \u201cother\u2019s rules\u201d, that it offers. ",

            "answer_text": "No one deserves homelessness.  No one. Ever. Sadly, too many think they do, though.  And without much distinction of the different reasons for homelessness. I have been close to all the reasons. 1.  I had a cousin who was abused by his father his entire childhood.  His mother was too.  She divorced the asshole, but Johnny never recovered.  He never felt comfortable in any place for too long, was happier wandering the streets, and could be found flopping at any one of a number of homeless shelters in the city.  My Grandmother would bring him home and clean him up for the holidays, but he always went back.  He deserved better than the life he lived.  With a little therapy, he might have done better.  He passed away on the street a few years back, and none of us found out until some of the volunteers he knew dropped off his few belongings.   2.  Some friends in Virginia had bought a very nice home and had resided in it for several years.  The family was having bouts of a mysterious illness, until they discovered a black mold growing in much of the interior walls.  They had to move out, but didn't have enough to rent a place, so they depended on the generosity of friends and lived in a tent in a series of backyards.  The insurance claim was denied after multiple attempts.  This began over a decade ago, and last I heard, they were still not able to live in the house. 3.  The father of another family we were friends with about 15 years ago lost his job.  He was a veteran, as was his wife, but wasn't able to find any viable work.  His wife was unable to work, having had what was believed to be nerve damage from a rough childbirth, but it turned out to be multiple sclerosis  They ended up out on the street, having lost a nice house.  After about a year, he finally got a job, which paid enough for them to rent a house and get a used car.  She began classes to become  a lawyer.  However, he began having intense migraines and ended up losing his job again after a year.  They eked out a living for another few years in odd jobs and working some for their church, but after he committed suicide, the younger children ended up with one of the older siblings, and the wife, now bedridden, ended up with us for a short time until she found a more permanent placement. What many people fail to realize is that homelessness is not the fault fo the person who has no home.  To say they deserve it says much for the person saying it.  I hear so called Christians of all walks make this statement, thinking that anyone can better their lot in life if they just work harder.  This is rarely the case.  These are people most in need of help.  Not necessarily monetary or even public services.  Sometimes, a reference for a job application, sometimes just a few nights under a friendly roof. Part of the problem with homelessness is that, to get anywhere in the world, you need a permanent address.  To get a job, you need an address.  To get assistance, you need an address.   There is no shortage of people willing to create shelters and temporary housing for the homeless, but many neighborhoods believe having one in their midst will create more crime and public annoyances.  In some cases this might be true, but not always.  Many shelters, aware of these concerns, are very careful to prevent these problems. This means the rules to live in these places are usually draconian, with eviction as the most common result of infractions, which also prevents any future ability to utilize other shelters. The shelters that do get approved are usually in rundown areas or far out from the places where jobs and services can be found.  Transportation then becomes an issue. Many of those I know personally without a home are out of work due to the economy, or that their skills are obsolete, or they were let go because a younger, cheaper replacement had been found.  Getting another job after a certain age is difficult at best, and after being out of work for too long means you are less attractive since your skills are \"rusty\". ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think anyone deserves to be homeless. But, I do believe a good number of them did it to themselves. Homeless people don't come in just one flavor. There are, believe it or not, people who choose it over the alternative. There are people who are homeless but have shelter; such as living in a vehicle. There are homeless that are not chronically homeless, but are in temporary period because of a fountian of reasons. There are people wirh deug addictions and behavioral and emotional health problems. And these are the broad categories. You can break it down further. None of these people deserve to be homeless, but many of them set themselves up for failure. I did an outreach event in Colorado Springs with VFW to get homeless Veterans into shelters. It seemed like about every fifth person claimed to be a Veteran. In two days of talking over 100 people, most of them claiming to be Vets, we came across about 10 that were eligible for any assistance. We found a bunch of people who claimed to have joined, but never made it out of basic training. We found a few with other than honorable or dishonorable duscharges, thus disqualifying them from benefits. Our ten legit guys all turned down the offer of living in a home. We helped them max out their benefits, make sure they had proper ID cards and information on where they could go if they changed their minds or needed help and a number of other things. But, they prefered the streets. No rules. No responsibilities. We brought these horses to water, they wanted alcohol instead. Alon the way, we came across a bunch of other homeless people. We would hand out little care packages, compile data and give them information on charitable and government programs and organizations they could use. What surprised me among many of these people was how many were kind of new to being homeless. And theu were clueless about how to get help. They ew they could get a meal every day at Acacia Park in the middle of town. They new were the shelters were. But that was about it. They didn't talk to the other homeless folks because they were scared. They didn't talk to the social workers at the shelters because theu didn't think they could help. They didn't talk to the ecclesiastical people because they weren't church goers. They avoided the police because they didn't want to get in trouble. These people were usually in a vehicle. They had recently lost a job or acquired too much debt to pay their bills. At the time, the legalization of pot had drawn a lot of prospectors who wanted to get into the pot business because they were very ignorant of what they were getting into. It never occurred to them that being a pot head wasn't what the new industry was looking for. So now they're stuck in Colorado with no job and no family. None of these people deserve to be homeless. But helping them requires a tailor made solution and some effort on their part. ",

            "answer_text": "How does one deserve to be homeless? What an odd concept! If you are asking if they made poor decisions that led them to the situation? Many probably did. Most of us do every day. Not all, but many. Most of us live paycheck to paycheck, not planning for future problems. That was the one lesson I got out of being homeless\u2026to plan for a negative event that may destroy my normalcy. We live like we can afford to buy needless things and seem shocked when we learn we really never needed those things at all because we are a society of consumerism. Most of the people that I stayed in winter shelters with, seemed as if they had finally given up on any decent life. They had accepted their failures and even clothed themselves in failure now. There were those occasional ill-planned people who were fired or laid off from work, who had no savings and ended up on the streets. There were also several people who had terminal illnesses and no ability to care for themselves and no income to support themselves. I always hated that the shelters didn\u2019t seem to place them first as to me, they seemed the neediest. There were couples with children, where dad couldn\u2019t seem to get off his butt and seek a job because he would rather have government help and take his kids to the movies every day, or hang out at the park. Those used to nauseate me, because they hung out in groups being lazy and had no medical or psychological diagnoses that justified giving up. There were the usual hookers and drug addicts. But there were also actors and kids who didn\u2019t want to go home because they loved partying in the streets and called themselves neo-hobos. I don\u2019t feel anyone deserves to be homeless though. I think with all of the empty buildings in any city, there is a solution to where the buildings could house many of the homeless and with counseling, they could get their confidence back. Even through all the hateful and nasty homeless people I was forced to deal with\u2026people who threatened to fight me for simply looking at them, or people in electric wheelchairs that threatened to run me over because they were simply angry and mean, or even the meth heads that slept beside me in their bunk, staring at me and playing with themselves, I don\u2019t think these people deserve homelessness. Some deserve a swift kick in the ass for being disgusting, but they all deserve to have a place to live, even if it is shared with others. ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to voice a contrary opinion. They probably do deserve it. Assuming that what we \u201cdeserve\u201d is based on the decisions we make. Especially in the USA, people who are homeless are usually in that position because they made some really terrible life decisions. People in many poor countries would kill for the opportunities afforded even to the most disadvantaged in the USA, and homeless folks are people who have largely squandered those opportunities. However, I think that it is backwards, counter-productive, and wicked to make moral decisions based on what people \u201cdeserve\u201d. I have much more than what I deserve. As do most people, especially in my country. Those who obsess over getting what they \u201cdeserve\u201d probably would not like what they deserve were they to actually receive it. If I were to get what I truly deserve, I fear that I just might be the one living under the bridge. We should not be seeking to mete out what everyone \u201cdeserves\u201d. Not only are we not good judges of that, but if we really were to apply that standard universally, it would backfire significantly on us. When it comes to the homeless, we should not look at what they deserve. Instead, we should look at their potential. What can they become? What small investment can get them moving in that direction? Of course, by \u201cinvestment\u201d, I do not necessarily mean cash. Actually, in most cases, cash would not help at all. But they do need help, and we, acknowledging their worth, should give them that. Do we deserve to be saved from the undesirable consequences of our own poor decisions? Probably not. But we all seek that very thing, do we not? ",

            "answer_text": "No one \"deserves\" to be \"homeless.\" It is simply a state of being that a relatively few people in any overall populace find themselves in at various stages of their lives. I do have to disagree with Murray Godfrey; it couldn't happen to most people. Most people have a support network who they can fall back upon or they realize that they may have to change something about themselves to find shelter. The homeless people with whom I worked shared many commonalities, although the primary reason for their being homeless differed: They had damaged or non-existent ties to their families - Many people wouldn't be homeless if they had a strong family bond. Unfortunately, most of the homeless people I had met, had abused or misused their families to the point where staying with them (even briefly) was not an option.They frequently engaged in magical thinking - I have seen people take money which could have enabled them to find shelter and gamble it away. Or give to a charity when they desperately needed it for themselves. These people seemed to believe that they would somehow either \"win\" enough money to take care of their needs. Or that their charitable gifts would be rewarded by some higher power.They had problems with authority - The phrase \" I don't like people telling me what to do\" is mantra to many homeless people. While most of us chafe under the authority of another, few of us will allow that dislike to translate into losing a place to stay or employment. Unfortunately many people who are homeless, will allow their difficulties with authority to override their common sense and the needs of their families and they find that they are homeless as a result.They are often not patient - While most of us hate to wait, we all realize that it is another of life's unpleasant realities. Many homeless people (whether through mental or emotional illness, substance abuse or immaturity) take this to extremes. I have seen people leave lines to get into shelters for the night because (they said) they were sick of waiting. I have seen people leaving busy benefits offices where they were going to receive preciously needed funds, because they had to wait for them. I have witnessed people quit temp jobs because they didn't want to work overtime and wait until they got off to do what they wanted to do. A lack of patience often exacerbates homelessness.They could not plan - They literally would mistake ideas for detailed plans and then be surprised when those ideas were not sufficient enough to obtain them what they needed. Instead of sitting down (as they had plenty of time) and working out a plan (or plans) to get their lives back on track (if they ever were) they would bounce from one idea to the next, hoping that \"this one\" would be the one that would work. They were almost always wrong; and for myriad reasons, they were never able to see why this was the case.They failed to learn from their mistakes - Consistently failing to learn from one's mistakes is a key component to continued homelessness. If you can't reflect upon how your current situation resembles other situations which did not work, you will again make the same or similar mistakes that you already have. If you have a close-knit family, substantial savings and a good job, you can usually weather hard times. If you do not, you may find that homelessness is in your future.The homeless situation in America today was caused by a perfect storm of events,including: The closure of many state run mental institutions and the belief that the mentally ill could self-medicate effectivelyThe collapse of America's manufacturing base as a source of jobs for marginal or low-skill employeesThe collapse of the American family structure and the belief that \"leaving home\" despite financial insecurity was what all high school aged children needed to do.The belief by many that they didn't need to get married and that pair-bonding was somehow \"archaic\"The \"Baby Boom\" after WWII increasing the population.The end of vagrancy laws in many communities.The removal of shaming factors which prevented many from becoming substance abuse addicts or allowed that addiction to surmount their need to remain employed.The election of successive governments (at all levels) which were then not required resolve to effectively end the burgeoning homeless problem.No one should be homeless.Homelessness occurs when other issues are not addressed.

            "answer_text": "In essence, this question is asking whether or not we think human beings should be held accountable for the condition of their lives. My short answer: Yes. Being homeless is not a permanent, immutable condition, especially in the USA. Consider that in ancient Hawaii, we had a caste system and no land ownership. The lowest caste (kaua) were branded, treated as slaves, and considered \u201cuntouchable\u201d. In comparison, the homeless in America live in a relative lap of luxury as they have the entire welfare system at their disposal. As a Christian nation, we are extremely compassionate - sometimes to a fault. Many of the homeless in Hawaii are on drugs or drunk, committing crimes, and urinating/defecating on the beaches. I asked a Japanese friend who lives here why we have so many homeless. Her answer: \u201cBecause you allow it.\u201d Even if you disagree, think of it this way: Do housed people deserve to be housed? Do working people deserve to be working? Do healthy people deserve to be healthy? It sounds absurd, because it is. A housed person who pays their mortgage on time deserves to live there. A working person who does their job continues to work. A healthy person who takes care of themselves will be healthy. This is a universal law of cause and effect, whether we like it or not. There are consequences to the choices we make, even leading to homelessness. ",

            "answer_text": "The notion that anyone deserves anything is based on religious and political ideas of social norms. It is based on a puritanical notion that we only get what we work for. It is based on the idea that there is justice in the world and that we can know what is just and what isn't.  These are all social fictions. Myths. There is no there to these ideas. Rather, there is no objectivity to these ideas, although people act as if the notion that we deserve things is objective, when, in fact, it is purely subjective, or it is a conglomeration of many different individuals' points of view.  If there is no objective justice, then no one can deserve anything. We can have opinions about whether we approve or disapprove of someone's behavior, but to say that opinion translates into objective deserving is the height of self-righteousness. It is also, I would argue, the height of inhumanity. I don't want to live in a world where people deserve anything. We shouldn't have to earn the approval of others to do anything. We shouldn't have to decide, in our own minds, whether we are deserving before we allow ourselves to live. I've heard people say that half of the homeless are mentally ill. I've heard others say it's three-quarters. Some people are incapable of making a home for themselves. Some people don't want to. There have been times in my life, when I felt I did not deserve a wife, children, home, job or anything. I was hellbent on making them all go away because I knew I deserved nothing. Less than nothing. I deserved, in fact, to die. I am only alive because I have learned that deserving is a red herring. It is irrelevant. There is no deserving. Believing that there is deserving is a sign of mental illness for me, and I suspect it is the same for most people. Except most people can ask if they are deserving and answer yes. I cannot. Since I cannot, I dare not ask the question. For that way lies death. The fact is that I deserve to die. Now. That's what my brain tells me whenever I ask the question. That's why I cannot dare to ask the question. I don't want to die. Since I cannot ask the question of myself, I also cannot ask it of anyone else.  What I have found is that I prefer compassion. I don't deserve compassion. Neither does anyone else. But I do prefer it. Life is happier when I am compassionate and when others are compassionate. Things work better.  So let's help the homeless. Individually or as a society. It's easier when professionals do it. Lets help them get into homes and get medications and get jobs. I guarantee you that we will all be better off if we do this. They will be more productive, on average. So will everyone else. When you aren't mentally ill, you can do more things.  When I say productive, I don't mean productive as society might think of it. I just mean able to take on tasks and do more of them. It might be as simple as making a cup of coffee. Or getting out of bed.  The homeless don't deserve to be homeless. Neither do they deserve to have homes. They, like everyone else. don't deserve anything.  However, if we practice compassion, we and everyone else, including the homeless will be better off. We don't have to be compassionate. We don't deserve compassion. But I prefer it, and I hope enough other people do, too. ",

            "answer_text": "In some ways, yes. I\u2019m always interested in hearing people\u2019s stories about how they are homeless, because that\u2019s when I start asking questions. One guy said he was working as a contractor building homes. He said he\u2019s apartment burnt down, and he didn\u2019t have insurance, so he lost all his stuff, and started living in public housing. Then he didn\u2019t want to get a job, because if he got a job, then he\u2019d lose the public housing. This was played in class at college. That\u2019s when the teacher said \u201csee it can happen to anyone\u201d. Really? Where was his family? Where was her family? Why didn\u2019t they live with the family until he could earn a few dollars to buy new tools? Why didn\u2019t he get a job anyway? Yes he would have lost the apartment, but if he never gets a job, he\u2019ll be stuck there until he dies. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to lose the apartment, rent a tiny studio until he earns money, buy tools, and goes back to building homes? Where were their friends? Where was their church? Why didn\u2019t they have friends and a church family that could help? Where was the insurance? Contractors building homes are not cheap. He should have had insurance. Why didn\u2019t he have money saved? On and on, the list goes. There was another story I heard over the BBC. This guy lost his job, and just went to live in the airport. He lived there for couple of years. Finally he got caught by the police, and kicked out. He immediately asked someone for help, and they put him up until he got a job, and got his own apartment. So why was he homeless for years, when he could have ask them for help at the very start? Pride. He didn\u2019t want to have to ask someone for help. So instead he remained homeless for years. And I could get into a laundry list of other questions as to why he was homeless. Of course the brutal truth is that, at least here in America, could be different elsewhere, most homeless are \u2026 NOT homeless. We had a reporter follow a guy, and we walked a few blocks, got into a late-model car, and drove away. There are some people who end up homeless by circumstance, but few of those people stay there. The people that are consistently homeless for periods of time, often there is a reason. Something they did that made them un-employable, or something they refuse to do, like an honest days work. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think anybody deserves to be homeless, being homeless can be devestating to some people, and others it's another bad patch in life so either one really can be damaging to ones mental health and physical health too, because the weather can be brutal and there's so many dangerous people and things in the world, we never know when it just might be our last day so we don't want it to be because we were homeless in the cold temperature of January, or by someone hurting us which results in death or anything else you can possibly think of, it's a really bad situation to be homeless so I can honestly say I don't believe anybody deserves it, and I know there are so many people who earned it for themselves but there are so many that didn't it was just bad things that happened and everything went wrong to the point of being homeless, but no matter which one they are why would they deserve it, they are human beings who screwed up somewhere and they got a punishment for it which is being homeless, and I've seen stories of rich people who do much worse things than most homeless people have done, but they get to keep their happy lifestyle so why does a homeless person deserve to be out on the streets, I've been homeless a couple of times in my life because of stupid spending when I should have paid my rent, but I was younger and I didn't so I got to be out on the streets myself and I had to deal with it, but I was pissed off because all the good I've done in my life nothing came to save me, I was screwed and it was because of stupid spending habits so to a degree I deserved to be homeless, but not totally because I've always taken in homeless people when I could help them, because I knew that they were homeless mostly because of something stupid they did, and the other things are that the majority of homeless people have serious mental health issues that went untreated for so long and they do what they feel they have to in order to find happiness which usually costs them all their bill money and they become homeless, they never wanted life to be that way but it is, so they have to deal with it and move on whether they like it or not and that really is a big kick in the ass for them, but then they get real angry and start paying all their bills and get their place and they do nothing for nobody, then they get deemed a bad person so they just can't win, but then you see so many people who have life handed to them and they have money and no real worries in life but they do nothing for anyone and they say oh well sucks to be you to the homeless people that never had a chance in life, honestly I'd say most of the homeless people deserve to have a place to live with some money in their pockets, and the rich people who are just mean and don't care about anybody else, they should get to indulge in homelessness for a while so they can see what it's like to struggle and pray that they get dinner tonight, and hang out on the streets being scared of what might happen to them with all the bad things that happen in the world, then maybe they'd be a little forgiving and help people to get off the streets, but truly I don't think anyone deserves to be homeless.

            "answer_text": "\"Deserve\" To merit, to be worthy of, to qualify for reward, assistance or punishment because of actions, qualities or situation. This question - do homeless people deserve to be homeless? - assumes that homelessness is a punishment for a negative quality or behavior. So, what deeds would merit this punishment: lack of comfort, warmth, sound sleep, shelter from rain and snow? If we examine homeless people, we find a predictable set of issues that contribute to their situation: alcoholism, drug addiction, mental illness, limited intellectual ability, childlike incompetence, post-traumatic stress syndrome and/or catastrophic financial events. To simplify, you could just say mental illness. So, illness puts these people at a level of function below the minimum standards of our societies, to enjoy shelter? If we lived in a more primitive, tribal society, the same people would be able to fashion some kind of shelter for themselves, but modern society has a minimum financial threshold they cannot achieve. They cannot pay the vig to the middlemen that control housing here, that did not exist in the wild. Does the punishment produce any results? Does it help them to desire a home sufficiently to try harder? Does it improve their chances of becoming employed? Of course not. Homelessness is a cruel punishment we assign to the incompetent. It is a convenient, self-serving lie that their suffering is deserved, like saying a rape victim was dressed in an immodest way and so deserved assault, for insulting our morality. It makes us feel better about ourselves, to compare our relative success with hapless, unable people; like prize fighting the elderly, it makes us feel strong. But, do you know who else is incompetent to work, to earn and to pay? Innocent children. Though they may be intelligent, mentally stable, industrious and moral, they can and are made homeless. How do they deserve to be punished? How do you think homelessness changes a child? ",

As a Social Worker and manager of a specialist homelessness services program, I can do a deeper dive into the common experience of this cohort. The majority of people experiencing homelessness have also experienced some kind of trauma prior to their first homeless episode. The program I manage has been well researched. In that program over 75% of people had their first episode of homelessness (of any kind) before they were 18. 50% had an episode of rough sleeping before they were 18. That speaks to a pattern of instability so early in life that they were not able to develop the capacity to manage life\u2019s basic tasks independently. This results in people developing negative coping skills such a drug use. Additionally, a large proportion also have diagnosed mental health conditions. Couple this with the fact that there is little to no affordable housing and few long term support options make it extremely difficult to make significant change. I\u2019ve heard all the arguments about people choosing to experience homelessness, not wanting to work, etc. I can understand why people may think that but the reality is that the people I work with are so beat down that they have given up trying. The road back is too hard. They have little to no family support. I am well aware that there are outliers and people with individual different experiences, but in my career they have been the exception not the rule. No one deserves to not have a place to live. It is a travesty in this day and age. ",

            "answer_text": "It seems to me that in the 21st century this question should no longer be pondered. But since it is, I will offer my opinion. No one but no one deserves to live in the elements without access to the basic needs of food, sanitary conditions, and a safe, warm place to sleep. No one. You\u2019d be surprised by the situations that can put people in this situation. Before losing housing, people often lead normal lives. Generally, a life situation such as an illness, a job loss, drug dependency can prevent a person from being able to keep up with the financial responsibilities of keeping traditional housing. These are situations where people have often lost the ability to do for themselves in some capacity and need assistance, not judgment. Where the idea of judging people when they are in the most need started is unclear, but it has caused devastation to many innocent lives. It is a vicious cycle and it is easy to become caught in its grasp. A stressful situation may lead to drug use which people often use to cope. Drugs can become addicting making one ineligible for services. Children who were born to parents who wouldn\u2019t or couldn't care for them are literally put outdoors when they reach adulthood if they weren\u2019t fortunate enough to get adopted during their youth. There are so many scenarios that can cause a person to become homeless, none of which lead me to believe they deserve to live in that manner. Under the facade of a Christian, god-fearing nation, there are people who based on life circumstances often beyond their control will be misunderstood and may never have access to a normal life. Somehow we have come to believe that people experiencing homelessness are a different breed of human not realizing that horrific circumstances may have separated us from the rest of society. Whether those circumstances are a culmination of childhood trauma or an adult crisis matters little. What does matter is that homelessness is a horrible social It is and has always been a crisis. The sad fact that we live in a world that has normalized it by no means that anyone should be subjected to it. ",

            "answer_text": "No.  Most of the homeless people I've talked to were at one time \"normal\" people.  Something happened in their lives that they couldn't handle.  Many of them are borderline or have full-fledged mental illnesses that may have contributed to the crisis or their inability to adapt.  Addiction is often involved too, either before, during, or after homelessness. What's so scary about it is that it could really happen to anyone.  The sense that I get is, once you're on the street for a few weeks to a few months, you start to lose touch with your humanity and reality as you knew it.  People stop treating you the same way.  They want to avoid you, not acknowledge you, or both.  That's hard to deal with.  If you're not crazy before that, it will make you crazy after a few months.  Not many of us could handle it. This is why homeless rehabilitation involves multiple steps of relearning how to live and engage with society, and it is very difficult. I remember how my thinking on homeless people changed.  I was working fast food as a 19-yr old kid.  A homeless guy walked in, bought a couple items from the 99 cent menu with money he had been given.  Then, he asked for a job application.  The manager gave one to him, the man filled it out and turned it back in to us, then left.  The manager waited a minute, then threw it into the trash.  \"That guy would scare customers away,\" the manager said.   With that statement he meant much more - 1) a homeless man is not worthy of even a fast food job.2) He's frightening to \"normal\" people - even the kind of folks that frequent fast food.  Thus not normal himself. That's why I hate it when people say they just \"need to get jobs.\"  No one will give them one.  That's a big part of poverty that people overlook- the poorer you look, the more prejudice against you. ",

What have they done to deserve not having access to bathrooms, showers and personal hygiene or a reliable way to escape rain, snow, heat and storms? Yes, a portion of the homeless population are not interested in complying with the social mores and do things that would help themselves. A few even have the attitude that they \u201cdeserve\u201d a free ride. Many have serious mental health issues. Others are locked into substance abuse and criminal activity. But the majority of the homeless got there because of a cycle of social injustice that is nearly impossible to escape. And the vast majority of people simply have no concept of the nearly insurmountable array of challenges that perpetuate this life. Who in the US deserves to face the indescribable poverty that leads to homelessness in one of the wealthiest nations on the planet. ",

Yes, some people may have been pushed out of housing due to rent increases and that\u2019s unfortunate, but the majority of homeless I\u2019ve had the \u201cpleasure\u201d of running into are drug abusers, potheads, or healthy, young able-bodied family units who want a tax-free income. The salvation army has a branch not even 5 blocks away where they could go and apply for assistance, but they choose to congregate on streets downtown and use signposts and trash cans as a urinal. In the past, especially when it was cold I\u2019d get this one homeless guy near my neighborhood a coffee. Last winter I did the same thing for a different guy, but he proceeded to ask me to get him an expensive cut of beef and harrassed me for three days straight afterwards when I wouldn\u2019t. It was $20/lb & I wouldn\u2019t buy it for myself, let alone a guy cussing out myself and others walking past. Any \u201cgoodwill\u201d I may have had, he killed. If you\u2019re trying to do something about your situation I\u2019d be glad to help, but if you just want to get booze or drugs I\u2019m not going to be an enabler. Look at their shoes too\u2014if they\u2019re new/barely worn chances are that they\u2019re faking homelessness for handouts. ",

It had read \"Do you think all  homeless people deserve to be homeless?\"  Now it reads \"Do you think most homeless people deserve to be homeless?\".  This edit makes my answer seem like pointless nonsense. All we need is one counter-example to demonstrate that all homeless people  do not deserve to be homeless.   All we need is one mentally-ill person, with no family history to clue him in that he might be at risk (so you can't blame him for not taking steps in advance of onset), and with no legal guardian empowered to institutionalize him. I.e., someone who \"slips through the cracks\", and there are many such cracks.   All we need is one victim of domestic violence, of fraud, of identity theft, or of a myriad of other crimes, who is left with no resources of her own, and no family or friends able to take her in. All we need is one person of modest means who pursued a dream -- a risky dream, but one that was potentially lucrative, and one that we as a society encourage people to pursue -- who didn't achieve that dream and ended up with nothing. All we need is the child of any of these people.  You can twist things around for any of the above to try to pin blame on them, but you cannot twist things around for their children. So, no. Emphatically no.   No.  No!  NO! ",

            "answer_text": "It is not my place to state whether some deserves to be homeless or not. The person that is homeless already has enough people doing that judgement on them - besides the homeless person themself. Wait! What?! Homeless people judge themself to be unworthy of a warm home and safety? Yes, some do. I held homelessness over my head as a notice that I deserved being homeless as a penance for judging others for their shortcomings. But isn\u2019t thinking you are \u2018supposed to be homeless\u2019 counterintuitive to logical thinking? Perhaps. Perhaps not. When one has a belief in a superior being, and one believes in karma, one is willing to believe that they are where they belong until whatever lesson is learned that was supposed to be learned. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t judge the homeless anymore - I have always held a belief very similar to what I just described. Is it a sanity issue? No. A belief problem? No. It\u2019s only a belief problem in that those on the outside of said belief cannot fully comprehend and, because of that, they assume the person is mentally ill, on drugs/alcohol, or some other problematic issue that they figure is the reason for the \u2018poor reasoning.\u2019 Once the belief becomes that penance has been paid, those that held said belief will step forward with a refreshed view on life and others. In other words, \u201cThe broken will always be able to love harder than most because once you\u2019ve been in the dark, you learn to appreciate everything that shines.\u201d So, again, it is not my place to say one homeless person or another deserves to be that way. Judgement is passed by too many using that kind of thought to begin with. Instead, we should be asking, \u201cDO YOU THINK MOST HOMELESS DESERVE TO BE HOUSED AND HELPED?\u201d I think you\u2019d find a better response in that sort of question. Until then, \u201cJudge not, lest ye be judged.\u201d ",

Especially in wealthy countries. Some people (especially the young, e.g. orphans) basically become homeless simply because they've lost a job, or have to wait for a benefits payment etc. and don't have family or friends to stay with - if I'd have nastier landlords and no family or friends to help that could have happened to me - ironically because I took temporary work and it ended sooner than I thought, and had to wait weeks for the rent component of my British social security to restart. (Rather stupidly I'd have been safer to deliberately avoid taking work). So I will try not to judge them and very thankful of my good fortune. ",

            "answer_text": "There are already many answers to this question, and many of them are quite good, such as Glenn R. Anderson\u2019s answer. Yet, I thought I could say a few words as well. :) I don\u2019t think that desert has to be equated here. Why does one want to know if someone deserves to be in homelessness? What is the deep reason for that? One possibility is that it is a matter of finding an excuse to dehumanize and not care about people who struggle on the streets. I think that desert and merit may apply very well to some things, such as when you are competing for a promotion or an entry into a university. Yet, I don\u2019t think that deciding to what extent a person brought misery onto himself does anything useful for anyone. Yes, people must be accountable for their decisions, especially when they harm others, so that they can learn and develop and stop harming others, but they must always be given the opportunity to get up on their feet again - everyone has a value as a living and a human being. The natural and desirable state of a human being in most societies is not a state where he/she lives on the streets. So, in an attempt to answer the question directly, I would say that nobody deserves to be homeless. Homelessness is not something a homeless person does to other people and that harms them. Homelessness is something that society allows to happen - and sometimes even makes happen (think of cases in which a person stops being able to pay a mortgage and is forced to the streets or in which a teenager is kicked out of home for any arbitrary reason). Homelessness is not an unethical act, it is not even an act in the traditional sense of an act. Secondly, in reality there are so many factors that we do not control in our lives and that the illusion of being captains in full control of our ships (lives) does not let us see, that sometimes things get really bad and we don\u2019t even see a storm coming, or are frankly unprepared to face it. This is why people in homelessness have different backgrounds and different reasons to be in such a situation, although there can be some common factors such as mental disease, ilness or addiction. The Canadian Observatory on Homelessness is quite elucidative: \u201cIndividuals and families who experience homelessness may not share much in common with each other, aside from the fact that they are extremely vulnerable, and lack adequate housing and income and the necessary supports to ensure they stay housed. The causes of homelessness reflect an intricate interplay between structural factors, systems failures and individual circumstances. Homelessness is usually the result of the cumulative impact of a number of factors, rather than a single cause.\u201d Most of us have safety nets that wouldn\u2019t allow us to become homeless, such as reliable families, friends or neighbours, savings, an ensurance (in some countries), a certain amount of wealth that can be sold in a case of an emergency and even good social services to help us get by in case of unemployment or disease. But, unfortunately, many people don\u2019t have most or any of these safety nets - or they fail. Then, all that is needed is the perfect storm that can easily sink an already frail ship. In one sentence we can sum it up as \u201cThe causes and factors contributing to homelessness are too complex to allow us to fairly blame people who are in homelessness for the suffering they are going through.\u201d. You will agree with me that nobody in their sane mind would prefer to live on the streets unless for some kind of a social experiment. We are psychologically, socially and biologically conditioned to seek the comfort and the safety of a house. If a sane person ends up on the street, it is because he/she couldn\u2019t find a way to avoid it - and how can he/she be blamed for not having achieved what is in his/her best interest? And if a person is insane and is on the streets, how can he/she be blamed either if she/he is not able to make sound judgements and act accordingly? ",

You don\u2019t deserve to be able to afford to buy a bag of weed and not be sent to jail for carrying with an intent to distribute. You don\u2019t deserve the ability to dump $100 at the bar and have no life-altering consequences for it. You don\u2019t deserve your mental health. You don\u2019t deserve health at all. You don\u2019t deserve a job with living pay and benefits. You job is probably a fuck-ton easier than most manual jobs, both physically and mentally, and possibly produces little to no value. You don\u2019t deserve a wife that is going to stick with you until the end of the rainbow. Others don\u2019t deserve to be forced into homelessness over alimony payments. You don\u2019t deserve the good upbringing, safe neighborhood, good schools, and good parents that you were born into. ",

God forbid they suffer from mental illness or chemical dependency, make a mistake at work or commit a minor crime. Most shelters only accept \"clean\" patients so they're faced with agonizing & potentially fatal withdrawal or trying to survive alone in freezing weather. Mental illness often leads to a maladaptive attempt to self medicate, which can quickly escalate into chemical dependency even as their symptoms conflate in response to existential crisis. You know the last thing on their mind? Where to pee. Where to defecate. They can't just wander into your local Starbucks & use the rest room. They'll be tossed out & risk getting arrested. So they relieve themselves in allies or on the sidewalk & get out of Dodge. Is it repulsive? Is it disgusting? Yes and yes. Do they feel shame? Yes. But what would you do in their position? Do your business when you can't wait any longer & get the hell away from the scene of the crime. The problem is not shit on the sidewalk. It's people living on the streets with nowhere else to go. Revulsion & callous indifference are not the solution. The only solution with any promise is compassionate intervention. Just as cities have police & firefighters they should have people on the street identifying people at risk & engaging them in compassionate intervention. Homelessness in the most prosperous nation in history is an oxymoron. In a nation of Christians it is the ultimate hypocrisy. We have the capacity to address it comprehensively but we don't have the will. Too much us & them, not enough we. A tragic & cynical waste of human potential. We have forsaken our brothers and sisters with cruel indifference and self-righteousness, thinking it can't happen to us. It can and will. It's happening right now. And it will happen again tomorrow.\u201d ",

For many, they inherited mental illnesses and were denied jobs, and after a few months of living on the streets they lost their ability to appear normal and non-threatening.  I'm of the opinion that there is no such thing as \"deserving\" anything. What happens happens. Some of it is under your control, some of it is not. \"Deserving\" is a way for people to rationalize and justify the past, not a forward-looking philosophy.  \"Oh, he probably deserved it\" - what people say when they don't want to expend the energy to consider someone's humanity. \"I deserve better!\" - what people say to try to make their own self-interest into a greater cause. Why not just say \"I want better!\" or \"I need better!\" ? \"The (insert demographic you are pandering to) people DESERVE (insert thing they don't have)\" - what politicians say to mobilize political capital.  In all these examples, deserving is at best an intellectually lazy way of approximating a deeper meaning, and at worst a way to play on people's emotions or dehumanize someone.  No one deserves anything. The end. ",

Their insurance did not cover what they needed and the out of pocket expenses and time lost from work and earning wages caused by having to recover from extremely serious surgeries have left them without funds. Their time lost from work as a result cost them their jobs as well because most employers who don't have unions (and these days most of them DON'T) are NOT sympathetic! The one who started this WAR on Working Class Americans and slamming them into poverty with his \"Trickle Down Econimic Policy\" was REAGAN. That is why no School of any kind, Airport, Hospital or Library should be named after REAGAN. Instead, every Park Bench a homeless person sleeps on or cardboard box a homeless person has to call HOME should be named after REAGAN. ",

Do they deserve it?Wives who run away from their spouses because of physical, psychological and mental abuse become homeless. Do they deserve it?Abandoned kids, orphans and kids running away from abusive homes are homeless. Do they deserve it?People who get laid off because of economic forces beyond their control become homeless. Do they deserve it?People who go bankrupt because of skyhigh medical bills and/or physical disabilities become homeless because of loss of income. Do they deserve it?Families who lose their primary breadwinner become homeless. Do they deserve it?These are some of the more common causes of homelessness.

The word \u201cdeserve\u201d is all wrong, so take that thought out of the equation. What you do have are some homeless folks who have been offered many, many opportunities to move their life forward - treatment programs for alcohol, for mental issues, free college education, a place to stay, job opportunities - all of it and more than once. Each time they fail to turn that opportunity into a life change, and end up in worse and worse conditions. As things get bleaker, they lean more on the same friends and family that have tried so many times before to help them, but always focused on stopgaps to help them right this minute. They can no longer even imagine their future as being different than today. There IS a point at which each of the friends and family members says \u201cI cannot do more for you until you take steps to help yourself. I will go with you to talk to social services about what programs and services are available, but expecting me to support you while you refuse to help yourself is not one of your options.\u201d Those are incredibly hard words to say and it is heartbreaking to watch someone you love be homeless. I wish there were mandatory programs for long term drug/alcohol residential treatment combined with counseling. For some, that would be what would turn their lives around, but as long as it is voluntary, they are too messed up to volunteer. A classic Catch-22. ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience of Church Charity \u2014 The longer somebody is homeless, the more they become accustomed to it. Like stray cats \u2014 they become \u201cferal,\u201d and so dangerous to adopt \u2014 resistant to domestication. When they started out in life, however, they were ordinary people. They didn\u2019t deserve anything bad. So, how did they become \u201cstray?\u201d Alcohol and drug abuse is apparently the most common cause. Here\u2019s the typical story; they start young. They can\u2019t hold down a job, so they can\u2019t move out of their parent\u2019s home. Eventually, their family\u2019s can no longer tolerate them, so they turn them out into the street, hoping that they will be \u201cscared straight.\u201d That strategy rarely works. On the street, alcohol and drug abusers find many \u201cbirds of a feather,\u201d and for a long time they flock together. Yet, precisely because of their incessant alcohol and drug abuse, they eventually break up. Now we have single strays \u2014 the average type of homeless person. They won\u2019t listen to the Preacher \u2014 but they will take the Free Soup. Charity is all we know how to do for them. Without a physical address, our Government has no way to contact them. They become statistics. Do they \u201cdeserve\u201d homelessness? That\u2019s debatable \u2014 but we must each ask ourselves how we propose to care for an alcohol or drug abuser. There are surely other types of homeless people \u2014 but they typically don\u2019t stay homeless for long \u2014 they soon reach out for Government or Church help to get back on their feet. In conclusion, we are left with one question: how do we propose to care for an alcohol or drug abuser? There\u2019s my experience of Church Charity. ",

            "answer_text": "No. As someone who has spent years organizing the homeless, I would say that nearly all presumptions about homelessness -- including my own -- are not only wrong but pointless. We have the money  and buildings to house and feed every human being on the planet. Study after study has shown that it costs much less to house, feed, and clothe the homeless than to deal with them as homeless individuals -- apparently the people running homeless shelters are putting money SOMEWHERE, as the costs of running a shelter are 3 times what it costs to house and feed a person in permanent housing. The question is, when do start treating people as PEOPLE instead of cost centers, victims, victimizable, trash, or something else. My project, Asheville Homeless Network (Asheville NC) has made some waves, but I'm not sure it would catch on in other places (nobody has tried it or succeeded at it, to the best of my knowledge), and I am no longer in charge of it (happy to say it continues on without me). AHN is a Membership Organiztion for the Homeless, Formerly Homeless, and Allies, where they meet once a week to discuss their needs, possible political or police actions or needs, or just gripe a lot. Even in Asheville, the people working with the homeless are working AT them, not FOR or WITH them, and continue to make them feel like trash. Hard for a person who wants to pick themselves up to believe in themselves when nobody else does. ",

Todays homeless are not the same creature as the Burnside bums of the 60's. Most of tidays homeless had jobs. Then, for whatever reason, their rent became more than they could afford. Then after bcoming homeless, they lost their jobs due to the conditions of life as a homeless person. For most of them, it was only after they had lost their homes, their jobs, and all dignity and hioe that they turned to drugs and alcohol as an escape. They do not deserve to be homeless, they deserve help, and jobs that pay enough to afford a life. They deserve a society that values the worker over corporate profits. ",

            "answer_text": "No. If not just for the fact that there's no free will, nobody deserves retribution. Most homeless people would rather have a home. They ALWAYS have a good \u201creason\u201d for why they're homeless, just like homeowners ALWAYS have a good \u201creason for why they have homes. Their only mistake is having bad luck. That's it. They didn't have the opportunities that Many others did and do. You could just as easily be one of them if you had the unfortunate luck of being born into their situation. Everyone works about as hard as the next. The only real differences is all the bullshit you can't control. The bullshit homeless people have to do with is usually unique in that it prevents them from having homes. They\u2019re unlucky in that regard. Homeless people have shitty lives. They have to learn how to cope with and accept being treated like garbage. It's a bad life. It's demoralizing. Nobody deserves a bad life, particularly if your only offense is being unlucky. Homeless people, generally speaking, have a lot to offer. As much as most everyone else. Some of the smartest people I know are homeless. Their gifts are usually just more difficult for others to see, but they're almost always there. ",

Ok. I believe you. Get another job than. Dont tell me there is nothing out there! Addiction? No one forces you to drink or use drugs. Mental illness? Don't bullshit me! I have mental illness. I have a cronic depression, anxiety and ocd. So bad I have to be on medication for the rest of my life. There was a time when medication didn't work and I got electric shock treatment. And guess what! I had a full time job and no one even suspected that I am sick. I went to work every day and collapsed when I got home. I didn't sleep for days in a row but I went to work anyway. Childhood problems? My father was an alcoholic and my mom raised us alone after his death. Oh and did I mention that I was sexually molested several times when I was a kid? And I was also raped when I was 25. And Im here, succesful and not homeless! ",

So no no one deserves to be home this sometimes things happen and sometimes you just lose all hope can I tell you find yourself back to you find your strength and you'll be under the bridge tomorrow or at a city grade at the hospital trying to keep warm let's pray for the homeless is pray for the people that haven't found a way yet cuz by the grace of God it could be you or me ",

You know - weren't perfectly mentally healthy?   Suppose that turns into major mental illness.You know how you like a few drinks with your friends and have dabbled in drugs?   Suppose, in your recent pain, this blows up into alcoholism and drug addiction.So your wife dumps you.   The bank forecloses on your home.   Your country club friends don't answer your calls.Bang.

Some are having a blast being homeless, hitchhiking around being free meeting people partying etc. Some people are naturally nomadic and are very happy living in a car or RV when they have perfectly good places they could be. So homelessness is not a tragedy for all, it is a choice. And a lot of fun at times. I am not talking about those people who like being homeless. Now do people deserve to be homeless. If a person is capable of working and refuses to contribute to society what should we do about this person? Do you want to work an extra day each week to pay for his shelter? I do not want to say a person deserves to be homeless because that is so harsh. But I am struggling in life, I work hard, I take care of my family and I do not have the resources to support some one who could work and does not feel like it. There is not different between you directly supporting a homeless person and the government taxing you more to pay for his housing. This is a video I made with some homeless friends  ",

The number one takeaway from all those months of personal observation is proof positive that our wonderful country has done our citizenry a great disservice by closing the mental institutions. Most of the homeless folks I met were homeless because they could not deal with the unique stress of normal jobs and normal housing. Generally, they were safe to be around, friendly, but it quickly became obvious that they could not (that is \"could not\" rather than \"preferred not\") to live as normal, average, workaday people. They needed some sort of supervision, and occasionally someone to help them with daily activities, scheduling, medical care, prescription supervision, and the like, which we typically give no though to (which is only in the case for a healthy, properly functioning brain).Also, realize that mental illness is a continuum, ranging from what nearly every human on the planet in their moment of doubts, to full-out paranoid schizophrenics and those folks we often think of as \"crazy\", plus everything in-between and beyond. This is not a choice they have made. They have broken brains, yet we do not treat a broken brain like we do any other broken organ. One does not see people avoiding eye contact with heart attack victim, or calling a blind or deaf person lazy or bums. I find it weird to entertain such a perspective these days. ",

            "answer_text": "It is interesting that no one has commented on all the housing that illegal migrants monopolize. And more importantly, the realtors and rental agents that benefit from raising the rent beyond what is considered to be a living wage in America. The next time that you complain about President Trump building a wall, remember the homeless that you despise, and know that your understand is part of the reason that they exist. I have known many homeless people over the years, and the one common factor is \u201cNormal\u201d life slipped away from them and they lost their drive to seek the American dream. The majority of them are quite skilled in building trades or construction labor but have lost the basic resources that are necessary to reestablish a regular life. There are some that have made \u201cFlying Signs\u201d their new occupation. Many work through day labor temporary services for 7 or 8 dollars an hour. And there is little motivation to rejoin society on societies terms. There is also little cash working for minimum wage. People have many perceptions of homeless people by observing them from afar. Get on your bicycle and ride down to a park or other public area where homeless people congregate, hang out with them for a day. There is less to fear when you expose your self to the truth. The interesting thing is that they will think that you are homeless as well, because you are not afraid of them. These observations are copied from another Quora commenter. They had damaged or non-existent ties to their families - I have found this to be true.They frequently engaged in magical thinking - No more than any one else that plays the lottery, and there are millions that do and are not homeless.They had problems with authority - Many homeless have been to jail, so they simply are not afraid of the police or going to jail. I have not witnessed any of them with an authority complex.They are often not patient - This observation is absurd. Homeless people are more tolerant than most. Go by your local homeless shelter and watch as they line up to enter the facility.They could not plan - Most long term homeless people are just not interested in the American dream any longer. Why do you need to plan when you are living life one day at a time.They failed to learn from their mistakes - This can be said of most. I do not believe that it is any more prevalent among the homeless society, than those who are not homeless.",

            "answer_text": "Being homeless, as cruel as unethical and abnormal as this may sound to you, is actually an option. Its peoples bad mistakes. Being born poor isn\u2019t your mistake, dying poor is your mistake. Said by Bill Gates. Its true. Now a days people in the third world countries are able to leave and get out their problems because they were hungry to make money. In today\u2019s world, its extremely easy to make it, and be successful, its painless, simple, but time consuming and a bit difficult, but doable! Homelessness is actually an option believe it or not. It sucks and nobody should ever be homeless, but most of the stories ive heard is that people just leave problems grow to the point they cant fix them anymore. Some of them were because of selfish reasons, money spent on entertainment and escapism of reality by taking drugs and alcohol. Ive spoken to a lady, she was homeless, selling her body, taking drugs. After talking to her, and making her understand her problems and how to permanently fix them, she went to get clean and has be clean ever since. When people are interested of change, they figure their way out. If people are comfortable being where they are and think pity is key, then they will always stay homeless. There is nothing people can do to save people from drugs, alcohol, homelessness, addictions, obsessions, only they can put their foot down and decide its time to change their lifestyle, personality, personal reality, habits, and more. Nobody can do it but themselves. And the answer to how they can start that process is by pointing out the problems and which future results they can lead to, acknowledging that they made the problem in first place and they need to stand for it and change it by using willpower, dont let your ruined subconscious mind suggesting you to go back to comfortable ways, fight it by counting five four three two one, and take control of your decisions. Theres a bunch more to this and i can only write so much before my fingers fall off but i hope you now understand that homelessness is peoples decision of leaving problems unsolved lead to bigger problems, and that homeless people can be rich if they wanted to. You dont need money now a days to start something. Its actually very doable when you know what you need to do. Fun part is that its all online. Theres alot of devices that have internet capabilities.

No. Because people are people, they are just like you. Know one \u2018deserves\u2019 to be homeless. I was homeless from a year. When I was 7, living in a hostel with 10 other people with young families. And do u know what? They were incredible people. All they had done was not made the best decisions and had ended up being homeless through no mass fault of their own. So to answer your question, no people don\u2019t \u2018deserve\u2019 to be homeless. ",

I say that no one should be sleeping on a city street, even in a tent. Too often I observe this scenario: the person is offered a shelter bed, but that does not work out because the person has too many conditions: what about my shopping cart full of stuff?will they take away my knife?I can\u2019t drink?no smoking?what about my seven cats?but that\u2019s too far from here!",

            "answer_text": "Definitely not. It depends on the cause and circumstances of their homelessness. If they are the types who refuse to work, indulge in alcohol and/or drugs and don\u2019t make any effort, of course they deserve to be homeless, because it\u2019s their own fault. But people can find themselves in all kinds of unpredictable situations without asking for it. Take my example. I was one of the best students in my class. My parents were educated and had good office jobs. We had a nice, big apartment in the center of our town. But one day, a war started. An army came to our door with rifles and forced us to leave our home without taking anything with us. It was a part of the ethnic cleansing of Bosniaks. We were lucky not to end up in a mass grave, but we lost our home and all of our possessions in only one second. We were literally empty-handed, didn\u2019t have anywhere to go and didn\u2019t have any belongings except for the clothes we were wearing. When I returned to my apartment 17 years later, all of our things were long gone. But I live in it again. In the meantime, my parents built a new house in another place, got new jobs and built their lives again from scratch. There is a difference between being in a bad situation because you caused it yourself and being in a bad situation because you were put in it. But no matter which circumstances you find yourself in, you have to work hard to improve your life. ",

They choose not to confront their problems and find ways in order to solve them. They choose not to push their way back up in life.

The people who we elect and trust to do things, once in office will give you thing like \u2018We are doing things. Nobody wants to see homeless people. So we have been working hard to grow jobs and lower taxes. But the other side is holding us up'. Being an Australian, here the goverment has now for years adopted the attitude that the best way to help the homeless is to remove any social security they can. Because a human without any help will be motivated to get of their ass and get a job. Note to them a couple of hours a week working for tips IS A JOB. One of our treasures, now I believe is an ambasoder in USA, when asket about people with job on low pay due to wage stagnation, what can they do said \u2018Get a better job' that was his solution. This the goverment before comming into power, for 3 years , was saying that workers in this country were getting to much money and businesses were not investing anymore. They will fix everything in one year. 6 to 7 years later, the only thing they fixed was driving wages lower, and the number of homeless up. If you see the Australian ambasoder in the US, he's the one smoking a sigar and no that is not two people in one suit it just one. ",

The PTSD veterans definitely don\u2019t deserve to be, nor the mentally ill or chronically sick.

What I'm getting at is that there aren't a lot of the homeless who choose to be homeless (especially children and the elderly). Sure, there are quite a few homeless people who drink or use drugs. Please consider just how stressful homelessness can be on an individual. Some not knowing where they're going to sleep, or even get their next meal. Worse yet, families with children losing their housing do to forclosure, natural disaster, or becoming injured and unable to work, laid off\u2026 The list of reasons goes on and on. I personally know that most homeless don't deserve being homeless. Who in their right mind would willingly chose to be homeless? ",

A drunken Russian with a whole mess of mental issues and psychotic rages who was finally kicked out by his landlord after nearly killing one of his housemates (why the police refused to deal with it is beyond me, but the psychotic was the only one who had reason to do so). Whether or not he is out on the streets or not, I do not know, but I imagine at some point he will be. And the second is a person I sometimes see out on the streets or in a library. Mental illness is not an issue for this person, as I have seen him speaking with others and his tone is completely rational and coherent, unlike a good many homeless people one encounters. Several years ago, I noticed what this man spent his time looking at on computers on several different occasions- white supremacist websites, anti-Semitic pages, that sort of thing. And now he\u2019s homeless, on the streets, and frankly, a hate mongering bigot like that deserves what he got. ",

No, but then life is not EQUITABLE. Never has been. Never will be. CANNOT be. Keep things perspective. I imagine that EVERY quadriplegic and quadruple amputee would be THRILLED to become homeless if it would make them whole again. I imagine MOST blind folks would rather be homeless than blind. I wouldn\u2019t survive long on the streets, but I would pick homelessness over the loss of a single FINGER! So, there are infinitely many things far worse than being homeless. \u2026..RVM45 ",

            "answer_text": "You frame the question in a way that distorts thinking. Deserve is dealing with worthiness, and that is not a valid part of the question. The real question should be in two parts. Do homeless people cause their own homeless by their own actions? And second, what can we do to help change these actions? To the question question, it seems most do cause it by their own actions by drinking and drug use. Those with just economic reasons should be helped and they are not a permanent problem unless the state makes homes so expensive, like California by requiring things like solar with increases home prices another $16,000, mortgaged out for 30 years, making it more like $40,000. But for those with mental issues, we need to carefully consider controlling those people, perhaps in specialized living situations. The second part is vital. You can provide more food, clothing, and shelter for those, but that will only grow the situation, as we can see with the places that have extensive programs to \u201chelp\u201d them. You must address their ability to make better choices, and nothing is presently doing that, certainly not our public school systems. ",

Most of the homeless have mental or psychological problems, and/or problems of substance abuse. They have nowhere to go because the mental institutions that used to care for them no longer have the resources to do so, their families have given up, and there are only a few halfway houses and shelters. It\u2019s a serious problem, leaving them on the street is not the solution, especially in the winter. So far nobody has come up with a solution. ",

I have a typical Philly rowhouse with marble steps where ice is completely invisible, but before I could even look for ice I was on the sidwalk, in the recycling bucket with my ribs hard against the marble stoop. As one of the 22+ million Americans still without affordable health insurance, it once again occurred to me as I lay there checking for injury - this is all it could have taken to make me homeless. It could have been bad, very bad, and I could instantly have lost my home to hugely inflated medical bills. Many more people than realize it are literally one step away from being homeless. ",

            "answer_text": "Its a very American idea of having homeless people. In Britain you are guaranteed a roof over your head. There are homeless, but these are usually people with alcohol problems or those in temporary distress (fleeing abusive partners). Other common groups of homeless are quite counter intuitive---they are extremely self-reliant people who won't ask for help: ex-military or Polish migrants. It isn't even expensive---think about it---homeless people aren't going to get jobs and they will likely turn to crime or at least it is a temptation. The US is run on a fiction. The idea that if people work hard they will do well has a corollary: that those who aren't doing well are lazy. The US shouldn't have a problem housing people: land is cheap. It has homeless purely because it wants them. It is deliberate government policy. The British system is perfectly easy to understand welfare is set at your rent paid plus (equivilent of $60 a week ($100 if you can prove you are looking for a job)) ",

Placing blame does us, as a community, absolutely no good. Looking for and implementing efforts to prevent homelessness seems to me to be the much more important thing to do.  Oh, I have several relatives with bi-polar disorder.  These folks would be on the street but for access to mental health care. Are they to blame for their condition?  Would our communities be better off, socially or fiscally, if they didn't have access to medication?  Politics aside, the answer is an emphatic NO! ",

The more important question is: what must a man do to deserve a home? Typically, one pays for it. Alternatively, one lives with someone who pays for a home. The one who pays deserves his home. The one who stays in a home another has paid for has received a gift, which by definition is undeserved. ",

That the government allows citizens who are often eager and able to participate to fall to such meager circumstances is a moral failing on the part of the government. What is a government for if not to enhance the lives of it's citizens? Or are we to believe that the necessary degree of competition amongst citizens for a successful society requires such harsh penalties for inability to adapt for whatever reason? Further, that a significant percentage of the population should always exist in this state? Nonsense. That's just an ugly way to think. ",

The welfare checks were issued Weds. and everybody paid their share except Mike. He has all sorts of excuses, the check didn't come, then he lost his card, then the bank don't believe it's him, and tis and that, in the end he thinks he is getting away with NOT paying his share.

People who end up homeless, from the vast majority of stories I\u2019ve listened to, are homeless because many things went wrong, their family and social networks are weak and often dysfunctional (I\u2019d sooner blame the caregivers or abusers than the actual homeless person). No, nobody chooses to be homeless. Nobody thinks that their decisions are going to lead to homelessness - they\u2019re just suddenly or gradually there, and it often takes months for them to realize that yes in fact they are now homeless.

I left prison with no support, no money, and possessing only the clothing I was issued upon release. I now have a large house, a great job, a wife, and children which I support with little assistance from the state. I have faced many of the same obstacles these homeless people face, including poor health, mental health issues, a poor background in work and education, and the additional obstacle of my felony conviction and long sentence. Through hard work and perseverance, I have built the life I now have and take great pride in it. It is only because of my willingness to put the effort in that I have done so and continue to progress. In America, even in the messed up state this country is in today, anything is possible. It only requires a plan and effort to achieve your dreams. ",

A consequence of this soporific (but fallacious) belief is that if you're not rich, it must therefore be due to a lack of ambition, smarts and hard work. In other words, if you're not a millionaire, it's because you're stupid and lazy. A fortiori, if you're homeless, it can only be due to an almost unimaginable combination of stupidity and laziness, and it is very much their fault.  A brief trip to your local McDonald's should help you towards the understanding that the lowest-paid jobs can be the most strenuous and least rewarding. ",

For most, there was some divide, perhaps several things in a row. Some of these things may have been their fault, and some not. And the road past the Y may have had turnaround points that they did not take. The two roads get further and further apart, until it looks like two travelers have nothing in common. But it may have been merest chance that had one fear left and the other to the right. And once you are on the road, it gets harder and harder to get back to the turn, perhaps going against traffic. Often, the poor no more deserve their poverty than the wealthy deserve their wealth. ",

The other homeless in the area said that she left the city and they never saw the \u201cson\u201d. It\u2019s really hard to help someone who doesn\u2019t want the help. ",
