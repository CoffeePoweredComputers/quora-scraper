            "answer_text": " Ernest Hemingway in Paris, circa 1920s. Just one? My wretched opinion? Well \u2014 I have to say Earnest Hemingway, author of The Old Man and the Sea, For Whom the Bell Tolls, A Farewell to Arms, A Movable Feast, To Have and the Have Not, and The Sun Also Rises, among several other novels and memoirs. He was wounded in WWI, one of the Lost Generation in Paris, a lover of bull fights, lover of cruel Spain, war correspondent during the Spanish civil war, war correspondent in WWII, veteran of four beautiful lusty powerful wives, deep sea fisherman, lifelong serious novelist, and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, 1954. Hemingway was a Man - a real man who loved adventure, danger, women, more women, soldiers, wars, courage, personal honor, living to the fullest, passionate women, more and more women \u2014 grace under pressure. HEMINGWAY WAS A MASCULINE, HARDENED, PLAIN-TALKING, CARNAL WRITER and that\u2019s why he\u2019s out of vogue right now, because so many women have lost their mysterious seductive sultry femininity and thus hate sensual men. But he is making a comeback, also right now. I love to watch how things are changing \u2014 women are becoming women again, and men are becoming men again. Most Americans are vomiting out the politically correct pablum they\u2019ve been forced to eat. (In truth, most Americans never changed. The feminization of America was only in a few big cities and the mass media. And truthfully, Hemingway\u2019s books always sold!) Ernest Hemingway was also a great writer, in the classical sense. His work will endure for centuries. I suggest with humility that you folks who want to read Hemingway resist reading any current biographies of him. The politically correct crowd have tried to emasculate Hemingway by writing critical biographies. But if you must read a biography, I reccomend A. E. Hotchner\u2019s, \u201cPapa Hemingway: A Personal Memoir.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Among novelists, some of my favorites areF.Scott Fitzgerald (The Great Gatsby)Harper Lee (To kill a mockingbird)J.D. Salinger (Catcher in the Rye) These novels (along with some others) are examples of what is christened a \"Great American Novel\" - novels which were not only great reads, but also captured the zeitgeist or the spirit of the time. To kill a mockingbird is about America's racial divide, which was a very relevant question when the book was first published (in the 60s). The Great Gatsby is about the post-war \"Roaring Twenties\" and the general sense of careless abandon prevalent at the time. Catcher in the Rye  is simply about adolescence and adulthood. These novels paint a very vivid and (supposedly) accurate picture of the USA at those points of time, which makes them American classics. You can find a list of some other novels which are also considered Great American Novels here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Novel ",
