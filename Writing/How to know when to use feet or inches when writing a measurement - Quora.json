            "answer_text": "This is very similar to asking \"How long do we refer to a person's age in months versus years?\"  Although this is arbitrary and varies from person to person, people generally can be 1 month to 23 months old in common parlance.  After that, we begin to say 2 years, or 3 years.  It makes much less sense to use months after that. I suspect the feet versus inches parlance to be the same for many people, because that's what I do.  However, in measurements, it doesn't help to drop the inches as it does to drop the months of a person's age, particularly if we're still trying to build or assemble the object.  If the object being measured has already been built and its size is only matter of curiosity, the inches typically sound silly for larger objects. ",

            "answer_text": "It's all a question of scale:for smaller scales it's OK to say 18\" or 32\" when you could say 1'6\" or 2'8\" but you wouldn't want to say 145\" when you really mean 12'1\" or even say just over twelve foot. The same applies to larger amounts. Actually 10ths,100ths and 1000ths of an inch are good precision measurements.Imperial is a good system for everyday ergonomic use;if you want to get scientific or technical by all means use decimal.
