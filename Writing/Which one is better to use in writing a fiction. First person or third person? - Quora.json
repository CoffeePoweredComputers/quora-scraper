            "answer_text": "The better one is whichever suits that particular story more. You should also take into consideration which you prefer or are more comfortable writing. If you feel that you can write better in third person, write in third person. If first person feels more natural to you, write in first person. Each has its own advantages and its own limitations (for example, in first-person narration, the author cannot share any information with the reader that the viewpoint character doesn\u2019t possess), but neither is inherently better all around than the other.

            "answer_text": "This depends on the story, the characters, the plot, and the narrator and the author. If the author writes the perspective of one of the characters better than in the third person, then first person would work better. However, if the author comes up with a great narrative voice that allows the author to provide readers with information that would never be available from a first person account of events, then 3rd person account and a narrative voice would work better.
