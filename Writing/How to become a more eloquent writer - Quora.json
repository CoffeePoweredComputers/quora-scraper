            "answer_text": "Define \u201celoquent.\u201d If you mean fluid and easy to read, remember that you are already fluent in your native tongue. If you concentrate on being CLEAR in your writing, without trying to impress anybody, your natural voice will emerge and you will have a distinctive style without any affectation. But if your goal is to impress people with your writing, you will fail. The farther you get from your natural speech, the more stilted and awkward you'll become. Trying to seem erudite or poetic only makes it worse. The worst writing I have ever seen came from writers who were grimly determined to \u201cwrite well\u201d instead of \u201cwrite clearly.\u201d If you are writing in a language that is not your own, the only road to eloquence is to make it your own: talk constantly with native speakers from various regions and levels of education, and read every kind of literature \u2026 especially popular literature that's meant to be read by volunteer readers. When you are so fluent you are never at a loss in reading and conversation, you're ready to start writing in that language. Then you'll find out how far you still are from being a native speaker. But it can be done, and has been done. ",
