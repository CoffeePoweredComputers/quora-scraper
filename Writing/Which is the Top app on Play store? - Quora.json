So here are my recommmendations : Common Tasks : Browsing : Use nothing else than chrome(Please don\u2019t use UC browser or other ad supported browser). As an alternative you may use Firefox.Adblocking : Chrome/Firefox doesn\u2019t have an adblocker built in so use Adguard(it will block ads in all apps on your phone). This one isn't available on Play Store though(or any other adblocker).Cloud Storage : Mega/Google Drive/OneDriveCamera : FootejSelfie : Haven't find any perfect one but Youcam and Candy camera are good(Retrica takes grainy pics)Photo editors : This can be a long list :For selfie : FacetuneAdvanced : Snapseed/Lightroom(maybe Photoshop)Filters : VSCO(known for quality filters, you may need to pay)Extra(stickers/collages etc) : PicsartArtistic : Shapical/FragmentsStreaming Service : Wynk/Spotify(for English) ***Local Music Player : BlackPlayerMedia Player dedicated to Movies/TV Shows : Archos Video Player(Paid)I guess that's enough for a normal person.
