            "answer_text": "If there is something you wish you had said to the deceased individual, then you should have said it \u2014 personally or in writing \u2014 before he or she passed away. People frequently feel deep sense of guilt, that they neglected to communicate something which they now feel is exceedingly important. When they learn that the object of their disclosure is no longer able to receive it or read it, they are devastated. Of course, you can still write the letter. Pour out your heart, express all of you innermost feelings, write everything you feel but never showed adequately. You can then keep it among your secret things, or you can tear it up and throw away the pieces. Neither will assuage your feelings of guilt, for having waited too long. Of course, you could privately show it to Grandma, saying these are all the things you wanted to tell Grandpa, but you just \u201cnever had the chance\u201d. Grandma will be appropriately grateful and understanding. She will tell you the Grandpa really did know all of those, but \u201cHe would have been so happy to have received this letter from you\u201d. Then you will feel worse than ever. The sad fact is that there is no way \u201cto write a letter late \u2026\u201d. If you are as devoted and as dutiful as you would like to see yourself, then sit down and write something out, now. No matter how many other \u201cimportant\u201d things you have to do, or want to do, right now. If you decide to wait until later, when you \u201chave the time to do it right\u201d, then there is a good chance you will find out that later is too late. If, as your question implies, you have already found that you are too late to have written the letter, there is no way of going back. You cannot correct or undo your procrastination. We all have a long trail of things we should have said, actions we should have performed, gifts we should have given, appreciation we should have shown. When we think about it, each of those is a sad memory. This one may be the saddest of all. But you can\u2019t change or undo any of those missed opportunities. Which may be a good motivator for setting aside your current To Do list, and making the list of Ought to Do. Then get those done, and out of the way, before returning to the regular To Do list. That will stop the growth of your Sad Memories list. ",

            "answer_text": "Go into it knowing that this is more for you than for anyone. Obviously the late person will not read it, and you may never want to show it to anyone else due to privacy. But letter writing to someone you lost in your life - a friend, a grandparent, whoever - can be incredibly healing as you process your grief. If you have regrets, you can write those down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t make more time for you\u201d or \u201cI wish I had been there for you\u201d or whatever else. If you loved the person, you can tell them how much you love them and miss them. If you didn\u2019t exactly love the person but cared for them (like if the person was a former teacher you admired), you can tell them how beneficial they were in your life and that you\u2019re honored to have known them. Write the letter as if you know the person is going to read it - if I were to write one - say, to my late grandfather - I would write to him as if he left for a long journey. So if I had regrets (and I do have them), I would write: \u201cI\u2019ll always remember flying to Fort Lauderdale when I was little and watching The Price is Right and going to feed the ducks and visiting the ponies across the street. Thank you so much for being part of my childhood. I miss you every day.\u201d Other people may need to write things differently, but I prefer to talk about the good times and tell my grandfather how much I love (present tense, not past tense) him. I still love him even though he is gone. The love didn\u2019t end. When you are done, you may want to keep the letter hidden. Some people get an urge to throw it away. If you get that urge after writing your letter, try to at least sleep on it. Give your mind time to process what you wrote down and then see how you feel later. ",
