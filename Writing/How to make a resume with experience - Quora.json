Tips and tricks to answer the question: #What is the best way to enter my work experience on a resume. 7 SECRETS TO WRITE A KILLER RESUME =>1. THINK OF YOUR RESUME AS A MARKETING TOOL It\u2019s easy to think of your resume as a summary of your work experience. But a resume isn\u2019t just about listing your professional history. Rather, it\u2019s a strategic tool for marketing your individual brand. Consider the perspective of a recruiter. The recruiter is seeking a candidate who fits a job description and can bring value to an organization. They don\u2019t have time to delve into your resume and figure out who you are, so you need to connect the dots for them. As you build a resume, think strategically. Consider what you\u2019ve accomplished in the past and what you can offer in the future. Make sure your resume tells a clear story about who you are as a professional. \u2014\u2192Related post: Free ebook 395 interview questions with answers pdf Download link: resume123. org/2018/06/free-book-395-interview-questions-with-answers-pdf.html =>2. IDENTIFY ACCOMPLISHMENTS NOT JUST JOB DESCRIPTIONS Hiring managers, especially in technical fields like engineering, seek candidates that can help them solve a problem or satisfy a need within their company. Consequently, you can\u2019t be a solution to their problems without stating how you solved similar problems in other companies and situations. *Focus on what you did in the job, NOT what your job was there\u2019s a difference *Include a one or two top line job description first, then list your accomplishments *For each point ask yourself, What was the benefit of having done what I did? *Accomplishments should be unique to you, not just a list of what someone else did *Avoid using the generic descriptions of the jobs you originally applied for or held \u2014\u2192Related post: free 32 resume templates Download link: 32ResumeTemplates.blogspot .com =>3. TAILOR YOUR RESUME TO EACH NEW JOB Along similar lines, you won\u2019t have much luck sending off dozens of the same resume to lots of different employers. Instead of treating your resume like a form letter, tailor it to each new role. \u201cOne of the most common resume mistakes \u2026 is creating one single resume and sending it out to every hiring company they can find,\u201d said career expert Jason Hill, founder of Sound Advice. \u201cI call this the \u2018shotgun approach.\u2019 Do not do this.\u201d Instead, research the company and read the job description closely. Figure out exactly what the organization is looking for, then reflect those qualifications in your resume. \u2014\u2192Related post: 35 tips to prepare for your job interviews Link: 35JobInterviewTips.blogspot. com =>4. QUANTIFY YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS Q: What\u2019s the most common resume mistake? A: Making too many general claims and using too much industry jargon that does not market the candidate. A resume is a marketing document designed to sell your skills and strengths rather than just portray a bio of the candidate. *Include and highlight specific achievements that present a comprehensive picture of your marketability *Quantify your achievements to ensure greater confidence in the hiring manager and thereby generate interest percentages, dollars, number of employees, etc. *Work backwards to quantify your accomplishments by asking, If I had not done X, what could have happened? =>5. REPLACE YOUR OBJECTIVE\u201d WITH A \u201cCAREER SUMMARY\u201d A Career Summary is designed to give a brief overview of who you are and what you do. Most Objectives sound similar: Seeking a challenging, interesting position in X where I can use my skills of X, Y, and Z to contribute to the bottom line. Not telling at all. *Grab a hiring manager\u2019s attention right from the beginning, remembering you *Have only 25 few seconds to make a good impression *Spend time developing a summary that immediately gets their attention, and accurately and powerfully describes you as a solution to their problems =>6. NETWORK. NETWORK. NETWORK. For unemployed candidates, handing out resumes should be a full-time job. The majority of mid*to senior-level positions are filled through networking, so contact absolutely everyone you know in addition to recruiters who are in a position to hire you or share insights. =>7. RESUME KEYWORDS: Many recruitment agencies (and indeed, some larger companies) use special software to scan applications for certain words and phrases, which are called \u2018keywords\u2019. To maximise your resume\u2019s chances of being found, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure your resume contains key words from the job description, or from your role and industry, to ensure it passes the first round of checks. Common keyword examples include \u2018project management\u2019, \u2018business development\u2019, \u2018customer service\u2019, \u2018account manager\u2019, \u2018software development\u2019 and \u2018leadership\u2019, amongst many others. Look closely at relevant job listings to see which words are repeated, and weave them into your resume and cover letters. ",

Dear career aspirants you are interesting and just listing what you did never project your real strengths. The best way to interest Hiring managers is to tell an interesting story.

Now compare it with an experience on a resume starts with a Story. Example from my sales position resume.  My 110%+ Goals Story I am an aggressive seller and had goals in mind. To reach \"Winner's Circle\" I had to average 110% to goal throughout the year to be eligible for the Award, and that was not always easy due to the competition. What I did differently?
