            "answer_text": "In the politics of the United States, you can come to the conclusion that one of two things was the driving force. The first explanation is that the United States is such a repressive country that S was seen to support diversity and equality. Z looks like \u201c\u2260\u201d, the not-equals sign. How much more explanation is needed than that? The second explanation is that the United States is extremely concerned about getting sucked into international secularism. They\u2019ve seen what the world will do to itself if left to their inclinations, and they won\u2019t risk it. They don\u2019t know if it\u2019s \u201csoccer football\u201d, the metric system, driving on the left side of the road, the Paris Accord, or giving up the \u201c.com\u201d domain that will suck the United States down to the banal level with the rest of the world that tends towards human-induced mass population losses and unstable governments, so they don\u2019t risk it. \u201cYou spell color with a \u201cu\u201d? \u201ccolour\u201d? Seriously? And you think that\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d. Yeah \u2026. That could be risky. Please just put that U back into the bag and draw another tile.\u201d \u201cBecause that\u2019s how it\u2019s done in other countries\u201d isn\u2019t a winning argument in the United States for many. If around the world countries like to use \u201cs\u201d more than \u201cz\u201d, that alone is a good enough reason to not take chances and use the \u201cz\u201d. Make a big deal about people all over the world holding a knife in the left hand when they\u2019re cutting steak and kidney pie and, bam, into the right hand the knife will go and into the trash for steak and kidney pie. Those are really the only two explanations of the political ideologies for why the United States does anything its unique and distinctly different way. Either, the United States is messed up, or the rest of the world is messed up and the United States wants to steer as far away from that nonsense as possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Americans simplified the spelling of words due to high printing costs back in the day. This is how we lost the \u201cu\u201d in \u201cou\u201d, for example. However, the -ize ending in realize, jeopardize, capsize, and prize has a couple of variants: In realize, that -ize predates the use of -ise. English is a Germanic language and \u201cizein\u201d is the relative in German for this word termination (\u201cizo\u201d in Greek which would predate the Germanic). The first use of -ise terminations appear Aaound the 1750s, which naturally leads to the assumption that the original spelling came to America with the colonists. Eventually the -ize ending changed to -ise in Britain while it didn\u2019t in the US.In capsize, -ize was the only acceptable spelling throughout history, rendering the alternate spelling with -ise that can be seen in some places, a blatant spelling mistake.So, no, the Americans didn\u2019t change the \u201cs\u201d to a \u201cz\u201d. The brits modified the \u201cz\u201d to an \u201cs\u201d when standardization wasn\u2019t super relevant in language. ",
