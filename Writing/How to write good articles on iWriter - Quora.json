            "answer_text": "Write Interesting Articles First, make sure every article you write is interesting on the reader. If readers like what you have to say, they are going to read more of your respective articles and you will probably receive more attention. Furthermore, when you discuss what you are passionate about; your articles will sound more inviting. Headlines Are Most Important Second, your headlines are the main element of your articles. Long headlines which have meaning are much better than short headlines. Your headlines can ask a question, produce a strong statement or give you a benefit to your audience. Should your headlines are fabulous, individuals will read your articles. Moreover, your headlines needs to be specific and clear to understand. Remember that 'How To' articles are incredibly popular online, so utilize them to have attention. Furthermore, your headlines can provide a strategy to a difficulty. They could be a list of tips or benefits your reader will probably want to know. Be Imaginative Moreover, if you would like customers to notice your articles, you need to be creative. For example, you could make a list of answers and questions as a way to sell your product or service. Give people solutions to their questions; explain the advantages for buying your products and folks will be inspired to make a purchase. ",

            "answer_text": "I have not actually experienced writing articles on the iWriter: Content & Article Writing Service site, although I do have a current membership there. Guess I've been lax in following up more, but...IIWII, right? (It Is What It Is). That said, I'd like to offer just a few comments regarding \"good articles\" in general, without regard to where they might be posted. Writing \"good articles\" can be defined in a few different ways, depending on what 'angle' or what 'strategy' is being described. For example, an Internet Marketing \"guru\" would likely suggest that SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the most critical aspect of any article or content, since it is SEO that tells search engines to \"find me! find me! find me!\". That's ok, and even a good thing, as long as SEO is used wisely and not overdone and not in a way which detracts from the purpose of the article (i.e., to 'inform', etc.) Really \"good articles\", in my (humble) opinion, are the ones that use a careful SEO approach along with top-notch quality in grammar, spelling, phraseology, humor, conversational tone, factual information, useful references, and other aspects that give content \"staying power\". So, in summary, I think I would recommend paying attention to quality first, and perhaps learn what you can about SEO and other web 'tricks and tips' to help bring attention to your content, y'know? Just sayin'...  ",

            "answer_text": "iWriter appears to be a bidding site. The first warming I see is, well, everything. They claim to employ more writers than any other site. And that, in turn, means far more competition (and less money) for you. They brag about paying $40 for a 500 word post. Seriously? That's 8 cents a word, NOT counting the time you put into landing the gig. And that's the HIGH end. ",
