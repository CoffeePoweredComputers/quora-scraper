            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Creative writing teachers who say \u201cYour character must develop over the course of your novel\u201d are doing the same thing junior school teachers do when they tell you \u201ci before e except after c\u201d, or \u201cyou can\u2019t start a sentence with a conjunction\u201d. They\u2019re teaching a lie, because it\u2019s easier than explaining a complicated truth. And because it\u2019s a lie that works often enough to be worth teaching. There are plenty of great and popular novels out there where the characters don\u2019t develop. A lot of them are genre fiction: detective novels, science fiction novels, horror novels. Some of them are considered great literature. Nobody changes in Moby Dick. However, character development hasn\u2019t risen to such prominence by chance. These days, we, as novel-readers, like and expect to see characters grow. Agents and publishers like to see characters grow, and will be less appreciative of your novel if they don\u2019t. So the answer is \u201cyes\u2026 but know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I agree that character development is really important, and there\u2019s no good reason to skip over it. One thing I wanted to point out is there\u2019s some flexibility depending on what genre you\u2019re writing. If you\u2019re writing genre fiction like a Harlequin-type romance or a thriller, you can usually get away with less development. But if you\u2019re writing about, say, a guy going on a long soul-searching motorcycle trip that culminates in him helping his ex- bury her dead cat, you need a lot of intricate details and ways to reveal character.
