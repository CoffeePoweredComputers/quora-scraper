            "answer_text": "To avoid potential redundancies in your work, you should: Follow the rule \u201cLess is more.\u201d Check if there is needless repetition, or if there are any redundant words, phrases, or expressions that can be removed.Tighten your sentences. Try avoiding longer sentences. When you check your writing and come across a long sentence, try challenging yourself to if you can make this sentence meaningful by shortening it to 15-20 words.Beware of Pleonasm: the use of more words than are necessary to convey meaning. It is also the term usually used when referring to a phrase that repeats itself.Be careful when using abbreviations. For instance, many people use HIV virus, when the V in HIV stands for virus.Remove unnecessary phrases and avoid using double negatives. This could make the sentence shorter and still retain its thought.Check for potential redundancies with online proofreading software which will flag up any repetition for you to check and edit if necessary.Read it aloud. An excellent way to identify redundancy is to read your work out loud. Any instances of repetition or duplication should be obvious.",

            "answer_text": "I must say that this is really a good question as we come across this situation often, when we are writing our first draft. However, there are various ways by which we can avoid it. I am going to share some of them here: Use of Synonyms: Repetition of same words makes the sentence really irrelevant.Be Straight Forward: Sometimes, we beat around the bushes and that doesn\u2019t help us to present our actual thoughts.Use of Bullet Points: Even if, nobody will read this answer of mine, they will still have a slight look at the Bullet Points that I mentioned. In case, they will have a doubt with any of the bullet point, they can read the description of these bullet points.Keep a Gap Between Writing First Draft and Editing It: As Mr. Einstein once said,\u201dWe cannot solve the problem with the same thinking we had when we created that problem.\u201d So. edit your first draft at least after 1 hour.",
