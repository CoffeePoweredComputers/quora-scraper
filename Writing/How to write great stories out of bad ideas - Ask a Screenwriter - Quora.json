            "answer_text": "I generally agree with Ken Miyamoto\u2019s answer that there are no bad ideas, but rather bad execution. That said, and as Ken likewise explains in more detail in his answer details, I have to admit I have actually heard some terrible \u201cideas\u201d \u2014 not the underlying basic concept, mind you, but the specific story ideas as pitched to me when I was being asked to develop a project. I won\u2019t go into specifics about them, but to make my point I\u2019ll offer a hypothetical example based on reversing an existing movie\u2019s \u201cidea.\u201d If someone has an idea for a drama about a gay person who goes through \u201cconversion therapy\u201d and has a wonderful experience that convinces them being gay was just a \u201cchoice\u201d that ruined their lives, and who successfully complete \u201cconversion\u201d to become a straight person who marries an opposite-sex partner at the end, that\u2019s a horrible idea as it is specifically expressed in this manner. The idea here extends beyond mere concept, since making such a story into a serious drama is an idea. The question is, does that larger specific idea have the seeds of a different idea based on the same vague concept? Perhaps. A story about someone desperately entering \u201cconversion therapy\u201d only to discover the therapy is a fraud, forcing them to accept the truth of their sexuality and learn to be happy with who they are rather than trying to change it, is a worthwhile \u2014 and true, for many people \u2014 story to tell. Alternately, you could make a satire about someone entering \u201cconversion therapy\u201d and portray it all precisely as described \u2014 person is gay, goes into \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d experiences all manner of ironic situations that actually send the message that being gay is not a \u201cchoice\u201d and even the people running the so-called therapy are gay but in denial about it, and the person finally exiting therapy supposedly \u201ccured\u201d but demonstrably still gay and just badly hiding the truth from themselves. You can denounce, mock, and tear apart the false concept of \u201cconversion therapy\u201d through satirically representing the truth about its failure, its cruelty, and the need to ban it altogether as an abusive, dangerous practice. The point is, what we consider an \u201cidea\u201d depends on the specifics of a situation, and each element of our conception of a story and how to develop it contains many \u201cideas\u201d that can be good or bad, depending on context. But in general terms, if you have an idea for a story in front of you, the most basic form of that story is the one that sheds interpretive ideas attached to flesh it out, so the underlying concept is not \u201cbad\u201d and is simply diminished by the bad additions built atop that concept to express the concept in more specific terms. Which brings us back to Ken\u2019s point \u2014 there are no bad ideas, just bad execution. We begin to execute an idea the moment we take the foundational concept (for example, someone going through conversion therapy because they are desperate to change themselves) and express the themes behind it and how to portray it in a story. If you strip away those \u201cideas\u201d of theme and portrayal, the main idea can stand on its own and offer itself to any number of superior, good storytelling approaches. So when we talk about \u201cbad ideas\u201d becoming great stories, we need to remember to specify that we mean bad conceptualization and development of ideas, as opposed to pure concepts. ",

            "answer_text": "There are no bad ideas. Just horrible executions. In a world where a screenplay about Michael Jackson told through the eyes of his pet chimp Bubbles can go on to become one of the hottest scripts in Hollywood, it\u2019s really about the execution of the idea. Now, yes, I\u2019m being a little tongue in cheek saying that there are no bad ideas \u2014 there certainly are \u2014 but it really depends on the execution of it. It starts with character. A great character can elevate an otherwise bad idea. But the full execution from beginning to end has to be solid. Let\u2019s take Brie Larson\u2019s directorial debut UNICORN STORE (on Netflix). After failing out of art school and taking a humdrum office job, a whimsical painter gets a chance to fulfill her lifelong dream of adopting a unicorn. This idea is a bit ludicrous and could certainly be looked at by some as \u201cbad.\u201d However, the script had an amazing character study. And that character elevated the concept. So just write it well. Write the hell out of it. Embrace the ridiculousness of it if the idea is that \u201cbad\u201d and find a way to make it great. ",
