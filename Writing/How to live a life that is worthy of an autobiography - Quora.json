            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a firm believer that everyone\u2019s life is relatively worthy of atleast a memoir. Most people that you encounter in life have stories of their experiences. No matter how mundane you may think your life\u2019s experiences are, you\u2019ve still had experiences, and I for one love funny stories. Funny stories that are true are really great entertainment. Hold on to the funny memories you have because people will love them. Adversity is something that everyone goes through. Include your adverisities and how you overcame them. That provides some of the best reading material. Now, forget about focusing on how to live a life worthy of an autobiography and just live a unique and personally fulfilling life. Do that and you will be provided with excellent, captivating, and interesting experiences. Set your goals and work as hard as you can to accomplish them. Most biographies have a base of how the person (of whom is the center of the book) got to where they are today. Overall, focus on living a life you want for yourself, so that later on you may have fantastic material for the telling of your story. ",
