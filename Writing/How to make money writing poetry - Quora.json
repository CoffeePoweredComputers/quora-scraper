            "answer_text": "Think about who in the commercial marketplace could use poetry. Contact them, give them some samples (copyright them first). Some examples might be: greeting card companies.florist systems. offer to write short poems involving flowers to accompany the floral arrangement, especially good for Valentines Day, Mother\u2019s Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Father\u2019s Day, etc.Personalization websites. Offer to provide poems they can offer to be engraved or printed with their products. They pay you a royalty per usage.Advertising agencies. They may want to use your poems in some of their ads. The poems should be little jingles. For them, call yourself a jingle writer, not a poet. A poet sounds too non-commercial, too theoretical or literary, too academic. Watch lots of commercials that have songs, ditties, or jingles in them. Get the idea from them, as to what makes the grade commercially in ads. Then write some of your own. Send them in to the Library of Congress, copyright them, and then send them in to ad agencies, with the copyright 2017 noted on them. Also follow through with cold calling the agencies. Find out who to speak to. they always need content. Nobody will laugh at you. If you get rejected, call and speak to someone else at the agency.See if you can use your poetic talents to write lyrics for songs. Then you team up with song writers who provide the music element. collaborate. That could make you rich. This is a way for your poetry to reach millions of people, and make them happy, or express their heartbreak, their sorrow, or their love. Look at the lyrics of best selling hit songs, and then start to write some of your own, with the same rhythm and pace.Write limericks. Write them on the latest hot topics and set up your own blog. Post them, and then also tweet them and use other social media. The idea is to gain traffic and regular visitors to your blog. Then you can monetize that by selling advertising on your bog. YOu should write a new limerick every day. That way people will keep coming back. It could be about Trump, the Kardashians, Game of Thrones, anything popular or in the public eye. How about Kim Jong Un, scary leader of North Korea. He should be good for a few limericks. Even Hurricane Harvey or Irma. If your limericks or poems are on hot topics, the search engines and spiders will regard it as relevant and will pick it up and give it high ranking.Use YouTube also, to recite your poetry. You can read it, and invite the viewer to come to your blog or website and get a free copy of the poem. Put instructions on the poem, that they can disseminate it, but they have to keep it intact, keep your copyright notice on it, and cannot charge any money for it.Other creative ideas: write a book of poetry, and upload it to amazon kindle. charge $2.99, so you\u2019ll get around $2.00 per copy sold. Then promote it with social media, and on your blog, and to your email list that you build up of people whose email address you captured when they came to your site or blog, or asked for a free copy of your poem.Think about writing poetry for niche groups who are avid and spend money. You could write a bunch of Christian poetry, and set up an affiliate arrangement with a large evangelical group that if they send you buyers of your ebook of Christian poetry, they get an affiliate commission. Set it up with Clickbank, Commission Junction, and others. Promote your ebook of Christian poetry on social media also.Promote yourself by writing poetry for celebrities. Then send it in to them. Like Oprah, Ellen De Generis. Tell them you\u2019d be happy to be a guest on their show. Take with info on your books of poetry, hard copies. Use amazon\u2019s print on demand service for hard copies. When you\u2019re on the TV show, or even interviewed on various radio shows, (even from home) \u2014they are desperate for content\u2014you then ask for permission in advance to mention your books or books, in the case of the radio, with your blog or website address, or an 800 number they can use to order your poems.I could go on. I hope you get the idea, that the sky is the limit using your creativity. Poetry can be beautiful, inspiring, uplifting,and express feelings that people may have trouble expressing. So you can help a lot of people, give people pleasure, and hope. That\u2019s why you can make a lot of money with poems. Don\u2019t let anybody discourage you.It will take time. Keep your day job, and write poetry and market it evenings and weekends. Someone may write poetry. But it\u2019s the marketing of the poetry that makes it a business and profitable. You can\u2019t just write and expect money to flow in. You need to work at marketing it, every day. Relentlessly.",
