            "answer_text": "The simplest way is to use a password generator. It randomizes the password based on your specific criteria such as much have uppercase, special characters, and alphanumeric characters. However, in cybersecurity simplicity often comes with major risk as fraud is as prevalent as ever. Stolen credentials are one of the paramount ways in which one can lose a fortune online. The criterion for a strong password includes two opposing purposes: Notable enough that the account owner can remember it without writing it down.Lengthy and rare (no personal info) enough that no one can easily guess it.Passwords are typically attacked through either a dictionary attack (trying every word in the dict.) or brute force attack (all possible word letter combinations i.e. aa, ab, ac) so utilizing special characters and numbers is advantageous. Password re-use is also a highly typical flaw that leaves user accounts particularly vulnerable. Utilizing a password manager is an effective way to store strong passwords. However, simply using passwords (even if strong) still leaves you vulnerable if: Passwords are transmitted in plaintext (not concealed) \u2013 could be intercepted as it moves across the network.Passwords are stored as plaintext \u2013 a hack on the server could could expose all passwords in the database.Market leaders such as Okta, ForgeRock, Microsoft, Ping, & Optimal IDM have all begun to implement some form of passwordless authentication. Passwordless authentication has been achieved through the use of the possession (has) and inherence (is) based factors that go beyond the limited knowledge (knows i.e. password/pin) factor: Possession, meaning, physically with you is being utilized in the form of a smart cards, security tokens, or one-time passwords (OTP) through authentication app, SMS and email.Inherence, meaning something you are including physical biometrics such as fingerprint, handprint, retina, facial scan, liveness detection, and behavioral biometrics such as voice recognition, gait and keystroke dynamics (typing pattern).Behavioral biometric authentication goes a step further by identifying a user based on the unique behavior they have when they interact with a device in a passive, adaptive, and continuous manor resulting in both better security & UX.

            "answer_text": "Pick a sentence that is easy for you to remember. Maybe a Bible verse, the pledge of a allegiance, a line from your favorite book, etc. In this example I will use the Pledge of Allegiance. So the line is - I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. Take the first letter of each word - ipattfotusoa Now add a number at the front or back, or both - 34ipattfotusoa87 Now change one or two of the letters to upper case - 34IpattfotUsoa87 Finally, add one special character to it - 34IpattfotU$oa87 You just created a very unique password that is something you can remember. This password is 15 characters long, uses both upper and lower letters, numbers, and special characters. It would be very resistant to cracking. You can use an example to give you the necessary 8 character password. You can also vary this approach, leaving out characters as long as you keep the password long. The numbers can also be those that are important to you such as birth dates. Normally the advice is to avoid those kinds of numbers but in this instance, since the base password is pretty random, it won\u2019t hurt. Its very unlikely an attacker could create a dictionary to crack this. Please don\u2019t use this actual password. Find your own sentence and then make it unique to you. ",
