            "answer_text": "Scholarship is a great source of financing your personal development for a better future.  The skill of understanding the expectations, aligning these with your starting point and goals to successfully apply for funding, training or a position will be a crucial skill going forward in your life. First, research the criteria for choosing recipients. This will put you in the context and provides the framework of thought for defining your approach. 1- Leadership experience In respect to leadership experience it is not about providing your generic views about your qualities but about your concrete leadership qualities well supported by specific examples of a leadership role or multiple leadership roles you fulfilled. A leadership role can mean a title. It can also mean acting as the person in charge of a task, taking the lead in organizing an event, project etc. or even be a mentor to others. Research as well the topic of leadership. When providing concrete examples out of your personal or professional life which demonstrate the specific leadership qualities you have developed, for example the successful execution of one of the key leadership tasks (e.g. the 6 E\u2019s of Leadership), one of the key capabilities (e.g. sensemaking, relating, visioning and inventing), or your leadership style, etc., I recommend to use the STAR methodology: Situation, Task, Activity, Result. Results and successes are important but if things did not go well you can still use the case to show your ability to learn from failure. 2- Future plans In respect to the future plans, relate them back to the specific scholarship principles, curriculum and goals. Underline that the qualities relevant for realizing your future plans are provided - at least in part - by the scholarship you want to get. Scholarship sponsors look for applicants with vision and motivation. Paint a picture of where you see yourself in 10 years from now and how the scholarship helps you to realize this vision. Give a good rationale why you have this goal to explain your motivation. Ensure that the vision is in line with the principles of the scholarship and with your path so far - if you wish to deviate explain why. You might find sample scholarship essays like these useful. Finally, be authentic in what you write. In order to be credible you need to stand for what you say. Go for your passion! Wish you success with your application! ",
