However, you might still need to reference stats and other info, so you should consider referencing other quality resources. I\u2019m not sure why you don\u2019t want to reference other sites; if you\u2019re worried about competing with them for keyword rankings, then make the links no-follow. Google doesn\u2019t crawl for no-follow links, so they won\u2019t benefit the other site as much, but you\u2019ll still appear informed and add gravitas to your content. ",

Of course, you should still include references to make to your article or blog post more authoritive but having personal experience in a topic is still a good way to write about something without having to do research.
