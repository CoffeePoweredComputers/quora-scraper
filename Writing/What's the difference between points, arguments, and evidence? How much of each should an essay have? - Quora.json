            "answer_text": "What's the difference between points, arguments, and evidence? How much of each should an essay have? Well, evidence is the objective facts. \u201cObjective\u201d in the sense that they\u2019re observable, demonstrable - they\u2019re there in reality for others to see, even if they may construe them differently, they\u2019re substance and features can\u2019t really be denied. \u201cArgument\u201d is a serious of connected statements intended to establish a logical proposition. It\u2019s a case being made, so to speak. \u201cPoint\u201d in this context, is what you mean by it or what you intend it to prove. \u201cPoint\u201d is a bit less technical than the other two. \u201cPoint\u201d could just be the upshot, what you\u2019re getting at. Point could be a crux or just a gist. In any case - get to the point. Every argument you make had best have a point. Better still, its point should go to support your overall conclusion - why include that argument, otherwise? Every argument you make had best be founded in one of two ways. 1) you argue from a universally-known (or assumed) uncontroversial truth. Something no one would dispute, and then reason logically from there, step by step, each step the inevitable consequence of the one before. Or else, 2) you\u2019d dang well better include some evidence for your basis. The evidence is what supports the argument. Shows you\u2019re not just reasoning from thin air. The two are by no means mutually-exclusive. Even if you\u2019ve got an undisputed truth to begin from, you may need to add in additional evidence to support the argument you want to make. Generally, you include only the arguments you need to to establish the conclusion you intend. Strongest best. Every argument should have a point, and - unless you\u2019ve got a really unshakable premise for that argument - some supporting evidence as well. Even if only to illustrate your main point, those evidence-based arguments really help to put it over. ",

            "answer_text": "here\u2019s an easy sentence to help: in order to get your point across, you have to use evidence to fuel your argument. it may sound a little confusing, so don\u2019t worry! you\u2019ll get the hang of it. disclaimer: i\u2019m tackling this as a high-school perspective. college requirements may vary \u2014 this is for an 11th or 12th grade level literature writing. a point is the main tone / reasoning you\u2019re writing. however, when it\u2019s used broadly, points are basically the equivalent of arguments, except to a lesser degree. considering there\u2019s remotely no difference, i\u2019m going to exclude points and make it into a main point. a point would be similar to \u2014 in an essay about taylor swift \u2014 debate. your point would be the fact you\u2019re trying to convince people something about taylor swift. hopefully that makes sense! arguments are mostly used in debate essays and i suggest only using it for that type. essays, similar to, entertaining or informational, shouldn\u2019t have an argument because the ideal audience is not threatening what you\u2019re writing. it should either be in a funny tone or a factual one. arguments would be similar to \u201ctaylor swift is an evolutionary singer.\u201d evidence is what fuels arguments, but it can be used for informational essays as well as debate essays. evidence would be similar to \u201ctaylor swift is an evolutionary singer because of her \u2014 from big or small \u2014 more than 300 award wins.\u201d if you were to use evidence in an informational essay, it would be similar to \u201ctaylor swift has won over 300 awards, which fueled the decisions from the music award industries to give her artist of the decade and woman of the decade\u201d. to answer the latter, it depends on the essay. you should really have one point and one argument, with three - five pieces of evidence for a classic two-page MLA formatting essay. with debate, you can have one - two arguments, with three - five evidences. and finally, with entertainment, it should ideally be one ( + ) point(s) and however much \u2018evidence\u2019 you wish (which would just be things such as metaphors, foreshadowing, and personification). hope this helped c: ",
