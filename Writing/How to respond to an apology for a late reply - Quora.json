            "answer_text": "If their replies are usually quick and they slip up a few times, then I appreciate the apology. I say \u201cthanks. It\u2019s fine\u201d and get over it. However, if said person is ALWAYS leaving you on read and then FINALLY replying \u201csorry for the late reply\u201d\u2026 over and over and over again\u2026.I tend to get sarcastic. I give just a little bit of a hint that I\u2019m a bit bothered, but not too much to come off as emotional. I might say something along the lines of \u201cokay\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not mad\u201d (I am). Because the person generally knows they\u2019re doing wrong but doesn\u2019t care, so they just say they\u2019re sorry to make it look like they care but they really don\u2019t mean it. They care more about what people think of them than they care about actually hurting people. They know they can just keep leaving you on read as long as they say sorry at the end of the day. I dont know. It really just depends on how often they apologize over it. If they slip up occasionally, then just say \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d and get over it. If they take forever to reply ALL THE TIME then you can either let em have it or give them a hint your upset. Or just drop them. Like the old saying goes, a true apology is a change in behavior. And FYI, if this second scenario is happening to you: chances are the person is either just really, REALLY busy or doesn\u2019t care for the conversation or for you. Drop that toxic person. ",

            "answer_text": "Unless the late reply has seriously inconvenienced you, I would say nothing at all. Usually apologizing for a late reply is done to acknowledge a minor lapse. It is a sign of respect on their part, and does not have to be answered. Take up with the relationship where you left off. They will understand that they have been forgiven. On the other hand, if they have missed a particular deadline, or it is no longer convenient or possible for you to deliver on something you had promised because of the delay, you might wish to let them know politely of the change. Nevertheless, even here, silence is often the usual response, especially if the relationship is not a close or important one and you are willing to let it lapse. If they have lost an opportunity, they will find out soon enough when you fail to reply at all. A third option might be to address the delay with humor and kindness. This approach would work for a fairly close relationship where you were seriously annoyed or worried about an extended delay. \u201cGood to hear from you again! I thought maybe you had joined a monastery!\u201d Or \u201cI hope the chinchillas didn\u2019t put you off!\u201d This gives them a chance to apologize further and give an explanation if they haven\u2019t already, so that amends can be made more squarely.
