            "answer_text": "As Candace Barr mentioned, including all of the specifics of the type of work that you did, how many students you helped, and what kind of results you saw are all positive. If you just include \"private tutor\" and no other details, it's hard for a potential employer to know if you helped your friend's sister with some homework once, or if you worked with half a dozen students for two years straight. Most will probably assume the former, which could be to your detriment if you actually spent a lot of your free time working with students. When I include my tutoring experience on my resume I tailor it the job I'm applying for, the same way I would for any other prior experience. So if the job I'm applying for isn't particularly interested in my experience working with students with their algebra homework as much as they care about my research and engineering background, tutoring is moved lower on the resume. However, if I'm applying for a job in the educational field, showing prolonged interest in helping students is definitely a plus, so that'll probably move it up higher. Finally, don't be afraid to highlight your tutoring experience. A lot of people underestimate how much work goes into being a tutor, including potential employers. From preparing lessons, to learning new skills, to explaining complex concepts in simple terms, to running a profitable business, tutoring covers a lot of the core components of many jobs. While I wouldn't lie or exaggerate, try to think of how you can discuss all of the different aspects of tutoring in as positive a light as possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Framing a resume can be a challenging task when we need to incorporate tutoring as our full time profession. Our grades in the resume may reflect our mastery over certain subjects, learning skills, but our sharing the same knowledge with others successfully via tutoring, only demonstrates our competency. Now our experiences need to be well tabulated in our resume. Generally describing our job profile, just mentioning the subjects we have taught and student age group will not do. We need to be specific, applying correct keywords in the job description connecting to our tutoring background is necessary. The planning, preparation and tailoring our teaching style according to the students\u2019 needs have to be well charted. The points to be highlighted are as follows: Communicated with school teachers and parents regarding the progress of the student.Elucidated in easy-to-understand language various complex terms to the students.Assisted the students in various complicated assignments.Worked effectively with students at various learning levels according to age group.Managed multifarious schedules in order to provide maximum service to many students.Coordinated between technological apps, videos, and bookish explanations on various subjects.Our resume must display that we are one of a kind and not everyone can be a tutor. Tutoring experience testifies a candidate's Intelligence, patience, confidence, teamwork, listening skills, quick thinking abilities. What more can an employer look for in an applicant who has these qualities! ",
