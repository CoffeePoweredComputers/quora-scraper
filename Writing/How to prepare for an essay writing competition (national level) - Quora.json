            "answer_text": "Firstly, know the rules and, if you can, the topics, and a little about the judges. Read the works of other winners of the competition, prior to you. Know the goal of the essay. Is the goal to convince, or entertain, or refute? Is it to read an existing piece and dissect? Is it an opinion piece? Creative writing? If you can, know! The writing skills are going to have to be honed already. You\u2019ll need to know how to use juxtaposition, allusion, and use grammar and punctuation to create flow \u2014 so nothing new there. Clarity and directness is good in most cases, but if these judges are from academia, then you may want to leverage more complex sentence forms in the body of work. I usually don\u2019t advocate complexity. Clarity is much more powerful. Secondly, whether you read up on topics that you know are included in the competition, or simply cover a lot of current affairs from various magazines and books, try to read in a well-rounded way. That is, don\u2019t read only Western writers\u2019 opinions; don\u2019t read only white writers\u2019 opinions; don\u2019t read only male writers\u2019 opinions. You\u2019ll get a full and rich context if you read across a variety of diverse writers. And don\u2019t automatically discount an opinion different than your own, either. If a disabled woman writer is expressing an opinion in her book or magazine / newspaper article, do yourself a favour and take it seriously. Some people will automatically downplay, or even discount the experiences and opinions of diverse writers like these. Don\u2019t you fall into that trap. Read in good faith until and unless the writer begins to prove you should do otherwise. Final point \u2014 because there have been other good points for you to get to in this thread \u2014 have fun! You\u2019re not going to win a competition if you\u2019re not memorable. To be memorable it helps to be authentic and speak your (well-researched) mind. It\u2019s hard to do that until you\u2019ve formulated an opinion on all you\u2019ve read, and unless you relax and have fun writing about the topic. Readers can feel the difference in the writing, and you will too. If the topic isn\u2019t one that anyone could have fun writing, cover it factually, but don\u2019t forget to humanize as you do so. Demographers can be guilty of forgetting this, sometimes. One doesn\u2019t want to run the risk of treating the people behind the numbers like chess pieces, or worse, brood mares. I\u2019m not sure this advice will come close to covering the prep work you\u2019ll need to do. Maybe you\u2019re looking for advice more like \u2018Carry several pens\u2019. \u2018Be ready to respond with heroic couplets in carmen figuratum\u2019, though\u2026 I\u2019d probably get a kick out of that, not gonna lie! But, generally speaking, think about the topic you\u2019ve got deeply and creatively. Innovate. And leave nothing on the table. After you\u2019re done, read it back and make changes as needed, to grammar, punctuation (for flow), and add what\u2019s missing. Clarify what\u2019s unclear. After you\u2019ve done your best, let it go. You can\u2019t go into the minds of the judges and make them choose your work, after all. But you can make your work hard not to choose. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "This kind of depends\u2026 do you know the prompt? If so the prep is fairly straight forward-looking research and educate yourself to the best of your ability on the subject and organize with a strong universal thesis and strong points. I would also advise against the traditional 5 paragraph format, unless regulations specify otherwise. But, as the likelihood is that you do not know your prompt, I would simply advise looking up on depth prompts and write. In that manner you will be able to create synaptic responses to that specific trigger (the essay prompt), create easier neurological pathways to allow the information and organization to flow, and heighten your vocabulary and sentence sttucture. Essentially, practice will make perfect in this case. I'm sorry I couldn't be more help. ",
