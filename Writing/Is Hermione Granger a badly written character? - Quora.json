            "answer_text": "Absolutely! Being relatable doesn\u2019t always mean a character is written well. Hermione starts off very relatable to all the little girls out there who preferred the company of books to that of people; the little girls who were swotty know-it-alls, who struggled to make friends, who had the teachers\u2019 admiration but not that of the other students. Little girls who got bullied for their love of books - and wouldn\u2019t you know it, Harry Potter was a book first, so that meant there was a big chance of said little girls picking up the book and immediately liking Hermione\u2019s love of books - could see themselves in Hermione Granger, the intense, bossy little bookworm whose heart is in the right place and would give life and limb for her friends. For the first three books she\u2019s rather great. She has buck teeth, which is often considered unattractive, like Ron\u2019s red hair or Harry being scrawny. She makes mistakes which prove she is not infaillible. She crushes on the school\u2019s most incompetent teacher who then turns out to be a chilling villain under all his goofiness, proving she is capable of lapses in judgement like everyone else. Prisoner of Azkaban is the book where she displays all the ways she needs to grow, from her stubborn pride that keeps her estranged from Ron for over a month because she just wouldn\u2019t apologize, to her hatred of failure in that she\u2019d rather quit a class than not succeed at it, as well as how she burns herself out with her trying to take every available class in the curriculum. Chamber of Secrets already had some sort of mini-arc for Hermione, to get her to stop believing in everything she reads in books, and Prisoner of Azkaban has now set up all the flaws she has and could grow out of over the course of the series. We could imagine Hermione experiencing failure and get a look into her insecurities, see how she fears Harry and Ron only keep her around because she\u2019s useful for homework. This would make Hermione even more relatable and human, as well as reassure people like her when Harry\u2026 stands awkwardly to the side because he\u2019s Harry - and Ron tells Hermione that she\u2019s crazy and there\u2019s no way she can think such rubbish is true, they\u2019re her friends because\u2026 well he doesn\u2019t really know but it\u2019s certainly NOT because of her grades, she could be the biggest dunce in the school and they\u2019d still want to hang around with her because she\u2019s Hermione! She\u2019s their friend and that\u2019s the end of it. Stuck with them forever. They\u2019re going to be glued to her worse than a gnome to a carrot! We could imagine Hermione\u2019s pride ebbing away as she and her friends get into conflicts and she refuses to concede any points. The last time she did that in Prisoner of Azkaban, she turned out to be right but it was at the cost of Ron\u2019s friendship (for a while); here just have her be flat-out wrong. Because she\u2019s not all-knowing, she\u2019s not almighty, and being clever and having good grades doesn\u2019t prevent one from being wrong (don\u2019t I know it).When I say that Hermione ought to grow past her pride, I don\u2019t mean for her to sweep her intelligence under the rug to get accepted better, no way. I\u2019m just talking about her learning to relent, about her learning to accept other people\u2019s opinions, about her growing more tolerant and thoughtful. But hey, Rowling is the one steering the wheel! So let\u2019s see how Hermione overcomes her flaws and grows as a character! So, how does she grow in Goblet of Fire? \u2026 She explains Ron\u2019s feelings to Harry - she doesn\u2019t get it right but Harry seems to accept her word as the truth - gets her buck teeth shrunk, and is courted by a famous athlete who gives her a perfect date and when she shows up at said date she\u2019s so beautiful even the racist who hates her guts doesn\u2019t insult her. \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 Yes hello Cinderesue nice to meet you. Uh. Ok. Alright. Ok. Um. Okaaaaaay well that was\u2026 something! No character development for Hermione at all, alright, totally fine, why not, ok. Why does she explain Ron\u2019s feelings to Harry though, and especially why does Harry listen to her, it\u2019s not like Hermione is known for being good with feelings - Ok whatever let\u2019s go Order Of The Phoenix! She\u2019s made prefect which has zero impact on the plot but gives Romione shippers plenty of opportunities to write missing moments fanfics, gets Harry to start the DA against his will - perfect, Hermione\u2019s bossiness interfering with her friendships - and Harry turns out to enjoy it - nevermind! - forces Harry to conduct an interview with Rita Skeeter even though he had a date - ah, good, that is bound to create some conflict - and Harry\u2026 doesn\u2019t react - nevermind!\u00b2 - then she explains Cho Chang\u2019s feelings to Harry and tells Ron he\u2019s incapable of feeling emotions\u2026 and then she is scarring a student for life without repercussions, and pretty much never had anything wrong happen to her aside from being knocked out at the DoM due to her own dumb mistake that is never expanded upon. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Ok, alright, why is Hermione suddenly giving out free psychology lessons now? Why the eff has she become the go-to for feelings stuff? Maybe because she\u2019s the only one of the trio with some romantic experience but come the eff on, one date does not a love expert make. And she was already doing that in GoF so that makes no sense - Ok ok ok Half-Blood Prince maybe there\u2019s finally something that takes her down a peg or two because so far I haven\u2019t seen anything like growth from Miss Granger - Hermione attacks Ron with canaries because he hurt her feelings.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026just\u2026 gonna\u2026 get back to that\u2026 later\u2026Hermione displays her tremendous lack of faith in Ron\u2019s abilities to succeed by himself, which greatly harms their relationship but most of the blame is pinned on Ron instead because Ron\u2019s feelings matter less than Hermione\u2019s in Rowling\u2019s narrative; Hermione is angry with Harry because she considers he\u2019s cheating to get better Potions grades even though he offered to share the book with her, she thinks the HBP\u2019s book was written by someone bad, she even tries to make Harry feel guilty about it JUST AFTER DUMBLEDORE\u2019S DEATH WHAT THE EVERLOVING F*CK HOW IS THAT GIRL CONSIDERED THE \u201cSENSITIVE\u201d ONE, she turns out to have been right with absolutely no call-out of her behaviour.Also she attacked Ron with canaries and is never confronted for it. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. b o i Okay so Hermione didn\u2019t\u2026 get anything resembling a character arc or whatever for the past three books. Alright. Well let\u2019s hope Deathly Hallows will change that? Better late than never I mean? Like, Ron\u2019s character arc which was hinted at in the first book, then surfaced back in the fourth, then a bit in the sixth - though how humiliating him repeatedly and hammering his self-esteem down to the Earth\u2019s core is supposed to teach him that his insecurities don\u2019t define him eludes me - and it\u2019s set to conclude in this one, so let\u2019s see - Hermione Obliviates her parents so they won\u2019t be in the way, but it\u2019s okay they\u2019re not characters anyway; Hermione is so pretty that she now gets cat-called by men on the street; Hermione is the only one who has done some packing for the Horcrux Hunt because she\u2019s the only one who\u2019s gone camping before\u2026? But in Goblet of Fire Harry and the Weasleys went camping - ok fine whatever, she saves Harry\u2019s life but breaks his wand but his life is saved so it\u2019s not that bad\u2026 Ah, yes, it seems she HAS learned something after all! Yay character growth!She has learned that she can beat Ron up with her fists and threaten to send canaries at him and that he won\u2019t fight back because his self-esteem is so low in the dumps he just accepts it.Yay character growth???!!!??!? She insists that the Deathly Hallows can\u2019t possibly exist in spite of the fact that she was perfectly willing to admit that all legends had some truth to it in Chamber of Secrets, so she actually regressed mentally; she gets tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange but she\u2019s up and about a few hours later so it might have well not had happened; she finally stops using mind games with Ron and just kisses him (yaaaay, now can you learn to not hurl canaries at him?); and in the Epilogue she again shows that she doesn\u2019t exactly trust Ron\u2019s abilities and then is proved right because Rowling is\u2026 Rowling. Ok. So Ron is married to HBP!Hermione. Nice. Nice. I\u2019ll just, um, call the police. Anyway. See anything resembling\u2026 change, mistakes, growth, lessons learned? Yeah me neither. And that\u2019s a badly-written character. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I like Hermione, she\u2019s clever and determined and strong. She can be scornful, a perfectionist and insensitive. Those are her qualities, good and bad. She\u2019s a good character, but she is badly written. I don't think you can separate her character\u2019s qualities from the narrative, because the way she is written is the way that the narrative presents her. When the narrative ignores or excuses her more questionable behaviour, as readers we are supposed to do the same. Shielding a character from question or criticism is bad writing, in my opinion. Hermione has great potential, and I think she is well-written in the first few books. In PS especially, she goes from being awkward, bossy and condescending to recognising the importance of friendship and bravery over intelligence and books. She still is incredibly clever and never loses her determination to be academically brilliant, but she starts to develop more social skills etc. Her consistent flaws are: a lack of emotional intelligence which can make her insensitive, fear of failure/expecting too much of herself and freezing under pressure. However, in the later books Hermione becomes more and more immune to criticism. What starts as Hermione/Ron bickering equally turns into \u201cHermione and Ron argue a lot, but it\u2019s always Ron\u2019s fault and he is always meaner\u201dHermione can be insensitive because she cares too much about logic (e.g. Lavender\u2019s rabbit) becomes, \u201cHermione is factually correct so it doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s rude\u201d (e.g. her scorn of Luna that gets overlooked, refusing to listen to the actual house elves but just calling them brainwashed and trying to trick them into being freed)Hermione uses advanced magic to jinx a contract without telling anyone it could permanently disfigure them if they break it? \u201cBrilliant\u201dHermione attacks one of her best friends, unprovoked while he is defenceless? Narrative emphasises the fact she is upset, so fans blame the victim (Ron)Hermione freezes under pressure becomes Hermione consistently and reliably pulls the trio out of danger in every situation with a spur-of-the-moment plan and idea. Granted this could just be a development of character, except there\u2019s no arc for that. It just happens.Hermione is academically brilliant but isn\u2019t very emotionally intelligent becomes Hermione can reliably explain other people\u2019s complex emotions even when she has never had a conversation with that person about how they are feeling (e.g. Cho).Bonus points as emotional intelligence is one of Ron\u2019s strengths that he loses and Hermione gains.Writing out a character\u2019s flaws, with no explanation or demonstration of them working to overcome them is lazy. Protecting a character even when they are in the wrong is bad writing. Favouring one character to the detriment of another is bad writing. If you do those things, you will end up with fans who glorify the character and refuse to even contemplate any criticism about them\u2026 or with fans who are sick of them never being called out and so feel the need to loudly point out those flaws to everyone else\u2026 ",
