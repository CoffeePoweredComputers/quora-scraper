It\u2019s the best way to be sure that the writing to be deleted won\u2019t confuse the OCR device or the mail carrier. Or me. OCR has come a long way, but it\u2019s still helpful to print legibly. USPS mail carriers would love for all of us to improve our printing. USPS Postal Explorer/Delivery Address requests\u2026 Always put the address and the postage on the same side of your mailpiece.On a letter, the address should be parallel to the longest side.All capital lettersNo punctuationAt least 10-point typeOne space between city and stateTwo spaces between state and ZIP CodeSimple type fontsLeft justifiedBlack ink on white or light paperNo reverse type (white printing on a black background)If you are using address labels, make sure you don't cut off any important information. Also make sure your labels are on straight. Mail processing machines have trouble reading crooked or slanted information.Okay. So, this is funny. The same site\u2019s example violates #3, #4, & #7. And since when do we not put a comma between the city and state when they are written on the same line?  from the (Welcome | Postal Explorer) webpage ",

But the post office workers don\u2019t like it (obviously) and the counter staff will ask you to clean it up (which was usual in my day). The point is to keep the envelope in as clean a state as possible. That is why address labels are used \u2014 so that wrong addressing can be \u2018corrected\u2019 with an overlay label. Update:\u2014 Be considerate of the postal workers. They can\u2019t always read your handwriting. Don\u2019t make it harder for them to do their jobs. They start at 2am or 3am and finish around lunchtime. ",

Reason (in the US, anyway): addresses are read by an automatic sorter which is actually capable of discerning many different kinds of hand writing. If you merely cross out the incorrect material, the OCR may still try to read it. And who knows where it might end up? However, if you completely black it out, there is \u201cnothing\u201d to read and the OR will work only on what is obviously written material. Hope that helps. ",
