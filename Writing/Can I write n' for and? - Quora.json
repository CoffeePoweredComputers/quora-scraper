It\u2019s extremely informal, or represents an informal and somewhat careless style of speech, so is only used occasionally. It occurs in phrases like \u201crock-n-roll\u201d, also \u201cFish \u2019n\u2019 Chips\u201d (sometimes used in takeaway restaurant signs). It can also be used in dialogue to denote careless speech: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d, I asked; He shrugged, \u201cThis \u2019n\u2019 that\u201d. ",
