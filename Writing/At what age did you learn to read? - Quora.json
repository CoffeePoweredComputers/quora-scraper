            "answer_text": "I suppose at the age of three. Maybe earlier? I can't remember the time I couldn't read. I can't remember learning the skill. I have always known how to read. I remember when I was four I made it possible for my kindergarten teachers to sneak out for a quick cigarette. They gave me books (that had the script I am using to write this post). I had to read to the others. It was easy and quick for me. I remember learning the Gothic script (Frakturschrift). I think it was in primary school or so. I did it to read the books and the magazines published in the 1920s. My grandmother told me two important things that still haunt me: Latin script (the one I am using now) is dangerous. It damages the eyes. Gothic script is not dangerous. It does not damage the eyes.There are really two S\u2019s. Not one.My grandmother was more used to Gothic script. That\u2019s the one she learned at school. Because of nostalgic reasons I read a few books in that script every year. I can actually remember learning it. Of course I used the learning by doing method. This means that occasionally I have to lower my head in shame in front of a freaky capital letter. My early reading skills caused some confusions. E.g. I could not understand why some people visited other people in the middle of the day and took their clothes off. Yes, they were in love, but love and being naked are two very different things. This is what happens if you read novels before you find out sex exists. The novels were not very explicit, but some details got me a bit confused. I also remember two souls that were united after a wedding. In their bedroom. In the middle of the night. Very strange witchcraft! I used to approach random aunties at parties and ask them about their male companions: \u201cIs he your lover?\u201d In my novels aristocrats were often married but that was irrelevant. Their lovers were very relevant. So basically I accused some nice people of adultery. Maybe I was right? My mother told me not to ask such questions. My objection: \u201cBut lovers are good people!\u201d was not accepted. At that moment I understood that the life in the novels was somehow very different. ",

            "answer_text": "I learned to read when I was about 3 or 4 years old. My parents say that I was reading by then, but I could read so young I can\u2019t even remember learning. Or that might just be because I\u2019m super absentminded and have a not-so-great memory. I can barely remember any of my toddlerhood. I actually have a picture of baby-me holding a book (it was upside down, lol), but I could definitely NOT read at that age. I mean, you\u2019d think that if I was able to read, I\u2019d be out of diapers, too. I also had a high level of writing at an early age. Writing is something I enjoy, and I\u2019ve always had a way with words, along with a good understanding of grammar, punctuation, etc. I think the reason my writing is so good, though, is because of extensive reading. Being exposed to a lot of books helped expand by vocabulary, and taught me techniques authors use in their writing. Nowadays, I read a ton of books well above my age level, and can go through them like wildfire. I\u2019m also working on writing my own, although it\u2019s just in the beginning stage. My love of reading started at an early age, and hasn\u2019t stopped since. ",

We read in books called basalt because they were meant for that grade level. The teachers never noticed that I was learning disabled and having a hard time reading.I read at home somehow. I had lots of books and very educated parents. No one knew until 6th grade when I had to read in from of my class. I couldn't read it. My teacher talked to me and then my parents and my mother, who was a wonderful ex-teacher helped me by reading material with me.I managed to get through school with only her help. In college, I learned about learning disabilities and realized that I fit the category!!!!! I have two Master\u2019s degrees which means I read a lot. It was never easy!!! When I read now, I read the story to myself and I was surprised to find out that other people don\u2019t have to do that. The words just get \u201cinto their brains\u201d without having to read to yourself. SOOOOO, you ask when did I learn to read? some people say that I still don\u2019t because I have to read it to myself. GO figure!!!! ",

When I was in my 40\u2019s, someone told me that I couldn\u2019t speak English before I went to school, and my Mum had to deliver me to kindergarten because I would run away (I remember the running away part). I remember my first book had pictures with the word below it, and I loved that book so much. I\u2019m not sure if that book helped me read or learn English - or both. In grade one I got the hang of reading (and apparently English as well). Then I got in trouble for going ahead in the grade one reader and my Mum was summoned to the school. She told my Dad and he told me to get my coat - I was terrified that I was being sent away. Then we went to the store and I got The King of the Golden River by Ruskin, The Little Lame Prince by Mulock and two Bobbsey Twins books. After that, I would read anything that I came across, such as cereal boxes where I learned that Shreddies had butylated hydroxyanisole. My favorite presents have always been books and I would always get at least two Nancy Drews every year. ",

That was in infant school aged 4\u20135ish, and I remember it because I wasn\u2019t being stimulated. We had quiet reading sessions where everyone had to go and get a book from the shelf in the hall, but there was an order that had to be followed. Dozens upon dozens of those dreary learn to read books. \u201cThis is Peter.\u201d \u201cPeter has a dog.\u201d \u201cThe dog is called Fido.\u201d I specifically remember asking the teacher if I could go for something more challenging but nein, \u201cfinish these first\u201d. If I were a smart alec, I might have said something like \u201cI don\u2019t intend to live that long\u201d. In reality, I just resigned myself to my fate. It\u2019s fine, I was already reading proper big boy books at home anyway, with subordinate clauses \u2019n\u2019 everything! I did eventually get recognised as a good reader though, and was promptly picked out to read a book to the class. My teacher, in an oral reading session, had discovered that I was a good reader. \u201cExpressive\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d were the adjectives routinely used during subsequent oral sessions throughout infant and primary school. Trouble was, sitting on a chair in front of the whole class, poised to read like a juvenile Roald Dahl at the start of a Tales of the Unexpected, left me shaking in my size threes. My expression got the hiccups, and I left feeling like Chamberlain facing the vote of no confidence. I did win the reading cup a little later, even got the Polaroid to prove it. They didn\u2019t let you have any of the sweets that filled the cup though. It was all just for show. Stingy arses. ",

I just remember clutching the new magically unfamiliar books and hiding under the table in the middle of my grandmother\u2019s living room to read them. My mother started reading to me when I was six months old or thereabouts. I suspect I memorized the stories she read, then paged through the books by myself reciting the words, and somehow figured out that there was a connection between the black squiggles on the pages and words. After that, I could read, and I haven\u2019t stopped since. Original question: What age did you learn how to read? ",

I would read and read for hours, devouring nearly everything my mom had (for kids), as well as non-children\u2019s fiction like The Hobbit. Eventually, when I went to school (in Estonia that\u2019s when you\u2019re seven) I read Harry Potter, the first four books in both Estonian and English, the rest only in English (the translation quality varies).
