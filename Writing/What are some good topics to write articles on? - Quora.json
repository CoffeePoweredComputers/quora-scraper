            "answer_text": "Yasmina is it? I thought I saw that flicker by as this loaded. Well Yasmina, I have to say a couple of things that may, in the current academic parlance, seem \"micro-aggressive\" but for an aspiring writer I find it rather incredible that you would ask the question. You see, writing is usually the effect, not the cause. Most of us write because we have things in our head that need to get out. They take the form of stories that simply must be told, or ideas that need to be shared or explored. There can be experiences that need to be remembered thoroughly and I can promise that there is no way to explore a memory than to wrote it out, and not just a page or two but two-hundred and fifty pages. Get into all your feelings about that experience, what the bus smelled like or the poor teeth of the girl you met on the train to Calcutta. Writing gives you the opportunity to dig into details of a thing you could never do in a verbal narrative. No one would listen that long---but they will read that long.For fiction---my beat---you must engage your imagination. If you don't have one perhaps another line of work might be more suitable, and less frustrating. To imagine a complete novel's worth of story is to have it, complete with characters, venues and situations, play out in your mind like a movie. If you have this gift then it is like writing down what you see in your head using the best, freshest and most elegant prose of which you are capable. You must strive to make every sentence a gem. Avoid all clich\u00e9s and the misuse of words that will annoy your editor.I made a bet with a writer friend of mine that we could come up with a killer of a title and I could write a book off of it. We did and I did and my crime novel \"The Sin Eaters\" is the result. What you are searching for is a spark, something you could feed and nurture into a fire, a conflagration to consume your mind and drive you to push those keys---or that pencil should you be the anachronistic type---and get it on paper while it is there in your mind. When you find that idea, and you will, that sends chills up your spine and makes you want, no need, to get it down. If you take nothing else from this, please remember, nothing is so perishable as an idea. They don't spoil, they just evaporate.The very best of luck and remember, writers write. When two writers meet, one invariably asks the question, \"What are you writing?\"Rob Dorsey ",

            "answer_text": "One of the bonuses of a diverse population/audience is there is a market for every topic. Specialty magazines, such as Bicycling, Hot Rod, Southern Living, DIY, Popular Science, etc, publish articles on a wide range of topics, but geared toward the overall theme of the magazine. I have several articles published in RN, Journal of Legal Nurse Consulting, Nursing, and RV, My first article to be published was about peer review organizations in the healthcare field and how to document effectively to prevent confusion on the part of the medical chart reviewer. They review for utilization of resources and quality of care. Writing contests are looking for short stories, essays, first chapters of books and poetry. You can even express your opinion in a local or national newspaper. If there is a area you enjoy writing about, find the market or adapt your article to a specialized publication. The Internet has millions of sites looking for content. Explore. Research. Write. You can publish a collection of articles or essays on Amazon. Not all self-published ebooks are fiction, novel length, poorly written or badly formatted. Just be careful to follow the rules and then publicize the heck out of it to capture an audience. Quora is a good place to practice writing persuasive or informative essays. I\u2019ve found people to be helpful with typos and appreciative of efforts to answer questions. Yes, some article topics will be more popular than others. Some publications only give you copies of their magazines or journals as payment. Some will pay enough to keep you motivated to write even more. Good luck author. I look forward to reading your efforts. ",
