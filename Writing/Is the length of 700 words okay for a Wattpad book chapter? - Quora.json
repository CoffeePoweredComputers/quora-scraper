            "answer_text": "Depends on the kind of book. Depends on the genre. Depends on where you are at writing in the book. Depends on how much of an experienced writer you are. Depends on how man readers and what kind you have. Many books have 500 word chapters and that is okay. However, many readers do not like short chapters and prefer them in between 1000 and 2500 - 3000 words. That is not always the case. But, all in all, it is your book. Write what you feel is neccessary. Just do not go from a 700 word chapter to a 3000 word chapter. If you feel that the chapter is over, then just stop and write the next fchapter. If later on you want to make your chapters longer, slowly increase the amount. E.g: Chapter 1: 700, Chapter 2: 800, Chapter 3: 1000, Chapter 4: 1200, Chapter 5: 1200, Chapter 6: 1500. Don\u2019t make it too obvious that your increasing the word limit. Not that it\u2019s a bad thing, but readers shouldn\u2019t be noticing the word count if your book is really good. In conclusion, yes 700 words is enough. ",
