I really I am grateful to you for blessing me with such a wonderful life. I am obliged to have a lovely family and friends. I believe people don't thank you enough for their lives. People tend to be so blinded by the flaws in their lives that they forget there is a happy side to it too. I am lucky to have enough food, a shelter and the much needed warmth and love in my life. I will never be able to thank you enough for the miraculous life I've been blessed with. ",
