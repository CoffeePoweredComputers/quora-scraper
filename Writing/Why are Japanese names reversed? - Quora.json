            "answer_text": "It\u2019s also the way Japanese linguistics work. Since family names linguistically express who we (the individuals) are in relation to our family (the larger group), this calls for a genitive expression (usually the equivalent of the English word \u201cof\u201d) to denote possession of the group over the individual. Over time, these genitive markers (if ever used) are largely lost. Take a look at the following examples from several languages, and how the common forms of names are essentially simplified ways of expressing the more complete names in parentheses. John Smith (John of [the] Smith [family])Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor (Sin\u00e9ad, descendent of [the] Connor [family])Ludwig van Beethoven (Ludwig of [the] Beethoven [family]\uae40\ubbfc\ud638/Kim Minho (\uae40\uc758 \ubbfc\ud638/Kim-\u00fbi Minho; Minho of [the] Kim [family])\u5c71\u672c\u7d75\u91cc\u5b50/Yamamoto Eriko (\u5c71\u672c\u306e\u7d75\u91cc\u5b50/Yamamoto-no Eriko; Eriko of [the] Yamamoto [family])You\u2019ll notice that in the instances of Korean and Japanese (examples 4 and 5), the genitive form is expressed in a way which is reverse to that of English. That\u2019s just the nature of those languages. It\u2019s the same for small places within larger places. For example, \u201cAlbany, New York, USA\u201d is really an abbreviated way of saying \u201cAlbany in New York State in the United States of America\u201d. This would be expressed in Japanese as the following: \u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u5408\u8846\u56fd\u306e\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30e8\u30fc\u30af\u5dde\u306e\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30cb\u30fc\u5e02 Amerika Gassh\u016bkoku-no Ny\u016b Y\u014dku Sh\u016b-no Aruban\u012b (The United States of America [gen. marker] New York State [gen. marker] Albany) Side note: Some languages sidestep the genitive marker completely, and use a different form of possessive expression: a patronymic or matronymic. For example: Margr\u00e9t J\u00f3hannsd\u00f3ttir (Margr\u00e9t, J\u00f3hann\u2019s daughter). ",

            "answer_text": "You got a few good answers there. Note the cultural presumption in your question, that the western way of writing names is correct! Japanese people can work with someone for years and not know their first name. Its normal to address someone as Nakano san or Sakamoto san (the latter my wife\u2019s surname: it means Original Slope). I work in a high school where there are now two teachers called Sakai. How do the other teachers distinguish them for me? Easy, the older Mr. Sakai and the younger Mr. Sakai. Actually surnames were the prerogative of the samurai class during the Edo Period, the surname often being combined with the clan that the samurai belonged to. It was only after the overthrow of the Tokugawa system, that commoners were obliged to have a surname when Family Registration Act was put into force in 1871. This was to enable the government to mobilize soldiers. Before that, except for the samurai, names were very informal and reflected the elements of the land where the farmers lived. Many Japanese names are based on locations or elements of nature, for example Yamashita (bottom of the mountain), Suzuki (bell tree), Kawaguchi (mouth of the river) etc. First names, especially for boys, often reflected the order of birth of those sons, Ichiro and Kazuo for first born, Jiro for second son, Saburo for third son etc. This was the traditional way of naming, but these days that way of naming (not christening!) has been mostly abandoned. So\u2026 Middle rice field, first born son (Tanaka Ichiro). Its functional but not exactly romantic. The most common surname in Japan? Sato \u4f50\u85e4 Number of people with that name: 1,928,000. Meaning: Alongside \u201ct\u014d\u201d \u85e4 (wisteria), we find sa \u4f50, meaning \u201cto assist\u201d. Assisted wisteria? well, why not? ",
