            "answer_text": "My gut is telling me that you aren\u2019t looking for a mentor, but rather someone who can do it instead of you. Why? There are freelancers who want to sell or buy Upwork accounts. There are freelancers who are looking for \u201cshortcuts.\u201d I just don\u2019t get them. Now, you want to find someone to \u201chelp\u201d you pass the Upwork tests. The last time I checked, you don\u2019t have to be a rocket scientists to pass them in your field of expertise. Do you want to achieve the perfect score? What\u2019s the big deal? After some time, you can apply to pass these exams again. Unless, you have tried and failed. If you want to begin your Upwork journey with a lie, then I simply don\u2019t know what to say. You plan to impress your potential client with your test results. However, they aren\u2019t true. These tests give you an indication of what more you still have to learn. What skills you have to improve. So, try a test or two. Pass or fail. Wait. Learn. Try again. Eventually, you will reach the top results and you will use them proudly on your profile. Truth to be told, we don\u2019t have tests on goLance. Now, you may ask the same question - Why? To be totally honest about it, I think that these exams for freelancers have turned into an industry for themselves. On some freelance websites, you even have to pay in order to take them. These tests are useful, but the freelance platforms just got carried away with them. They are important, but they aren\u2019t the most important thing for freelancers. The emphasis on these exams obviously gives some freelancers the dishonest ideas such as this one.  ",
