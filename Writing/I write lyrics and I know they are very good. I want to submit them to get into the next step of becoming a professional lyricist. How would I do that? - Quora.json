            "answer_text": "Most every professional lyricist has developed high level connections within the music industry.  I am assuming that you are not a singer-songwriter but solely a lyricist (although I'm sure you play at least one instrument). If that is the case, you are a specialist that needs to be hired by musicians and/or music industry executives.  While I don't know that many professional musicians, those that I do know live in Nashville, New York city and Los Angeles.  I'm sure some other metropolitan areas in American (and throughout the world) have a sufficient enough music industry to support some professional lyricists.  But most likely you need to be geographically in the place where you can network so that you can present your lyrics to those who can make decisions about how to use your talent.   Could you do so living in a more rural part of America? Anything is possible. But my sense is that there is a lot of undiscovered talent in the heartland of the country because they are not in a place where they can be discovered. ",
