            "answer_text": "You are called \u201cmixed-handed\u201d or \u201ccross-dominant.\u201d You are not called ambidextrous. Ambidextrous means that you have essentially equal use of both hands. You do not. You have a dominant hand, but it changes across tasks. The best way to think about is that handedness isn\u2019t a trait of you. It\u2019s a trait of you + the task. For so-called \u201cright handers\u201d, these are closely correlated. If you write with your right hand, you probably do everything else with your right hand. For those who write with their left hand, it\u2019s not as well correlated. Something like 50% of left-handers throw a ball with their right hand (according to Handedness Statistics). I write with my left-hand but do virtually everything else (including other precision tasks, like using tweezers) with my right hand. ",

You can be fully ambidextrous, meaning you can use both hands equally for most tasks or ambidextrous either, where you prefer to use one hand for some tasks and the the other hand for others. You are describing \u201cambidextrous either\u201d. I am ambidextrous either as well where I am left-hand/left-eye dominant, eat/write with my left but naturally do a bunch of other tasks, like throwing a ball or playing sports, with my right hand. For some tasks I can readily switch hands with minimal effort. ",
