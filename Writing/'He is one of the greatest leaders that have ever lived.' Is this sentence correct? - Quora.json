We have such awkward English excerpts when text is correct but can seem arguably clumsy or cumbersome at the same time. In such circumstances, we may sense that there is something that does not seem right with the text - when that happens, the text fails even though its structure may be correct. If you agree, one way to remove the clumsiness in your sentence is to instead write, \u201cHe is one of the greatest leaders that has ever lived.\u201d ",
