            "answer_text": "Every autistic person is different, so there isn\u2019t one right way to write a realistic autistic character. However, my advice would be to steer clear of the following stereotypes, as they are vastly over-represented in media: obsession/special interest/talent involving math/numbers/physicshypersensitivity to noise and touch with no other sensory issues\u201cgenius\u201d who doesn\u2019t feel empathy/doesn\u2019t care about anyonestimming only when upset (happy stimming is a thing too!)has no interest in other people and always wants to be alonehas little emotion \u2014 flat affectdoesn\u2019t talk to anyonehas photographic memoryWhile some autistic people do have these traits, many of them are quite rare, and this is all books and movies tend to represent, so when you\u2019re writing an autistic character, try to have only one or two of these traits of any. Remember that some autistic people: have obsessions/special interests/talents relating to things like music, literature, fashion, movies, etcetera, not just math/science topicsare hypo(under)sensitive to noise or touch and seek out that kind of stimulationhave average or below average intelligence (autistic people aren\u2019t always either geniuses or intellectually disabled)experience average empathy, or even too much empathy (hyper-empathy)stim when they\u2019re happy (spinning, hand flapping, jumping, singing, etcetera)want to be around other people and have an interest in making friends (having trouble making friends doesn\u2019t always equal not wanting to make friends)struggle with math and science, and are better at other subjects, like art or englishexperience a lot of emotions, and just have trouble identifying or expressing themtalk too much (hyperverbal) and have trouble picking up on social cues that people want them to stop talkinghave an average or below average memory, or notice specific details that others don\u2019t and remember those things but miss main things that others noticed/rememberedAlso, please don\u2019t make autism their entire identity! Autism may be a part of who they are, but remember that they are a human being with personality traits and opinions, not just a walking case study. ",

            "answer_text": "By far the best way is to be, or to have been, a 15 year old autistic boy. Being, or having been, a 15 year old autistic person of any other gender is a close second. If you can\u2019t manage either of those, read works by teenage autistic boys, like The Reason I Jump or any of Tito Mukhopadhyay\u2019s or DJ Savarese\u2019s works. Learn from them what it was like to be 15, a boy, and autistic all at the same time. Then, go make friends with autistic teenagers. Learn what it\u2019s like to be them. Make friends with autistic adults and learn from their perspective on their own teen years. Take any depiction of an autistic teenager not written by an autistic person (who is or was a teenager) with a grain of salt. Non-autistic people typically get autistic experiences totally wrong, because they\u2019re interpreting autistic behavior according to what a non-autistic person would \u201cmean\u201d by it, rather than by what the autistic person may be trying to accomplish.
