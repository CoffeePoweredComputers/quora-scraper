            "answer_text": "Since you talked about getting serious about your goals and plans, I am taking the liberty to assume that you already know what your goals and plans are but are looking for strategies that you can successfully implement to achieve those goals and plans. What works for me is writing down my goals and plans every morning and visualizing what my life would look like when I have achieved them. It might come across as a cliched way of doing things, but believe me when I say that it works. I have observed that on the days when the first thing in the morning, I sit down and take time to reflect on what I want and how I want to go about it, I do all the things that are important to take me to my goals. And the days I don't, I am usually dilly-dallying with the stuff. It's amazing how focussed thoughts in the morning set the tone for the rest of the day. Try doing this: Gradually get into a habit of waking up early and waking up at the same time each day. (I really like the \"5AM club\" idea proposed by Robin Sharma. However, to each his own. I find 6:45 AM suits me much better).Buy a Journal you can jot down your thoughts in.After you are done with your early morning business, sit down at a quiet place and bring your thoughts together - What is it that you want to achieve, what is stopping you (weaknesses), what will help you get there (plans and strengths), how will you feel when you have actually achieved those goals, what are your major distractions and how do you plan to remove them.Make a To-Do with 3 most important things that will take you to your goals (You need to work on your goals every single day and you will be amazed at how the efforts of each day add up).Recapitulate it every day.This entire process would be longer on the first day you actually do it. Once you start doing it every day, it would take just 15-20 minutes day after day, which I think is a very short duration given how those minutes can turn your day around. P.S. As easy as it sounds, this is going to take effort. No one can jump into a change, you always slide into one. It took me almost a month to get my sleeping habits on track. Almost 2.5 months and I still can't say my dietary habits are perfect. But they are MUCH better than what they used to be like earlier, and that's what counts! Each day was a struggle. All you have to do is, stick to it day after day, no matter what your level of enthusiasm on that particular day is. ",

            "answer_text": "In order for you to get serious about your goals and plans in your life, the following conditions must be put in place: - your goals are compelling, inspiring and overarching enough, broken down into short-term, medium-term, and long-term perspectives, and covering all the major life dimensions in your life to drive you; - your plan has a vivid end in mind, with start-point, end-point and the developmental path of transition points in between, where all the predefined tasks that you need to accomplish daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and even annually at each transition point till the end-point are clearly spelt out for implementation and execution; - preferably, you also have some form of system, like a PERT Chart, to control, track, and monitor your forward trajectory as laid out in your plan; My rationale: By doing so, you naturally feel proud to have put in so much effort and time in the thinking and planning processes!
