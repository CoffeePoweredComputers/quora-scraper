            "answer_text": "This isn\u2019t something I\u2019d condone, but depending on the app that you use, usually it is impossible to do so. At best you can read the excerpts that the texts have and make assumptions on the entirety of the message. Another option would be to just delete the message after reading so that there will be no read indication since the message \u2018doesn\u2019t exist\u2019. Do at your own risk, because if you are caught, it\u2019s a severe breach of trust. ",

This need to prove themselves does not end even when they are adults as it spills into their domestic affairs. If you think you can understand why they are this way, well you will need to take a lot of classes. DIGITAL RESOLVES PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR AND CYBER FIRM In a situation that he is a game-nerd, you will need to sit him down and discuss how you feel neglected and unappreciated.
