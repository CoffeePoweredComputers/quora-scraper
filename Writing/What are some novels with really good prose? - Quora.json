Lyrical. Recommended: Bel CantoJames Meek. In a gradient of sparse to lyrical to eloquent. Example paragraph from \"We are now beginning our descent\":\"\u2018A country sends its travellers abroad like words spoken from one person to another,\u2019 said Kellas. 'Like me talking to you now. The country sees its travellers leave and I hear the words as they leave my mouth and enter you. But the country doesn\u2019t see what happens to its traveller when he arrives in that foreign place and I can\u2019t know how you take the words I speak.\u2019\"For me, beautiful prose is elegant, eloquent, lyrical or all three. It doesn't have to be rich and thick as Nabokov or Henri Miller wrote, although that's beautiful too. As with all subjective questions such as these, this is, naturally, a subjective answer.  ",

The Crossing, Child of God, Suttree, Blood Meridian are all great books that are beautifully written (In Child of God he even made a necrophilia drama beautiful). \u201cHe looked at a world of incredible loveliness. Old distaff Celt's blood in some back chamber of his brain moved him to discourse with the birches, with the oaks. A cool green fire kept breaking in the woods and he could hear the footsteps of the dead. Everything had fallen from him. He scarce could tell where his being ended or the world began nor did he care. He lay on his back in the gravel, the earth's core sucking his bones, a moment's giddy vertigo with this illusion of falling outward through blue and windy space, over the offside of the planet, hurtling through the high thin cirrus.\u201d\u2014Suttree ",
