It is better to highlight the text in the book. Begin writing the outline Use letters to denote the most important points in the chapter and elaborate on them. Use numbers and sub-letters for any supporting details. Convert the outline to the full text When writing the full text, make sure that all information is covered. Rewrite it if necessary. Not every part of a chapter will need to be included in the summary. The outline is a guide to the information included in the summary, but it can be deviated from. Read and proof the summary After writing the summary, read over it and compare to the original text to see if any information could be added. Check the document for spelling errors and other potential issues and save it. ",

            "answer_text": "Writing summaries is not as simple as many people perceive it to be. You\u2019ve been reading the whole chapter and now you have to write a short description that captures every important detail of the chapter. Compressing the chapter into 4 or 5 paragraphs takes expertise to so. The summary is not supposed to be detailed about every single aspect of the chapter but rather a conclusive overview of the most important aspects of the chapter. Typical items to consider include, what the chapter was about, the main topic being discussed in the chapter, the author\u2019s insights and the take-away lesson from the chapter which form the conclusion.
