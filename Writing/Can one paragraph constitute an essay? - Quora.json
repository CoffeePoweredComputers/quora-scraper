Each paragraph will normally begin with a topic sentence that outlines the main subject of that particular paragraph, then proceeds to develop it, before concluding with a link sentence. And that one will lead on to the subject of the next paragraph. By the time you have finished all these interlinking paragraphs, and reached your logical conclusion, the whole thing should be as fully connected as a string of beads. And the final paragraph, linking all the way back to the original introductory remarks, should fasten it all together like a well-strung and properly closed necklace. You could, if you really wanted to be difficult, dump all of these separate elements into one solid block of text, and invite your unfortunate reader to tackle it all in one go. But why would you want to be so unhelpful? I think paragraphing makes life a great deal easier, and your argument much clearer.  Just in case you really don\u2019t believe me yet, try reading your way through this: I would say No. A well-structured essay normally starts off with an introductory paragraph, proceeds to work its way through a series of subsequent paragraphs, all of them developing an idea in logical form and order, and finally ends with a concluding paragraph which sums up everything said and deduces something from it.

            "answer_text": "Technically it is possible to write an essay in one paragraph, albeit maybe a long one. Realistically the quality of the essay will likely suffer. As a college professor, it is unlikely that I would accept a one paragraph essay since the minimum word count that I accept, for virtually any essay, is 350\u2013700 words. Too many words for one paragraph. An essay consists of three parts. The opening or thesis which is a statement of what you are going to write about, then the body of the essay is the presentation of your facts or arguments which support your thesis, and then the conclusion which is a statement of what you wrote about. Better to use a minimum of three paragraphs. ",

The demands of unity forbid a proper paragraph from comprising the entire arc of an argument demanded by a proper essay. By the same token, a proper essay, which introduces a topic, discusses it, and forms a conclusion, has a broad scope which cannot be contained in a single paragraph without violating the demands of scope and unity which apply to the paragraph. I could write a one paragraph story (microfiction) but not a one paragraph essay. ",
