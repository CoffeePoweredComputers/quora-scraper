            "answer_text": "Clive Barker - Weaveworld Intense fantasy horror. Features Immacolata aka the Incantatrix aka The Witch, one of the Seerkind that live in Weaveworld (a magical land woven into a carpet).  While an embryo in her mother's uterus, Immacolata manifested her inherent evil for the first time, using the umbilical cords of her triplet sisters in order to strangle them. As a result, she was the only one of the triplets to be born alive. However, even though she murdered her sisters, the young Immacolata also bound them with a spell that forced both of them to constantly accompany her in the form of ghosts throughout her life and protect her. Indeed, the two sisters (the Hag and Magdalene) were forced to serve their sister as ectoplasms, although they were granted the promise that as soon as their assistance was no longer required in her ploys, she would instantly dismiss them to find death and eternal rest. Immacolata spent most of her childhood wandering around graveyards and having a morbid interest in death and pain. - wiki The scenes where the hero Cal is set upon by the Hag and Magdalene, and then later when set upon by their \u201cfruit\u201d are terrifying beyond comparison.  Once you\u2019ve devoured this go for Imajica and get haunted by the Nullianac. ",

            "answer_text": "In The Haunting of Hill House, by Shirley Jackson, Eleanor and Theodora are sharing a room and Eleanor wakes to a banging. Coming out of sleep, she thinks it is her mother banging her cane on the wall to ask for help, but then completely wakes up and remembers that her mother is dead and she is in the house, taking part in a study. Afraid, she takes Theo\u2019s hand across the way in the next single bed. A series, of frightening events take place and Eleanor takes solace in being able to hold Theo\u2019s hand. But she starts complaining that Theo is squeezing too hard. Then the supernatural activities stop and Theo sleepily asks what has been going on. Clearly, Theo has been asleep during the entire scene while Eleanor was awake, experiencing the entire event on her own. Eleanor asks (I think), \u201cWhose hand was I holding?\u201d As a teenager, I was terrified. The entire book was terrifying. Jackson was a master writer and leads you through the story, taking you exactly where she wants you to go. ",
