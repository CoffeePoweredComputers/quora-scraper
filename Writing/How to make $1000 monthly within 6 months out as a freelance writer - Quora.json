            "answer_text": "A few years ago I read an article about how freelance bookkeepers could earn $60/hr and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh my ass off. Being an Accounting major who worked with business owners daily (Commercial Loan Officer), I had an inside view of how much bookkeepers \u201cactually\u201d made\u2026 And after seeing this article (from a former CPA), I chalked it up to another scumbag that was just trying to sell some info product that didn\u2019t work. A couple months went by and I didn\u2019t think much of it, until the day I was unexpectedly let go from my job and had to figure out another source of income\u200a\u2014\u200aasap. After a few days of searching and looking for the best option to dig myself out of this hole, I remembered the article I\u2019d read a few months back\u2026 And even though I was still hesitant, I didn\u2019t have any other options, so I decided to take the leap and become a freelance bookkeeper. To my surprise, I was able to make a decent amount of money off bookkeeping right away ($35/hr)\u2026  But it took me a total of 3 weeks to realize that I couldn\u2019t do this much longer, as I absolutely HATED crunching numbers (funny to say for an accounting major). This led me to doing more research and that\u2019s when I came across an article that talked about a writer who was making $125/hr. Now this really made me LOL as it was crazy enough to hear that a \u201creal job\u201d like bookkeeping was able to make $60/hr, but a fake job like \u201cwriting\u201d? There\u2019s no chance in hell those hippies could make that much. At the same time, I was intrigued to learn more, mainly so I could uncover the lie\u2026 And well, 3 years later, as I write this article\u200a\u2014\u200aI can honestly say that I turned down 3 writing jobs this morning, all at a rate of $97/hr. Why in the hell would I do that? Short answer, because I can\u2019t handle anymore clients. Long answer, because over the years I\u2019ve learned a few small tweaks that help me stand out from the \u201cstarving writers\u201d, and instead, able to make a good living off writing. Trust me, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m a Hemingway either. Do I have skills that produce results? Absolutely, but so do a lot of other writers out there\u2026 And the only thing that differentiates me from them is the strategy I follow, which I\u2019m going to give you today\u2026 Starting with: Higher rates = better clients One of the hardest things for me to understand in the early days of freelance writing was how charging low rates is actually the dumbest thing you can do to get new clients. Not only does this cause burnout and do more harm than good, but it also tells clients that you don\u2019t value your work\u2026 Which means the good clients won\u2019t want to work with you, and since we have to find somebody who\u2019s willing to pay us for our work, that usually ends in you working with a bunch of shitty clients\u2026 Which always leads to burnout, stress, and future articles about how being a freelance writer is the dumbest thing you can do. Know what I mean? Good, now that you know, I need you to go back to the drawing board and start increasing your rates. That\u2019s not saying that you should start charging $125/hr so you attract the best clients, as you still have to be SOMEWHAT practical\u2026 But if you\u2019re reading this article, I bet there\u2019s some room for you to raise it. To give you some idea of where you should be, I started landing an endless stream of writing clients when I was charging $45/hr (and that was when I had like, 2 weeks of experience)\u2026 But experience isn\u2019t the only thing you should take into consideration, as you also need to look at your skill. Because clients pay for results, not proper grammar I always have to laugh when I look at other freelance writer\u2019s profiles as the main \u201cbenefit\u201d they talk about is how they know how to write grammatically correct articles. Something about how they have an English degree from some fancy university and have a command of the english language, which is great, but again\u200a\u2014\u200aclients don\u2019t pay for good grammar\u2026 They pay for good results. If I had to pick one thing, I\u2019d say this is the biggest disconnect between freelance writers and good clients as writers think clients want fancy language, when clients know they just want results. This is important for many reasons, but one of the easiest ways to overcome this issue is by simply picking a skill that they can actually measure. What do I mean? Think about it from the client\u2019s perspective. Very few clients are going to pay top dollar for a proofreader as they don\u2019t think they\u2019re getting that much value out of it\u2026 And at the same time, a lot of clients won\u2019t pay a lot of money for bloggers either. That\u2019s not saying they\u2019re not out there as I\u2019ve seen plenty of people make money by doing so and I\u2019ve personally made $45/hr as a blogger myself, but that\u2019s nothing like the rates people will pay for skills that directly make them more money\u2026 Such as: Landing page copywritersEmail funnel copywritersSales page copywritersAd copywritersAnd any other form of copywriter that essentially serves as a digital salesman on paper\u2026The takeaway: There\u2019s 2 important lessons that any writer can take from this, and that\u2019s: Think about how much value your skill bringsAre you a proofreader that simply ensures there\u2019s no typos in the client\u2019s blog? Don\u2019t expect to become a millionaire anytime soon. On the other hand, if you\u2019re a sales page copywriter that creates a digital salesman that keeps ringing up sales.. Then forget about hourly pricing and start looking at value, because it doesn\u2019t matter how long it takes you to do\u200a\u2014\u200ait matters how much value they\u2019re getting off your work. 2. Learn how to show what benefit you bring to the table The other side of this is always remembering that it\u2019s your job to show the client what you can do for them. I see this mistake way too often with any freelancer, where the think it\u2019s the client\u2019s fault for not seeing their worth\u2026 And even though that might be true, playing the blame game has never benefited anybody, so stop crying and start learning how to show your worth. But remember, some clients can only pay so much The last thing I really had to learn on my journey was that some clients simply can\u2019t pay your rate. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re the best copywriter in the world who knows how to show your benefits and create an irresistible offer, if your target market can\u2019t pay your rates\u200a\u2014\u200athen you might as well headbutt a brick wall (figuratively, please don\u2019t actually do that). How can you avoid this dilemma? Position yourself to attract a certain target market. One that not only needs your service, but can also pay your rate\u2026 And to give you an example of this, when I first started as a Copywriter, I positioned myself as a Copywriter for Tax Firms. I did this as I knew all established tax firms had enough money to pay my rates, but I also knew the number nerds (I can say that as I\u2019m one of them) hardly ever know how to market, so when I can produce results and get them lifetime clients\u2026 Then well, $97/hr is chump change compared to the amount of revenue they\u2019re making over the years, a win-win for both parties. Long story short\u2026 Writers don\u2019t have to starve. I don\u2019t care how many bad clients you\u2019ve had or what you want to say about \u201cluck\u201d, there\u2019s plenty of writers who\u2019ve been able to make a good living\u2026 And the only thing that separates them from you is a good strategy.
