            "answer_text": "Critique VS. Criticize I'd like to differentiate the terms \"critique\" and \"criticize\" using an example from Bee Dictionary.  \"Critique\u201d as a verb is not synonymous with \u201ccriticize\u201d; \"critique something\" means \"evaluate something thoroughly\", while \"criticize sth\" may suggest that somebody finds something lacking. e.g.   \u201cJosh critiqued my backhand\u201d means Josh evaluated your tennis technique but not necessarily that he found it lacking. \u201cJosh criticized my backhand\u201d means that he had a low opinion of it.  You're asking How do you critique someone's writing without offending them. So, let's assume that you thought someone's writing is not perfect and you have [small or vigorous] disagreement[s] upon it, at least. Otherwise, normally speaking, the writer cannot be offended by your critique.  So, you're actually questioning How do you disagree with someone's texts without offending them?  Disagreement VS. Bias It is almost a truism that disagreement produces offense and even conflict. Some studies suggest that perceptions of bias can drive this relationship.  It's not the disagreement but rather its resulting perception of people that determine whether or not they should counterattack. That decision can derive from their perception that they're treated not as reasonably expected, but unjustly and unacceptably. That is, the offender is viewed as biased. So a question that How do you disagree with the texts without bias? arises.   Solution: Cooperative behavior In some circumstances, people are naive realists; that is, they would believe that they see the world as it really is in \"objective reality\". Studies have shown that this belief always prompt people view those whose opinions differ from their own as incapable of considering the situation objectively, thus resulting in hopelessness of cooperative problem solving.  So, instead of stating that you're only correct and perceiving the author as incapable of objectivity, you would try noting that from your personal perspectives, the relevant issue should factor some other probabilities in and cooperating with the author to establish some sort of common ground on the particular controversial view.  So an important question involves How do you cooperate with the writer to reach consensus on controversial views?   Disagreement VS. Dissensus Anyway, you need not to compromise to avoid the potential offense for a \"nicey-nicey\" environment. What's more, we need to converse in order to learn. But rather than disagreement, dissensus is a more critical thinking-oriented path to the truth.  To differentiate the terms \"disagreement\" and \"dissensus\", an other example might be needed. Two groups supporting or attacking an opinion that if China is a threat may address their stand points in totally different ways.   ------------------------------Welcome proofreading help and language suggestions for all my answers.

            "answer_text": "I am a script reader and script editor. This means I get paid to assess writers' work (usually screenplays) and/or develop it with them. I find that giving feedback is in an artform in itself; I am honest, but positive: I will say what is working/what I like, followed by what I think needs more development. Generally this \"works\" but often it doesn't matter how I do it, but rather how writers process it, which is not always to do with me. Writers often have very thin skins about their work, so take feedback badly; others love feedback so much they tear their work up constantly and rewrite it from scratch over the slightest note. Writers who make effective use of feedback are very rare. In fact, I believe those that go on to become professionals are those that can do this. ",
