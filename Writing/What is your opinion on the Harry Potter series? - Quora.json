            "answer_text": "It\u2019s pretty good. Maybe not quite as amazing and thought-provoking as His Dark Materials, but still very deep, fun, and interesting. Note that I compared Rowling to Pullman rather than Riordan, because trying to compare this subpar excuse for a real author to them is like comparing \u201cPlan 9 From Outer Space\u201d to Star Wars and Star Trek. I was once a Percy Jackson fan. After reading \u201cNorthern Lights\u201d (aka \u201cThe Golden Compass\u201d) while I was awaiting the first Magnus Chase book, I found out that I could no longer read any of Riordan\u2019s work, as it was juvenile baby stuff compared to it, more on the level of \u201cDiary of a Wimpy Kid\u201d than anything else. It wasn\u2019t literature, just slapstick comedy with elements of fantasy and faux-drama thrown in. In contrast, I also re-read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows after reading \u201cThe Subtle Knife\u201d, and found it very good and of comparable quality. It\u2019s the Breitling to the Rolex of His Dark Materials, with Percy Jackson being a $2 Spider-Man Light-Up digital watch in comparison.  ",

And not because I\u2019m a fangirl.Great at letting children fall in love with the world of words.Teaches morals and holds great themes that make themselves clear only when reread. Which is why it should be read more than once.Read the books before you watch the movies, although both are great.Best read it starting at the ages of 8 or 9.Fantastic Beasts is for after you finish the books (and the corresponding movies) and not before.It\u2019ll let you believe that this is a magic number.HP is great, but stuff like Cursed Child must be touched (or not) with extra precaution.",
