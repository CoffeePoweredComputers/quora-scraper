            "answer_text": "The only thing that worked for me is to get something. An idea so simple, and straightforward: Stop trying so hard. Stop thinking you\u2019re the center of the universe and that you need to make something big of your life. Stop caring so much about a future that isn\u2019t promised, live in what the present gives you. Why do you need to care so much about a future that isn\u2019t there? Setting achievable goals in the situation you\u2019re now in, like getting a good grade. Or helping your mom clean dishes. Or cleaning your room, will bring excellent fulfillment. What I noticed, is when you stop worrying and trying so desperately hard\u2026 Things go way easier, you feel better and anxious thoughts rarely cross your mind. You are more satisfied with your current situation and you notice the little things. Of course I\u2019m not saying that you need to give up everything as soon as you have to do a little effort. What I am trying to say, is why worry so much about making it big in the future. Like being the CEO of Google. Would it really mean that much to you? Would it really bring you great joy and fulfillment? Just worry about the things in your life that are happening now. Make the best of what is happening now in your life. Accumulating your very best in the now, to the next now, the next now and the next now will automatically bring a future in where the best you is present. And ask yourself the question: do I truly need to try so hard as to make it big in a future that isn\u2019t there, or should I try very hard in a present that is right now? You\u2019ll see that if you try to live in the now, you won\u2019t have time to worry about the future. I\u2019d be glad to answer any question you might have. A.M.J Prevot ",
