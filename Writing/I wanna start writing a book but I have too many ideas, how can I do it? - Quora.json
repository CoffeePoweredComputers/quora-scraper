Jim Butcher even was unable to get published until one of his teachers forced his hand into becoming what he called a \u201cgenre writing drone\u201d. He loathed the idea at first\u2026then he got published. Ever hear of The Dresden Files? Yep. That was made by buckling down, doing what your teacher suggested and \u201cselling out\u201d. Writing for pleasure is and should be about you and what you want to explore. Writing for others, for profit.. that's not about you. If any authors say it is, ask for a list of the books they've published. If they've published any, check their sales. If they've sold a lot \u2026 ignore what I said and beg them to teach you because they're a prodigy that flies in the face of what it typically takes to write for a living. The only other advice I can give is that if you're not writing about the most interesting time in your main character's life you either have the wrong main character or the wrong time of life. ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing I would recommend is that you learn proper grammar. The next thing is to organize your ideas. Write them down. See which are related and can create a synergy that makes a story better. Some ideas will fit into other ideas. Remember, not all good ideas actually make a good book. Some just don\u2019t have enough stuff beyond the initial idea. A book needs a lot more than that. Sometimes, the idea is just a great line or scene, but you would have to build somewhere to put it. Kind of like a very large 9 by 15 foot large painting which may be very gorgeous, but you just don\u2019t have a wall big enough to hang it. You would have to design a whole new room. ",
