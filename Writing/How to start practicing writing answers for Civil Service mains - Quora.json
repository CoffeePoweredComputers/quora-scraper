            "answer_text": "Many of students do ask this question , but actually its simple if you have observed this since your school or college days Prior to answer any question or assignment these should be asked to yourself ( start your answer writing this way ) What is demanded of me? Does the question call for an outline or a detailed account? Am I expected to demonstrate my knowledge on a given issue or just present what I have read in the materials supplied to me? Am I expected to refer to any particular sources of information or experimental data? Am I expected merely to describe things as they are or must I analyze and explain them? Need I discuss implications and suggest application and/or give illustrations? Once you have answered the question or assignments, pause for a while and try to answer the following questions before final version of answer . i)Does the response answer the question or deal with the issue/topic taken up? ii)Does it cover all the relevant aspects and with sufficient details? iii)Is the content presented accurate and relevant? iv)Is the presentation logical and clear? v)Are the main points well supported by examples/arguments/illustrations etc.? vi)Does the presentation make a clear distinction between your own ideas and those of other? vii)Have the acknowledgements been furnished? viii)Is it of the right length? ix)Is the grammar, punctuation and spelling acceptable? x)Has the response been neatly typed or legibly written? now after doing all these go for someone expert on the topic and let him/her evaluate your answer . now get the comment from the expert ans ask these question to yourself where you have gone wrong what actually the demand of the question is how it should have been tackled from which perspective the response/question has been viewed by the tutor what the personality of the tutor is (who otherwise is \"faceless\" during the teaching-learning process) how an assignment of similar kind can be effectively tackled etc. What schools and colleges taught us we neglected during that time but eventually one day we realize the importance of those assignment , tutor marked tasks etc .
