            "answer_text": "I would have to say people love taking selfies because it is a way to see what you look like in that very moment. Also alot of times people think that selfies make them look better than they actually do in real life. Selfies can crop away all the drama and stress that is going on around them for a time even if it's just for a second while they are taking the photo. They can also capture a quick memory or make things look more exciting to the viewer. Last but not least people love taking selfies because it has become a cultural norm to indulge in this behavior especially for the younger generations due to all the different social media platforms and front facing cameras it is almost expected.
