            "answer_text": "Unlike most students who prefer to take the \u201cprofessional\u201d tone, I prefer taking the story approach when it comes to writing scholarship essays. I use what I call the 7-step framework. Step 1 - The first sentence is everything The first sentence is where you will get the most attention from the judge so your job is to grab it, maintain it and smoothly transition it to the next part. I always like to start my essays with a quote. Instead of\u2026 Ever since I was a kid, I have always wanted to do something important. I wanted to be the childhood figures I\u2019d seen in cartoons, like Pocahontas. Now let\u2019s add a quote. \u201cDon\u2019t go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.\u201d \u2013 Mark Twain Ever since I was a kid, I have always wanted to do something important. I wanted to be the childhood figures I\u2019d seen in cartoons, like Pocahontas. If you read the quote, it doesn\u2019t have any relation to your story. What does \u201cthe world owing you a living\u201d have to do with your childhood? It doesn\u2019t make sense but it works. Just don\u2019t go add some random quote about underwater basket weaving. Plus it makes you sound more intelligent. Win-win. Step 2 - Once upon a time\u2026 After grabbing the judge\u2019s attention with your super sexy quote, the next part is where you will start your story. The judge\u2019s attention span will still be at its highest here and your job is to keep it that way. You won\u2019t win scholarships if the judges are skimming through your essay. In the depths of the Great Barrier Reef, there was a clownfish who can\u2019t really swim. That was me. The main goal of this are 3 things: Make them curiousMake them ask \u201cWhat is this student going to do next?\u201dMake them understand where you are coming fromStep 3 - Every day, you\u2026 Now, let\u2019s build on that connection. What does your life look like? Every day, my dad Marlin would take me to school. However, I didn\u2019t like it. I wanted to prove to my dad that I could swim to school safely. We are building a connection with the judge. Imagine if you started off your story in this step. Your story will be like this\u2026 Every day, my mom would take me to church. However, I didn\u2019t like it. I wanted to prove to her that I could go to church safely myself. Instead of\u2026 \u201cDon\u2019t go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.\u201d \u2013 Mark Twain In the depths of the Great Barrier Reef, there was a clownfish who can\u2019t really swim. That was me. Every day, my dad Marlin would take me to school. However, I didn\u2019t like it. I wanted to prove to my dad that I could swim to school safely. Step 4 - Until one day\u2026 My dad was taking me to school every day UNTIL ONE DAY\u2026 Can you feel the suspense building? What is going to happen next? This is where your life encounters an obstacle. Judges are looking for a student who have overcome obstacles before NOT someone whose life is smooth sailing all the way. Step 5 - Because of that\u2026 From that day, your life changed. You are no longer the same person as you were before. This part is what I call the story development process where you will build on your story with \u201cBecause of that\u201d. I was trapped in this container. I had nowhere to go.2 hours later, I was dropped into a box. It had 4 glass walls surrounding it.I was terrified. I didn\u2019t know where I was. Because of that\u2026 Suddenly, 3 fishes appeared.1 of them had a bright yellow body. The other was an oval-shaped body just like a rugby ball. The third fish wasn\u2019t like a fish. He was shaped like a star. Step 6 - Until then\u2026 This is when your life started becoming better. You can see the light at the end of the tunnel. You\u2019re nearly at the finish line. After weeks of intensive planning, we came up with a plan.Our plan was to pretend we were dead.After that, our owner will grab us and flush us down the toilet.Our plan was based on the theory \u201cAll drains lead to the ocean.\u201dWe executed it and all of us got flushed down the toilet. Step 7 - Ever since then\u2026 This is when you end your story and let the judges know what you have learned from this experience and how it made you the right person to win this scholarship. And that\u2019s what ultimately led me to be a great swimmer and teach other fishes like me to be a more confident swimmer.From that day on, I was able to go on and win the Best Left-Handed Swimmer award, Most Adventurous Clownfish award and The Only 5.0 GPA Fish. I`ll leave you with a quote by Andrew Stanton, the writer of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Finding Dory and Wall-E. \u201cStory-telling is knowing everything you\u2019re saying, from the first sentence to the last that is leading to a singular goal.\u201d ",
