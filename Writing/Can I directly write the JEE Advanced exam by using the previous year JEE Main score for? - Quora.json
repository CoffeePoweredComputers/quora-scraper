            "answer_text": "NO ABSOLUTELY NOT \u274c\u274c.. You know how many students doesn't get 75% in board but gets above 96 percentile in jee mains.. Finally they give again all three exams i.e. boards, jee mains and adv.because they are not even eligible.. According to your question if this is possible then coaching industry will collapse \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 There are lots of examples I have seen in kota, and even our faculty members always says about this tragedy.. Remember one thing competition is very very huge in engeenering entrance exams.. And IIT-JEE is all about rejecting students.. Plzz be focused on small papers first then only thinks about jee advanced.. Even if u not score good in jee advanced it's absolutely okay but if u score less in boards then in future your are facing rejection in foreign universities and nobody knows what's life decided.. FREE ADVICE::: THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF STUDTENTS WHO WENT KOTA WITH A DREAM OF GETTING IN IIT DELHI AND AFTER 2 YEARS THEY EVEN NOT GET GOOD PRIVATE COLLEGES.. SO PLZZ FOCUS ONLY ON 12 AND JEE MAINS THEN ONLY THINKS ABOUT JEE ADVANCED..  AND YEAH I GOT 94% IN CBSE 2019 AND 13K RANK IN ADVANCED .. BUT DUE TO MY BOARDS PERCENTAGE I GOT NUS SINGAPORE.. ",
