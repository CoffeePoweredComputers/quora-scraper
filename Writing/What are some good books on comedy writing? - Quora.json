            "answer_text": "There is an abundance of books on comedy writing, simply do a Google search on comedy writing books and the most popular and most recommended will be listed for you. Personally, I think that a wide variety of reading material is key to teaching yourself how to write funny. Here I will focus on stand-up comedy because it really goes to the core of comedy writing. One simple way is to read books that are written by some of your favorite comedians, as suggested in this photo below\u2026  You can learn a lot about their writing style, meanwhile still exploring and working on finding your own voice. The first book I have read, which was given to me and is truly a bible when it comes to comedy writing is this one 1- STAND-UP COMEDY: THE BOOK by Judy Carter  It has been an eye-opening guide that really helped me when I started out in comedy. 2- COMIC INSIGHTS: THE ART OF STAND-UP COMEDY by Franklyn Ajaye  My personal favorite, I enjoy reading this one over and over again. It feels like hanging out with a good friend who knows a lot and picks at the brains of comedic geniuses, whom Franklyn personally interviewed for this book. Truly a must-read, indispensable for anybody who cares to learn about comedy. I would say you definitely need this one. 3 - DON\u2019T WEAR SHORTS ON STAGE by Rob Durham This one I bought for fun after hearing about it through a comedian\u2019s group on Facebook and figured it would be worth a read. I am suggesting it to provide an example of why you should take chances on reading anything that piques your curiosity, you might be delightfully surprised in what you find off the beaten path of household names and top best-selling books. Experiment! This is a personal account of a working road comic who earns a living doing comedy, sharing what he has learned over the years.  Lastly, I will post here as a bonus, since we live in the digital age where Google is your best friend, I typed \u201cstand up comedy guide\u201d in the search bar and came up with these results you should feel free to check out, after all, more information can only bring you more knowledge on comedy writing which isn\u2019t a bad thing.  Hope this help answering your question! Have fun, good luck and happy reading. ",

            "answer_text": "I have been through this one:Writing Movies for Fun and Profit: How We Made a Billion Dollars at the Box Office and You Can, Too!: Thomas Lennon, Robert Ben Garant: 9781439186763: Amazon.com: Books but I do have to say your best bet is reading the works of comedy writing. You will get your ideas on how to tell a funny story in book from that. What makes you laugh about what you read? What direction did you think the story would go in and did it take a turn that was funnier than you thought? Also, I have to give credit to one of the masters. He is funny but sometimes in a twisted way.Winters' Tales: Stories and Observations for the Unusual: Jonathan Winters: 9780916562670: Amazon.com: Books This is just one of his and I would encourage you to look up his other as well as other books by comedians. Here are some to include:Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined: Drew Carey: 9780786863518: Amazon.com: Books Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man: Tim Allen: 9780786861347: Amazon.com: Books Attempting Normal: Marc Maron: 9780812982787: Amazon.com: Books Try those out.
