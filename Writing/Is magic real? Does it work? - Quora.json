            "answer_text": "\u201cIs magic real? Does it work?\u201d Well, let\u2019s examine that idea, why don\u2019t we? It\u2019s simple really. Do you have ANY direct, verifiable evidence, proof positive, that \u201cmagic\u201d is real, or that any \u201cspells\u201d actually work? You don\u2019t. No one does. And no one ever has. In fact, every time someone does try to prove that \u201cmagic\u201d is real, he/she fails, utterly and completely. James Randi had a standing offer, for decades, that he would give $1 million to anyone who prove to have any paranormal abilities, magic included. No one ever claimed that prize. Every person making the attempt failed. What does that tell you? A million bucks up for grabs, and NO ONE could get it. And if magic did work, all anyone would have to do is stroll onto any university in the world, and present himself to anyone in the Physics Department, and proceed to shake the entire world of science to its very foundations. But this has never happened. Or, such a person could walk into the Pentagon (or any other country\u2019s equivalent) and proceed to demonstrate his \u201cpower\u201d, drastically altering that country\u2019s military budget, to say the least, and its standing on the world stage. But this has never happened. Such a person could approach the Board of Directors or CEO of any major corporation, and completely alter the way they do business, the way they deal with (and completely dominate) their competitors. Such a company would become, within a very short time frame, the dominant force in their chosen industry, and branching out into other industries would be child\u2019s play; they could easily dominate every market, effortlessly. But this, too, has never happened. So we are left with a huge, gaping void, which should not exist, which COULD not exist, if \u201cmagic\u201d were real. Inescapably, we are drawn to the only logical conclusion, the only one that makes sense, and fits the available evidence: Magic doesn\u2019t exist. ",
