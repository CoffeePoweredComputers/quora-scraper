First understand that some recruiters may be suspicious of the applicant who has freelance work on their resume but can\u2019t adequately describe the scope of the work or what was achieved. In the past some people with gaps in their employment have filled in that time with claims that they did \u2018freelance\u2019 work as a way to fill those gaps. Work is work. If you were gainfully self-employed, an employer won\u2019t have a problem with that as long as you can describe what you were asked to do, for whom, the time frame and result, just as you would for any other employment that you may have had. Be ready to explain the projects you worked on with a recruiter. While you don\u2019t necessarily need to name the company (if client confidentiality is involved) you do need to give a pretty comprehensive explanation of what you accomplished. Having written recommendations or letters of appreciation will go a long way as well. Your question asks about whether you needed to add freelance experience to your resume. I am assuming that you mean that you actually did perform work as a freelancer and wondered how to add it to your resume. In that case you would use Freelance Editor for example and include dates. A brief general explanation would come next. For example- \u201cGathered information from multiple sources writing/editing to produce various documents including manuals, newsletters, published articles and grant proposals etc\u201d. Then you would use bullet points to describe specific projects, work involved and result. Freelance work should be treated as any other employment in a CV or Resume but not as fill for employment gaps. ",

            "answer_text": "In general, It is a good rule of thumb to only include experience that is relevant to the field/industry that you are applying for or has transferable skills that can be easily applied to the job posting. For instance, for someone in graphic design, chances are you have been able to work with several companies as a freelancer. By all means, list this under a Freelance section and highlight your top accomplishments. This shows your diversity in the field and your knowledge to complete different projects in a timely manner. Another example would be someone who is a Web Designer who has completed a few freelance projects in web design for different clients. Once again, this would be completely acceptable to add on your resume as it is relevant to what you want to do. Now, let's say you are applying for a Director of Sales role and you recently started dabbling in freelance photography. I would most likely recommend leaving this off your resume as it doesn\u2019t add a lot of concrete experience for what you want to do. However, you can definitely add this area of freelance to your LinkedIn Profile as you have more room to work with and LinkedIn is a little more personable than a resume. When deciding to add Freelance work to your resume use your best judgment. Ask yourself, does this project add value to my resume? Is it relevant to what I am applying for? Are my skills transferable? If you answer yes to these questions then, by all means, add the project to your resume. I hope this is helpful, happy job hunting! ",
