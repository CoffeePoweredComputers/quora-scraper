            "answer_text": "(NOTE: Written in jest. PURE FUN, Nothing Else; Just being sarcy) \u201cDear \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 I never knew wishes could come true this spontaneously in life; looks like both of us wanted this very badly. Now I suppose you cannot crib that God does not answer your prayers. See how quickly He responded to you? Happy to inform you that I am going\u2026\u2026\u2026 going a very long way\u2026\u2026\u2026.somewhere where you cannot find me (hopefully)\u2026\u2026..not that you will try anyway; I still remember the day when I hid in the closet for almost 2 hours trying to surprise you and you had not even bothered to search\u2026.You were watching Mr Bean on tv and couldn't be disturbed\u2026\u2026..I admired this survival instinct in you - no wonder you are the survivor\u2026.. That you find Mr Bean sexier than I has been a powerful motivating aspect of this final journey of mine\u2026\u2026. Just to remind you of all the poignant memories that we shared in this painfully long but funnily ironic relationship of ours that both of us thought is love(!!!)\u2026.. Remember the times when you said that I should be bold enough to chalk out my path in life? Well, I am doing it now - I am a lot bolder now since I know that I am going\u2026..and that in this journey I cannot fail - see? I have finally done that one thing where I have not failed. Remember how you thought I was sweet enough to book tickets for all your favorite movies even if I did not like them? Well, since I am going, I might as well tell you - when did we pay attention to the movie? Your taste in movies sucks!!! You are so very analytical that you cannot tell the difference between the hero and the villain\u2026. A word of sincere advice before I go - please and again please dont do the following while on dates with any other boyfriend - I have been victimized enough for an entire lifetime - Discuss Aadhaar cards of your Dad and MomExplain why beer is bad for the kidneys (what were you suggesting then?)Discuss the benefits of being bi-sexual (please no - not this one)Argue with them on why organic food is better for our health - for heaven\u2019s sake - ALL FOOD IS ORGANIC. There is NO INORGANIC SHIT!!!!!!Argue that boys with six-packs are interested only in fitness and not in girls - why the hell would we want six-packs if there were no girls?For any red-blooded boyfriend, a date with a girlfriend has only ONE LOGICAL conclusion - you get it? You GET IT? ONLY ONE LOGICAL CONCLUSION!!!! Ever heard of \u201cwarming up\u201d on a date and then taking matters further\u2026\u2026\u2026.? No? Poor YOU!!!! I dont expect you to get your eyes moist over this letter - even if you did, your new boyfriend (your Plan Beta) is always there to wipe them for you\u2026.(surprise!!! I know) If I know you right, they could very well be tears of joy\u2026 For God\u2019s sake dont ever visit my grave after I am gone - I hate bouquets\u2026.. of course that may not be real reason why you would visit the cemetery - you once told me it is a cool thing to make out in places like that - and I am sure your new boyfriend would only be too willing\u2026\u2026. Poor sucker - I am sure even he will write a letter to you one day\u2026. If this letter has raked up all your anger and at the same time given you a sense of relief - well, I think I have done my job - one LAST act of love!!! Good bye for ever\u2026.. PS: I have emailed this to the other fourteen clueless girlfriends of mine. Ha Haa\u2026 the joke\u2019s on you!!! (Laughing heartily while dying\u2026) ",

Write her a mail in a nice paper, use a nice pen if you have one, in your own handwriting. There\u2019d be a chance she\u2019ll keep it through her life, so make sure it\u2019d last long. Write a timeless piece of writing. The one where she open it again in the future and it\u2019s still beautiful and relevant. Write your memory of her throughout your life. Then the moments you spend together. Tell her how beautiful she is and how she completes you. Tell her how much she means to you, how much you love her, how she made your life full of wonder. Then the hardest one, tell her goodbye. Tell her even in your death you\u2019ll miss her, you\u2019ll look down to her and want her to live a happy life. Tell her to keep chasing her or both of your dream. Make it sounds like she\u2019s not losing her life, so after a period of time she\u2019ll move on. She has to. And perhaps you\u2019d wanna give her a gift. Something that really mean much to both of you. No need to be fancy, but you might want it to last long as well. ",
