It's the trustworthy standard. You might feel overwhelmed by it as a new poet but later as you grow will be glad you have it on hand. I also suggest you mosie on over to The World's Largest Poetry Site They LOVE new poets over there! And while you are at it, buy my book. It will warm you up to poetry.
