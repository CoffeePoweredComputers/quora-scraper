            "answer_text": "I am no expert in psychology but I did live with my narcissistic ex for over a decade so I can only go on my experience. My ex would have an argument about everything and anything because he enjoyed causing unnecessary stress\u2026..He would have rowed with his shadow if he could!! (Only not in front of anyone, that'd ruin his image!!). Looking back I trod on eggshells when any decision had to be made because he'd disagree with me about most things\u2026\u2026.just for the sake of it. I always felt confused after his rages about innocuous problems and was in a state of mental exhaustion trying to reason with his argumentative outbursts and defend myself (not physically mercifully). I believe it is known as \u2018crazy making\u2019, it puts his/her relationship in a permanent state of anxiety which they seem to thrive on (I always had a perplexed expression on my face, cortisol ran through my veins instead of blood and I always looked frazzled. He, on the other hand, didn't!). I believe it may also be a temporary fix for their boredom plus mine thought he was an expert on everything so he'd argue to make me feel stupid (when really id give up the row just so he'd shutup!!). If your narcissist provokes you before an event or a visit with friends/their family, it's to make you look like a crazy person when you arrive. I think mine did this so I would look angry and stressed in front of \u2018witnesses\u2019 when we turned up. He, of course, was relaxed and jovial on arrival because he'd got \u2018whatever it was\u2019 out of his system. He could then blame my behaviour for the demise of our relationship when he cheated on me with a girl in her teens six months ago (he's 57), he thought people would sympathise with him because he lived with a \u2018stress head', little do they know eh!? Hope that makes sense, im fairly new to quora and I'm not so great with the words! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking. In my experience they create arguments for the following reasons: Fuel - They thrive on attention whether it\u2019s positive or negative. So they are \u201cfueled up\u201d or energised by the negative fuel they get from arguments.They\u2019re bored - I\u2019m not exactly sure about this one but i felt when our relationship became a bit mundane (normal, without incident) she\u2019d poke a fight just to disrupt the balance. I think this creates a level of excitement for them and makes the \u201crelationship\u201d more interesting.To break the intimacy - Sometimes I actually felt her getting close, almost as though she was bonding with me. All of a sudden she\u2019d create an argument from nowhere about nothing.They need an excuse to take a break - And old supply is in town and wants to meet up. They need an all-clear so they poke a fight to keep you at bay for a while. If it doesn\u2019t go as planned they\u2019ll return like nothing happened. If it does work out you don\u2019t hear from them for quite a while.That was my experience. Best wishes Richard! ",
