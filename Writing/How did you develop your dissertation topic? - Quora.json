            "answer_text": "Interest is the most determinant factor in the subject matter. Just as it would be hard and challenging to dance to the music you dislike the same with dissertation writing. Without an interest in the subject matter, your zeal and thirst to research are dented. Remember the core role of the supervisor is to provide advice and guidance on how to prepare, produce and improve a dissertation. The dissertation writing process can take weeks or months and trust me passion will be an inspiration to your work Evaluate the emerging trends, with these trends there are more research gaps to fill into and advance the area of study. Getting a unique area to research can be difficult for most subjects but you can take an area whose research has been done and approach it in a different angle. Else you can take a small topic in your area of interest that has not yet been saturated with research and advance with new ideas. Be precise with your idea, broad ideas prove to be challenging to cover with limited word counts. With a specific idea, it's much easier to draw conclusions than with broad topics. Students fall into the trap of formulating a difficult topic for dissertation just for it to prove a challenge after acceptance. Have an overview of the work t be done before submitting your dissertation topic. Evaluate yourself and the time schedule you would need to achieve your goals. Some times, one has to rely on online dissertation writers such as Best Dissertation Writing & Review Services to help in writing a dissertation. Though this raises some ethical questions on academic integrity but its a good source of help in time of trouble. In most cases, it's not laziness that makes one acquire these services but time limitation and responsibilities. Remember to choose a specific topic (Avoid too broad topics), align your topic of choice to your passion. ",
