            "answer_text": "Install the PySerial library and import it to a sketch. With serial.Serial(#parameters) you create a handler for the COM port you want to read/write and the characteristics of the communication i.e. baud rate, parity bits etc. Then you could write something like data = serial.readline() and read bytes in the buffer until you meet a null terminator. You can either use data = serial.data(128) #read 128 bytes. Check the library on Google, is very well documented. ",

            "answer_text": "Reading data from a serial port is a standard procedure, it doesn\u2019t depend on a programming language. To use a serial port, a user application must open it first and obtain a handle. Then, by using this handle, the application can invoke driver functions that send and receive data. If the serial port is not needed anymore, it must be closed. ",
