            "answer_text": "Technically if your book is a best-seller for the publisher or imprint you\u2019re published under, you can call yourself a best seller even if it\u2019s a small press and you\u2019ve only sold a thousand copies in six months. But, here\u2019s the thing: you\u2019re deceiving the reader. Most readers believe that if you\u2019re a best seller, you\u2019ve hit the NY Times, USA Today, Amazon overall or a major category (not a sub sub sub of a sub category) or some other major list. If you\u2019re being completely honest, you\u2019ll tell the audience what list you hit (Amazon best seller in 2016, Top Ten Thriller on B&N, #1 in Fantasy on Amazon for one week, or whatever.) If you hit #1 in a major category on Amazon, btw, you\u2019ll know. You\u2019ll have several hundred sales in one day, if not a thousand or more, and you\u2019ll likely have similar sales for several days after due to the exposure of being in the top twenty. (It\u2019s awesome to be on that coveted \u2018first page\u2019 when someone makes a search.) You can also be a best-selling author on Amazon. You can find out what your rank is through Author Central. I believe it\u2019s harder to be a best selling author than it is to have one book be a best seller, because your non-performers pull you down, but I\u2019m not sure about that. I\u2019ve hit #2 in LGBT fantasy before, and was in the low hundreds for all Amazon books with one of my books, but I\u2019ve never made it into 4 digits as an Amazon author. I think it\u2019s legitimate to consider yourself a best selling author on Amazon if you\u2019re in the top 100 (or maybe even the top 500), but that\u2019s really, really hard to hit, harder than hitting the list with a single book. You won\u2019t have to worry about whether or not you are, because at that point you\u2019ll know because you\u2019ve had massive sales. You can make any claim you want, really, and legitimize it by creating your own small press and making yourself your own best seller. But what that really does is make the term best-seller have less and less meaning. It\u2019s already losing meaning, since there\u2019s no oversight, and the term is being abused by some authors. If you decide to use it as a selling point, be aware that a reviewer may call you on it, and that although you may get a few more looks inside than you otherwise might, if your book isn\u2019t best seller quality you\u2019ll lose the trust of your readers. Since reader trust is so critical for making or breaking a book, I personally wouldn\u2019t risk it. Why is reader trust so important? If you\u2019re writing non-fiction, if you\u2019ve deceived them about being a best-seller there\u2019s no reason for them to trust your contents. And if you\u2019re writing fiction, they\u2019ll know you\u2019re insecure about your writing and will hold back their emotional investment in your story, which makes it more likely that the story won\u2019t work for them. In the end it\u2019s up to you. I suggest you wait before you make that claim. When you hit best-selling status, you won\u2019t have to ask. You\u2019ll know. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe to attain New York Times best seller rank, one has to sell 5,000 copies in a year. On Amazon, with ebooks, it's a little different, and I'm only guessing, but it's probably attainable by selling about 100 copies a month, but the rank will go up and down from day to day. Now, I know why you're asking; every self published author has started claiming best seller status. They're a bunch of filthy liars who are simply putting the words best seller on their cover to trick readers into buying their books. On Amazon, you can check a book's ranking, and I always find these books ranked around 400,000. That means about 2 or 3 sales a month, maybe 4, to hover around that rank. Is it possible the book sold more copies at a previous point and hit Amazon best seller? Maybe, but why would that wind up on the cover of the book? I'm self published, and I am trying my hardest to become someone in the writing community, and when these liars, who aren't even capable of stringing together 5 cogent sentences, lie to their audience, it ruins the name of self published for all of us. Furthermore, many of these people trade 5 star reviews with other self published authors in exchange for a 5 star review, and then they have this atrocious, unedited piece of drek with 400 5 star reviews, and let's be honest, review do sell books, but the readers are tricked by the fake reviews, and when they buy the book, and learn it's garbage, they get angry and write a scathing 1 star review. You can check \u201cbest selling\u201d author, Gary Lindberg. Go to Amazon, find his books, click \u201clook inside\u201d, and you'll see what I mean. Plus, you can check the rank of his book, and finally, you can read the 1 star reviews left by remorseful readers, and compare them to the fake 5 star reviews. ",
