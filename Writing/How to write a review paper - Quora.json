So as per my knowledge,though am not so experienced one , still struggling with paper writing. But I have read many review article ,how beautifully they captured from one corner of the topic to current status of that research. First of all decide what you want to show from your article like, you want to discuss the particular topic or you want to show its growth from particular range of year, etc Then do proper literature survey . And then conclude what you had observed . Thats it , I know its not sufficent better consult any reviwer . All the best Happy Writting :) ",
