            "answer_text": "The Government of India and syllabi of all the Universities follow the Grammar of British English . According to the British English language the surname or last name must be written in Capital letter . So , the first letter of your last name must be capital . Not only the the surname but also the first and middle names are scribbled in capital letters . In this context , the American English is something different because it doesn't emulate the use of capital letter laid down by the British Grammarians. In the American English you can write small letter whether it is first , middle or last names. Historically , there is no tradition of the usage of Small Letters in the English language . Goold Brown has mentioned in his popular book ' The Grammar of English Grammars ' that the use of small letters began after the seventh century AD in England . Hence , it is a novel approach in English . ",

            "answer_text": "As per English language and grammar, both the last name (surname) and name should start with a capital letter. For example, if the name is Rakesh and the last name is Sharma, then write the full name as: Rakesh Sharma. If there is a middle name, then that should also have its initial letter in capital as in Rakesh Rajini Sharma. The reason for the above is that a name (full or part thereof; middle name, if any, included) is a Proper Noun as it refers to a particular person which is yourself here. Proper means one\u2019s own. Hence a Proper Name is a person\u2019s own name. The rule of English grammar dictates that Proper Nouns are always written with a capital letter at the beginning. ",
