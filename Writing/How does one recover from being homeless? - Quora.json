            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t answer the question for all homeless people, but as a board member of a non-profit that helps adults with mental health illness recover their lives and dignity, I know many wonderful people who I am happy to call friends and are now employed who have recovered from homelessness. The \u2018easiest way\u2019, which is still incredibly difficult is having family support to help you get the programs and/or pharmaceuticals you need. This is far from easy for many loving and caring family members to do (at least in California), given the laws around conservatorship. If the homeless person doesn\u2019t want the help it\u2019s really hard for the family (no matter how caring) to go to court to get control over their affairs to help them deal with any issues they have to get them off the streets. If the homeless person is willing to get help and fortunate to still have a great relationship with family, they can move home, or their family can provide interim rent, and help them get public assistance from government housing agencies. I\u2019ve also known folks (without family support) who have gone from homeless to gainfully employed and no longer on the streets. I so applaud them for the effort it must have taken for them to accomplish that, but it did depend on government programs to help. In my mind this answer only applies to those with mental illness, but I suspect most alcoholics and drug abusers would fall into that category. If you want to know of one non-profit international organization that has helped many people, please looks up Clubhouse International. It received the Hilton Humanitarian Award in 2014.

            "answer_text": "This can only happen when they change their ways, most people become homeless because of things they did wrong, some were drug addicts, or alcoholics, some with poor spending habits, and others with making poor living choices like being too loud, or too messy, but no matter what it was it usually was because of poor choices, with exception of some that just had some real bad luck in life and lost their jobs and couldn't find another quick enough to keep their place, and it is sad for those ones too but if you think about it it was a choice because if they had paid their bills and rent as they were before unemployed and put every extra dollar they had in the bank they would have a pretty boring life, but a nest egg for if they were to lose their job and could pay rent until they found more work so it's really down to poor choices, and if they learn from those lessons then it won't happen again and I know it's hard but sooner or later you see it really is only tough for the first couple of years until they have a few thousand dollars then after that they can go back to a normal enjoyable life, and that's how homeless can be stopped.
