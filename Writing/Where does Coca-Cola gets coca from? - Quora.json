            "answer_text": "The original mixture of Coca-Cola was devised by a pharmacist in Atlanta, Georgia back in 1886. He was including cocaine in that original concoction. It was very popular back then even with the ladies. Unfortunately in 1903 the federal government past a law making cocaine, morphine and other popular medications in the opiate family illegal except for prescription use. So our pharmacist substituted caffeine for the cocaine, without changing the name. Currently an 8 oz can of coke has about 30 mg of caffeine. I have had an 18 year old who was closing the local Burger King and drinking coke by the glassful. He came in with his heart in atrial fibrillation from the excess caffeine. ",
