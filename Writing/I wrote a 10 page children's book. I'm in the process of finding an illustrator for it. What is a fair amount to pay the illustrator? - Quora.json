            "answer_text": "Illustrators are often chosen by the publisher (even if you have used someone else) and the illustrator receives 50% of the royalties and the author 50%. This is very fair because pictures sell books to children. They appreciate the words later. I once agreed to illustrate a children\u2019s book for a flat fee for someone who self published his work and had licensed my art before for covers of his books. 12 Illustrations for $8,000. paid in advance. Sadly, he died just before he went to press and his children didn\u2019t want to spend their inheritance on publishing another of their dads books. I was paid up front because people have a tendency not to pay the artist if the publisher chooses another artist. ",

            "answer_text": "Unless you are self publishing, don't bother trying to find an illustrator. Concentrate on finding a publisher. When you find one, they will have firm ideas on who should illustrate it. Illustration is a global market and it's very unusual to be offered royalties any more unless it's a very short print run. The publisher won't be expecting to pay you anything from that agreement. Publishers offer flat buy-outs nearly all the time these days because royalties are costly for them to administer and they don't need to offer them. The fees vary, but $100 per page isn't unusual for school books. Picture books are sometimes a bit more, and a lot more if you're a famous illustrator. Illustrators don't, as a rule, drive Ferraris.
