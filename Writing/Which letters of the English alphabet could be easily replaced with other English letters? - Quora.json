As the description to the book in the second example, below, says, \"Grammatical 'rules' or 'laws' are not like the law of gravity, or even  laws against murder and theft--they're more like rules of etiquette,  made by fallible people and subject to change.\" And I would add, let's not \"mess with success.\" If spelling reform were actually to be instituted, think of all those millions of published works that could no longer be read in the original, without translation or transliteration. We would be solving one problem by creating another, even larger one. Besides, spelling-checkers are everywhere these days. First example: Here's the title page of an 1879 bulletin by the US Spelling Reform Asoshiation, written mostly using their touted reformed spellings.  THE  PRESENT  STATE  OF THE  SPELING            REFORM IN AMERICA.BY PROFESOR FRANCIS A.  MARCH. LL D.,President of the Speling Reform Asociation.RED BEFORE THE SPELING REFORM DEPART-MENT OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASO-CIASHON AT ITS ANUAL MEETING IN PHIL-ADELPHIA, JULY 29, 1879.     The movement for the reform of Englishspeling is a product of the spirit of the age,a tru birth of time, as Bacon likes to cal hisfilosofy. The great curents of thought andaction set towards reform. We ar for re-forming everything that can help us in thediscovery of truth and the improvement ofman's estate.     Givn a spoken language, the easy com-unication of it by riting and printing isa problem in labor-saving mashinery. Butther is so much that is complex and super-fluus in our present speling that hundredsof milions of dolars ar wasted by it in ourprinting ofices every year.     Our teachers see that two or three years ofthe scool-life of every child ar worse thanwasted in trying to lern to spel.     Our statesmen see that we hav 6,500,000iliterates in the United States and that oneof the most powerful causes of iliteracy isthe badnes of our speling.     Our scolars find ther studis of language<more> Second example, from The Lexicographer's Dilemma: The Evolution of 'Proper' English by Jack Lynch:       \"One minimally intrusive possibility is to remove the more obvious irregularities without reforming the alphabet itself. We might abandon of, for instance, for uv, and replace neighbor with nabor. We could get rid of the apparently randomly doubled letters\u2014change spell to spel\u2014and replace two-letter combinations with one letter when a single letter will do, as in alfabet. And while some silent e's serve a purpose, distinguishing can from cane and bit from bite, others do nothing at all\u2014bizarre, cigarette, giraffe, and have could just as easily be bizar, cigaret, giraf, hav. Other silent letters could also go, giving us spellings like dam, anser, and onest.     \"This would probably be the easiest kind of spelling reform to put into effect, because the newly spelled words are immediately recognizable by those even without special training\u2014it's as close to intuitive as spelling reform can be.     \"This solution is, however, far from perfect. It still represents some single sounds, for instance, as combinations of letters, when one letter for each sound would make more sense. The letters th usually make the single sound of the th in thin or that, but sometimes th actually sounds like a t followed by an h, as in hothouse, shorthand, and sweetheart; likewise, the two-letter combination sh usually represents the single sound of shop and fish, but sometimes, as in Crosshatch, grasshopper, and hogshead, it's two separate sounds, s and h. Without some extra symbols in the alphabet, we can't show the full range of sounds in a one-symbol-for-one-sound relationship.\" Rather than go on with examples, I think we can agree that although it's a worthwhile idea in principle, in practice English spelling reform would be a major disaster without a corresponding major gain.  Note: Belatedly, I see that I did not address the OP's question in regard to computational linguistics. I apologize. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking! One obvious place to look is this meme that occasionally goes around about simplifying / regularising English spelling. (Here is one example: Linguistic humor)  x to ks is a good idea.c can often be dispensed with since it often sounds like either s or k, so one could simply write those letters (e.g. sirkus for circus), but it\u2019s less clear what to do about ch (if we were simply regularising English, plain c could stand for the ch sound but if we want to reduce the number of letters, that won\u2019t work). Perhaps tsh could serve for this.You could probably get fairly far by replacing y by i; even in its function as a consonant, it should work acceptably.If you want to get rid of w, I probably wouldn\u2019t reach for vv but instead for u. (Though if you want to go for visual similarity, then replacing w by vv would inspire replacing m by rn, which often looks confusingly similar anyway!)q is nearly always followed by u; you could replace qu by kw (as some Cornish spellings do, for example)\u2014then with a further replacement of w by u you would get ku.I would also suggest replacing z by s; the functional load of this distinction is moderately low, and Gregg Shorthand (for example) usually does not distinguish between the two, and in German, the same letter s can be used for both sounds as well. Also, z is the least frequent letter in English, so is less likely to be missed.So if you implement those suggestions, you would be left with the following 20-letter alphabet: a b d e f g h i j k l m n o p r s t u v And here are some example texts written in the reduced orthography:  The kuik broun foks jumps over the lasi dog.

(I see that Steven de Guzman came up with a very similar proposal, though with ph for f\u2014as in Vietnamese\u2014rather than s for z as in Gregg Shorthand, and additionally proposing that j be replaced.)
