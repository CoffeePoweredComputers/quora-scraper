            "answer_text": "It's the one of the most trivial yet purely honest question that I would love to answer. Be truthful: If you're truthful and honest no matter who reads your letter. He/she will always understand your concern. If they don't, you'll always be strong and upright in your own eyes, which really matters a lot. P.s- I myself had quite an experience to write such letters. Though, I never had those absence of mine intentionally. ",
