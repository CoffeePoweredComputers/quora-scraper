            "answer_text": "It depends what you are writing. Dramatic writing can work for nearly every single genre of fiction. There are a few things that you could try if you want to tone it down or write pure humour. The first is the possibility that you need to get it out of your system. This might seem odd but sometimes I find that if I am stuck with a certain style then I just go with it for something appropriate. After I have finished that or got a fair distance in a usually find that I want to move to something a bit different or try something new. This makes it easier to make a conscious break away from a particular style. The other big one I can think of is to write the humour and silly pieces trying not to be dramatic. It\u2019ll be hard work but each time you feel you are being dramatic steer away from the tension. This could be easier if you write flash fiction or short stories to start out which will give you a chance to really focus on the side of the humour and not give you the space to add too much drama in. There is a third way though. In the novel I am writing (I generally write novellas) I use a lot of sarcasm and dark humour. Elements of gallows humour crop up as well. It could work really well to use humour to diffuse tension in the drama. Almost as a punchline resolution. This way you get to do both. if I were in your position I would go with the third option here. It means that i can write something i am comfortable with as well as incorporating new elements. I would suggest you also check out the writing excuses podcast. (Writing Excuses). They have been going through different styles and genres in their more recent shows. The shows are relatively short so easy to fit in if you are strapped with time. One of the authors who hosts the podcast writes comedy and the others have a wide variety of different styles under their belts. Their expert advice may help you understand what to do more so it doesn\u2019t sound forced. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "When writing, everyone discovers a voice, or multiple. It can depend on how you write, or who you write. Your tone is your own personal one, or even multiple. Your writing voice doesn\u2019t always have to relate to who you are out loud. For example, all of my quora answers make me sound like a much more civil, well rounded, level headed person than I actually am, and that\u2019s completely okay. Written you and verbal you can be completely different. But if you really feel the need to add in your humor, then you should probably try adding some funny things into the dialogue. Or, leaving sarcastic comments in descriptions of things. Or, you could try disguising yourself as the character you\u2019re writing. I do that a lot. Some characters are always bitter, some are free spirits, and others are the most aggressive characters you can find, physically and verbally. I just turn into that character as they narrate. I am them in writing when I\u2019m really someone silently slouching in front of their laptop. You could attempt to make a character who is the jester of the story, and have them be the one to make everyone happy. If it\u2019s to strenuous to just make them naturally silly, give them a reason to want to make everyone laugh. Whatever you choose to try and make your material a bit more lighthearted, just remember that it doesn\u2019t really matter if it is. Your writing voice(s) are yours, and you can leave it/them alone if you decide to. ",
