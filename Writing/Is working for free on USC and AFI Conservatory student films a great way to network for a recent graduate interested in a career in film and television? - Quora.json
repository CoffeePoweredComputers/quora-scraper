            "answer_text": "Yes, this is certainly one way to break into the industry. Film students always need crew. If you do a good job, you're dependable and you're willing to learn and work hard, then you are like gold to a stressed out film student who is desperate to find dependable crew. You will be talked about and recommended to their peers. I have direct experience with this. When I was a student at USC I needed some help with one of my films. A young man who had recently moved from France to LA answered my Craigslist ad and helped out on my film. I was so impressed with how hard he worked that when I was asked to be a 1st AD on a larger film project I asked this young man to help me out as my 2nd AD. He then impressed the director, the producer, and the other students working on that film and they asked him to help out with their films and pretty soon he had as much work as he wanted and, since everyone knew what a good worker he was he was often the only paid crew member on a student film. And this trend continued when the students he had worked for graduated and got paying work, they still either needed to hire crews or were asked to recommend people and his name would come up. He got jobs on indie film productions and commercials that way. You probably won't be asked to work as a \"department head\" (a DP, an editor, 1st AD, Gaffer, Production Designer, etc.) because those roles are usually taken by fellow students, but there are many *crucial* jobs on a set where you can make a difference, and, once you prove yourself you can move up to those roles. But keep in mind that, like all networking, you need to be proactive about it. Once you get onto a set, introduce yourself to the other students, let them know you're available to work on projects. Put their contact info into your phone. Stay in touch with people. And when someone calls you the night before a shoot, or the day of, because someone flaked on them and left them in the lurch, drop what you're doing and lend a hand. Long after that film project is forgotten about, that person will still remember that you rescued them and you can never predict when that is going to pay off. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Just make sure you don\u2019t attend these schools unless you are willing to be in debt. Do this for some time to make connections, but do not work for free for too long. The longer you work for free, the more connections you make with people who, well\u2026expect you to work for free. You want to be able to support yourself in this industry. If you know how to do the work, can do really good at it\u2026there is no reason you shouldn\u2019t be able to support yourself on it. My recommendation: work on three student films at USC or AFI to network and learn your skill. From that point, charge a day rate of something like $150 or the appropriate amount in Los Angeles (I\u2019m from Chicago). Only work for free again if you have the opportunity to (A) rise up in responsibility (i.e. Electrician to Best Boy to Gaffer) or (B) have the opportunity to make a meaningful connection or connections. Otherwise, work for $150 per day and play with the flexibility of this rate to get on people\u2019s good side (maybe drop to $75 per day since you like a project, people will be flattered). Build your portfolio. A career doesn\u2019t mean big $$$ necessarily, but it does (if you are only doing that thing) need to be able to support you financially. The best workers I know in Chicago (a) didn\u2019t go to university for a film degree, (b) worked from the ground up in the industry and (c) were serious about how professional they work and how much money they deserve for time worked. Employers and film productions respect that. No offense to AFI and USC students, but they are also broke college students first and foremost and have little of their own money to pay you for working on their production. They offer a great platform to learn, but you will not be able to pay a down payment on a condo or rent (in LA of all places) with little scraps you make from a college production. So again, it\u2019s not something you should do for free long term. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It is indeed a very good way to network. I have personally gotten on a few paid gigs because of AFI sets. I have a friend who has gotten interviews at production companies because of her connections through AFI. I would caution however that you shouldn\u2019t let yourself do too many volunteer PA gigs. Being a PA is, in all honesty, mainly manual labor. It only takes so long to know how to call rolling, master some basic radio talk, and learn about the different departments. After being on five to ten sets I think you will know everything you need to know about being a PA. If you\u2019re gonna be doing volunteer work, make sure you are learning. Try to get into different departments and learn new skills. While connections are certainly important, competing as low skill labor in an extremely competitive industry is not advisable. ",
