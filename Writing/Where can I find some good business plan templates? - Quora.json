            "answer_text": "You can find some business plan templates mapping out what your Core consists (Core technology, Core competences, Core values) at your given Growth status but what I\u2019m missing from those business plan templates is the dynamic and the flow. So, what about this? I see Growth as a dynamic advancement of a series of growth events. I\u2019ve realised a pattern here. All it was to codify it. I call it The Full Stack Growth Cycle. The framework of a scaleable, repeatable and sustainable Growth. A high level intro: as it turns out in between the classic growth milestones (MVP, Seed, A, B, C) the same events are repeating and following the same sequence all the time. Those events are 1: core 2: challenge 3: opportunity 4: growth 5: traction 6: investment. What makes growth different is actually what happens in between those events. You can reach your full potential by using such a dynamic business plan template.  ",
