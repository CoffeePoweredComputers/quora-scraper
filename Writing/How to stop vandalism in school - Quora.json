            "answer_text": "There is no \u201cfix\u201d to the problem of vandalism, but there are ways to minimize it. The high school that I attended was mostly built of concrete blocks, but the interior walls were finished with a plastic coating that resisted ink and pencil marks\u2014it would\u2019ve taken spray paint to mark it up. The elementary school where I volunteered (prior to pandemic) was in the middle of a rough neighborhood. Druggies would break into storage buildings to do their thing, and would break into classrooms looking for money or things that could be resold easily. There were two mobile units whose windows were broken every few months, and some classroom windows were also broken from time to time. The most disgusting vandalism were crude graffiti on the basketball court. After the shooting at Parkland, Florida there was community pressure to secure the school. They installed cameras at the entrance so visitors had to be buzzed in by the office. Motion detectors and an alarm was installed. Then a fence was put up around the pre-k play area and outside cameras were put up. Two years ago, the school installed a tall chain-link fence around the back of the school enclosing the mobile units and storage building. This upset some in the neighborhood because it prevented access to the basketball courts. In retaliation, tires were slashed on all the vehicles in the back parking lot early one summer morning (the custodians\u2019 cars). But the year was uneventful. No broken windows; no break-ins, no vulgar graffiti. The cost was a fortress feel with reduced access by teachers and students. But there are still vulnerabilities so the situation is a balancing act between security and usability. ",

            "answer_text": "Best way I can think of is to completely enforce a strict zero-tolerance policy. Meaning that if caught, there would serious consequences. Not anything like a warning or after school detention. It should be either weekend detention, cleaning the school, or possibly suspension. These consequences should have serious punishments if they are not taken seriously. Meaning if they don\u2019t show up it goes against their record and they could risk not graduating. But for any of this to be legal in the board the school will have to put all of it the student handbook. That way no parent can complain and try to waive the punishment. ",
