            "answer_text": "If you are referring to a marriage ceremony, \u201ctraditional\u201d probably means religious. So the difference is whether you are married in a religious ceremony, or legally married by a judge, or a minister who refrains from involving deity in the proceedings. I have performed both Wiccan handfastings and civil ceremonies. The result of becoming legally married is the same. ",

            "answer_text": "What kind of ceremony are you asking about? Weddings, funerals or what? Even if we are very secular here in Sweden, the traditional funeral or wedding is a christian ceremony. The difference is if it is a priest/pastor or a civil person who performs the ceremony. In the civil ceremony there is no hymns sung or bible text read, also no praying. The rest is very similar. ",
