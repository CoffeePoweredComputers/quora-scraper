            "answer_text": "Studying is a very import part of learning. I like to think of studying as the major component of being prepared for what lies ahead. (Just made that one up!) Studying = preparedness. It is synonymous with training for a sport. If an athlete enters a competition without training, the results may not be good. So, by studying, a student is prepared with the knowledge gained from reading and learning from others who are better versed on subject. Studying what others have written may allow a student to formulate his or her own opinion based on knowledge rather than just relational thinking. Don\u2019t study and practice boring information\u2014just use what is available to you to learn what you think is necessary for the task. Improvise, and hold an open mind to learning from your studies! It\u2019s all good\u2014it\u2019s all positive. Make studying work for you on your terms! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can be successful without a degree. There are plenty of examples around. What is very important is to commit to learning and growth, whether you do a degree or not. That also means, that you need to carry on learning after your degree. To comment further on the degree, doing one gives you learning discipline, opens your mind as you meet a wide array of people and mix up with professors and academic. So it's enriching. You can get the same if you network with many people. It's just more effort on your side. The flip coin is first that a degree is expensive and can put you in serious debt. And that it puts you in a sort of mold that you might not adhere with. ",
