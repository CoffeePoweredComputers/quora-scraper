            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s get this straight. Whose shows the ownership or possession of something by someone and should be followed by a noun. e.g Cinderella, whose hair is as white as snow, married a handsome young prince. Who's means \u2018who is\u2019 - the apostrophe shows that the i is missing: e.g Who\u2019s Snow White? So for your question, Is this sentence correct: \"Whose this pen\"?. It should be Whose pen is this? ",

First of all, from the way it is phrased, it seems that you are asking \u201cWho is this pen\u201d. The corrected version would be: \u201cwhose pen is this\u201d. Concerning the punctuation, the interrogation mark should be within the inverted commas.  So, finally, the correct sentence is \u201cWhose pen is this?\u201d Hopes that helps :) ",
