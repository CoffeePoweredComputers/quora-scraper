            "answer_text": "The short answer is that it depends. Most colleges use the Common App, some allow both, a few use only the Coalition App, and some require neither. The two apps have different essays, questions, and requirements. It all depends on the college you are applying to. For example, UC schools don\u2019t use the Coalition or Common App essay, they have their own requirements. But other schools, like the Ivy League colleges and many other private and public schools, require that you send in your Common App or Coalition App essay. I would recommend that you create a list of all of the colleges you want to apply to and figure out what their requirements are. For most people, the Common App will be sent to the majority of their schools. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, the main essay you write in the Common App will go to all colleges you apply to through the Common App portal. I suppose it\u2019s the same for Coalition App too. But if you want to tailor your essay to different colleges, you can do it. When you submit the first application, you can make changes to the info in the application form and any edits to your essay (even write a completely new one) - and then send it to the next college on your list. But you cannot change anything in the applications you already submitted (students ask about it all the time). ",

However, if an essay is part of a Supplement specific to only one Common App college, then it will only be sent to that college. (My daughter applied to several colleges with the Common App, and it seemed like most of them had some sort of Supplement specific to that college.) ",
