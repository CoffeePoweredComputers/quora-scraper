            "answer_text": "All new authors have difficulty finding their markets, and many published writers publish only one book. Genre novels are the only way one can learn to write books that can easily be published because there is a much vaster market for poorly written genre because that market has little taste. Genre writing can be successfully taught and work-shopped, whereas there is no way to teach novel writing. Once a person stumbles through one or two complete book manuscripts, if they have what it takes to be a novelist, they are compelled to write something that an outside editor will love or feel like taking under his or her wing. Margaret Mitchell wrote 11 variations of Gone with the Wind in hand-written script. If you use The Silence of the Lambs as a model for your book you will be able to find a market for it. Or study some of the novels written in Europe which barely run 100 pages, and win many plaudits. ",
