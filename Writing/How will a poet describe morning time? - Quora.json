            "answer_text": "A poet would first strive to feel the morning time. Words can create masterpieces once put to paper; it can stir the fire on which burns the cauldron of all human emotions. I do not call myself a poet. Rather, just an emotion, waiting to be felt. So, I could probably do no justice to the scent of flowers, that I begin my day with. I cannot describe perfectly the incandescence that bid me greeting with their warm embrace. I have not the words for the feel of the kiss the dew drops leave on my lips. But, as I am such a romantic, I can imagine, with my eyes closed, a scene only Keats\u2019 words could do justice to. Because once I give in to my senses, I can smell the smoke, hear the honks, see the traffic and feel the fire of the world, like an outraged mother waking up her ward. ",
