            "answer_text": "The competitive aspect of being a writer/published author can cause jeolousy amongst other writers. Especially when any writer or writers have more financial success than the other writer. I think that can cause the mean comments. Sometimes it is simply a matter of forgetting their own past experiences\u2026 But competition is out there in every creative arena. The music industry. The television industry. The movie industry. The entire entertainment industry. The drive to be better takes work. Lots of blood sweat and tears. You want to be really good, you gotta put your nose to the grindstone and just work your tail off. Eventually you will achieve a form of recognition for how hard you worked. Some people are jealous when it looks like someone else has any success. Or, it looks like they worked less hard to achieve that success, or they feel that success was handed to them. In their limited worldview, they might feel the accolades are undeserved. \u201cThat person didn't work as hard as I did, so why do they get more than me? Must be dumb luck.\u201d Couldn't be talent. Or good timing. Or striking a nerve. Or better yet? Tapping into something the other writer did not tap into as quickly. Or\u2026this might be the real stick in your craw point: Maybe that author found a perfect niche and figured out the quickest, easiest way (i.e. best formula) to exploit that niche. And then exlpoited it blatantly. More to the point, that frustration exists at its core because not everyone understands or appreciates the concept of fast food. Not everyone appreciates it when someone is not shy or embarrassed by their own ambition. Some folks resent it because it seems distasteful. \u201cThey're pandering to the lowest common denominator. Can't be any good.\u201d Maybe. But sometimes there are levels of good and those mean different things to different people at different times. Does your local high end steakhouse hate McDonald's? Of course. Opposite ends of the spectrum, admittedly, but go with me. You're at work. It's lunch time. You're starving. You have half an hour for lunch. You didn't pack a lunch. You need to find someplace close, fast, with a drive-through, you can get in and get out of just that fast. 30 minutes or less. You're on the clock. What do you do? Do you drive all the way across town to the really nice steakhouse for an amazing tasting meal that fills you up but also hits all your tastebuds the right way so you savor it\u2026? Only if you want to get fired. The correct answer is: McDonald's, Taco Bell, or Burger King. McDonald's is closest, it wins today. Why? McDonald's sucks, right? Food is terrible, isn't it? It only sucks or is terrible to critics and purists. If you are working and have 30 minutes to grab lunch, get back, eat, clock in, and NOT lose your job? You blow through Mickey D's drive through, grab a bag of food, blow back to work, and inhale your lunch. Quick meal. Fills you up. You could eat during the drive back to work. And, you still had five minutes to clock in. Kinda hard to hate that. Sometimes, speed, simplicity, and convenience, and availability, win out over product \u201cquality.\u201d People hate Starbucks for the same reason they hate McDonald's: they're everywhere. They\u2019re quick, convenient, and reasonably priced. (Not cheap. Reasonable.) Same with Walmart. Same with Taco Bell. Same with Domino's Pizza. Etcetera. Some people do something because they \u201chave\u201d to do it. Something just drives them and compells them forward. \u201cI have to do this. I need to do this. I must do this. This is my passion. I can't do anything else because it would not be me. (I sucked at everything else. This is what I'm good at. This is what I am. This is WHO I am.)\u201d When that person (Stephen King, for example) sees someone else come along in their field who sets out to be as successful as possible in the shortest time possible with a formula they know will work, that other person will dismiss them. Do you buy a James Patterson novel because you want to read great literature? No. And he knows that and never intended it to be. You buy James Patterson, for the most part, because he's a quick, easy read. You can grab one of his paperbacks, toss it in your beach bag with your towel and tanning lotion, and whip through it lying on the beach, catching a tan. Or, as a quick read for the plane flight. Bus ride. Boat ride. Lunch break at work\u2026in short, anywhere your attention might get diverted. Anyone and anything can distract you, and will in those places. You need a book with short chapters, few words, easy to zip through, and won't upset you when something distracts you. Good story that keeps you engaged and turning pages. If you need to set it aside, you need something you can jump out of and jump back into just that fast. (Fiction for the A.D.D./A.D.H.D crowd, which includes me.) If you spill coffee or soda or lunch or tanning lotion on the book accidentally? No big deal. (Just a Jim Patterson book, anyway. Grab another copy at Walmart on the way home\u2026) A James Patterson novel is the McDonald's Quarter Pounder w/Cheese Meal of fiction. (Much the way Maroon 5 are the Quarter Pounder w/Cheese Meal of the music industry.) And some writers resent this. Especially when someone cranks out as many books in a year as James does, and makes as much money doing it as James does. Jim was in advertising and marketing before and while launching his writing career. The insight into what sells drives his entire writing career and working model. (He's a fiction factory, basically.) James Patterson novels are fast food fiction. (To further prove it, Jim publishes a line of novellas designed to be quick, easy, reads that only cost a few bucks: Bookshots. They've been around a short while but there are boatloads of them already. Bookshots are the McDonald's Happy Meals of fiction\u2026) Sometimes, you want to read a thought-provoking, well-written, work of great literature. Sometimes, you just want a quick midnight snack. It's that simple. (Keep this in mind too: Check back on that steakhouse in a few years. Check on that McDonald's too. Good chance the steakhouse will be gone. Good chance McDonald's will still be there.) In the case of Stephen King making some unfortunate criticisms of James Patterson recently\u2026there's more than a little irony in play there. Steve probably just totally forgot that when he was first published back in the 70\u2032s, nobody thought much of him, either. Here was a guy teaching English and submitting various short stories to, excuse the euphemism, all the various titty magazines he could get published in. Not to forget several other only marginally more reputable publishers. You gotta build that C.V. and you gotta get a lot of rejections\u2026or back then you did. When Carrie finally got published, it did not make Steve an instant success. Surprised? True. Did okay. However, about the time it was going to come out in paperback, there was a bit of a bidding war. Enough people wanted it in paperback that publishing rights for that edition sold for $400,000. (His then standard 50/50 split with his publisher, Viking, meant Steve got $200,000. Not a ton of money but it allowed him to quit teaching and write full-time.) More important and relevant to the topic: not every critic loved his work. More than a few were loudly dismissive of Steve's writing skills\u2026or lack of. (There's that ironic part thing.) \u201cThat's not writing, that\u2019s just word processing.\u201d Amongst other similar gems. Steve used to be very humble about his writing. He never claimed to be a great writer: \u201cI'm no Graham Green.\u201d For Steve, for a long time, Story was always boss. Ironically, James Patterson does not consider himself a great writer, either. But guess what? In a James Patterson novel, story is always boss. The reality and the irony is: Back in the 70\u2032s when Steve started out? Stephen King WAS James Patterson. More than a little ironic he seems to have forgotten that. Steve would do well NOT to forget his very humble not auspicious beginnings himself. Lest someone point out the deep irony of his negative slams against James Patterson. (More than a little bit of the pot calling the kettle black, Steve. Just saying.) ",

            "answer_text": "Not all writers are mean to other writers.  Not all teachers are mean to other teachers.  Not all lawyers .. well, you get the point.  Meaness comes from jealousy.  In a competetive career like the publishing business, it's not always the good writers that get on the best seller list.  Oftentimes it's luck, or who you know.  There are hard feelings when other writers feel they have more talent, are more creative, or make  darn sure their editing is perfect yet a poorly written, sloppy novel that looks like it was thrown together in a few weeks takes the world by storm, goes viral, movies are made... ad nausem.  We've seen it time and again.  It's hard to swallow, but that's the writer's life.  Some of us handle it better than others. ",
