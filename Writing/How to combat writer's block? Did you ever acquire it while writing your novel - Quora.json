            "answer_text": "The reason it gets so bad is because you think you need to fight it. I\u2019ll explain. We all have 2 sides to our brains. One side is more analytical. The other is more artistic. I theorize that writer\u2019s block happens when we shift too much focus onto the analytical side and here\u2019s how to fix it. You need both to write obviously, but when the writing just flows, you\u2019re using your artistic side of the brain. When you have writer\u2019s block you just shifted over to the analytical. How does this shift happen? We start thinking about deadlines. We start questioning if it\u2019s good enough. We start looking for typos. We start editing what we already wrote. This is all analytical. And the more it creeps in, the more we move away from our creativity. It all seems logical and important, but it becomes counter-productive when it blocks your flow. Try to shut this stuff off while you write and get back into that creative heart space. Some methods I\u2019ve found that work are: Exercise \u2014 get the blood flowing, release endorphins and studies show you become more creativeMeditate \u2014 Don\u2019t meditate on what you\u2019re writing. Instead use this time to recenter yourself, relax and re-focus.Bounce ideas off friends \u2014 no man is an island. Sharing with others can get those creative juices flowing againSpend time with inspiring visuals. Seek out places or images that inspire you. Focus on the emotions they invoke. For some people, music works better.You might also find this article helpful. Defeat Content Writer's Block Once & For All  ",

However, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever experienced \u201cwriter\u2019s block.\u201d What I have experienced is that I\u2019ve made a mistake and taken something I\u2019m writing to a place where I can\u2019t continue writing it, because I\u2019ve boxed myself in or otherwise created an untenable position. The solution isn\u2019t to break through the block, it\u2019s to go back, figure out where I made the mistake, and fix it. ",
