            "answer_text": "Someone? Who? A high school graduate? A school drop-out? An engineer? A basketball player? A journalist? A novel writer? There are a zillion categories, and even more within each category. Some people write slowly, some quickly. An eight page paper is probably about 2500 words. When I was in journalism school, I could turn out 2,000 publishable words an hour, so this might have taken me an hour and ten minutes\u2014assuming I started with all the information I needed and didn\u2019t have to do any research. I was one of the fastest writers in my class. But any journalism student in my class could have done it in two or three hours. What about a non-writer? Someone with a good command of English, who had all the facts at hand, should certainly be able to write 2500 words in a day without sweating. If he/she had to do research, that would add to the writing time of course. If this were a high school assignment, I\u2019d expect the teacher to give students a week to do the job. This should present no problems. It should be plenty of time. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I have done the \u201cNanowrimo\u201d challenge a few times, and it takes me about 90 minutes to write ~2000 words of fiction. I can do a little better than this, ~1500 words an hour if I have a solid outline/well researched topic for an essay. So, at 500 words/page, it would take me roughly 3 hours to just write the essay. If we factor in research time (say 6 hours), outlining (1\u20132 hours depending on how well I know the topic and how much of an opinion I have), formatting references (I use LaTex now so it only takes a few minutes, but in Word citation managing is a pain so we\u2019ll say an hour), and then proof reading and editing (I\u2019ve done a lot of writing, so my first drafts come out reasonably well/close to what I\u2019m trying to say. For me this is about 2 hours. For the average person, it probably works out to more like 3\u20134 hours). If we add all that together, you get somewhere between 14\u201316 hours.on the low end. If you are unfamiliar with the topic, a slow writer or not very good at writing, any part of this process can take a lot longer. Also, if you try to do it all in one go, fatigue is going to slow you down somewhat as you move through the process. I\u2019d say you should budget about 20 hours as a minimum for a research based essay (or any kind of essay that requires you to have citations or textual support), and perhaps 12 hours for an essay that is devoid of sources/research.
