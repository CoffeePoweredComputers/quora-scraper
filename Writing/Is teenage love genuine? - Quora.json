            "answer_text": "Thanks Supreeth Hegde for A2A. A teen, is a young person aged between 13-19 years. During this period a person goes through puberty, he/she grows taller, stronger, heavier, hairier, smellier, moodier and may even get pimples. But along with these physical and hormonal changes, psychological development takes place in parallel. Human beings are full of desires and during adolescence, sexual desires are at peak. That gives rise to extreme attraction towards the opposite gender(may depend upon your sexual orientation). That is totally normal and happens to everybody.  During this period, porn plays a significant role in affecting the teenagers psychologically. Many studies show that the average age (when kids start watching porn) is 14. That gives rise to an increase in their desire of mating. Though not everyone would admit, but deep down every teenager feels the need for the same. That leads to shyness in some, while some becoming sociopaths.  Now coming back to the question, in general, teenage love is not real, because it depends on many factors, a major being maturity. According to me, Teenage love stories are the most beautiful part of one's life. While puberty phase takes care of your physical aspect, teenage love takes care of mental. A majority of teenage love stories don't succeed because of many of the above factors, but it's failure that teaches the great lessons in life. I remember when I first felt loved. I was 18, she was the girl who would be my soulmate, everything felt like the end of the world(but it wasn't). I was the most egoistic, stubborn, arrogant, introvert and anti social person I would ever know personally. But when she broke up, I was devastated, heart broken, and felt like a victim who was not served justice (but I now feel,that I deserved that). That took a lot to recover and completely changed the way I used to be.  Now coming to the question again, I was the most immature person, that in general, every teenager is. All I had in abundance were, \"desires\" to be with her, \"jealousy\" to not let her be with anyone else, \"passion\" to win her every time, \"ego\" to not let her go, \"anxiety\" to lose her some day. And all these factors combined, made me the most unwanted boyfriend that any girl could barely handle. So my love for her was NEVER REAL. ",

            "answer_text": "Many smart people over here saying that teenage love is not real and one said that it is just infatuation. (Adults don't experience infatuation or what?) Nothing can be more funnier than these answers. You mean, let's say 18 year old person's love is not real but 28 one's real. Wow! In many countries, male and female could get married legally at the age below 20. So she or he is not ready for love, but ready for marriage!?! Also, let us not forget that female and male brain is different and female teenager is way more mature and sophisticated than the male teenager. This is proven fact in children also! Now coming to the main point: what is love? who can define love with the age? People answered here are talking about smart love, a love which can last long, a love which is not infatuation! A love that can lead to long lasting relationship or a marriage! If teenage love is due to infatuation and hormone changes and puberty and all, what about adult love? Tell me what are the reasons and chemical reactions in their body behind adult love? The same reasons are there! There is lust in adult love, there is expectations in adult love, there is same madness in adult love as mentioned in answers here. Maybe the only difference is the intensity with they are prepared for love even before falling in love, but then, adults are also prepared for. However there is a line, but a thin line, which can not be lead towards the statement that teen love is fake love! Just on the basis of reasons, you can not justify one is true love and another is false love. You can say that teenage love occur without much calculations and thinking. You can say it doesn't last long, and stuff. But you can not say it is not real. (If you ask old age lovers who spent years together, they would include almost whole the youth's love in teenage love category!) Yes, there is, clearly an attraction and infatuation in many cases, but that wouldn't suffice the equation that leads to the conclusion: \u201cteenage love is fake.\u201d The only difference in teenage love and adult love is that probably adults are not in that much hurry to fall for someone for a reason or two; or they will smartly choose their lovers from the available options. Otherwise, psychological process is maybe a tad different but biological process is pretty much same! Certainly we need to think but socially! ",

            "answer_text": "My father told me that I didn't know what love was with my first girlfriend and I believed him at the time. There is a small hint of truth to this. It is believed that you cannot fully know true love until you know/love yourself. We are still developing as teenagers and therefore we might experience a deeper sense of love when we are older. However, from a biological point of view, we feel or experience love through the release of oxytocin (Love drug) in the brain. This feeling is the passion or lusty love. There are three types of love according to Robert Sternberg.   Intimacy is the feeling of closeness and connectedness you have with your partner. If this area is at a high level then your partner feels like your best friend. You feel as if you can be completely yourself around them and they feel the same. In some ways intimacy cannot be improved. Sometimes your values, interests and personality just do not match up with someone else. However, intimacy can be improved by creating new common activities to engage in together, sharing intimate details about yourself or by fully accepting them for who they are Increased intimacy will positively correlate with an increased desire to keep that person in your life. Commitment is what this desire is defined as. It is your ability to see you with your partner in the future. This manifests behaviorally through such things as; making future plans, talking about your relationship in a future context and actively trying to keep the relationship intact when it is threatened. A person\u2019s attempt to \u201cfight\u201d for the relationship is heavily influenced by their attachment style. The last component of a consummate love relationship is Passion! A passionate love relationship is one in which both people have a strong physical attraction for the other person. This attraction is expressed by the person\u2019s desire for; physical closeness, sex and an increased release of oxytocin when the person with their partner. Passion is known to be the first thing to diminish in a relationship with your partner. Their are biological reasons as to why this is. However, there are ways to create and maintain passion in your relationship. Read more: Page on pinnacleofman.com ",

            "answer_text": "To be honest it really does depend. A lot of teenage girls will date someone and this is how it usually goes: Day 1: They usually post a picture of them on their stories and say \u201cTaken by this cutie XOXO\u201d Week 1: Once again, they will post something on their stories saying \u201cHappy 1 week with this guy\u2026\u201d (they never say their names) \u201c\u2026I love you so much, and even tho it\u2019s only been a week I feel like I've known you my whole life. XOXO\u201d Week 3: They post on their stories \u201cI'm single hmu. I just realized that HE was toxic.\u201d They do this because people overuse the word love, claiming they love every single thing, like pizza or a show on Netflix. These teens will be dating for only a week and start saying they love each other. Other times it can actually be serious. For example, my boyfriend and I met in 7th grade (2017). We didn\u2019t talk until Halloween when we ran into each other and I forced my friends to say hi because he was new, and later that night he asked for my number. In October we started dating, and I went through that emotional teenage phase in December when my mom got breast cancer. He helped me through that, and I helped him through his problems. We hang out all the time and have been dating for 1 year and 5 months, and in my opinion, I doubt we are breaking up anytime soon. We do love each other, but we didn\u2019t say it until around 6 months in our relationship. That is real love. So those kids who only date for one week and say they love each other is not true love, but when you support each other, get to know each other, and really feel happy, that's when you know it might be love.

            "answer_text": "Rarely. I think the problem is confusing love with something else. This is my last year as a teenager but I'm pretty sure I've never really been \u201cin love\u201d with somebody. Teenagers just really, really like somebody, find they're fun, enjoy their company and think it's love. They find this other person so perfect that when they actually spend enough time with them to realise the little faults they have, which they can see only after the initial charm has work off, it breaks them. And then it's over. The swearing forevers to each other and posting lovely photos on Instagram and putting appreciation posts on Facebook. All of it. That's the problem. Love doesn't work that way. You don't give up on a person when you learn about their faults. You either learn to live with those faults or you help the other person improve those faults. You have to put in effort. Loving another person isn't a passive act, it needs constant effort. I'm not saying you can't fall in love as a teenager. You can. It's just very rare. Even when it is actually love, it's not important that it works out. There may be circumstances where you can't make it work despite best efforts. Nothing you can do about that. And I'm not in the teenager love hater party, but I can see now the reason why people get annoyed by teen love. There's public declarations of love followed by a newer declaration with someone else in three weeks and to be honest, that actually can be annoying. There's nothing wrong with dating, experimenting. But stop calling every crush the love of your life. They're not. ",

            "answer_text": "Excellent question. I was in a relationship from the age of 14 through 16. Beforehand I was seeking out something different - I had no interest in finding love. Love found me. The thing about teenagers is that we\u2019re very hormonal. This often causes a very high \u2018drive\u2019, not necessarily for sex, but for emotional connection. It\u2019s very easy as a teen to dive into a relationship one day to the next. I would say that that girl is the only person I have really felt \u2018love\u2019 for. There\u2019s no question that teen love is genuine. Teens are definitely capable of feeling love, and as a teen, I feel that people often look back on teen relationships later in life and say \u2018I was never truly in love\u2019, or decide to call it all fake. I am still 16 and have yet to fall in love with someone, at which time I\u2019ll have a personal comparison point, but I don\u2019t deny that I did feel \u2018love\u2019 for my ex girlfriend. It\u2019s also important to recognise that love comes in many shapes and forms. The thing about teenagers is that we have little patience, and can get attached to people very fast, especially nowadays when we have the ability to instantly communicate using the internet. Therefore, whilst for an adult it may take a proper process, with dating etc before finding someone who you like, teenagers can completely fall for people without even talking to them or seeing them close up. It\u2019s the kind of thing that I imagine you grow out of relatively fast, but at the time it\u2019s definitely genuine to the person in question. We can often fall for people on our first meeting, something less common in older people. We also don\u2019t know exactly what to look for as we\u2019re inexperienced and don\u2019t quite know what we\u2019re looking for yet; we\u2019re just chemically wired to search for something, and that we do. On the basis that it people still positively look back on their memories as a teenager; of falling in love for the first times, having new experiences - I would say teen love is genuine. I would not say that teens know how to manage it properly yet. Thats something one must learn. E.S.T. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of people say that teenage love is just infatuation, but does this apply to every single teenage couple? Infatuation, defined as \u201can intense but short-lived passion or admiration for someone or something\u201d is something that everybody has felt before. I would argue that even adults have confused infatuation with love. For me personally, infatuation is something you experience when you look over and the boy sitting nearby is really cute, perfect you\u2019re in love. You proceed to crush on him for days, weeks, months, such a long time. But the moment you realize the boy has a flaw, any flaw - you don\u2019t feel the same. That\u2019s the clump of teenage relationships, well, the ones that most people pay attention. It\u2019s infatuation with the image you have of somebody, but once that ideal image is changed, by a flaw, you begin to lose feeling. For example, I\u2019ve dated 2 guys and am currently dating another boy. I\u2019m 17. The first boy I dated was my freshmen year. He was in band, a wonderful and talented marimba player. A very handsome guy too, especially for one who hasn\u2019t quite matured. Yep, this feeling I had was infatuation, not love. I learned that after I broke up with him. Why? Because I realized that under the pretty layers, he was a pretty awful person. Once I knew that, the image in my head shattered. After this point, I took my time. I was developing, my personality was being shaped, I was learning to love myself and my ideals. Afterwords, a lot of things changed for me. The second boy was a grade above me, we began talking in a boyfriend/girlfriend sense about 5 months after I broke up with Boy#1 - He was pretty sweet, we shared the same interests, same friend group and got along great. He wasn\u2019t much of a looker, but he was super sweet. I was pretty sure I was in love. But every single time I noticed a flaw with him, I just couldn\u2019t get it out of my head. That relationship didn\u2019t last very long either. My current boyfriend, man, we have more of a history together. But I\u2019ll get to that some other time. But after dating this guy for almost 2 years, I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019m actually in love with him. I love his every flaw and he loves mine. We support each other through tough times. Even before us dating, we were best friends and really cared about each others well being. The important thing is, like most couples should, we work together, we communicate, and we don\u2019t give up on each other. We better ourselves and each other. ",

I even remember the exact date and time when I saw her first time . We was in the same school , then I left that school and met her after more than 5 years and still she was remembering me . That moment we was friends again , I never told her that I was in love with her , and again after 2 years we lost touch after she shifted to a new location . We met again when we joined same coaching class , unknown about each other . She was a changed girl I met after 2 years. She gained a lot to attitude and ignorance for me . I thought it was a common thing as we after a long time , but it was not that common . I started talking with her and we was friends again . Then somehow she got what are my feelings about her , if she was older friend that I knew , then she would talked with me once . But this time she just stopped talking with me suddenly . I later found that now she knows my feelings about her , but she actually mistaken it . Later she leave that tution without telling me . I was always in thoughts of her and in wait , one day everything will be fine . With the changed attitude , she is a person who will never look me back . Many times I tried to think about other girls but Everytime I start to think but I comes to her . It's not any type of physical attraction or something , It's all the way pure love . I am just sixteen and smiled with her and cried for her again and again . It was true in my case , but many guys only haves physical attraction . You just have to decide it is love or physical attraction . That is all about teenage love is\u2026.\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Does anyone know the definition of love? I am not sure if there is one irrefutable definition of love. No one knows what love is and will give descriptions, experiences, feelings, emotions and a variety of explanations for \"what is love\" This in itself should tell you that there is nothing like \"love\" When you are a teenager there is a huge surge of hormones that brings on moods, melancholic behaviour, emotions, sexual arousal, sexual experimentation and sexual exploration. With all this comes a tendency to be attracted instinctively to another. This attraction varies from person to person. It could be because of their physical appearance, the way they walk, talk, smile, laugh, interact, their softness in terms of temperament etc etc. Everyone is attracted to someone for different reasons. Once this attraction sets in, there is a need to pursue their object of their desire and with it comes a sense of insecurity, competition with others, hopelessness, excitement, lows and highs, all in keeping with the \"choreography of the chase\". This \"chase\" that builds the insecurity and the longing is the \"love\" we feel. Once their object of desire is seduced and in their clutches, the affection and intimacy abounds, the emotions and feelings at their peak and mating and sex ensues. This entire charade then wanes after a period of time - some immediately after the mating takes place and some later. This is why marriages end in divorce. Somehow that initial intense pursuit and need for achievement is followed by a phase of complacency because now there is no competition. So when you ask me if Teenage love is genuine, my advice would be that you stop intellectualising those emotions and those beautiful thoughts and just go out a feel that love and intimacy. There is no better feeling than that. Sex intensifies that and the intimacy that you sense and feel just awesome. Have fun and enjoy your teenage years. Don't be too old before you need to be.   ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on the people. About 7 years ago or so a 16 year old girl started working at the restaurant I was a manager at. We all noticed she was falling in love with one of our coworkers, who was 23 at the time. The age of consent where we live is 16, so it technically was legal, but for months that was all anyone talked about. Eventually, people started saying to her face that she was irresponsible, and that her boyfriend was only in it for sex with a younger girl. Well, the couple decided soon after that, that they would refrain from sex until her 18th birthday. Throughout those 2 years, we were all surprised that they stayed together, never fought, were the fastest drive-thru team we\u2019d ever had, and somehow they still managed to keep it a secret from both of their parents. They just quit working here about a year ago, but there\u2019s a few people here who are still in touch with them and apparently they\u2019re still going strong and are in the process of getting a dog together. I\u2019ve also seen people going on 21 and who still aren\u2019t ready for a relationship. So yes, teenagers can feel genuinely in love, just like people in their 20s, 40s, 80s. But it\u2019s also easy for a teenager to mistake a small crush for love as well, but just like anything else, it completely depends on the person. ",

I don't know if it's rumours or not. I mean dating a criminal?I know a girl who is dating a guy, he makes adult vines which is absolute nonsense on YouTube and got many followers. And the girl is so proud of him. She literally chants his name.I know a girl who is going to leave her parents and gonna get married this year. Last time she didn't had the chance to. And again I don't know if it's rumours or not.I know a girl who left her parents for a guy and she married last year. Soon she realised her mistake and came back. And her parents accepted her.I know a girl who dated 5 guys at a time.I'm not trying to judge anyone here. Also exception exist. But this is what majority of people do. If this is what they call love then I'm up for it. ",

It's not something that seams important to people at present. But once we learn to love ourselves life seams easier and then we can understand the meaning of true love and it is then when we'll start to understand each other. Hence, this will help us in the later.Read the real life love stories whenever have time. Also can watch the matured movies or series that match to your ideal love. Like for example, I watch Korean series coz I like cute love stories ;) In addition to this we can read novels or magazines that have articles describing the real life love stories.Start recognizing the people around you right from today. This will slowly make you more readable. \u201cHow is this related to teenage love?\u201d Well the biggest problem is, most people fail to become a lover in the first attempt. They take a life lesson and it is only after this the calouslness in them disappears. Since we are teenagers, from now on we can take the necessary precautions. After all we can pass the difficult time easily because we know the correct method to handle it.Hey! Teenage love has its acurate name infatuation. And that is genuine. Hope it helps! ",

Boy: Because you're so pretty and I think I am falling in love with you. Girl: Really? But my friend is much more prettier than me. She's just behind you. ( The boys turns back) Boy: Are you making fun of me? There's no one behind. The girl left. Wanna know why? Because if he had loved her genuinely, he wouldn't have bothered to look back. Got a smile, right? In teenage when we are developing our personality, we often tend to feel attracted to a person.  ( Pinterest: Image source) That's normal. Of course it's all in the hands of the hormones. In my opinion, teenage love is not justified. Love in it's own word is a very big thing. Love is not a feeling, it's a growth. Growth of oneself. True love evolves. It doesn't appear spontaneously,but grows and develops. It is a decision. \u201cMaking love doesn't make it love\u201d It's just infatuation. Think and act.

Google has quite a good analytics and I think I also have some good reason why not to fall in relationship in teenage it's normal it happens but if you have the option to come out from that just be out I am assuring you that you will not regret and I am assuring one more thing that you will regret if you don't come out So continuing further I am not saying that you should never fall in a relationship but according to me For more click \u2014->Blog | iiw-\u00c3 ",

Neverthless,I agree during teenage there is more infactuation towards opposite gender,they are more tend to get attracted but I don\u2019t find it true to judge their relation. Lot\u2019s of teenagers do get into relationship but their reason can be different. Some get into it\u2026just because they went with heat of the moment.Though the outcome in those cases is null.Some get into it..thinking it to be true love which later ends with either of their partner cheating because it was just an attraction.Some get into one\u2026they truly love each other but sometimes circumstances do not help them.Most of times studies and career are the reason for them being apart which I think is correct,because if you are meant to be together sooner or later things will fall into place but keeping future at stake doesn\u2019t makes sense.But still there are few people who successfully handled their relation and career keeping them on the same page though such people are tough to find. My opinions might disagree with some people but this is what I personally think. A GIRL NEXT DOOR. ",

I don't remember if I felt sexually attracted to him or anything but I remember how happy I was in his company. Even though it was one-sided, I really wanted him to be happy, he was someone I wanted to dedicate my whole life to. Time passed, stuff happened, misunderstandings grew and he graduated from high school and we sort of lost all contacts. When I think back, I can't help but smile at how silly I was. I didn't care if he was of different caste, creed, religion, etc, etc. I didn't care about his money and property. I had no idea what DSLR could do. I was attracted to him because of his personality and his charm. I know everyone feels this love when they hit teen. The butterfly feeling in the stomach, the feeling that they can conquer everything, thanks to the hormones and puberty. Genuine love isn't based on profit, it just happens. So I don't think teen love is not genuine, it is. Afterall we love that person for who she/he really is. If that's not genuine, I don't know what is. ",

For example, some couples get together in their teenage years and if you watch them, they'll get married, they'll start a family, they'll die together. In that case, it is genuine. That's quite obvious. On the other hand, three of my exes told me that they loved me. Yes, I'm 14, I have 4 exes, and I have a boyfriend now. Anyway, some of my exes told me that they loved me. Two of them let their friends beat me up constantly. I put up with it for quite a while. I broke off one of those relationships and the other one broke up with me because I \u201cwas mad too much.\u201d My exes obviously didn't love me, and it hurt. It doesn't help that one of them is trying to get me back. I won't fall for it again. I've learned my lesson. ",

You may fall for someone and date for 2 weeks but the love was genuine. You felt something. You may date someone online and you may not ever touch them but the love was genuine. You knew they were an amazing person and you felt in love. You may fall deeply in love for someone at school but the love is definitely genuine. The age doesn\u2019t matter, you feel something for that person and that\u2019s all that matters. Love isn\u2019t dependent on age or money. If love is felt then it\u2019s always genuine regardless of whether you\u2019re a teenager or not. ",

Sometimes it's your teen age, sometimes wrong person selection, sometimes since you find someone better...and so on...  I know some friends , who was in love since class- 7 and now a happy married couple... and I also know some friends who were in love in college days ,then in post grad bu now happily married with some different person. This is life... There is neither any fixed pattern to live it nor to love. ",

Each one is unique; each one is devastating when it fails. And it will, inevitably. The very things that makes teens attractive makes them poor long-term partners. Innocence, or freshness. Health. Fertility. Youthful appearance. So a teen is a perfect attractor, and when they are at their most receptive. Helps keep the species alive, but it\u2019s harder on long-term relationships. ",

Oh youngsters your mind should be awaken to use your strong body to search God and spread Godliness to the society. Practice Godliness and holiness. Ethical and moral values are more priority than laws. So think about God and practice Godliness.Girl and boy should make love only after marriage which is God planning. The love ,romance shown in movies are against God planning ",

In my concern love doesn't have any age, if anyone loves true they will be ready to loose everything for their loveable one.  \u200b ",

True love is not hugging or kissing someone, but its the sacrifice of yours towards them. Respect and honor your love ones. I think teenage love is also a real love because in love, age, wealth, gorgeousness and charming doesn't matter at all, love is from your heart not from your mind or physical state.Keep loving and be always lovable.

Teens are just beginning to learn what physical/ sexual attraction feels like, and sometimes that initial attraction can develop into actual love. It does happen. They are also starting to learn what characteristics they do and do not want in a boy/girlfriend. Because of this, they can also fall out of love almost as easily as they fell in love. Does this mean their love isn\u2019t real? No. It just means they are young and inexperienced. Ahhh, to be young and in love! ",
