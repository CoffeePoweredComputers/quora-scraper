            "answer_text": "Most people will want to write a last will and testament when they are able to do so, have the life events that make it smart to do so, or have the motivation to do so. Most jurisdictions allow an adult past the age of 18 or the age of majority to draft their won will. While most 18 year old or those in their early 20s will not write a will it is an important part of being a responsible adult to do so and it is wise to do so sooner rather than later if one has the ability to do so. If one has a life event such as getting married or having a lifelong partner or the the birth of a child those life events can make it smart to draft a will to protect those persons that would be affected if one passed away. The motivation to write a will is the most important part of one wanting to write a will. Certain things will motivate one to make a will like a health scare or the death of a friend or loved one that makes one want to act and get started that may not happen if one lacks motivation to do so.
