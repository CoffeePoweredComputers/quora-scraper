            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. But then, I\u2019m not best placed to judge. I\u2019m a cultural pauper. There is a creative skill and imagination in poetry for sure, but if we\u2019re applying labels, I\u2019d put poetry under literature, not art. You might argue literature is a form of art. Fine! However, ask yourself if a novel is art, then ask if a biography is art, then ask if history is art. If the answers don\u2019t come so easy, then you\u2019ll see my point - those are literature, but not art (in my opinion). To me, art is more of a visual (as opposed to visualising) thing, where the expression of skill can be seen (yes, I know you can see poetry as you read it, but I\u2019m sure you know what I mean) and touched e.g., sculpture or installation. So, there you have it. TFA. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Abdul Hussain, poetry in some ways is the highest form of art. The ancient Greeks who imagined the Muses, the nine daughters of Mnemosyne, the deity of memory, assigned a few of them to poetry and none at all to painting. Calliope was the muse of epic poetry.Erato was the muse of love poetry.Polyhymnia was the muse of sacred poetry.Euterpe was the muse of lyric poetry and music.History, Tragedy, Comedy, Dance and even Astronomy all got muses, too. Just not painting, sculpture or architecture. I think if you look into all cultures\u2014from Japan and China to the sub-Continent, Russia, Europe, the Islamic world, Europe and the indigenous peoples around the globe, you find poets at the very top of their cultural pantheons. So yes. Poetry is definitely a form of art. ",
