            "answer_text": "Talking to someone else about their attitude is a little like talking to them about spinach on their teeth. They can\u2019t see it, and they don\u2019t feel it, so they immediately feel a disadvantage. Also, you are applying what you see to how they feel, which doesn\u2019t translate well. Finally, a lot of people don\u2019t even know that they can control their attitude or that it influences their behavior. So your opinion of my attitude is most likely going to be viewed as a judgment, and an attack on my person, not on my actions. I strongly suspect that the attitude you feel needs adjusting is attached to some behavior you observe. Stick with the behavior. At least, both of you have some sort of access to that. Get agreement that both of you acknowledge the behavior, then explore the consequences of the behavior with the other. How did they feel about the response they got? Why did they get that response? What response did they want? How could they get that response? Make it legitimate exploration behavior and impact. Avoid criticism and judgment\u2014you are trying to help. We can\u2019t change others; it\u2019s hard enough to change our own attitudes and behaviors, and it doesn't happen in an instant. You may want to have this conversation several times before you get acknowledgment, ownership of the behavior and what causes it, and any significant change. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Your attitude is reflected in your thinking that the conversation is going to be difficult. So first thing, get over your attitude. How does their attitude affect their job performance? The impacts should be clear to you. What one thing do they need to do this week to eliminate one, and only one of those impacts? Next week, change another thing to eliminate the next impact. Iterate until the negative impacts are gone. Then, figure out how they can achieve excellence. Continue the process of changing one and only one behavior a week. Take your time. Spread the conversation out. It took a while for that attitude to grow. It will take a while before that attitude is gone. You can ask about why that attitude came to be, but its an attitude. It was a learned behavior. And, it was taught. Passive aggressiveness teaches. The failure to be prompt with difficult conversions just makes them much more difficult. Never wait to say. You yourself need some help. Go to HR and look into their EAP programs. Never let people around you engage in passive aggressiveness. Lead by example. ",
