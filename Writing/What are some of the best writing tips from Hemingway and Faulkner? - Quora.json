            "answer_text": "What a huge question. Hemingway said it best himself: \u201cI think you should learn about writing from everybody who has ever written that has anything to teach you.\u201d I have no idea what that means. But it sounds impressive. But quite seriously, Hemingway didn\u2019t officially talk about his writing much, as we have most of it from letters, private memoirs and informal remarks. But he came from reporting, and his writing screams out, \u201cLet the reader feel for himself, and let me just describe what they\u2019re seeing.\u201d And so it\u2019s tight and vivid writing, with lots of short sentences and strong verbs. He sure knew how to create pictures in the readers\u2019 heads, and he coined the word \u201cice berg style\u201d because it was cold, but the reader could project their own warmth or passions into it, but it was under the surface. Here\u2019s my favorite tip from Faulkner, who said the best training for writing is reading copious amounts of anything: \u201cKeep it amateur. You\u2019re not writing for money but for pleasure. It should be fun. And it should be exciting. Maybe not as you write, but after it\u2019s done you should feel an excitement, a passion. That doesn\u2019t mean feeling proud, sitting there gloating over what you\u2019ve done. It means you know you\u2019ve done your best. Next time it\u2019s going to be better.\u201d And one last Faulkner pearl: \u201cYou can always find time to write. Anybody who says he can\u2019t is living under false pretenses. To that extent depend on inspiration. Don\u2019t wait. When you have an inspiration put it down. Don\u2019t wait until later and when you have more time and then try to recapture the mood and add flourishes. You can never recapture the mood with the vividness of its first impression.\u201d ",
