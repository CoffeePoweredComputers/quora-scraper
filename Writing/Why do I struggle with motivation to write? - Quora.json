            "answer_text": "Do you ever struggle with a motivation to brush your teeth? Most likely not because the notion of motivation doesn\u2019t apply to this daily task. Exclude the notion of motivation from your thinking about writing. Make it an unquestionable task that has to be done. No matter how well you do it. Again, before brushing your teeth, you don\u2019t question your perfection in this task. You just do it. Similarly, if you are learning a physical skill, let\u2019s say figure skating, you would never call your coach saying you don\u2019t feel motivated to practice. Writing is a skill. Never wait for motivation to grace you with its presence. With that said, do look for ideas to inspire you: read, research, surround yourself with fascinating people, stir up your knowledge and imagination. ",
