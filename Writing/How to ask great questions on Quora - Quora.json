            "answer_text": "As a Quora reviewer, I have seen many, many questions that were undoubtedly badly written. They are characterized by rambling, misspellings and grammatical errors, bizarre assumptions and over-specificity. The worst leave the reader wondering what on earth is being asked. Some of them have long unformatted details that go on for screens, effectively answering the question right in the question details. A great question on Quora is a sort of koan that elicits thoughtful answers. These are the Needs Attention categories available to reviewers: Needs More InformationNeeds to Be ClearerNeeds Spelling, Grammar, or Formatting EditsNeeds to Be Phrased as a QuestionNeeds to Be a Complete SentenceContains Multiple QuestionsNeeds to Be ShorterToo Reliant on Question DetailsRhetorical QuestionNeeds to Be Phrased More NeutrallyAdvertisement or Self-Promotional QuestionPossible SpamNeeds to Be Written in EnglishPoll QuestionToo Many TopicsNeeds Topic AdjustmentDirect QuestionObsolete QuestionAnswered in Question DetailsContains Unnecessary ProfanitySpecific Legal QuestionSpecific Medical QuestionWriting an adequate question on Quora is not too hard. One of the easier methods is to copy the phrasing of a popular question. (In fact, it's nice to have some sorts of questions in a standard format, rather than a hodgepodge of different wordings that make it hard for others to find your question.) Writing a really good question is harder. I recommend taking the time to read the questions that have already been written on the main topic. You may find that there's already one that answers your question, or one that asks your question but isn't worded well. If you're confident in your ability to write good questions, you might consider editing the poorly written one. (This will mean that you will not get credits for followers to this question. However, Reviewers are tasked to Redirect Questions that are substantially similar, so you might find yours merged into an older question, anyway.) Things which I am aiming for when I edit a question on Quora:  the wording: One clear sentence. As an example, the original question was \"I live in an authoritarian regime. How do I effectively communicate with others without getting into trouble?\" I changed this to: How do I effectively communicate with others without getting into trouble when I live in an authoritarian regime?I don't think it's necessary to put the premise in the question itself. Self-referentially, this question has a simple expression, \"What characterizes a well-written question on Quora?\" and a further clarification that this is concerning the writing within the details. (It could have been written, \"What does a good question on Quora look like, aside from interesting topics\", which would have been far more confusing.)Not written in Jeopardy!-eseThe question should read naturally, rather than being a statement that has been forced into a query.Clear and interesting question details, as necessary.Not every question needs details, but if it does, they should draw the potential answerer in and make the case for why this is a compelling question by giving context or adding the thoughts of the questioner. Be careful with these as it can easily lead to adding in other questions and over-broadening the scope of the question.Designed to elicit interesting answers.Questions that draw out personal experience work well on Quora.Good questions inspire expert analysis or a well-curated synopsis of information that helps distinguish a great answer on Quora from the masses of facts available elsewhere on the 'net.Seek sincerely.This one is subtle, and I do not have a succinct example of what I mean. Quora's power users are often flooded with demands for answers, and frequent answerers in a topic often get to a point of burnout from the repetitious and uninformed nature of the questions asked. (e.g. When it comes to the topic of \"Germany\", why are Quora users so obsessed with questions about Hitler, Jews and WWII?) A little homework by the questioner can make the difference between a clich\u00e9 and a subtle detail that brings out an impassioned outpouring of explanation.Simplicity is good.Questions that are applicable to more than one particular situation generally work better. The exception to this might be in the Dating and Relationships topic, where specific details lead to answers tailored to the situation at hand.the context: Set the primary topic accurately.Food is a vague topic. Usually you can find something a little more specific.Choose additional topics with care.Questions about Europe really don't need every single country listed in the details. You want to attract the attention of people who actually care about your question. You'll pick up followers and answerers from related questions while someone is browsing through Quora.Check again to see that your question is written clearly. Avoid abbreviations except where commonly used within that context (writing HIV is appropriate, rather than Human Immunodeficiency Virus, writing \"froyo\" is somewhat obnoxious). Check against the list of Needs Attention tags. Consider whether your question benefits Quora as a community in addition to your own personal curiosity. If you can reword the question to have broader appeal, you should probably do so. (But avoid making it so broad that it is unanswerable!) If you're having trouble wording your question well, Need help wording a Quora question? is open to assisting you.

            "answer_text": "Ive got a question which i fear if raised it \u201cas\u201d a question on Quora, It would never see the light of day, so I\u2019m \u201canswering\u201d here w hopes someone will help me understand how to \u201cwork\u201d this issue I have - namely, how to get questions posted in what is a clearly a subjective environment of applying a posting criteria to these questions. Below is the gist of my issue and my frustration in getting QUESTIONS posed on Quora. ANSWERS, i have no problems with. They get easily posted. And I\u2019ve submitted many, a number of which have gotten a good response. So, on to my issue: Since I\u2019ve been on Quora I\u2019ve had a few \u201cquestions\u201d get not allowed. But no specifics, just a bunch of pre-written bullets sent to me as to what \u201cmay\u201d be the reason. I believe I have a decent command of the English language so I SMH about that. None of these questions were socially controversial or off color. More frustrating: I notice a LOT of OTHER questions from others on Quora, that are very lengthy and sometimes are \u201cstatements\u201d more than questions. And THEY have \u201cgotten through\u201d (posted)!! So I\u2019m wondering: are there some underlying \u201c \u201cclubs\u201d of reviewers on Quora who allow some to post but not others, based on some hidden and subjective (certainly not objective), criteria?? A recent disconcerting example: I had a \u201cquestion,\u201d an innocuous one, about sports - no foul language and basically, what I thought was, good grammar. I tried and tried but kept getting pushback - a pre-written page sent to me as to what may be \u201cwrong\u201d w my question. But my question could never get posted, even when I edited it 4 it 5 times to rephrase it but still KEEP TO my damn question. Then, out of the blue, my question got edited by whomever in the \u201cQuestion Posing Police\u201d and It POSTED (which I soon took down \u2026 hey, it\u2019s MY question!!)!!! No one contacted me or ASKED me if THEIR \u201cinterpretation\u201d of MY OWN question was ok. Whaaat?? Seems a very \u201cWhite House\u201d kind of jazz is going on, like what they do w the CDC.

            "answer_text": "One simple way to ask great question is to ask an honest question for which you are seeking an answer. Some points to remember while writing the question: Has the question been already answered? This you can find when you draft your question and Quora suggests with possible similar questions. If you find a question similar to yours, you can go to the answers of that question. If you are not satisfied with any of the answers, you can write a new question emphasizing on what is lacking.From similar questions you will come to know people who have answered that question and who has understanding or expertise on the subject of your question. This information is very useful because with that you can direct your question to the person who had already answered similar question and there are more chances of your question receiving more answers.Give relevant background and precise information which would help someone understand what you are looking for and answer to the best of their abilities. Pictures and links help sometimes.Adhere to Quota's Be Nice Be Respectful and sensitive to your audience in your questions, and you will put a great question.Be genuine and avoid trolling questions and you will add much value to the platform through your questions.",

            "answer_text": "Look, this is certainly not the way. Being \u2018amazingly good\u2019 at asking questions has absolutely no value in Quora. It can only help yourself with the questions you have. But there are already a multitude of ways to get your questions answered: GoogleBooks (visit a library)Other people around youI would say the best questions for Quora are the ones where this method just won\u2019t work, so you need more outside people: when the topic is obscurewhen it\u2019s very personal for you, and you look for someone in the same situationwhen you really need an expert to answerwhen you are interested in a wide perspective from lots of people (hope the question gets some traction there)One more thing: Quora is not Facebook, and upvotes are stupid. This is not high school. A \u201cTop Writer\u201d is not more knowledgeable than all others, it\u2019s just someone whose answers people enjoy reading. That doesn\u2019t make them true. A lot of writers get sucked into an upvote game, where the answer deteriorates because it starts following a certain style, or strategy. Even worse, a lot of \u2018answers\u2019 don\u2019t actually answer the question, and instead sit there to evoke emotion in the reader, in order to provide serotonin to the reader\u2019s brain, like a cheap drug dealer on a street corner, using unnecessarily heavy metaphors.

            "answer_text": " Life is full of questions. Questions, for some of which we are able to find answers, and for some we are simply unable to. You want to know when is the next flight to Paris. But you are asking at airport\u2019s help desk about all the flights going to France. In such a case, you cannot expect to get the correct answer. Can you? Maybe this is the reason in life sometimes we are unable to find answers as we are asking the wrong questions. Simplify the way you manage your projects and teams. Switch to ProofHub. That\u2019s why they say asking question is not important. It\u2019s important to ask the right question. And just like everything else you can make it a habit to ask the right questions by practice. How can you do that? Here are some tips that might help - Understand the problem first  You cannot use a key to unlock the door as long as you know the right lock where it fits in. same is the case with solution. You can never reach to a solution unless you understand the problem first. To ask the right question, you must first ask yourself whether the problem is clear to you or not? That\u2019s what they call as probing in tele-calling industry. The tele-callers are trained on how to ask the right questions i.e. how to probe. And, the first step in doing that is to rephrase the problem told by the caller. And, then begin with the probing. Probing narrows down all the possible wrong directions in which you might head before getting to the real problem. This can save you from not just hassle, but a lot of time wastage as well. Put yourself in other person\u2019s shoes  I\u2019m a big fan of the movie series Pirates of Caribbean. And an even bigger fan of Captain Jack Sparrow. Whenever someone asks me how am I able to handle problems at office so well I refer them to this quote by Jack Sparrow in the movie - \u2018The problem is not the problem, it\u2019s your attitude about the problem.\u2019 Continue Reading Here\u2026 ",

Do some research before you ask, get a general understanding of the realm you are interested in.Think about your goal, what do you want answered within that question?Spell check and check for syntax etc. Sometimes I have to mind read what the quoran is trying to ask me.Make it short and sweet, if there are add on\u2019s that you need to add like an image or something that you need explaining add it.

First the length of a question has been increased. This is both good and bad as I see it. Good in that you can include comments within the question. Bad in that you end up with huge question, with multiple comments inside the question. First, word you question as simply as you can. Keeping enough detail that the author answering is not guessing what you are asking. Keep the number of question to a minimum. Write another question and reference other questions. Using comments and then putting a question mark at the end makes processing these questions annoying. A comments section has been added to each questions. This is an excellent place to add details. If the details are important to the context of a question try adding a See Comments to the question. Questions are the property of all Quoran. How well you write them will reflect well on how the question is treated and how good an answer you get. How a question get answered is up to the author. Vague questions get all sorts of answers. Last, if it is another question about how long is a normal penis and variation on this question, the answer has been written long ago. Beside, there is nothing you can do about it. Use the Quora\u2019s search or Google to research the answer to your question. Exploration this way can lead to interesting treasures. Don\u2019t be lazy. Asking a question that has already been asked won\u2019t get you an answer if the authors don't see any merit in the question. Use the site with courtesy and respect. Remember, Be nice.

            "answer_text": "Having reviewed a lot of Quora questions, there are some words and phrases that I've found are frequently indicative of a poor question.  Perhaps the most frequent flaw in questions is asking a closed or poll question (which is contrary to policy, viz. Are poll and survey questions allowed on Quora?), rather than a more open question. Frequently offending words which suggest a closed question include: Is ... ? Does / Do ... ?Should ... ?Can ... ?Will ... ?All of the above questions can be answered with Yes or No, and thus are closed questions and less likely to provide insights than a more open question. Try to think whether you can replace such words with better interrogatives, such as: Why ... ?What ... ?How ... ?If you're having difficulty rephrasing to remove the offending interrogative, feel free to post your question to Need help wording a Quora question?, and I'm sure some other users will be happy to assist. Vague or unclear adjectives Questions should include some criteria that allow readers to judge whether an answer is useful, and another common error is using vague adjectives that can be entirely different depending on the perspective of the person who asked. bestgoodgreatfunAll of these words can have very different meanings to different people and in different contexts. Think about which property you're most interested in, instead: accuracymaterial qualityspeedaestheticscostdurabilityvaluereliabilityFor example, \"What is the best computer for a student?\" is somewhat meaningless, without knowing whether that student is studying programming, architecture, or liberal arts, what their budget is, whether they need a laptop that they can take to university every day, whether they need a particular OS, etc. Whereas \"Which sub-$1,000 Windows laptop would you recommend for daily use of an architecture student in June 2013?\" is far more likely to elicit relevant advice. Grammatically correct \"How to ...\" e.g. \"How to ride a bike?\" This form of question is reasonably common, partly perhaps because this might be how people ask questions of a search engine, but also because this is considered acceptable colloquial use in some countries (notably India). It doesn't, however, conform with conventional English rules of grammar and is best avoided.  A better way to phrase such a question is: \"What is the fastest way to learn to ride a bike?\" ",

            "answer_text": "Brevity, simplicity, clarity: Ask your question simply, clearly, and briefly so it\u2019s easy to read through and more useful for the next researcher that asks a similar question. Edit your question before hitting the \u201cSubmit\u201d button. Look for a way to shorten sentences, remove phrases or a even few words while preserving the question. Do this before hitting \u201cSubmit.\u201d Most people are strapped for time and effort, so don\u2019t test their resolve to help you. Minimize the barriers to coming to grips with the topic. Relevance, hot topic: People like answering a hot topic, partly because a lot of eyes will be on their answer. Something apropos and relevant to recent developments in the larger world/mediasphere will attract attention and recognition and reward the answerer for their efforts. Specificity: the question should be specific enough that the answerer can do a good job of answering without being forced to make sweeping generalizations about the situation. Many contribute answers because they want to add high-quality, relevant, reliable knowledge to the greater body of crappy, unreliable, biased information found elsewhere on the internet, a kind of pay-it-forward for a better world ideal. Comments and links provide background: use the question\u2019s comments section (the speech balloon icon under the question headline to provide further background, internet links to comparable discussions. This will help to weed out the massive number of ways a question could be interpreted. Try to be brief, but there is also an opportunity here to flesh things out. Craft in some RELEVANT interest: Write the question and especially the background so it is as interesting and useful as possible. A brief RELEVANT story or description of your situation relating to the question may help. Letting some suspense or mystery into the details may make the question more compelling, but don\u2019t let these details stray off topic too far or make it more difficult to answer. Add keywords: think about how someone else might research a similar question. Keep the question headline simple, but after hitting \u201csubmit\u201d you can still add and remove relevant keywords above the Question headline (click the pencil icon). you can also work search terms into your comments, eg how would machine learning and 2018 manufacturing automation inform this question? Challenge and depth: Put a little careful thought into your question before hitting \u201cSubmit.\u201d Would a person smarter than yourself be tempted to ask or answer this? Ask yourself if someone out there will find it fun or interesting to puzzle through this problem to a satisfactory conclusion. Some questions will make the answerer appear intelligent, so there is a reward for going to the effort. Specify what kind of answers would be most and least useful: speculate on the likely ulterior motives for answering. People (and other primates) have the desire or need to provide comfort, to encourage you to look optimistically at a problem, to entertain, inspire, correct an injustice, grab attention, establish intellectual authority, defend their political views, boast, cover their ass, take the piss, lie, or flog their software startup. A question providing different motives for responding might give your question more attention while obscuring the high-quality accurate answers. Use the comments section to indicate what kind of answer you\u2019re looking for, and also which varieties you want to avoid. Evergreen: It can help to prime the question for evergreen answers, ie answers that are likely to remain useful over the long term, over the entire course of a person\u2019s life. Some people will get more satisfaction from answering this kind of question instead of minutiae or the flavour of the month. Avoid leading questions: Don\u2019t word your question to encourage a leading answer, or a biased reply. As stated above, many people here have a genuine desire to help people by providing accurate information and good advice. IMPORTANT: Request answers from people with a past history: after you hit \u201cSubmit,\u201d the \u201cRequest\u201d icon under the question headlines will allows you to search for answerers that might have been troubled by the same question. Ask yourself who would be strongly motivated to answer a given question because they have a history with it: they have struggled with the same issue or been plagued with a similar curiosity in the past. Wanting to share a solution to a problem you encountered is one of the most basic empathic motivations that people share. ",

Here\u2019s how I do it: I write all questions in a document file.I review the entire file every morning.I move the best questions to the top of the file. I also edit them in any way I can: shortening them, catching typos and mistakes, making them clearer, etc.I avoid posting any question the day I write it (once in a while I make an exception). It\u2019s better to sleep on new questions, and see them with a fresh eye in the morning.I move the weakest questions to the bottom of the file. They are probably too weak to ever ask, but they might give me ideas for better questions.When the file approaches five pages in length, I delete the last page. It\u2019s all junk at that point.Each day, I post the best questions from the top of the file. I work my way down until I can detect a reduced quality, and stop.Evidence that this is good advice: If you are in the partner program, you are given 25 answer requests per question. If your questions don\u2019t get answers, they are poor questions, and Quora lowers you allowance of answer requests per question. I\u2019ve always been at 25, suggesting I am asking quality questions. Many other people report being at lower levels. Last weekend, I did an experiment. I thought maybe I was being too hard on myself regarding question quality, and decided to ask a series of questions outside my expertise (psychology). I asked questions about math, economics, programming, money, etc. I\u2019m not ignorant of these topics, but I\u2019m definitely no expert. They did poorly, and my answer request allowance dropped to 16. Obviously, I am not great at writing questions outside my areas of expertise, because most of them didn\u2019t get any answers. Reviewing them now, I can see that many of them were weak or boring. Rule of thumb: I didn\u2019t care much about the questions, which is a giveaway that others won\u2019t either. Obviously, I want my request allowance to return to 25, so I am stepping back for a few days. I am giving my creativity a rest, so that I will come back with a series of strong questions that will be well-received. I am dumping all the questions in my document file that have been kicking around for more than a week\u2014around 150\u2013200 questions. When we ask bad questions, we are wasting our time. We are annoying people. We are lowering the quality of Quora. We won\u2019t make more than a few pennies. A good question writer makes money. A person who spends a lot of time posting both good and bad questions is cutting their hourly earnings dramatically. One last note: Most of the questions on my profile are from the time before I learned to post only my best questions. Partners have the option of keeping their questions off their profile, which I do. I speak a few languages, and I want to have time to translate my questions before someone else does. I often like to consider whether a particular question will be well-received by other cultures, before flinging it at them. The Quora platforms in different languages have definite preferences for the kinds of questions they\u2019ll answer. Also, I write mostly psychology questions. It\u2019s particularly easy to write bad questions about psychology, if you don\u2019t know much about it. I am bombarded with such questions. Thanks for the question. I hope that this information will reduce the amount of very weak questions that are being posted. Absolutely everybody writes good and bad questions. The trick is not to post the bad ones.

I also edit them in any way I can: shortening them, catching typos and mistakes, making them clearer, etc.I avoid posting any question the day I write it (once in a while I make an exception).I move the weakest questions to the bottom of the file. They are probably too weak to ever ask, but they might give me ideas for better questions.When the file approaches five pages in length, I delete the last page. It\u2019s all junk at that point.Each day, I post the best questions from the top of the file. I work my way down until I can detect a reduced quality, and stop.",

Try the built in search first. But failing that, become a \"power user\" and try a Google search with the \"site:\" operator. For example, searching Quora for all Questions, Answers and Posts about Ghosts, enter the following in the Google Search box: site:Quora.com Ghosts If you find a question that asks what you want to know, but does not have adequate answers, you might choose to Re-Ask, by hitting the Re-Ask link. Do this instead of asking a new question. On the other hand, if no existing Question really gets it right, then add a new one. How? Click blue button to Ask Question (top right). Enter question and press Next. Correct grammar or punctuation as needed.See if the recommended questions address your concern, and click on them if so. Best to use Middle Mouse Button to open several in new tabs. If no other question does it for you, fill in: Write Question Details and click on blue button My Question is New. (Please add details!)Then add appropriate Topics. Had you searched, you may have found these: How do I add a new question to Quora? or How do I ask a question on Quora? or How can I ask questions more effectively? ",

Apologies if I sounded rude. You do have quora's own data, it suggestes what topics need more question. You need to write questions that's usually on everyone's mind but they don't ask. One of my most popular question was why we can't send a satellite to a black hole to take pictures of it. This was way before the recent images came out. I was a bit surprised, my question came out of my interest in astrophysics, but there are several others who had the same thing on their mind. So it's all about asking questions that usually people would like to ask. What I have also realised is that, how popular someone is. The more popular you are on quora, the more interest people show towards whatever question you might have wrote. ",

This was immediately merged which means it was at least as good as an existing one that already started to receive answers. The site has attention and engagement covered by virtue of its popularity. It recently expanded into Spaces to capture the social network and blog crowds as internet use grows globally. The strategy is to get replies or comments. Requests to answer heighten chances. Then it is a matter of finding sources or letting the app rank them by default. For any topic, a review of associated content is going to reveal confusion or unknowns so those immediately invite critical inquiries. What is most relevant socially is up to interpretation at the time. That is similar to other forms of literature or media so there may be some overlap at the boundaries of each form. The question may also be posed to search engines and end up here anyway. Problem-solving often triggers information gathering which may look into data collection and then sift that into knowledge to present answers. Most users opt to ask again and cross their fingers that it will be seen by the right experts or that the bots have their preferences down. Curation is up to the user base who may be sharing reference posts to others. Questions are used to get to the next stage of development for the individual, group, or society from the Socratic method to testing machine intelligence. They prompt or prime deeper and wider viewpoints. All social, all good. See: Papers on Questioning ",

If you really want to ask some., Try to be more specific.Don't try questions starting with Why, What, who or when. EtcDon't try asking simple question, try elaborating your question.Check whether similar or such questions have been in Quora before.Try to merge two or more parts into one.Don't try something that makes the reader hurt intentionally or howsoever.Try adding a picture that could probably explain what you are looking for.Hope it helps.

It\u2019s just that I\u2019m a researcher by training, and there are so many other sources for answers. If I have a physics question, I go to friends who are physicists; if I have medical questions, I go to my various doctors; if I have questions about language, geology, astronomy, biology, etc., I seek out experts in those fields or read their books (how weird is that?).
