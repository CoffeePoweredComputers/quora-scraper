You must study AND practice, and endeavor to get better and instill new habits. You need to read books on the craft and purposefully try new and better techniques. You need instruction to know what you are doing wrong and how you can fix those mistakes and get better. So read books. Take classes. Learn and then practice. That\u2019s how you improve as a writer. Beginning writers are in a state of unconscious incompetence. They don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know. Add some instruction, and they enter conscious incompetence\u2014they learn what they don\u2019t know. After some practice and more instruction, they enter conscious competence. They are doing things right, but they have to think about it. Finally, they enter unconscious competence\u2014they do things the right way without having to think about it. These are the four stages of competence in ANY field, and professionals go through all of them. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "If I were to write everyday, would I significantly improve my writing skills? Grammatically speaking, I believe my writing skills have improved some. But it\u2019s not like I have all my writing sources and research material set in front of me, while I research how to sentence structure here. I just write..reread, and if it makes sense to me, then I post. I put periods and commas where I think they should go! Lol! Jk sometimes.. In kindergarten is where it all began for me;) Learning my alphabets led to forming words, then attaching more words.. forming sentences. Sound too simple? I am not trying to insult anyone\u2019s intelligence, but, had I stopped there and quit learning, I\u2019m sure my skills would have ended there as well. As I progressed through school, I developed skills on how to write book reports and manuscripts using certain formats. I took a Business English class in college that taught me how to use different format styles for business-style writing, such as, memos and essays. This was a tedious class and the papers I wrote, that I thought looked great, came back to me all red-check marked up! When writing academic documents, medical journals, scholarly journal articles, books and even essays, the most commonly used writing format, uses APA writing style. The APA, American Psychological Association, was originated by a group of professionals in 1929, they set rules and guidelines in place unifying writing order, as well as, allowing for a systematic approach for the citing of references, as a way to increase the ease of reading comprehension*. This appears to be the most popular editorial style used today. However, more than improving my writing skills, which I believe, are far from perfect and I\u2019m sure I\u2019d still receive some red check marks\u2026is that, writing for me, has expanded or broadened upon several other areas of greater importance. Namely, it has enhanced my memory skills. It has served in a social quality in my writing structure and content. It provides me an introspective view into self examination. Writing is a great tool to get in tune with one\u2019s self. It has forced me to work through areas of intellection, that otherwise, if not pressured to write down, I would likely have forgotten or maybe, not given the thought or understanding a place of importance. Most of all, as a writer addressing a question or concern, my goal here in serving as a contributor, is to offer some insight or \u201cfood for thought\u201d, through providing generically designed suggestions to light-hearted questions. My intention is not to control nor sway an individual, but offer another way a situation can be viewed or handled, orrr..just give some good old-fashioned advice and referrals. What good is a question if it doesn\u2019t harbor a response infused with suggestions or information, other than a waste of time. Writing for Quora isn\u2019t the same as writing for my Business English class. I might get sent to the collapsed farm, but my GPA won\u2019t be affected! There are people on Quora that choose to remain on the sidelines and are happy doing just that\u2026 reading and some asking questions! There are people here on Quora that have a desire to write, but their fear of writing may be holding them back. I remember how my nerves tingled with my first few writings; esp, just before hitting that submit. Oh wow! So stepping out on the limb of fear factor, I have to tell you, the more your write, the better it gets. It really does become easier. Best to your writing! **What is APA Style? ",
