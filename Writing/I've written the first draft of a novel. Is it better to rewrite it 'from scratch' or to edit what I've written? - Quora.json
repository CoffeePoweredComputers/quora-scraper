            "answer_text": "The draft should never be considered a finishing point but only a start to work from. It would be rather radical to completely destroy the draft and start again from scratch but in the process of going through several drafting stages by the time you get to the completed work you could easily see a vast difference between the started draft and the completed final edit. For example depending on the flow of the novel you might find a beautifully written chapter that just simply does not fit into this particular novel, instead of discarding completely place it in your \u201cto be used for future novels\u201d drawer. To me writing is like music, the trumpet solo sounds wonderful but if the story is about strings then that trumpet solo needs to go. Thank you for the question. ",

It\u2019s rare that, for beginner writers, the first draft will consist of sections that remain untouched. Where you decide to place your alterations (new or old document) isn\u2019t really as important as how well you make your improvements. It really comes down to whether you want to preserve your first draft. And this becomes a moot point because you should be making backups as you progress. If you\u2019re asking this question, I would assume that you\u2019ve spent a good amount of time writing what could be your first novel. This leads me to believe that you\u2019ve already put a lot of time and attention to your first \u2018draft\u2019.. which means it may not be entirely \u2018draft-like\u2019. I\u2019d recommend editing what you\u2019ve already got. ",

The original draft is short and is still in my head. This works fine for short fiction. For my novel, I would not even consider setting the first draft aside and starting over. The process already takes a great deal of time and this would only add to that. But when it comes time for me to rewrite, I will not consider anything in my first draft to be sacred. That goes for individual words as well as plot and character development. ",

If your novel is a complete mess but there are some nuggets of great writing within, I say start over from scratch, this time trying to write more tightly. ",
