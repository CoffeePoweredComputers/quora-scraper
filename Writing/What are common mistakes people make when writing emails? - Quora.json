            "answer_text": "There is quite a lot of email mistakes, but here are 10 most frequent in professional emailing- 1. Sending your email to a wrong person Before sending a professional email, especially one with confidential information, ensure that the email is being sent to the correct recipient or recipients of the information you are communicating. 2. Using unclear subject lines People make a big mistake not keeping in mind that it is an important part of the email. Your subject line should be both clear and attractive.  3. Sending generic messages You are writing to a real person, so make it look human and authentic. Write an email without generic and nonpersonal messages. 4. Not segmenting and customizing your template Do not write the same message to everyone. You need to focus on quality rather than quantity. Yes, you can use some templates but you should change them for each recipient, it will reward you at the end (more clicks and replies). 5. Writing too long emails and too long sentences Consider how your message will come across to a recipient and try to cut the excess. When you have the opportunity to keep it concise and snappy, do it. 6. Not double-checking your grammar/spelling Proofread your emails, especially if the message is going to a very important person. 7. Not using email signature No email signature often means no trust. Write your full name and your contact details or such of your registered business. Include a photo of yourself to make your email look more personal or a company logo to make it look recognizable.  8. Using jargon or emoji in your email Things like jargon or emoji can make you look incompetent and not serious in the eyes of your recipient. Try to avoid it. ",

            "answer_text": "The most common mistake is making it about yourself. Too often, you begin an email with I. But it\u2019s not about you. You\u2019re writing to someone else, so make the email about them. Why should they care? Ask yourself how to frame the message so that someone else wants to read it. Avoid I. Are you writing a cover letter for a job? Consider what the recipients need, and address that. It\u2019s an interesting exercise to see if you can write an entire message without using I. You\u2019ll be surprised how easy it is. After all, if the message is all about yourself, there\u2019s no point in sending it. That\u2019s an essay, not a communication. ",
