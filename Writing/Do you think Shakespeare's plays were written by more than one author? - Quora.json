            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been hearing these kinds of comments since studying graduate English in the 1970\u2019s. Yes, there is internal textual evidence that Shakespeare had collaborators for some plays. The theory that DeVere wrote these plays has been around forever - also that Francis Bacon wrote them, which frankly makes more sense to me in terms of style and subject. I take all of them with a grain of salt for two reasons: first, these theories are based on the prejudice that Shakespeare must have been illiterate, despite the existence of English Common Schools (not to mention private tutors). To understand his social background and education, I suggest you read Shakespeare of London by American scholar Marchette Chute. She meticulously examined 16th century documented sources for her book. Her conclusions are drawn from these sources. It\u2019s always puzzled me how Shakespeare could have been the heir of a successful business man, expected to take over his father\u2019s business, and be illiterate. If he couldn\u2019t read enough to keep account records straight, the business would have died in months. John Shakespeare wanted his son to be a gentleman with the necessary education to rise in the world - if I recall correctly, he even purchased a coat of arms. Chute discusses in detail the curriculum for the local school Shakespeare attended. Read her book and make up your own mind. But I have another specific reason: the genius of Shakespeare meant that he didn\u2019t care about consistency of style. Some of his writing is just plain bad - just as some of Beethoven\u2019s brass orchestration leaves much to be desired. Genius often doesn\u2019t worry about consistency. If you can, consult The Energies of Art by Jacque Barzun, his essay \u201cFrom The Shakespeare File\u201d. Barzun runs through comments on Shakespeare over the centuries and quotes how often Shakespeare\u2019s writing was regarded as just plain bad: \u201crant, doggerel, tedious writing, crude horseplay, comic bores, hackneyed situations\u201d and so on. Samuel Johnson couldn\u2019t stand much of his writing. G.K. Chesterton loved his \u201cgusto\u201d but from the same period, George Bernard Shaw said he would like to dig him up just so he could thrown stones at him. And Tolstoy called his reputation as a playwright a \u201ccollective hallucination.\u201d I personally cannot imagine the rather ascetic Earl DeVere being associated with the frequent bad writing in Shakespeare\u2019s plays. I also can\u2019t imagine him actually part of the process of a working theater, especially with Richard Burbage and crew. They were as rowdy as it gets. But read Chute\u2019s book and the essay - it\u2019s fun and a great eye opener. ",

All of the alternate theories\u2014Bacon, Oxford, and the rest\u2014founder on three important points. First, there is the evidence of the dedicatory material in the First Folio and Ben Jonson\u2019s personal comments on Shakespeare. Second, there is the corrosive snobbery that suggests that Shakespeare had to have been a university man, when his education at the Stratford grammar school was quite sufficient, since it included classical languages\u2014and genius does not know social distinctions. Also, Shakespeare is not a particularly learned writer, compared to someone like Spenser or Jonson. The third is a logical one\u2014first, who would have benefited from so elaborate a charade, and how could it have been kept secret? There are many literary hoaxes, and all of them were uncovered quite quickly. The only comparable secret I can think of is the details of the Eleusinian mysteries, and even there were know more than a little. The laternate theories do not stand up to logic and common sense\u2014or scholarship. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Every time a play by Shakespeare is read or seen it is co-written by the reader or seer. The second reading of anything is a reading of a new work. Try it. You\u2019ll be astonished at what\u2019s \u201cin there\u201d on a second reading. By the twenty fourth reading your own contribution to the original begins to taper off as you find you\u2019ve finally learned how to read. That\u2019s particularly true of Shakespeare; no one, repeat, no one, has fully learned to read Shakespeare; the challenge is enormous. But the way that challenge is fulfilled is to learn to become the reader Shakespeare requires you to be. You can\u2019t be the first person on the moon any more, but you can be the first person to have, in the richest sense of the term, read and understood Shakespeare. ",

            "answer_text": "In some cases, the plays offer an example of what might be called \u201cliterary geology\u201d - since there were layers of edits added later. We don\u2019t know who made the later adjustments, or how often, but we can speculate that they were made to render the plays more accessible to the illiterate audiences at the popular theatres. It\u2019s important to remember that the plays were originally written by DeVere as entertainments for the court of Elizabeth I - highly sophisticated plays for a highly-sophisticated audience. Their author could not be known to the public, since it would be a painful humiliation for him. Therefore they leaked out anonymously - \u201cplays enjoyed by the queen\u201d - but without an author. So, for anyone who wanted to use the material it was \u201cfinders, keepers\u201d and writers associated with the theatre, or even actors themselves, would have the option to add lines, change lines, or leave lines out. The saddest part of this: we do not know what the original \u201croyal\u201d plays sounded like, and - until the successful development of time travel - will never know. ",

            "answer_text": "In a sense, most likely, yes. Bernard Shaw hypothesized - and, I think, with a considerable degree of justification - that Shakespeare went around the streets of London with a notebook in hand, and in it he would jot down any really brilliant and pithy phrases he might overhear from people talking to one another in the streets, shops and public houses: snippets such as \u201ca rose by any other name would smell as sweet\u201d or \u201cTo die, to sleep - to sleep, perchance to dream\u201d; and when he found an appropriate place in any play he was at that time engaged in writing to insert some of those pearls, he did! So basically most of what he did was akin to what we in modern times would call \u201ccopy and paste\u201d gems of the English language from other people\u2019s conversations: and, Shaw surmised, that is also why Shakespeare thought of himself as \u201ca snapper-up of unconsidered trifles\u201d.

These include the three Henry VI plays (with Marlowe and/ or Nashe), Titus Andronicus (Peale), Timon of Athens (Middleton), Pericles (George Wilkins) and Henry VIII, Two Noble Kinsmen and possibly the lost Cardenio (Fletcher). Middleton may also have done revisions of Measure for Measure, All\u2019s Well That Ends Well and Macbeth. Stylometrics is controversial, but co-authorship was quite common in Shakespeare\u2019s time and it is unlikely that he would not have worked with other playwrights from time-to-time ",
