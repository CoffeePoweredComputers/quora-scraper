            "answer_text": "[1/14, 22:09] Dinesh Ramani: Speak a little English every day. The absolute best way to learn any new language is just to speak it. It doesn't matter if you only know five English words or if you're practically fluent -- speaking English with another person is the fastest, most effective method of improving. Don't wait until you \"feel more comfortable\" speaking in English -- you probably won't reach that level for a long time, so push yourself outside of your comfort zone and start speaking English today. You' ll be amazed at how quickly your language skills improve. Find a native English speaker who is willing to spend some time speaking English with you -- you may be able to offer them a language exchange, where they spend 30 minutes speaking English with you and you spend 30 minutes speaking your native language with them. If you live in an English-speaking country, you can practice by starting simple conversations with the people you meet, whether it's saying \"hello\" to a shopkeeper or asking a stranger for directions. [1/14, 22:10] Dinesh Ramani: 2 Work on your pronunciation. Even if you have an acceptable grasp of the English language, with good grammar and an extensive vocabulary, native English speakers may find you very difficult to understand if you don't work on your pronunciation. Correct, clear pronunciation is essential if you really want to improve your level of English. Listen closely to how native English speakers pronounce certain words and sounds and do your best to copy them. Pay particular attention to any sounds that you are unfamiliar with or that do not exist in your native tongue. For example some people have difficulty pronouncing the \"r\" sound, as it does not exist in their native language, while other people have difficulty with certain consonant clusters, such as the \"th\" sound. Be aware that the pronunciation of certain English words varies greatly depending on the part of the world it's spoken in. For example, American English is very different from British English. If you intend to travel to or live in an English-speaking country, this is something you should take into account when learning how to pronounce certain words. [1/14, 22:11] Dinesh Ramani: 3 Expand your vocabulary and use idiomatic phrases. The wider your vocabulary and the more English phrases you learn, the easier speaking English will become. Again, spending time with native English speakers will help you to pick up on common vocabulary and phrases in a natural way. Although reading, watching English TV and listening to the news is also beneficial. Once you have learned a new word or phrase, you should make an effort to use it in a sentence -- this is the best way to commit it to memory. Another easy way to commit new words to memory is to make labels for everyday household items and stick them around your house or apartment. Then every time you use the kettle or look in the mirror, you will see the English word for these items staring back at you. You should also start a notebook of idiomatic phrases that English speakers use all the time. Some examples include \"it's raining cats and dogs\" (raining heavily), to be on \"cloud nine\" (to be very happy) or saying something is a \"piece of cake\" (when something is very easy). Sprinkling these kinds of phrases into your conversation will bring your level of English up several notches. [1/14, 22:12] Dinesh Ramani: includes proper sentence structure and verb conjugation and will generally provide a very structured approach to language learning. Attending a discussion group is a more informal and relaxed way of learning English, where the emphasis is more on communication and relationship building than on speaking \"correct\" English. Speaking English in this setting can help you to become more comfortable with speaking in front of other people. Both of these language-learning settings have their pros and cons, so it's best to do both if you can! [1/14, 22:12] Dinesh Ramani: 5 Carry a dictionary. Carrying an English dictionary with you at all times (whether it's an actual book or a phone app) can be very useful. Having a dictionary means that you will never be stuck for a word. It can save you a lot of embarrassment if you're having a conversation with an English-speaker and forget a word in the middle of the sentence -- all you have to do is take a second to look it up! Aside from saving you awkwardness, looking up the word you need then immediately using it in a sentence will actually help you to commit the new vocabulary to memory. It is also helpful to have a dictionary to peruse throughout the day during private moments, like when you're sitting on the train, waiting to cross the street or just having a cup of coffee. You could learn an extra 20 to 30 English words per day using this technique! As a beginner, you should start with an English dictionary that provides definitions in your native language. However, once your language skills improve, you should switch to using an English-English dictionary, which provides English definitions for English words. [1/14, 22:13] Dinesh Ramani: Listen to English radio or podcasts. One of the best ways to improve your English listening comprehension is to download English-language podcasts or radio apps on your phone or MP3 player. You should then make an effort to listen to the podcasts or radio shows for at least 30 minutes per day. Do it in the gym, on your commute to work, or while you're sitting at your computer. Make an effort to understand what's being said, don't just let the English wash over you. Even if you find it too fast, try to pick out key words and phrases to get a general idea of what the conversation is about. If you can, make a note of any words or phrases that you don't understand and look up the translation afterwards. Then listen to the podcast or show again to hear the new words or phrases in context.

            "answer_text": "How Can I Improve my English Skill? Quora has thousands of such questions and still, they are asked nearly daily. Why? Because it is not easy to improve English skills for adults. When you were a child you could learn any foreign language fast and easy because you were learning subconsciously. Adults learn English consciously by trying to memorize the information about the language. Adults can't reproduce the processes which children use when learning the first and second and third language. All leading language learning companies use translation-based tools promising learners that they will memorize vocabulary and phrases with ease. However, when we analyze these tools we understand that it is very hard to remember bilingual information because each language learned by adults and spoken fluently has its own center in the brain located at a certain distance from the native language center. Another negative impact of using the native language in creating the second language system: adults continue thinking in the native language and try to speak in English. This is extremely difficult; most adults come to the wrong conclusion that they are language-incapable. All adults are capable to learn a second language; to achieve this objective easily; they need to use a different approach. A small proportion of adults (less than 5%) somehow (the mechanism is unknown) preserve the ability to visualize both written and spoken words. This numerically insignificant category of people preserves the child\u2019s ability to learn a new language without reverting to mother-tongue translation. Natural linguists come from this small category of people, and they are absolutely unaware of the cross-translation problem or of \u201cthe tyranny of the mother tongue\u201d which most of their students face. Here is the answer to your question: stop learning and start training English skills You may achieve your objective by developing a new habit of performing three actions at the same time: reading, listening and speaking simultaneously with the speaker. This three-action activity presents the brain with a challenging workload and automatically stops cross-translation into the mother tongue. When cross-translation is stopped, a foreign language center is formed in the brain of an adult because old symbols which were previously wired together with the words of the native language are now re-wired to the words in a second language. Two Systems of the Mind: System One and System Two To explain why an adult can\u2019t learn a foreign language by rote memorization using bilingual information, I need to remind you about two systems of the mind, introduced by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman. We think slow and fast because the mind has two different systems. System One operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System Two allocates attention to the effortful mental activity and therefore is slow. For example, rote memorization belongs to System Two, whereas expression of our feelings and thoughts, i.e. speech, belongs to System One. Subconscious Training Language Skills Belongs To System One If you learn a foreign language with the objective of communicating in it, you need to develop it as System One. That is why the conventional methods of learning a foreign language, which belongs to rote memorization, should be replaced by subconscious training language skills. Training is the best alternative for adults since it belongs to System One. Driving a car, figure skating, playing a musical instrument, martial arts skills or speaking a foreign language \u2013 all of these skills are trained as System One. During the training of all these skills, the brain finds and records the patterns that it can perform without conscious effort and with minimal attention, i.e. effortlessly. I want to stress that children use System One in the acquisition of their first or second language whereas adults use System Two. So, to stop struggling with the acquisition of a second language you should stop using the conventional methods of conscious learning and start using the subconscious training language skills that belong to the System One of the mind. Conscious learning is characterized by the appalling forgetting curve whereas subconscious training is stress-free and has no forgetting curve. ",
