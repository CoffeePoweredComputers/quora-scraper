            "answer_text": "You\u2019ll find a good method(s) for providing critique or feedback on a poem on Scribophile. That method is as good for summarising a poem. You might have to register in order to find the information under something like hints and tips on how the site works - a little effort that should prove valuable, if you\u2019re serious as regards intent. There are lots of aspects to a poem you can consider when writing a summary. Some of the technical aspects involve form or lack of it as in free verse you might say, stanzas, line length, white space, line endings, enjambment, rhyme or the lack of it (at line ends or mid-line rhyme, for example), meter, etc. Looking at all of those things, you should ask yourself, why did the poet choose to use this, that or the other device. Other things to look at are \u2018voice\u2019, whether the narrator, if there is one, is first or third person, for example, and elements such as the characters, things, images, metaphors, similes, etc., you can detect in the poem. In each case, write down what you think or can deduce about why the poet chose to use each literary device you have identified. Then there are things like the first line; does it make you read on, for example, and if not, or if so, why is that, is what you should be asking when looking to summarise. The same goes for the rest of the poem. Ask yourself what the poem says to you; what it\u2019s telling you or what you make of it; how it feels when you read it out loud, why did the poet favour a particular word over others he or she could have used - anything on those lines. Uses Kipling\u2019s \u201cwho, why, what, when, where and how\u201d and you won\u2019t go far wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, depending on what your professor asks for, there are three aspects of poetry that might need to be summarized: Describe the type, form, or style of the poem: ballad, epic, haiku, free verse, etc. Describe the format of lines \u2014 rhyming/unrhyming, type of meter, length, refrain, stanzas, etc.Explain the literary (poetic) techniques used to create the mood or \u2018feeling\u2019 of the poem \u2014 rhythm, word choice (sound of the words), metaphor, alliteration, personification, imagery, allusion, etc.Interpretation of the actual verse (the words/lyrics). What meaning and feeling does the poem impart? What is the message (hope, despair, longing, fear, admiration, beauty/awe, etc.) How does the poet use special words, rhymes, images to convey the meaning? Does one thing represent another?In the poem segment below, you can almost hear the \u2018roar\u2019 and see the \u2018anger\u2019 of the coming sea storm. The repeated \u2018s\u2019 sounds (alliteration) create the sound pattern\u2026 and the rich words \u2018paint an image\u2019 of the ravaging winds and rain. The lines are \u2018heavy\u2019 with words that represent the weight and surge of things to come. Hatteras Calling by Conrad Aiken Southeast, and storm, and every weathervane shivers and moans upon its dripping pin, ragged on chimneys the cloud whips, the rain howls at the flues and windows to get in, the golden rooster claps his golden wings and from the Baptist Chapel shrieks no more, the golden arrow in the southeast sings and hears on the roof the Atlantic Ocean roar.
