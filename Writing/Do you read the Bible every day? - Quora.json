            "answer_text": "I should read the Bible every day, especially that I am serving Him for years, and at the moment I am serving Him full time. This past two weeks, I have been reading a lot of Scriptures every day, for its continuous days. However, prior to that, a month ago and some months ago, I have been only reading it a bit, maybe once or twice a week. And it was a disaster. As a believer I would attest with all my heart that it is really God's Word, by that I mean the only God's Word. We are so blessed that the Only Creator and Lover of mankind has left for us His very own words! But very few people appreciate that. In fact many people doubt that the Bible really is God's Word. Let me state some reasons why the Bible is God's Word and that there is no other: First, the Bible is Alive, it changes lives. I mean, countless lives. Reading and applying it in everyday life provides strength to the weak, wisdom to the confused, salvation to the lost, and healing to the sick. No other psychology or self-help books can do this. Second, the Bible is Reliable, its history record is perfect. Credible historians, Christian or not have testified again and again that the Biblical Record of human history is accurate and without any error. Third, the Bible is Prophetic, its prophecies were fulfilled and are being fulfilled. The Bible contains more than three hundred prophecies regarding the Messiah Jesus Christ alone, and all of them were fulfilled, and that is a miracle in itself. And there are many other prophecies concerning different areas, which were fulfilled. Many still are to be fulfilled concerning the end times. Fourth, the Bible is Harmonious, its sixty-six books do not conflict. The Bible is written in a span of more than fifteen hundred years by more than forty authors, signifying that it has One Ultimate Author as the books contain a unified message of God's Glory and Man's Redemption without any conflict. Fifth, the Bible is Indestructible, countless attempts to destroy it failed. Kings, Emperors, Politicians, nations, and Satan himself tried to destroy it but they all failed miserably. The Bible is still the best-selling book of all time. Now, let me state my personal reasons why I try my best to read the Bible everyday: First, I get to know God better thru the reading of the Bible. This is maybe my most important reason. Bible reading cause me to know my God and Savior more. It draws me closer to Him, and it brings intimacy to our relationship. Deuteronomy 31:12 (KJV) Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law 1 John 1:3 (KJV) That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. Second, it guides me. If I want to ask God about anything in life I have two basic options, prayer and Bible reading. God's wisdom and counsel are found in the Bible. Proverbs 4:4-6 (KJV) He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live. Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee. James 1:5 (KJV) If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. Third, it sanctifies me. The Bible shows my errors, and tells me the right ways in all things. It provides detailed instructions on the direction to go towards holiness. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 (KJV) All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect Psalms 119:9 (KJV) Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. Fourth, it strengthens my faith. The Bible feeds my soul in my daily walk in life as a Christian. I do not rely on emotions and feelings, but in the Biblical Faith in my walk in life. Romans 10:8 (KJV) But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; Romans 10:17 (KJV) So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Fifth, the Bible is the best Christian Worker Handbook. Thru the Bible I get to know how to serve God in the most God-glorifying way. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 (KJV) All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. 2 Timothy 2:15 (KJV) Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. I will age and God willing attain an old age but my need for the Bible well never cease for the Word stands forever. Psalms 119:89 (KJV) For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven. ",

            "answer_text": "No. I wish I could say that I do, but it\u2019s more like when I remember to do it. I also don\u2019t floss every day. I brush my teeth every day and I pray every day, though! Flossing and bible study are \u201cextra\u201d right now in my life. I hope to someday have those habits down but for me, personally, I am not really great with healthy habits and it\u2019s a slow process for me building them. I am recovering from a deep and several years-long depression so even keeping up with housework and personal hygiene has suffered. Only recently have I been consistent in my daily routine, and only in some areas. I still struggle with establishing consistency in other areas. I think the Lord knows me and my struggles and I pray daily for mercy and just keep trying. As Brene Brown says, if you enter the arena you WILL fail, but failure isn\u2019t permanent! So I keep getting knocked down but I also keep getting back up. I try to learn from my failures and be kind to myself and others in the process. A good friend of mine from when I was a teacher reminded me of God\u2019s grace. He is patient and merciful and long suffering. So I have to be, too. And if it isn\u2019t clear why I would want to read the Bible every day, it\u2019s similar to why I would want to floss my teeth, exercise, bathe, eat, and so on. Caring for my spiritual health is as important as caring for my physical health. And just like I dread going to the gym but am always glad I did, I don\u2019t always feel like reading my scriptures but I am always glad I did when I do. ",

            "answer_text": "My wife and I are working through the Bible. We\u2019ve been married for 7-and-a-half years (and together longer than that). Since I\u2019ve known her we\u2019ve read through the entire New Testament about 1-and-a-half times, the book of Job (the first book of the Bible we read together), the 12 minor prophets and others. But now we\u2019re slowly tackling the whole of Scripture. We read a chapter a day between 4 - 6 days a week. If we consistently read a chapter a day we would finish is just over three years. At our current rate we\u2019re probably going to take closer on 5 years, which is great. If we didn\u2019t start now and stick to it, in 5 years we wouldn\u2019t have finished the Bible. It is a good discipline to read the Bible daily. I made my way through it more when I had an audio Bible. I lost it in a crash of hardware and software. Anyway get going. 15 minutes of personal reading a day could mean you finish the Bible in one year. And doing it once doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re finished. The Bible is definitely a book that can be read and reread. I posit it\u2019s the Book with the most re-reading inherent to it. ",

It\u2019s my power source. How food is to one, reading the word of God is to me. The bible says Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds. out of the mouth of God.' Mathew 4:4 Here recently i find myself more fuller. I\u2019ve taken away the bad eating habits and I've actually started to read my bible more. I find myself fuller, and satisfied! I literally some days have to make myself eat because I feel so full.(Being spiritually feed) The more you study the word of God, the more you pursue a relationship with him the more your hunger and thirst becomes to receive the word of God. Try it! Start a challenge. Start a 14 day no social media challenge and for two weeks find a book in the bible to set aside and just read. Take notes, highlight, really meditate studying God words and watch what he does! God bless! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I read the Bible every day. I have read the Sacred Bible more than 40 times. I cannot always maintain my schedule but I try to cover 5 chapters daily (if I cannot on rare occasions just one chapter suffices). When I reach the Book of Psalms I increase my reading to 10 chapters since most psalms are very brief; for instance, the 117th Psalm contains only two verses. In this way I usually complete the reading of the entire Bible in one year. I am assisted to get Yahweh\u2019s or Jehovah\u2019s mind on matters if I approach the reading of the Scriptures humbly, not being critical or looking for supposed contradictions. For example, Proverbs 14:30, in part, states, \u201cA calm heart gives life to the body.\u201d How true! Displaying uncontrolled negative emotions such as anger stresses the heart and may lead to a heart attack or stroke. Modern medical science recognizes how detrimental to our heart if we harbor negative emotions and display them without self-control. ",

Personally, we trade \u201creading da bible\u201d for \u201cknowing the Christ\u201d much as they did in Jesus\u2019 time. In John 5:38\u201340 Jesus addresses the folks that made it their job to know the scriptures inside out. This is how He addressed the issue: And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. The scriptures reveal Christ. But, a relationship with Jesus is far superior to a book. Had the scriptures been the ultimate answer God could have just dropped pamphlets from heaven, like He did manna. Instead, that voice from heaven said, \u201cThis is My beloved Son. Listen to Him.\u201d He\u2019s available today apart from a book (the same was He was for the first 1,600 years of Christianity).

There are so many contradictions and nasty rules that I spend most of my time reading Greek & Roman mythology which make a lot more sense. Most people spend their time trying to convince themselves that there is a god when mythology shows that there are many gods, that people believed in as much as the modern Christian god. Don\u2019t you realize that you have been conned? There is much more proof that another people with greater intelligence showed us how to live. If your god makes you feel good, so be it. The mind is a powerful tool. Try the myths; perhaps their bible (fables) are better than the one you accept without question. If there is One True God, why is he only in your mind? Could it be that you were conned so that they could control you? ",

If you are serious to know please critically and thoroughly read Shrimad Bhagavat Geetha in original Sanskrit text with translation of your choice along with Mahabharata to understand its background and the Upanishads to properly understand its teachings. You must follow its teachings to the word; that is why thorough understanding with reference to the context is necessary. It took me more than two years to complete. Afterwards I thoroughly and critically read the English translations of Holy Bible and Holy Quran. I had to be satisfied with the translations only as I do not know Arabic or Latin. It took me another two years to understand the origin of the concept of the day of judgement and the resultant eternal torment in fiery hell. I had to refer often to the English translations of Antiquity of the Jews by Josephus, Hadith and Sharia. Please do not ask me how it changed my life because I shall not tell you about my grades in the school and my first job. I feel every young man should read the three books in the order and manner stated. It is also worthwhile to read, at least in translation, Tripitaka, Jain Agama, Zend Avesta and the teachings of Confucius. N.B. Earlier I had read translations of Geetha, stories from Mahabharata, Upanishads etc. None of them is anywhere close to the original. ",

One cannot trust a relationship based solely on feelings. We need to know Him through the word to verify what we learn of Him otherwise. ",

Plus, it\u2019s useful to understand that Western Civilization is based largely on the ideas presented in that one collection of books, so it\u2019s good to know that too.
