            "answer_text": "Let me reiterate the simple but often forgotten truth about UPSC. UPSC mains exam is the day of your final performance. It can never exceed what you have trained and practiced for until then. My favorite analogy for UPSC is training for a competitive sport. Intros and conclusions are like \u2018form\u2019 or style. If you want to correct your form either someone has to personally coach you and rectify your mistakes from the answers that you write or there is the Ekalavya method, ie. you simply watch how the experts do. I think the reasons most aspirants are not equipped to write good intros and conclusions is: They often misunderstand the point of Mains. It is not to test the breadth (prelims already does that) rather subjective exams are designed to test the candidates depth of understanding. They are a pain for conducting, it is so much easier to conduct all the papers in objective mode, think of it. Much time, money and energy can be saved. There is a good reason why it is not like prelims. So how can you tackle it with the same material that you used for sailing through prelims.They do not read quality material. Take for instance Indian Polity, Laxmikanth & NCERT will help you cover most of the syllabus and may even provide the content to answer most of the questions. Look at a chapter or topic intro on the other hand. It is sub-standard, not their fault. It was never designed for that. It was designed to give you content which it does. But, one cant expect to frame a good intro without ever being exposed to texts with good intros.These skills are acquired sub-consciously from what texts we read. If you read good magazines and articles and even books, like Subhash Kashyap in this instance, you will have exposed yourself and unwittingly acquire and with practice reproduce the style and content. You don\u2019t even have to try learning it consciously.No one can teach you to think. You inadvertently pick it up from the environment around you. Present pattern of UPSC is extremely time demanding, so unless you grasp the question and frame your answer in about few seconds you wont have time to spare for framing a good intro. The only workable solution is exposing yourself to good material, lectures on Youtube, journals/magazines, quality articles published in popular media, quality conversations and finally practice.Bottomline, good intros an conclusions in mains exam are a result of reading and learning from good quality material and then practicing it on the long term. The minor tips, you will yourself figure out after practice/mock tests. They are very specific to the individual. Happy preparation and all the very best ",

Introduction to the answer will and should be reflect essence of the topic .It will change according to the demand of the question,context and subject . For instance, we can not follow same type of introduction to geography ,polity and ethics. Therefore we have to keep in mind the subject before writing an introduction . similarly , Conclusion is also play an important role by giving completeness of the answer.It gives us an opportunity to take a stand , view , express our opinion in a objective way. Examiner will impress and reward good marks for good and opt conclusion. Some tips from my side: Disclaimer: The following tips are from my experiences . please try in your test series so that you will get to know , it works or not. How to improve introduction and conclusion : I have gone through with one of the topper\u2019s strategy regarding intro and conclusion. she says that , one can improve introduction by writing different introductions ( like 5 to 6 ) to same question .By writing this , one can understand by reading our answers . similarly , Some institutes , in test series ,giving marks by dividing into intro , body and conclusion .
