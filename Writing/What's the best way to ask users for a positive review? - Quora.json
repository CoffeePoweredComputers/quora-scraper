            "answer_text": "We make it a part of our customer service job. I even heard that some companies even make it their team\u2019s performance indicator. We at HelpCrunch provide customer support through live chat (and sometimes, emails). In fact, it\u2019s own own live chat tool, which you can test yourself, but that\u2019s not the point. So, our review collection process looks like this: When someone says something nice about our business in a chat conversation, it\u2019s a direct signal for our customer service managers to act.We ask whether they\u2019re willing to write the same about our tool on G2 Crowd or Capterra (popular review websites in our niche) as well as some other places.If that\u2019s not forbidden by review website\u2019s policy, we might offer something in exchange \u2014 like a small discount or feature extending. That\u2019s just our way of showing gratitude and appreciation.We also track our customer satisfaction rate based on \u2018chat rating\u2019 reports. Basically, customers receive a short message asking them to rate their experience with our customer support team at the end of every closed chat. They must choose of the three options \u2014 good, neutral, or bad.So, we then take all those who rated their chat conversation as \u2018great\u2019 and send them a targeted email campaign. We ask them to leave reviews on corresponding website in order to retrieve a small discount or something along these lines.All this is done by our customer service team. All they need to do is to react promptly on nice words, that\u2019s it. ",

            "answer_text": "That is a wonderful question. :) The best way is to ask for reviews in a straight forward way by incentivising the user by giving in-app freebies. If your app doesn't have any in-app purchase you could probably gift them some apps that they would love. There are some users that give free reviews based on the type of App. If they find it useful they may definitely give some great reviews and do it free of cost too. These users can be found in many forums or FB groups. But the most common method is paying money to get a review which will usually work but is against the policy of Apple and also doesn't give an useful review and usually says \"Great\" or \"Super App\" etc. Hope that answers your question ",
