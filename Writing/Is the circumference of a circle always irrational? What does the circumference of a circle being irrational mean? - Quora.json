            "answer_text": "Is the circumference of a circle always irrational? What does the circumference of a circle being irrational mean?  Contrary to some rather misguided and ill-informed responses to this question, no of course it\u2019s not always Irrational[1] . A combination of Euclid and Archimedes (in that order) proved in antiquity that the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference ([math]c[/math]) to its diameter ([math]d[/math]) [and thereby obviously its radius ([math]r=\\frac{d}{2}[/math])] was invariant, with the figure in question being between [math]3\\frac{1}{10}[/math] and [math]3\\frac{1}{5}[/math] [2]. Much, much later (1706), William Jones[3] coined the usage of the Greek letter for \u2018p\u2019, [math]\\pi[/math], to denote this constant and it stuck. So that means our mysterious constant can be written as: [math]\\dfrac{c}{2r}=\\pi\\tag*{}[/math] Which we can rearrange as: [math]c=2\\pi r\\hspace{5mm}(1)\\tag*{}[/math]  In a 1768 paper, German Mathematician Johann Heinrich Lambert proved that [math]\\pi[/math] was an Irrational Number. Amongst other things, this means that if the radius of a circle is a Rational Number[4] then its circumference is indeed Irrational. To see why, if instead the circumference was Rational, then there would exist an Integer[5] , [math]a[/math], and a Natural Number[6] , [math]b,[/math] such that: [math]c=\\dfrac{a}{b}\\tag*{}[/math] But then, if our radius is also Rational, we have an Integer, [math]e[/math], and a Natural Number, [math]f[/math], such that: [math]r=\\dfrac{e}{f}\\tag*{}[/math] And by (1) we have: [math]\\dfrac{a}{b}=2\\pi\\dfrac{e}{f}\\tag*{}[/math] Rearranging we get: [math]\\pi=\\dfrac{af}{2be}\\tag*{}[/math] Which is obviously Rational, a contradiction. So we have shown our result [math]\\blacksquare[/math].  But the radius does not have to be Rational. In particular if we set: [math]r=\\dfrac{q}{\\pi}\\tag*{}[/math] Where q is any Rational Number, then the circumference will be: [math]c=2q\\tag*{}[/math] which is clearly a Rational Number.  Tired of having sand kicked in your face by people who know more about [math]\\pi[/math]? Read The Irrational Ratio and it will be you doing the kicking[math]^{[a]}[/math]. Note [a] The author does not condone the kicking of sand. No sand was harmed in the writing of this answer. Footnotes[1] The Irrational Ratio[2] Peter James Thomas's answer to Pi is the ratio of the circumference and the diameter. Pi comes even in the formula of circumference. How did they calculate the circumference before discovering pi?[3] William Jones (mathematician) - Wikipedia[4] The Irrational Ratio[5] A Brief Taxonomy of Numbers[6] A Brief Taxonomy of Numbers",

            "answer_text": "Sure, the circumference of circle must be irrational. The circumference of circle is given by 2*pi*r ,where r is the radius of circle. Since pi is an irrational number and irrational*rational=irrational So, circumference must be irrational. There is no any proper method to measure the length of a curve. The one of the method is by using a thread and placing it exactly on the curve and make it straight again to measure its length. This method has some ambiguity. Circles are curve at each and every point on their curvature. If we place the thread on its curvature, it must become slightly straight at any point because points are very small and we can not visualize it. Thus, the circumference of circle being irrational means it can not be calculated exactly.  ",

            "answer_text": "It is pointless to say whether the circumference of a circle is rational or irrational. It is like asking whether my weight is rational or irrational. However, it is understood that you are asking whether the measure of the circumference of a circle may be irrational. It depends upon the unit of measure you adopt. Suppose you have a zero-thick non graduated tape that exactly wraps around a circle. Now define the length of the tape the unit of length. Your circle has a rational circumference. But if you now measure the diameter of that circle in terms of the unit you just defined, you cannot express the diameter, I beg a pardon, the measure of the diameter ;) in p/q form. Hence, the measure of the diameter becomes irrational. Conversely, if you define the measure of the diameter the unit of measure, then surely the circumference would become irrational. There is no circle the ratio of whose circumference to diameter is rational. Hope, you got my point.  ",
