            "answer_text": "We teach people how to treat us. Time to get it together and grow up. Practice intelligent emotional maturity and learn behavior which instills self confidence and self containment. Basically, be in control of your emotions, do not let emotions control you. Do not be overly friendly as this denotes a need for acceptance. Confident people do not need outside acceptance from the masses because they value themselves. Realize and become very aware of your personal boundaries. In this case, we\u2019re addressing boundaries with regard to how people speak to you. When a person has violated your boundaries here is your formula and your choices; Do nothing, ignore the behavior and leave the area where the two of you are occupying.If their behavior is egregious- Look them directly in the eyes, stand about 2 feet away while directly facing them (you are breaking g a social barrier of distance- this is very assertive behavior) do not blink, so not smile and ask them to repeat to you what they just said. Do not break your eye contact. You do not need to do anything except get them to repeat themselves and say absolutely nothing while giving them a dead emotion Fargo Killer stare. Most likely you\u2019ll get a lot of back peddling.Stick to absolute facts and do not bring ANY emotion into the situation. Only children who feel disempowered behave emotionally. (Fake it \u2018til you can make it.) Ground yourself and speak in a quiet direct manner. State the facts; \u201c\u2026you raised your voice and called me a $%#$%#\u00a5+. Your voice was elevated, you spoke loudly and your face was red. You used profanity and disparaging language. I do not allow people to speak to me this way. I cannot change you but I do not allow myself to be in disfunctional situations. Your take good care and peace out.\u201d Also you can add the option of a future time and date to resolve a matter. Get up and leave - do not say goodbye.Never retaliate or respond with behavior that is at a deminished level. Be self contained. Remember, before animals attack they vocalize in a much lower growling tone. This tells the intruder that they have/are about to crossed a boundary. When you speak use a lower tone and learn to make absolute direct eye contact. Alphas make direct eye constant to signal their intentions. Betas break eye contact. A lot can be said by catching someone\u2019s eyes and not breaking eyes contact while at the same time not smiling (or smiling, depending.) ",

            "answer_text": "You get respect by giving it, but sometimes we have to draw boundaries of what we will tolerate and what we won\u2019t. Sometimes we have to pick and choose our battles. Some people are not worth the time or the effort because they are just rude and that\u2019s their nature. They don\u2019t deserve a reply, just walk away. However, on the other hand, like myself, if you say something to me that is very disrespectful or rude, I will let you know\u2026and I guarantee you that they will not do it again. When they know where you stand, they know their boundaries. ",
