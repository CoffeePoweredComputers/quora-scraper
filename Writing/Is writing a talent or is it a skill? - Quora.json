            "answer_text": "I have to disagree with Munir Zamir's answer. I recognise both skilled and talented writers, but I do not believe the border between the two can be crossed: Yes, skilled writing can be a discipline and respond to motivation and self-control, but it is a false hope to propose that skill can convert into talent. Talents (not just writing, all of them) are somewhat wild, unpredictable things. Where a skill improves with discipline and concentration, often a talent withers away under those influences. Talents flower when relaxed and free of distractions. The two schools of writing have remarkably little in common. ",
