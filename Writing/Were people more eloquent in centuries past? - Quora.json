            "answer_text": "As Franklin Veaux pointed out there is some substantial selection bias in regard to examples of past writings which are circulated. Not everyone is John Keats, and there's a reason why his (and the others') writing in particular is singled out as extraordinary. As one would expect of any medium there is much variability between individuals. To illustrate this, here are some ordinary letters from the Civil War soldiers wrote home, available at Letters Home From The Civil War and selected at random. Grammar and spelling have been unedited by me. Dear MotherJames has just been here with a telegraphic despatch of the Death of Father Just as I had written the last sentence in a letter to Father. James tried to obtain a furlough for us to attend the Funeral but it was beyond the power of our Col to grant it as he had Orders from Gen McLellan not to grant any furloughs on any account Please tell me all about Fathers Death and the circumstances atending it. My Dear Mother,    Hearing that there is a mail going out this afternoon I thought I would improve the opportunity and write you a few lines.    I am sorry to tell you I am not very well at present. I was taken sick about three weeks ago with chronic diarhea, and have been in the hospital about a fortnight. I have been pretty sick but I am getting better now and hope to be well in a few days.    I would like to have you send me some things which will come better in a barrel than in anything else. I should like some good fresh eggs, a bottle of preserves, some lemons if you can get some good ones, some ginger root. Some butter would be very nice, it will come better in a tin can than in anything else. I would like some sugar too. I wish you would send a bottle of good Cider Vinegar also-    I would like some pickled onions, and some dried apples. Some prepared chocalate would taste first rate, as we do not get good tea and coffee.    A towel and a couple of handkercheifs will be very acceptable also. If there is any room for anything else I wish that you would fill it up with onions and good sound apples that are not quite ripe that they will keep better.    I have not heard from you since I have been here but should like to do so every mail. If convenient please send $5.00 the next time you write. Dear ParentsI take this opportunity to let you know that I am well at present and hope you are the same today our company is on picket I am on the pike leading from Louisville to Nashville two in a place we sit on a board in the fence corner opposite a Doctor\u2019s shop it is a beautiful day warm it appears to me just like an April day in Ind the days are warm but the nights are cool but we have plenty of cover & blankets and straw to lay on the health of the camp is good by taking in consideration the number that is in camp 50,000 men is a good many to be within sight Gen. Sherman is here. I do not know what his business is but I think we will not stay long some of the officers say we will leave this week but they do not know any more than I do. We have a good time of it today our orders are to let no person through without a pass and when any one comes that has no pass we have to take him to headquarters we get plenty of apples from those that are takeing them to camp to sell when we stop them for their passes they give us apples by the wholesale. I believe we are to be payed this week so the Colonel says. He also says that we will be at home by New Years but perhaps he does not know I am very well satisfied not home sick some of the boys are. I do not have much time to write today so must close I have not received a letter from you since I came to camp but have been looking for one. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. In the everyday, no, people are people, and when you see transcriptions of people speaking in their native dialects, it's nothing special. However, there used to be a firm division (and this division still exists in many languages, but has completely eroded in English) between spoken and written forms of the language.  Written language was more formal and standardized, and often used a wider vocabulary, not least because writing was for posterity and not \"in the moment.\" Today, we're expected to \"write like we speak,\" and everybody writes all the time, most of it intended to be ephemeral, forgotten in the next moment. So, people write far less eloquently, today (though as Franklin Veaux pointed out, not as much as you might think, because nobody publishes crap hundreds of years after it was written, generally speaking), but general discourse hasn't changed a whole lot.
