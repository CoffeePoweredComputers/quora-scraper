            "answer_text": "User story is nothing but a piece of requirement. In Scrum world, it is called as Product Backlog item. Who is responsible for coming up with requirements for the Product? While anyone can propose or suggest requirements for the product, its the Product Owner who is responsible for it. Anyone can create a Product Backlog Item in Scrum. Ordering the product backlog and deciding what should be the priority lies with Product Owner. He/she is the sole responsible person for the product backlog. Can Scrum Master write? I don't think there is a restriction for Scrum Master to write a piece of requirement in the form of User Story. He/she can very well go ahead and write them. ",

It is the Product owners responsiblity to make sure the Acceptance Criteria are clearly defined and in line with the purpose of the story. Ideally the whole team will get a chance to discuss the story in a grooming session making the original author of a story less significant. ",
