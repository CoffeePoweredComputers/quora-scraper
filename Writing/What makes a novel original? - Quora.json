            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t believe any novel is wholly original. All of them spring from the literary context of what has come before. All rely on cultural semiotics, and use signs and signifiers of the base culture to speak to an intended audience. Most novels either carry familiar themes further onward, or use contrasts to examine those familiar themes. IMHO, the most original novels were by Joyce and Pynchon\u2014whose originalities lay in form and structure, but not necessarily in themes. I\u2019d say a good 80% of novels written today are low in originality, particularly since the advent of a marketing focus in the publishing industry. Whole genres (romance, mystery, thriller, women\u2019s fiction) are like giant sausage factories, pushing product through the mill to keep revenue flowing. Marketers have determined that we really WANT to read the same thing over and over, packaged in different covers. Which is why it is so hard for an original novel to break in. Just ask J.K. Rowling.

            "answer_text": "What makes a novel original to me is not necessarily a new plot line because honestly most of the plot lines have been used multiple times. What makes a novel original to me is how well the author creates the world that they are using in my mind. How well the author creates original characters that I can relate to and that I like or dislike in equal measure. Whether it\u2019s fiction or nonfiction, all good writing is creative writing. It creates something special that\u2019s why it\u2019s called creative. That\u2019s why I can pick up a great book for the eighth time or the ninth time or the 10th time and it still feels original to me. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a tough question. To be honest, I wouldn\u2019t know. To be original one needs to have an idea that has literally never been tried before. Even when someone else has written a hideously work about something and you wrote a superior novel with the same kind of aspects, your novel still wouldn\u2019t be original. And with so many (aspiring) writers, the chance of being original would be pretty low in the first place. How about you strive for making an interesting, well-written novel I would love to read? Then I really won\u2019t care if you aren\u2019t original. I prefer that over any kind of original novel that is written poorly. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s usually said that there are only seven basic plots. Everything ever written boiled down to seven plots Add to that the fact that novels have been around for a very long time. So all of the quirky approaches like writing without punctuation or writing from the POV of a dog have already been tried too. I would suggest therefore that it\u2019s pretty much impossible to write a totally original novel. Better to channel your efforts into writing a good one. ",
