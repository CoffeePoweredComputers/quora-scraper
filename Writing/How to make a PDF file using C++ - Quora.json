            "answer_text": "I\u2019d consider using some pre-existing tools and libraries. It can be done by scratch, of course, but you can use C# with the Kdan PDF SDK library to easily create PDF documents. I\u2019m from the Kdan team, and I want to share some features of the PDF SDK, because I think they would be useful to anyone who needs to create PDF features using C. The SDK is based off of over 10 years of experience with PDF Reader, Kdan\u2019s award-winning PDF solution used by over 50 million people. It includes cross-platform support for iOS, Android and Windows, and many features of the PDF Reader. A robust viewer system that can render large documents, text selection and annotation, and even legally enforceable signatures by DottedSign, built in. One of the most economical SDKs to use today, Kdan\u2019s PDF SDK comes with a free trial and code snippets so you can get started right away with your first apps. Download now and see what you can create. ",

All you need to learn this way is PostScript and how to call other programs. If you don\u2019t already know PostScript, you are probably better off with 1).",
