            "answer_text": "Writing MBA essays and statements can be more than a little intimidating, but there are definitely a few things you can do to get your application to the top of the pile. 1. Answer the question! It sounds obvious, but it's pretty easy to get off track from the topic or to answer a question you feel more comfortable with than the original question posed. However, it's very important not to get derailed! Get to the point as quickly as you can, and be relevant throughout the essay. Make sure you have a clear structure and a logical flow of thought. 2. Be specific to the school and the question posed. When you (inevitably) have to explain why you chose a particular institution, there should be a clear correlation between your reasons and the school. Don't make the common mistake of submitting the same application to different places and simply swapping out the names! The letter will come across as too general because you've crafted the statement to fit multiple places while changing just a few key phrases. They won't absolutely know, but they will suspect. Even worse, you're proving to yourself that you don't have what it takes to write a few separate documents, and that's not only lazy, it's a little insulting to the addressee. 3. Follow the rules. If there's a word count, do not go over, under any circumstances. If they want a specific font type or size, just do it. If they want a certain file type, make sure you save your document to match. Little details like this are the first step to getting your document through the door and onto the desks of the application committee members. If there's a time to color inside the lines, it's now!  4. Be personal. Don't talk about rising tuition costs in America; talk about how you had worked two jobs and still completed your final year of undergraduate education. Don't turn it into a sob story, but talk about how it was all worth it, or how it made you who you are today. Focus on unique experiences that will set you apart from the thousands of other applicants to the school. 5. Don't go overboard with the enthusiasm. Always remain professional. Show that you have energy and passion, that you are committed, and that you are unique. However, be humble. Unique does not mean \"the best.\" What makes your point of view your very own? That's what you want to demonstrate. 6. Make sure there's some mention of your achievements and the challenges you've overcome. Show that you are well rounded. What are your accomplishments in academia? Athletics? The arts? Make sure the achievements you mention are current and professional. 7. It's okay to keep it simple. Drop the dramatics. The jargon, the academic language, and the stuffy personality all have to go. Show your personality! If you're funny, be funny. (If you're not, though, this probably isn't the place to practice.) Just be yourself. Maybe you're sensitive. Talk about how you learned to accept criticism, and prove that it's something you've developed. 8. Don't ever give excuses or apologize. So you have a bad mark or a year in which you did nothing at all. Even though there are always explanations for doing poorly, they should never be used as excuses. Address your mistakes, and talk about what you've learned. 9. Edit the essay. It's not worth risking a blatant grammar error, as that can become the main thing a reviewer remembers about your application. Even if you have flawless grammar and spelling, perhaps you can work on clarity, tone, or structure.  ",

So it is all about what you show you have, and this part of application gives you the proper ground for the same. Essays/ SOP is the heart of your application, as you are directly introducing yourself to the adcom in a written format, and thus considering what the University wants in your profile you must make sure you hit the bulls eye. For writing a perfect statement you can consider the following steps: Be yourself, as an original is always worth more than a copy.It\u2019s the opening of the letter which will grab attention so ensure it is strong and articulate.Highlighting the strengths and assets of your profile, I repeat highlighting the strengths and assets of your profile is the most important aspect of your candidature.Precision, honesty and clarity should be the strong points of your SOP.Remember to convey your goals and how MBA program will take you closer to those goals.The committee should be made aware of your skills and interests.Your shortcomings should also be conveyed across in a subtle manner. For example if you had an average GPA or a poor GPA in your freshman year, it should be put across in a cryptic way, along with mentioning how it has improved over the time.For a particular Essay question, you must answer it with suitable examples from your past experiences.When you write an SOP for MBA the focus should be to describe the information which is relevant to your past events and connect it with the next possible steps you seek. Your work participation, the place you have worked, duration of work and what you gained from it are a few areas which are to be emphasized. Work exposure contributes greatly in shaping your personality and accentuating your persona.There is no room for errors, spelling mistakes or poor English while you write SOP for MBA.The SOP should not exceed more than 2 pages (unless guided otherwise), content should be double spaced with 1 inch margins and in Times New Roman 12 points font (preferred).To sum up, the way you are brought up, your experiences and the environment that you live makes you resonate different than every other being, and so does your story. And thus the unique path you come from, which has solidified your current goal must be beautifully connected and presented correctly. ",

            "answer_text": "Creating a good essay can be a pretty hard work for many candidates willing to enter top management education institutions. However, if they are ready to find some time, specify their aims, think about their achievements and follow simple instructions, then they will have all chances to write a paper that lets them get a foot in the doors of many colleges. An essay is a tool which lets the admissions department get to know the candidates better. Even though creating an essay may seem to be an easy task from the first sight, there are a few important directions to follow to create a standout paper. Think About an Essay In Advance Allocate some time for reflection before starting to write a paper. Most programs ask candidates to write several essays. So, it is important to start researching specific questions long before brainstorming. Don\u2019t hesitate to create two separate lists where you will indicate all your plans and achievements and name the schools and programs you want to enroll in. Mention Your Achievements Sometimes, boasting about yourself may seem to be a sign of a mean person. But this has nothing to do with an MBA paper. However, make sure that you don\u2019t look like a braggart. Focus on the good things you have done and achieved, and convince the staff that you are going to be a good student.

Believe it or not but admissions officers are like lie busters. They can easily tell an honest applicant from the one who is just trying to seem such. And if they spot a liar, his/her essay will get straight to the rejected pile.Tell them about your goals. Your goals are part of your personality. And that is exactly what admissions committee wants to see in your essay. Write about your achievements and future goals. Show the connections between them and the way you took to reach them.Say why you are a good fit for them. Naturally, once you\u2019ve decided to enter particular b-school, admissions officers want to know why. What can you offer them? In what way you fit the program you are going to get into.",
