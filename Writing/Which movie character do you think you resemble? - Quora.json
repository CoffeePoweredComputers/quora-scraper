            "answer_text": "Kanji bhai (Paresh Rawal) from the movie Oh My God!  The first time I saw this movie, I thought \u2015 he is exactly like me. He is an atheist, and his thinking and mine \u2015 questioning everything related to God \u2015 was too identical. Not just me, some of my close ones thought the same as well. So, this character is more or less me, except his age. :P I am almost the same. I keep questioning about the existence of God and all these religious beliefs that people are following religiously (or blindly). I am practical, and there is no expectation of magic from any super power. I don\u2019t believe in afterlife. I have no fear of God, and I don\u2019t believe God or anyone else has any control over us or any other thing in this world. It is as simple as that for me. When I die, and if there is no one to keep my name, what is a big deal in that? Who cares what happens after I'm gone forever? One of the famous dialogues from this movie, which matches my thinking is: Main sab dharmon ka aadar karta hoon ... aur kisi bhi dharm mein maanta nahin. (I respect all religions ... and don't believe in any religion.) I see no reason why someone should tell me how to live my life, not even God. I decide for myself. Good or bad, it\u2019s my life, and I have got my brain and heart to decide for myself. With that, I say this again: There is no better religion than humanity and there is no God better than your humble self. Choice is clear, my choice.  Smiles! \u263a:) ([math]\\ddot\\smile[/math]) Shail 'The Atheist Flash' ",

            "answer_text": "I am basically a mix of two characters: Ved Vardhan Sahini from Tamasha.  And. Ayan Sanger from Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.  Just like Ved. I am a storyteller. He talks to mountains, enacts various roles, makes up stories and narrates them to people and entertains them. As a kid, Ved shows all signs of a master storyteller in the film. Though I am not a master storyteller, just like Ved from Tamasha. I too did all those things as a kid, and continue to do so now. Wherever I go to any social gathering, everyone assembles around whilst I tell a story, a story I made up based on real incidents mostly. I narrate whatever is in my mind and most people are interested in it. And just like Ved from Tamasha, I too talk to mountains, walls and enact situations and characters mostly in front of the mirror as I can\u2019t go to Corsica just yet. And just like Ayan from Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. I too am a sensitive introvert. There is a scene in ADHM, where Ayan tells Alizeh how he was seen as a ajeebo (Weird) introvert and that he had no great friends in school and the label of a weird introvert frankly made no difference to him. That\u2019s almost exactly similar to me. I too was labelled as a ajeebo in my school, and I still am a big introvert. And just like Ayan, I am extremely sensitive in real life (not on Quora). And yes I have been friendzoned multiple times like Ayan was! I share many other similarities with both Ved and Ayan. The only similarity I don\u2019t share is obviously the looks. Ved and Ayan are extremely good looking, I am not. Besides that, these characters are almost autobiographical in nature for me. I don\u2019t know why Ranbir choose these characters (he looks to me like an introvert too). But its because of these characters, that I am his biggest fan. I could instantly connect to Ved from the second he appeared on screen, same with Ayan. ",
