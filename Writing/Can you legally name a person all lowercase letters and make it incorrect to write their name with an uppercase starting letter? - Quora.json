Still, most put the period there despite many (in his time) being told not to by the man himself. My first name has only on \u201cL\u201d but half or more of the people who know me spell it incorrectly despite the fact that they know better. I once was in a war of sorts with an HR clerk who kept fixing my name after I\u2019d go into the system and correct the spelling. I have no doubt you could spell the name in all lowercase on the birth certificate. I\u2019ve seen some debate about whether or not whoever is writing it down can refuse to accept anything other than what they believe to be a proper name. A nurse refused to write down Dweezil for the Zappa\u2019 son, so they had to change it (to Richard, I think \u2026 short for \u2026 well \u2026). Legal, who knows but you\u2019re probably not thinking \u201clet\u2019s get the lawyer while our kid goes as no name.\u201d (Dweezil changed his first name to that as an adult, so that\u2019s long been his legal name.) But lots of luck \u201cmaking it incorrect\u201d for anyone to spell it otherwise. It\u2019s incorrect to spell my name with two ells, but how exactly would I stop anyone from doing it? Sue hundreds of people constantly? And how does that stop the next person? You\u2019d have a fight with schools, doctors and who knows who else. But who I\u2019d really sympathize with is the kid because that\u2019s who\u2019s going to take more s**t than you could ever imagine over this. ",

That\u2019s how it was in the country of my birth (the Netherlands). Here in the U.S.A., clerks and/or computers will usually change the lowercase \u2018v\u2019 to an uppercase \u2018V\u2019 and often times they will remove the space. I correct it when I can. My naturalization certificate, which is my U.S.A. official identification document shows my name as \u201cMARNIX ALEXANDER van AMMERS\u201d. I don\u2019t know how or why it went like that. Why not all upper case? Why not mixed case? On any form I always write my complete name as \u201cMarnix Alexander van Ammers\u201d. I deliberately use two spaces between my middle name and my last name in the hope that intelligent computers might grok that the two spaces separate the last name from the rest. I would say that it\u2019s \u201cincorrect\u201d for my name to be written anywhere other than the way I write it, but to a clerk somewhere it might be an unbreakable rule that a name has to be written with the first (or all) letter(s) being upper case. I don\u2019t know that there is any law governing this. ",

You can ask that your name be spelled with only lowercase letters and this will generally be followed by the media, publishing houses, etc. The poet e. e. cummings is an example that readily comes to mind. He liked his name to be spelled in only one case: all upper case or all lower case. In spite of this, note that both the Poetry Foundation and Wikipedia spell his name with the conventional upper case/lower case combination. ",
