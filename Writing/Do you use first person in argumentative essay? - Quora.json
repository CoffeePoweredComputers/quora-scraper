            "answer_text": "This is only my own preference and experience, but the answer is a resounding NO, students should not use first person point of view in any sort of essay other than a personal narrative essay. I customarily allow students to include anecdotal evidence in essays that may be told in first person, but that is a small example within the larger essay. Overall, the point of view for the essay should be third person. Note that second person is also not allowed. Do not speak directly to your audience with \u201cYou.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There is no place for first person in formal academic argumentative essay. However, you can use first person only if it has been asked to provide your personal opinion or reflection about the topic. Otherwise, argumentative essays present different arguments as per the views and facts provided in other research studies, news articles, books or any other literary sources. Thus, no need of first person in such essays. ",
