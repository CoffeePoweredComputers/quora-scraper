            "answer_text": "Writing applications can be difficult if one is not in the habit of writing applications. Every application has its set of rules and one needs to carefully abide by those rules and write relevant content in so that it doesn\u2019t get rejected. Let us now discuss how to write an application for school admission. We need to take care of these four important things: Address: The first and foremost thing in in application is address. If the address isn\u2019t right, many things can go wrong. Subject: Keep it as short as possible. It should be a short sentence making some sense. Content: Start with requesting humbly and don\u2019t write too much details. Save them for the appointment. You just have to tell about yourself and the person you want the admission for. Also, why you want the admission in respective school. Signature & Contact Information: End the letter with politely hoping for an appointment. Then add you signature and contact details. So that you can be contacted for the appointment. Let us now look at an actual application: The Principal, AB Public School, Shahdara, Delhi - 110002 Subject: Requesting admission in your school. Ma\u2019am/Sir, This is Mr A(your name) and I humbly request for an admission of my son/daughter\u2019s admission. His/her name is B(child's name) and he/she is an industrious student. I got transferred to this city and had to bring my family too. Hence, I am looking for a befitting school for my child. Post enquiries I found your school to be the best in our neighbourhood. I would be very glad if you accepted my child. He/she is a brilliant student, both in academics and in sports. I am very sure he/she will bring laurels to your school as well. I would like to take an appointment from you regarding the admission. Looking forward to hear from you. Thanking you in advance. Regards, Mr A(your name) (Address & Contact Details) ",
