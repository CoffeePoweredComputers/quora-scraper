            "answer_text": "Absolutely yes. And I would highly encourage you give them a try. And I would also highly encourage you to try looking at books from a slightly different point of view. Pick up a book and start reading. Give it 30\u201350 pages, see where it goes. If it\u2019s boring you don\u2019t feel bad about putting it down and looking for something else. I\u2019ve done this several times. But back to DFW - I would start with some of his short story collections: \u201cOblivion\u201d, \u201cBrief interviews with hideous men\u201d, then maybe move to some of his essays: \u201cA supposedly fun thing I\u2019ll never do again\u201d or \u201cConsider the Lobster\u201d. Some of these works can be highly entertaining, eye-opening, educational, overly academic. Look around and see if you find anything you would appreciate. I\u2019ve tried getting into his epic \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d, but 60\u201380 pages later I put it down. I\u2019ll get to it sooner or later. But his unfinished novel \u201cThe Pale King\u201d I highly enjoyed and appreciated. I haven\u2019t read everything he wrote, but the above mentioned works I truly enjoyed and loved. ",

            "answer_text": "I cannot decide \u201cworth\u201d or \u201cworthwhile\u201d for you. However, there is a specific dilemma people face. Some novels can be recommended and that is because the novelist communicates with a foundation in the knowledge domains. However, when novels do not reflect the foundation in knowledge domains, the communication they offer is merely a reflection of the author\u2019s general confusion. As a general guide, if you want to find a real \u201cworth\u201d or \u201cworthwhile,\u201d start exploring the realm of nonfiction. ",
