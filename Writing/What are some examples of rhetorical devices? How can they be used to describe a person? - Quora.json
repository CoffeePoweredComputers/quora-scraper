            "answer_text": "Your first question is easy to answer; your second question, not so much.  For your first question,instead of listing a bunch of rhetorical devices, most of which are very difficult to pronounce, let alone define, I'll simply refer you to an excellent list of rhetorical devices compiled by Dr. Robert A. Harris in A Handbook of Rhetorical Devices. He defines and illustrates each rhetorical device very well. In my opinion, his handbook, available for free on the internet, is invaluable for speakers and writers, whether they are seasoned professionals or rank newbies!  Foundational Devices For your second question, an obvious answer should begin with a good long look at metaphor and simile. These two tropes (the technical category into which they fall)exist in the realm of similitude, with simile the more obvious of the two,having as its companions the words like or as.  In describing a person using simile, you could say, \"In his last diatribe, he was like a ravenous wolf tearing apart its prey; instead of teeth, he used invective.\" Here the word picture likens a particularly vituperative public speaker (such as a politician running for office) to a vicious animal--a wolf, which is hungrily reducing another animal to bloody, bite-size pieces.  Is the speaker actually a wolf? Of course not. If, however, the simile you choose to describe him captures the essence of his diatribe accurately, then whoever hears or reads your simile will be that much more likely to remember your word picture. In the rhetorical arena, that is one of your goals, is it not? You want to affect your audience/ readers in a predetermined (i.e., extemporaneous) or un-predetermined(impromptu) way.  In using metaphor to describe the same speaker's rant, you could say \"Candidate Wilson was a wolf in his latest rant.\" In this sentence, you put the comparison into the laps of your listeners and either allow them to make the appropriate comparisons, or you subsequently supply them further into the speech.  Metaphors and similes are analogies, and the points of comparison, analogs. They need not always have negative import. You could just as easily refer to a different kind of politician as an angel--assuming that he manifests certain angelic attributes such as goodness, kindness, helpfulness, protectiveness, and so on.  The Analogy An analogy, which is technically a trope all its own, can be extended so as to encapsulate an entire speech or a healthy segment of a speech. If, for example, you are giving a speech about the perils of pollution and the need for dealing with the perils in an intelligent and effective way, you could use the analogy of triage. In actual triage, doctors and nurses attend intelligently and effectively to, say, the victims of a freeway pileup by determining the severity of the injuries and then attending first to the people with the severest injuries and then to those with less severe injuries.  In rhetorical triage, you could use an analogy in describing a person or a group of people, with triage serving as a basis for your comparisons. By taking the notion of disease (e.g.,cancer) and systematically comparing the stages of disease to the way terrorism works its way into the fabric of society, destroying it little by little, you may be able to get your audience to sense how immediate the danger of organized terrorism is.  As for other rhetorical devices used to describe people, just think of what you want to say about a person. Regardless of whether what you want to say is complimentary or derogatory, there is probably a rhetorical figure which can be adapted to your purposes.  Sarcasm and Irony For example, sarcasm and irony are staples for speakers who want to antagonize, ridicule, belittle, or derogate a person. The ancient Greeks had certain stock characters in their plays: the eiron was a self-deprecating fellow who feigned knowing less than he actually knew, and the alazon was the posturing braggart who thought he knew more than he actually did know. A modern-day counterpart to these two characters are Sheriff Andy Taylor and Deputy Barney Fife from the Andy Griffith Show. One tricky aspect of irony, however, is sometimes a person only seems to be self-deprecating but is in reality using his supposed modesty either to gain admiration for himself or ridicule someone else. In other words, he's fishing for compliments or he's assassinating characters, in which case the supposed irony itself becomes ironic. (Don't think too hard about it; you might hurt yourself!).  In short, these two rhetorical devices are not so much used to describe people; rather, they are inhabited by people whom others describe as ironic and sarcastic. If you want to see an ironic and sarcastic person in action, I recommend watching virtually any of Don Rickles' video at utubeonline.com.  Some Examples As for the many other rhetorical devices which can be used to describe people, each one can be adapted to a particular purpose. Here are a few devices, a brief definition,some examples which utilize them, and a reason for why they might be used. Note: quotations are from Dr. Harris's handbook. asyndeton, the omission of conjunctions between words     or phrases:     Ms. Wicker is haughty, mean, sarcastic, a regular Cruella DeVille. Dr.     Wilbur, on the other hand is compassionate, tenderhearted, generous, a truly good Samaritan. (Deliberate omission of conjunctions which can give \"the effect of unpremeditated multiplicity\" which seems more impromptu     than extempore.) polysyndeton, the inclusion of more conjunctions than would ordinarily be used: a) The ancient tribe called Weeblos neither ate nor     drank nor traveled nor slept nor did anything without first consulting     other members of the tribe; and b) In her dealings with her students,     Professor Barton was personable and helpful and accommodating and     professional. (Multiple conjunctions \"call attention to themselves and therefore add the effect of persistence or intensity or emphasis to the     other effect of multiplicity.\"understatement, the expression of an idea as less important than it really is: a) Adolph Hitler was quite the rascal indeed!; b)     During WW II, the Nazi guards at the concentration camps were certainly     not kind to their captives; and c) The lecturer's \"brief talk\" was by no means short, given its four-hour duration. (Used for ironic emphasis, or even for politeness and tact, as when a speaker wants to downplay his or her accomplishments, as when the Ph.D. in Renaissance history says, \"Yeah, I have a passing acquaintance with a couple of     the big ideas which emerged from the Renaissance.\") litotes, which expresses a positive with two negatives: a) Einstein's theory     of relativity created no small furor among the physicists of his day; b) It is of no small consequence that the Democratic candidate uses almost     exclusively a string of ad hominems [i.e., personal attacks and character assassinations] to belittle his opponent; and c) The president's string of     epithets and expletives which were recorded without his knowing it will likely do no small amount of damage to his re-election campaign. (Litotes \"either retains the effect of understatement or becomes an     intensifying expression.\" I imagine its use gets listeners to think more and longer about the content of what has been said than its non-use, since they have to balance and interpret in their minds the two negatives and the positive at the same time.) parallelism, which is a \"recurrent syntactical     similarity\":     a) My opponent, who claims to be squeaky clean, has in fact been arrested     three times: once for illegal betting, once for drunk driving, and once     for public slandering; b) The wannabe mayor has always sought but never obtained the support he needed to become a candidate; and c) She tends to keep her mouth open, spewing nonsense and spreading gossip. (According to Harris, it shows that the ideas contained in sentences--or parts of sentences--are of equal importance. It also adds balance and rhythm and clarity and clarity [notice the polysyndeton!] to your speaking and writing.)zeugma (both pro- and dia-)\"includes several     rhetorical devices, all involving a grammatically correct linkage (or     yoking together) of two or more parts of speech by another part of     speech.\" The     following examples are from--or adapted from--Harris: a) Pride oppresses     humility; hatred, love; cruelty, compassion; b) Fred excelled in sports;     Harvey at eating; Tom with girls; and c) Mr. Glowry held his hero's memory     in high honor, and made a punchbowl of his skull. (Zeugmatic devices have     economy, and they create helpful connections between thoughts.)antithesis, which \"establishes a clear,     contrasting relationship between two ideas by juxtaposing them , often in     parallel structure: a) To err is human; to forgive, divine (Alexander Pope); b) That's one small step for a man; one giant leap for mankind (astronaut Neil Armstrong, as his foot touched the surface of the moon); and c) Alistair Conacher was fond of saying, \"If we try, we might just succeed; if we do not try, we cannot succeed.\" Conclusion Becoming adept at using rhetorical devices takes lots and lots of practice. Be aware, however, that the overuse of devices in shorter writings and speeches can do more harm than the under-use of devices in longer ones. (What device or devices did I just use in my last sentence? There will be a quiz tomorrow!).  The rhetorician who uses rhetorical devices skillfully, seamlessly, and appropriately will likely--and more often than not--outshine another communicator who favors \"talking straight from the hip.\" Speaking (or writing) extemporaneously, using well-thought-out and artistic verbal flourishes after having prepared and practiced extensively can bring personal satisfaction to the speaker and benefit to both speaker and listeners (or readers) alike.
