I just took APUSH (got a B first semester and an A the second semester) and am an upcoming senior. Here\u2019s some general tips I have for you: Understand that history is ambiguous - Even though you may like to think that history is black and white, it\u2019s often really ambiguous. One example I always think of is the American Revolution. Everyone usually thinks that all colonists wanted to revolt against Britain, but when in reality it was about 40% Patriots, 40% Loyalists, and 10% who abstained. You can improve your understanding of the material when you realize that there are often many viewpoints on different situations.Do all your notes and homework - Notes and homework are a pain the *ss, especially in APUSH because of the sheer number of pages you\u2019ll have to read and sheer number of terms/events/people you will have to remember, but doing so adequately will for sure prepare you for quizzes and tests. Remember to also organize your notes and use highlighters.Don\u2019t be afraid to try new things - Sounds pretty corny, but nonetheless APUSH will definitely teach you how to write a lot better. If you find yourself having to write an essay for whatever reason, try thinking outside of the box and bring other content into your essay. For example, I was super surprised when I received a 29/30 on an essay about the Progressive Era and Jim Crow. I got the score because I mentioned how renowned progressive president (progressive presidents were known for social reform) Woodrow Wilson was actually a racist that admired the film The Birth of Nations, a film that glorified the KKK. I backed up my claim with research from Princeton University. It\u2019s outside-the-box thinking that APUSH teachers really like to see.Understand that you will likely struggle - APUSH by no means is an easy class. In fact, it\u2019s one of the AP classes with the lowest 5 rates. You will definitely be confused at first with everything being thrown at you once, but you will get adjusted to it. Just keep trying.Hope this helped! ",
