For instance, like, okay\u2014 Punctuate as demonstrated above. Viz., predominantly with commas, but when longer between dashes or parentheses, and at the dangling ends of sentences with a dash or maybe an ellipsis \u2026 As for spelling, I suppose you could distinguish between uh, uhh, and uhhh, write um differently than mmm, sometimes or always transcribe y\u2019know instead of you know in different people\u2019s speech.
