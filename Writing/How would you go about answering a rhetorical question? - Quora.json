            "answer_text": "A rhetorical question is nothing more than an intellectual exercise, a though experiment. It is an applied approach to a theoretical condition. In effect, the only significant difference between a rhetorical question and one of immediacy is that one has practical implications, the other does not. The rhetorical question is heuristic, causing the one who answers to form ideas about a nonexistent set of circumstances. But answering it requires the identical intellectual tools as does answering any question. So, how would I answer a rhetorical question? I would answer it as if it were not rhetorical because that distinction is immaterial. ",
