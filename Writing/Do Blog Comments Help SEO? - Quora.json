            "answer_text": "Blog commenting has been an SEO strategy since the first time anyone opened up comments on their site in the first place. Mechanically, it\u2019s very simple in concept. Blog comments are content on a page. Content on a page is indexed by Google. If a link is on a page, that link becomes part of Google\u2019s analysis of SEO. Therefore, you can leave a blog comment with your link and have that linked indexed by Google, thus counting as a benefit to your SEO. Many such services sprung up around the same time the tools came out, years ago, in an attempt to leverage mass blog commenting as a money-making strategy. In fact, many of these services use these same tools to accomplish their tasks. A blog commenting company will generally give you promises about the minimum PageRank, Domain Authority, and other metrics of the sites they target. They\u2019ll also often talk about how their target sites are all dofollow blogs, and how you won\u2019t be marked as spam, and all the rest. Essentially, these companies maintain lists of sites they can post comments on and have those comments benefit their target sites. It needs to be an active blog with some level of authority in a relevant niche. It should have good PageRank, Domain Authority, and other meaningful metrics. It should be followed, to give the link real SEO value. Essentially, a blog commenting service outsources the goal of blog commenting for SEO, using their own resources instead of requiring you to build up your own lists of relevant sites and whatnot. Rather than using blog commenting to spread your link around and get some mechanical SEO company San Diego benefit, I think you have a much better opportunity. With blog commenting, either manually or with services you pay for, you\u2019re generally spamming your link around for some minor returns. It might cost you money or it might cost you time, but either way, there\u2019s a real cost associated with it. Identify the best blogs in your niche, and completely disregard any thoughts of links whatsoever. ",
