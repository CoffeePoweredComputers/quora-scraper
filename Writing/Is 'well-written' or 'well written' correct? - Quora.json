            "answer_text": "Well-written is correct as it is describing the verb \u2018written\u2019 however, it\u2019s not nescessary as you can write , well written , both ways are correct, just that the one hyphenated is more \u2018formally\u2019 correct. have a look at this usage of hyphens down here from the online English grammar books statings, I hope it helps with the difficulty of some usage of hyphens: Rule 1. Generally, hyphenate two or more words when they come before a noun they modify and act as a single idea. This is called a compound adjective. Examples:an off-campus apartmentstate-of-the-art design When a compound adjective follows a noun, a hyphen is usually not necessary. Example: The apartment is off campus. However, some established compound adjectives are always hyphenated. Double-check with a dictionary or online. Example: The design is state-of-the-art. Rule 2a. A hyphen is frequently required when forming original compound verbs for vivid writing, humor, or special situations. Examples:The slacker video-gamed his way through life.Queen Victoria throne-sat for six decades. Rule 2b. When writing out new, original, or unusual compound nouns, writers should hyphenate whenever doing so avoids confusion. Examples:I changed my diet and became a no-meater.No-meater is too confusing without the hyphen. The slacker was a video gamer.Video gamer is clear without a hyphen, although some writers might prefer to hyphenate it. Writers using familiar compound verbs and nouns should consult a dictionary or look online to decide if these verbs and nouns should be hyphenated. Rule 3. An often overlooked rule for hyphens: The adverb very and adverbs ending in ly are not hyphenated. Incorrect: the very-elegant watchIncorrect: the finely-tuned watch This rule applies only to adverbs. The following two examples are correct because the ly words are not adverbs: Correct: the friendly-looking dogCorrect: a family-owned cafe Rule 4. Hyphens are often used to tell the ages of people and things. A handy rule, whether writing about years, months, or any other period of time, is to use hyphens unless the period of time (years, months, weeks, days) is written in plural form: With hyphens:We have a two-year-old child.We have a two-year-old. No hyphens: The child is two years old. (Because years is plural.) Exception: The child is one year old. (Or day, week, month, etc.) Note that when hyphens are involved in expressing ages, two hyphens are required. Many writers forget the second hyphen: Incorrect: We have a two-year old child. Without the second hyphen, the sentence is about an \"old child.\" Rule 5. Never hesitate to add a hyphen if it solves a possible problem. Following are two examples of well-advised hyphens: Confusing: Springfield has little town charm.With hyphen: Springfield has little-town charm. Without the hyphen, the sentence seems to say that Springfield is a dreary place. With the hyphen, little-townbecomes a compound adjective, making the writer's intention clear: Springfield is a charming small town. Confusing: She had a concealed weapons permit.With hyphen: She had a concealed-weapons permit. With no hyphen, we can only guess: Was the weapons permit hidden from sight, or was it a permit for concealed weapons? The hyphen makes concealed-weapons a compound adjective, so the reader knows that the writer meant a permit for concealed weapons. Rule 6. When using numbers, hyphenate spans or estimates of time, distance, or other quantities. Remember not to use spaces around hyphens. Examples:3:15-3:45 p.m.1999-2016300-325 people Note: Most publishers use the slightly longer en dashinstead of a hyphen in this situation. Examples:3:15\u20133:45 p.m.1999\u20132016300\u2013325 people Here is how to type an en dash: On a PC, hold down the ALT key and type 0150 on the numeric keypad located on the far right of the keyboard. On a Mac, hold down the Option key and type the minus sign located at the top of the keyboard. Rule 7. Hyphenate all compound numbers from twenty-one through ninety-nine. Examples:thirty-two childrenone thousand two hundred twenty-one dollars Rule 8a. Hyphenate all spelled-out fractions. But do not hyphenate fractions introduced with a or an. Examples:More than one-third of registered voters oppose the measure.More than a third of registered voters oppose the measure. Rule 8b. When writing out numbers with fractions, hyphenate only the fractions unless the construction is a compound adjective. Correct: The sign is five and one-half feet long.Correct: A five-and-one-half-foot-long sign.Incorrect: The sign is five-and-one-half feet long. Rule 9a. Do not hyphenate proper nouns of more than one word when they are used as compound adjectives. Incorrect: She is an Academy-Award nominee.Correct: She is an Academy Award nominee. Rule 9b. However, hyphenate most double last names. Example: Sir Winthrop Heinz-Eakins will attend. Rule 10. Many editors do not hyphenate certain well-known expressions. They believe that set phrases, because of their familiarity (e.g., high school, ice cream, twentieth century), can go before a noun without risk of confusing the reader. Examples:a high school senioran ice cream conea twentieth century throwback However, other editors prefer hyphenating all compound modifiers, even those with low risk of ambiguity. Examples:a high-school senioran ice-cream conea twentieth-century throwback Rule 11. When in doubt, look it up. Some familiar phrases may require hyphens. For instance, is a book up to date or up-to-date? Don't guess; have a dictionary close by, or look it up online. Hyphens with Prefixes and Suffixes A prefix (a, un, de, ab, sub, post, anti, etc.) is a letter or set of letters placed before a root word. The word prefix itself contains the prefix pre. Prefixes expand or change a word's meaning, sometimes radically: the prefixes a, un, and dis, for example, change words into their opposites (e.g., political, apolitical; friendly, unfriendly; honor, dishonor). Rule 1. Hyphenate prefixes when they come before proper nouns or proper adjectives. Examples:trans-Americanmid-July Rule 2. In describing family relations, great requires a hyphen, but grand becomes part of the word without a hyphen. Examples:My grandson and my granduncle never met.My great-great-grandfather fought in the Civil War. Do not hyphenate half brother or half sister. Rule 3. For clarity, many writers hyphenate prefixes ending in a vowel when the root word begins with the same letter. Example:ultra-ambitioussemi-invalidre-elect Rule 4. Hyphenate all words beginning with the prefixes self-, ex- (i.e., former), and all-. Examples:self-assuredex-mayorall-knowing Rule 5. Use a hyphen with the prefix re when omitting the hyphen would cause confusion with another word. Examples:Will she recover from her illness?I have re-covered the sofa twice.Omitting the hyphen would cause confusion with recover. I must re-press the shirt.Omitting the hyphen would cause confusion with repress. The stamps have been reissued.A hyphen after re- is not needed because there is no confusion with another word. Rule 6. Writers often hyphenate prefixes when they feel a word might be distracting or confusing without the hyphen. Examples:de-iceWith no hyphen we get deice, which might stump readers. co-workerWith no hyphen we get coworker, which could be distracting because it starts with cow. A suffix (y, er, ism, able, etc.) is a letter or set of letters that follows a root word. Suffixes form new words or alter the original word to perform a different task. For example, the noun scandal can be made into the adjective scandalous by adding the suffix ous. It becomes the verb scandalize by adding the suffix ize. Rule 1. Suffixes are not usually hyphenated. Some exceptions: -style, -elect, -free, -based. Examples:Modernist-style paintingsMayor-elect Smithsugar-free sodaoil-based sludge Rule 2. For clarity, writers often hyphenate when the last letter in the root word is the same as the first letter in the suffix. Examples:graffiti-ismwiretap-proof Rule 3. Use discretion\u2014and sometimes a dictionary\u2014before deciding to place a hyphen before a suffix. But do not hesitate to hyphenate a rare usage if it avoids confusion. Examples:the annual dance-athonan eel-esque sea creature Although the preceding hyphens help clarify unusual terms, they are optional and might not be every writer's choice. Still, many readers would scratch their heads for a moment over danceathon and eelesque. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, Naj. Please note that the \u2018well\u2019 and \u2018written\u2019 are adjectives and their combined role is to describe an aspect of or the book. There are 7 Types of English Adjectives Descriptive. A descriptive adjective is probably what you think of when you hear the word \u201cadjective.\u201d... Quantitative. Quantitative adjectives describe the quantity of something. ... Demonstrative. A demonstrative adjective describes \u201cwhich\u201d noun or pronoun you're referring to. ... Possessive. ... Interrogative. ... Distributive. ... Articles. Now, in our case, both adjectives are in order but have different functions. The \u2018written\u2019 is an adjective that describes inter alia an aspect of a noun, a book. In this case, a book that is well written. The \u2018well\u2019 qualifies the \u2018written\u2019. Together, they qualify the book. When used as an adjective before a noun, use \"well-written,\" as in, \"That is a well-written book.\" When used as a predicate adjective, there's no hyphen, as in, \"That book is \"well written.\" That, in a nutshell, is what you are up against. I do not think one should just correct your choices. You need to understand how all these parts of sentence work together to enable you to write correctly. I hope you will keep it up to master English. After all, it is almost the language of the universe. (I exaggerate, but you will find it will help you everywhere to communicate.) Good luck. Bye. ",

            "answer_text": "When well-written is used as an adjective (and I can\u2019t think of another way to use it), it requires a hyphen; everyone who says the hyphen is optional is wrong, to be blunt, and the answer has nothing to do with style guides and everything to do with logic. A well-written book isn\u2019t well and it isn\u2019t written. It is well-written. If the modifiers must be \u201cbundled\u201d in order to convey meaning, then they must be joined with a hyphen. So: a worker-owned factory \u2026 a student-led discussion \u2026 but a delicious chocolate cake (no hyphen because each modifier can be used on its own to tell us about the cake). Note that an -ly adverb + adjective needs no hyphen when modifying a noun: a stupendously dull lecture \u2026 a surprisingly rich meal \u2026 an overly long movie. I can explain why, if you like (let me know); I\u2019m omitting the explanation to avoid creating info overload. Best wishes. ",

(A pet peeve of mine is that the one type of compound adjective that does not require a hyphen is the one that people who are uncertain about the principle use the most.

I believe there is a technical word for this phenomena, when a language slowly morphs into something simpler as we go along, but I cannot think of it at the moment.  Either way works, but technically well-written is better. I like hyphens because it seems to me that they make sentences easier to understand. Less cluttered. ",

The descriptor, placed after the vowel, has become the predicate of a complete sentence. My dog is twelve years old -- no hyphens. My twelve-year-old dog -- hyphens.

The OED does not regulate the formation of any adverb + verb compound noun example, even though it contains a sliver of newly coined terms in that regard. As a rule of thumb, the Latin roots (English is a German language but it has an important part of its semiology and syntax rooted in Latin too) of the English grammar dictate that the compound noun components be written in the singular. There are some exceptions to the rule. I would not use well-written but I am not a grammarian. Another rule of thumb is that words need contextualisation in order to convey meaning, which makes the need to link adverb + verb compound nouns unnecessary. ",

(e.g., \u201cThe book was well written.\u201d) The styles I work with require that I delete the hyphen in that case, but I would assert the better edit is to put it \u201cThe book was written well,\u201d with all the parts of speech in their normal positions.
