            "answer_text": "I have to agree with everyone else here - writers write, and they write a lot. Steven King said in his book On Writing a healthy number is 1,000 - 2,000 words a day. Jack London supposedly wouldn\u2019t start his day until he wrote 1,000 words. (Also, a lot of writers, and the company Google, seem to think that the morning is the best time to be creative). But I\u2019m going out on a limb here and thinking that this question is really about how do you work as a writer. As in, get paid to write. Which is a much, much more difficult question. For my part, I\u2019ve only gotten paid to write for magazines, blogs, and news sites (and very occasionally, a comic script or a web short). I am no success. So, most of what I know about the subject comes from reading about the paths better writers have taken. And cribbing from a few people I know who could call themselves vaguely successful. But the first thing is, what kind of writer? Nonfiction magazines, trade publications, etc.? Start by figuring out what you know well, or what you wouldn\u2019t hate to research. Typically, the most technical expertise required, the better the pay. Then, before you start writing, read some of those magazines. Not just any, the ones who might take a submission. There\u2019s Writer\u2019s Digest\u2019s Writers Market 2018 for that, or this handy database: Freelance Rates Database Be creative about the niche (you\u2019d be amazed how many bloggers make a living by writing about Disneyland). Journalism? Good luck. The process is similar, but arguably more difficult. Publications like the Washington Post, and the Guardian take freelance contributions, but you\u2019d better be good to get in. A lot of the contributors are bona fide experts in something; they have something to say. It\u2019ll be easier (maybe) to go more local, but the news paper business is drying up fast, and even a small established publications can ask for long resumes as more seasoned journalists go looking for jobs. Screenwriter? Write something, then see if you can get a little piece of it made and send it around. This seems to work well for animated shows - South Park was a brief Christmas card, Rick and Morty was a short parody of Back to the Future. If you don\u2019t have some friends with cameras, or who can draw, then try Black List and see if a reviewer likes it. It costs a little, but great things have come from that site. There are also agents you can send scripts too, but there\u2019s a little Chicken or the Egg problem there. A lot of agents don\u2019t seem willing to take a chance on someone not already established\u2026 and then you\u2019re counting on an agent to get established. Short Stories? Good luck. Literary Magazines increasingly seem to be on one pole or the other. Either incredibly high-quality with virtually no chance of an amateur succeeding (The New Yorker) or partial scams that depend more on charging authors reading fees than selling their magazines. Here\u2019s a little of the high end: Top 50 Literary Magazines -Every Writer - Every Writer There are also contests - 31 Free Writing Contests: Legitimate Competitions With Cash Prizes Same problem with contests about the reading fees. Novels? ??? A lot of people claim you should just publish yourself, either for eReaders like Kindle, or with real books using something like CreateSpace. It\u2019s easy\u2026 real easy. So easy, that everyone has done it. The explosion of published work has created fun little statistics. As of 2011, if you read one book a day, every day, it would take you 60,000 years to read every book registered with the Library of Congress. I\u2019m sure that number is much higher now. Real publishers still exist. Many are scams or vanity publishers, asking you to pay the publishing costs and selling almost exclusively to friends and family members of the author. Some are real, and very difficult to sell to. Once again - Chicken or the Egg. Big publishers want big names. To get a big name you need a good publisher\u2026 sometimes. For all of these, there are some bits that are a little more universal: Know you genre/niche/expertise well. Read thoroughly in he area you\u2019re going into. Reading might be more important than writing really.Build an audience. Some people are great in short form - so they master Twitter. Then when the time is right, they publish something for their fans and start making money. Others are great on Reddit. Others try on Quora\u2026Avoid the scams and reading fees (unless you can really really verify its authenticity. There are some good ones, like Black List). Anything that shows a writer on the beach with a laptop, who happens to be a beautiful woman, is generally a scam.Figure out the schedule. Here\u2019s the daily routine of a bunch creative geniuses (including writers): Creative Routines. As Terry Pratchett said, \u201cOnly in our dreams are we free. The rest of the time we need wages.\u201d Meaning that while you\u2019re trying to make it, you\u2019ll need to work. You might make a full-time income writing blogs, shorts and news articles, then one day, the ad rates go down\u2026 less people seem to read\u2026 the freelance offers seem to be lacking\u2026 and then you might end up driving Lyft for a while. It happens, just keep writing.I guess the biggie is to write\u2026 there\u2019s that too. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, what is it that you think writers do? They write! Of course.  \"There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down and bleed.\" \u2013 Ernest Hemingway Some writers write long form, some write short. Some write poems, others write biographies. Some went through years of schooling to learn what it means to write well, others simply wrote and wrote and wrote until readers started to pay attention. If you want to be a writer, the most sure-fire way to do it is to 1) find something to write about, 2) write about it, 3) find a way to share what you wrote with the world. Thankfully the Internet has made much of this process easier than ever! The only thing technology won't do for you is the actual writing. Which is what writers do, so you'll have to look into that bit a little more. But on the other two points: the finding something to wring about and sharing what you write, you can turn to the Internet (which it appears is exactly what you've done here). Finding what to write about What to write about? I don't think it matters much what your topic or style of writing is, only that you're passionate about them equally. You can be passionate about automobiles, but unless you're equally passionate about writing about automobiles, you're going to find yourself flubbing about a lot when the time to write comes. We call these people \"aspiring writers\" because they want to be writers and they are excited about a topic, but they cannot \u2014 for their lives \u2014 sit down and actually write. Explore what other people have written about, think of anything you've read that sparked a particular interest in you or that captured your attention so completely. Writing isn't difficult, you'll find. I mean, it can be difficult to get yourself to set up your computer or type writer or papers just write, to pour the ideal amount of coffee or tea into a mug, to will your butt onto the chair and, as Hemingway famously quipped, bleed. But oh what a chore finding something you actually give two cents worth of interest about can be! It's not the actual sitting down to putting the words together that is particularly difficult. Toddlers do it! Finding something you can dedicate many of your limited heartbeats toward expressing, something you can transform from that intangible nothingness that exists only inside your head into something that others can feel and see and taste and hear and be part of...all from a few lines and dots on a page? That's where the work comes in. But don't let that statement scare you away! Anyone can be a writer, a good writer at that, if they take the time to put their heart into writing. That's really all there is too it. Once you've got that down you must then find someone who is willing to read what you've written. Find an audience Start a blog. Share snippets of your writing on social media sites like Facebook or Twitter. H Publish the book yourself and see if any local, small bookshops would be interested in selling it. Do whatever it takes to get the word out, literally. If you want to be a writer \u2014 really, truly \u2014 then simply write. If you want to be a great writer, just keep writing. I don't believe you need to get formal training or to become a student at a notable institute to do what anyone with enough heart, energy, and a pad of paper can do, let alone do it well. ",

            "answer_text": "The simplest answer is to write and publish a book.  At the lowest level of the equation, you can write something and publish it on Amazon Kindle or Smashwords or Create Space or some other platform and \"Presto!\"  you're an author.  Whether or not what you've written is utter dreck that nobody, even your mom will bother reading, you are an author.  Congratulations. Right, that was a snide answer, but millions of people each year pick that path and declare to anyone who'll listen, that they're an author.  The other answer is that you sit down and spend months, if not years, writing something and making it something that doesn't just please yourself, but also pleases others who read it.  This is a very difficult path, and in all honesty, I'm not sure it's really a path worth following.  The publishing business is really pretty crappy and the agents and editors that you're forced to suck up to are, by and large, a pretty rum bunch.  The book publishing and distribution business is ineptly run and ridden with gatekeepers who decide whether to put a book on bookstore bookshelves based on weird, capricious, whims.   If you choose to go this route, it is almost guaranteed heartbreak.   But that's how you get readers.  And you will be an Author and nobody can ever dispute this fact.  If you choose self-publishing, people hearing you call yourself an author will inevitably roll their eyes and say \"Okayyyyyy!\"  But you know what's funny about this whole silly business.  The process of finding readers is exactly the same regardless of which route you pick. You're going to have to beat the bushes for readers either way.  Believe me, New York publishers will do only the most pro-forma promotion and marketing for you.  You'll have to promote your book yourself and if you're really good, you can find as many readers with a self-published book as with a commercially published one.   Of course if it's legitimacy you want,  there's only one way to do it. ",

            "answer_text": "I love to write, whether it\u2019s working on my next serial, making a blog post, or answering questions here on Quora, I love it.  So, you want to be a writer. Your first step? Just start writing. It really is that simple. But, beyond that, here are my thoughts on how you can get that career, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after, off the ground. Read. Yep, you heard me right. You cannot be a good writer if you don\u2019t read a lot. You must scower your particular genre (the one you\u2019d like to write in) and read, read, read. Read the best-sellers. Read the books/publications that aren\u2019t doing so hot. Read the reviews of what you read. This will give you a great idea of what is selling and what readers want/don\u2019t like.Get a tough editor. I say get an editor, but just get someone that is a grammar cop in their spare time, or someone that you know LOVES your genre. You want someone that is tough to point out issues with your writing. Don\u2019t see these critiques as failure, but see them as opportunities to grow better at your craft.Keep a notebook or journal by your bed. You never know when an idea will come to you\u2026 might be in the middle of the night! Write these down.Study people and take notes. (If you\u2019re writing fiction, that is) One of my favorite things to do is to people watch. Waiting for a flight is the best time, in my opinion. You see so many different people from all walks of life in an airport. (Like Lord Vader and his minions below) Write.Just like everything in life, you can\u2019t expect to be great at it the first, second, or fiftieth try\u2026 but hang in there. If you love what you are doing and love what you are writing, you can do it. :) ",

            "answer_text": "One does not simply become an author, yes it can be a \"thing\" or one can \"be\" and author, but it's not something you achieve but are born to be. It is a way of life.  To be an author; it means having something inside your head just dying to get out. It\u2019s a beautiful magic creation that you feel you must put down on paper for the world to see. You will spend years chasing it, and countless hours going out of your mind to perfect it. It means to touch people on a deeper level just by writing words. To make them able to see what you are saying. To achieve greatness when they can feel, taste, and smell what you are writing. It means to weave amazing pictures in the readers mind. Bright vivid pictures with realistic sounding people. It means to pull a character out of a book and sit them right beside you. It means to ponder and think then to think and rethink again. It means your time is never your own. It means that you are a slave to the words bursting forth from your mind. There will be days when you will pray for words and others when you wish they would stop. It means when the words start coming, you must drop what ever you are doing to write them down before losing them forever. Being a author means being able to look at things in a strange way that others may not understand. It means to think outside the box, and to walk the fine line between strange and insane. It means that some people might call you crazy, And maybe you are, maybe to be a author means to be crazy. For those of us who write, to be a author simply means living and breathing life in your own special way. ",

            "answer_text": "I apologize, but before I start, I have to do this: *writer. Alright, so the steps to becoming a writer are so hard and dangerous, and you cannot possibly begin with something costly and difficult to find. Many dragons need to be slain, so we need something mightier than even the finest of enchanted swords. No, my friend, we need\u2026 A Pen! Or a computer. Okay, so here\u2019s what you do: Write! Write anything. It\u2019ll all suck at first, no one starts amazing. Look up some prompts, and write as often as you can. If you do that, within under a year, you\u2019ll go from a beginning writer who\u2019s not great to someone who can at least make a good storyline! I will, however give you these tips, which were learned over about 3 years of serious writing, and while they sound dumb, if you start with these tips, you might get better faster! Actually plan out the story.There were at least 7 stories I started and couldn\u2019t finish, and as I got towards the middle of the story, I couldn\u2019t figure out where to go. Why? Because I didn\u2019t plan it. I had a vague concept, made up some names, and started writing. That\u2019s okay, up until the time when you actually want to finish the story. What you want to do, when planning, is give your concept, first. Then expand upon it a bit. Actually, as much as you can. Now that you have the idea of how the story is supposed to go, you can either start writing and plan as you go, or get even more in detail, and plan out the first however much of the story you want. It\u2019s up to you to write it well when it comes time, and for the outline, you can skimp on detail. Then, if the story takes on a path of its own, you can afford to be flexible. Actually create your characters.Now that you know what your story is, create your characters. Their personalities should add something to the story and contribute to the plot. For example, Charlotte\u2019s Web wouldn\u2019t have worked if Fern was a sadistic girl who didn\u2019t care much for animals. So especially for your main characters (protagonists, antagonists, best friends in either direction), make sure it fits the story, or expect the plot to drift a bit. Write as often as possible, and when you have to stop for a while, don\u2019t write everything you have in mind.Seems counterintuitive. \u201cI have to go to bed, though, so shouldn\u2019t I finish this idea first?\u201d No. Okay so think of this: It\u2019s so easy to get started when you have an idea, isn\u2019t it? Like, when you\u2019re falling asleep and you think of something great so you jot it down and then use it the next morning. So when you have to sleep or go somewhere, write down some small reminder or brief summary of the idea, or the next part, etc., and then when you come back, you have that to jump-start you back into the story, whereas if you wrote everything, you\u2019d have to spend another 15 minutes, probably, thinking of the next part. Of course, the outline should help, but still. It makes things easier, and plus, you won\u2019t spend all night going \u201cjust 5 more minutes\u201d. And by writing as much as you can, not only does it create an okay habit, but it also helps you get good at it as fast as possible. Following the tips, or not, this will help you get better at writing. In Conclusion, just remember that nearly anyone can write, but it does take time to become a good writer. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are new to writing, please oh please do not be discouraged by the first few attempts, no matter what genre you chose, if you\u2019re going for technical or creative. I believe the first step definitely would be to decide what you want to write about, what you want to say and who your intended audience will be. For now don\u2019t duel on the impact your writing should have or whether it is good. If you\u2019re starting out, I would suggest you pick a topic and start writing snippets in the form of your choice; i.e. short stories, poems etc. How to go about it will greatly depend on your personal choices. There are those who can simply start writing, and there are those who need to have every little sequence of event pre-planned. Perhaps an outline is beneficial for you, especially if you are taking on a novel form which are more complex and tend to have subplots\u2026 see where I\u2019m going with this? I taught myself to write. It was a pain in the butt because I didn\u2019t have any guidance such as writing clubs. So I made many mistakes. One of the pitfalls of starting out is that you will notice that you start to improve your writing skills. Narrative becomes more coherent, scenes begin to flow, etc. BUT, no matter how tempted you are, DO NOT stop to edit!!! I made that mistake many many many times simply because I realized that my previous scenes were not at the height as the later ones. So I kept rewriting and rewriting and it took me forever to finish my story. Let me tell you a little anecdote about how I started and the mistakes mentioned above. I set out to write a short story meant to be open ended to hopefully encourage the reader to fill the blanks of subsequent possible events that would never be. I get a little satisfaction on that hehehe\u2026 don\u2019t mind me\u2026 back on track. So, being the creative person I am, while writing this simple piece in short story form so as to not have to duel on the heavy details that are an inevitable part of the novel form, I realized that my brain had set flight. I soon began to expand the story in my mind, imagining possibilities after possibilities of plot developments\u2026 and then and there I decided I would make this short story the full blown novel it is today. Let me tell you that the decision did not come without its fear factors. I had never attempted a novel before and I knew the road would be a difficult one in my case since I had no support whatsoever. So I read a few book on the subject of writing fiction and creative writing. Save yourself the trouble. While they do have good advise here and there, there is no specific answer as to how to write. The common theme in books on how to write is that you practice and continue practicing. So I decided that the short story I wrote needed to be converted into novel form. I tinkerered and worked on it day in and day out. At first it was infuriating because I foolishly expected quick results. That is not how this works. Soon, as the novel progressed and I reached the end of my first chapter, WOW!!! That feeling will stay with you forever. So I used that adrenaline height and pushed on to the second chapter. Here I began to note an improvement in my narratives, and thus the mistake of stopping to auto edit myself to try to bring the previous chapter to par. Whatever you do, do not make the mistakes I made. Look at the exercise for what it is, a practice in the form of a draft that is yours and only yours. Do not put pressure on yourself thinking you must finish in a week. It will take time. Trust me when I tell you that you will laugh and you will cry as you attempt, fail, attempt again until you succeed. Because when you do succeed you will learn that you have an ability not many have. Realizing that you can do it is something that will inspire you to go on and on. Don\u2019t be deterred by the early results. Nothing is ever created or developed overnight. There will be a process of trial and error very normal when developing new skills. Keep at it. You will make it, just as I did. If you go the route of more complex writing such as novel or technical form, and you feel an outline is your thing, you might want to check out existing softwares aimed to do just that. An example is Dramatica Pro. However, never let these softwares dictate the route your story should go. You are the writer, you are the author and you should decide where your story goes. Hope this answer helps. Write on!!!! ",

Here goes: It takes a very healthy imagination. While writing you will come across times where you will be blocked and you won't know what to do next. This is what writers call Grey Area. This is where your imagination will help you the most. And also imagination is indeed the driving force of any type of literature.You need to read. Read a lot!

Create a character and give her/him a challenge. Make another character a bad guy. Before you know it you have a story. Or write a thought. An idea. The way the light catches all the detail of a flower. Listen to other writers speak. Read all the time. Listen to yourself think, then write it down. Recollect the past in the tranquility of the present, a la Walt Whitman, and write. Music\u2014with or without lyrics\u2014will often push your fingers on the keyboard or a pen across paper.

Carry a notebook and write down any and all ideas that come to mind.Once you\u2019ve got something interesting, write down a treatment for it, create a quick beginning, middle, and end. Remember, good books/movies are kind of like good jokes: You\u2019ve got to know your punchline before you start telling the story.After you\u2019ve devised the plot and characters, start writing. If you\u2019ve never written a book or a movie and have no idea how to write, google it and study until you get the basics, then WRITE, WRITE, and REWRITE.If you\u2019re writing a movie, then keep your story\u2019s setting limited to two or three locations. Shoot your movie with your friends, finish it and show it to everyone. If you\u2019ve never written a book or a feature length film, then you probably are a terrible writer right now and you need tons of practice \u2014 even if you have written a book or a movie, it\u2019s probably poorly constructed. I\u2019m trying to save you the rejection heartbreak you will receive once you try to peddle your script to anyone in a Hollywood.

Join a book discussion group or a writers\u2019 group but don\u2019t make it a religion. Stick to your style and guns. Say what you want to say and say it as simply and as forcefully as possible. It helps if it is beautiful too. When you have enough successes in publications, get a literary agent to represent your work (Good luck!). Don\u2019t give up. You got to think and feel and suffer, there is no other way. Never lose sight of humanity. If humanity is not there, your writing will never matter. Try to think about the world but also remember that literature lasts longer than this generation, what is in the marketplace, who is the President of the land, etc. They are important like the price of food is also. But to be a writer is to be always hungry, not so much to be recognized as a good writer or a genius, but the hunger to be known by another human being. You might write something that is as perishable as lettuce or as enduring as the Great Wall of China. In any case, \u201cmeasure your progress by how long it takes you to get there.\u201d Oh, by the way, you will need a job other than that of a writer.

            "answer_text": "Becoming an author is as much a balance of self as it is a system of effort and sacrifice. Obviously a great deal of the process relies on one's dedication to the writing process, but there comes the time when a writer must take the step from a private scribe to a potentially public figure. A wise mentor of mine once said that a writer becomes an author when they find that writing is only half of being an author, and while writing is undeniably an inescapable step in the process it's true that a writer who never submits their work can never advance. There are a number of options in this second step, but for the purpose of simplicity it's best to view it as a choice between three distinct paths: self, indie, & traditional. Self - despite what many say, self publishing is not an ugly word and there is no shame in doing so (while it stands to reason that self publishing is the \"easiest\" way to get a piece out, if it is of low quality or sub-standard effort then the piece will not go far and, worse yet, the public that is reached can--and often does--do substantial damage with poor reviews and word of mouth). While self publishing can be an unforgiving crash course in what it's like to be in the public eye when one is not ready (it's been said that every rejection letter is easier to swallow then another reader pointing out you weren't ready to see print), many well-written authors see monumental success in this process. Because self-publishing puts near-total (if not total) control of every element of how the piece goes out (including cover art, internal formatting, networking platforms, etc...), then somebody who is well versed--or has connections who are well versed--in the various arenas can see the release of a compelling piece that will earn them 100% of the earnings. Indie publishers - This process represents a \"cool center\". Though self publishing represents a form of indie publishing, there are publishers who operate in this realm. These publishers are less dictated by the confines of commercial publishing and, as a result, more author-friendly (I've heard horror stories of traditional authors submitting a completed manuscript to their publisher only to be told that they need to completely rewrite the piece in order to incorporate a \"crowd-pleasing\" element to cater to the publisher's demographic; regardless of what those changes mean to for the piece). The submission process varies for indie publishers (they'll often specify their guidelines; for example, my company, Tiger Dynasty Publishing, has a guidelines page that mirrors the standard formatting guidelines of traditional publishers that can be found at tiger-dynasty.com), and the services provided will vary as well. However, for the most part the general process of going through an indie publisher allows an author a great deal of ease in the publishing process (TDP and others, for example, will provide editing, cover designs, and other publishing costs at no expense to the author), as well as helping to market and promote the piece upon publication. Finally, there's traditional publishing. This is, of course, what most people think of when they consider the process. Many will argue that this is \"harder\" than other methods, but it stands to reason that, as mentioned earlier, a rejection letter isn't always a symbol of failure, but one of being not yet prepared (the success rate of traditional publishing mirroring the fact that commercial publishers only accept pieces that they personally feel will return the multi-thousand dollar investment an accepted piece represents). However, time, ease of submission (the shift from mailing manuscripts to one of simply emailing a file has made the proverbial \"inbox\" for publishers substantially more filled each day) and an over-saturation in the market has motivated many publishers closed to what is referred to \"unsolicited manuscripts\". An unsolicited manuscript is a submission by an author who is not represented by a literary agent, and it has been said that acquiring a literary agent is often more difficult a process than getting the actual publisher. The process of querying an agent isn't altogether uncommon from querying a publisher--it follows the same general premise of \"here is my piece and why everyone should love it\"--but an agent (at least the honest ones), are more hesitant about accepting due to a number of elements, the most predominant being a preexisting workload with other clients as well as the gamble of representing a piece that might not succeed (a true threat to somebody whose time is directly proportionate to their earnings, especially when their earnings are based on a percentage of the piece's sales ~ usually in the vicinity of 10-15%). Whether or not an agent is involved, an accepted piece through a traditional publisher is often met with an advance (a pre-determined sum of money that represents, as the name would imply, an advance on estimated earnings from the piece; if a publisher offers a $10k advance, they will not begin paying the author royalties from sales until they have sold $10k worth of books). Now, despite what many will say, no one option is \"the best\" for anybody. Just as every person is unique, every author is an individual, and the personal know-how and strengths will determine which option is best for them. I'm often asked \"what did you do?\" or \"what path would you suggest based on your success?\" in regards to my own path as an author, but I rarely offer up solid advice for them in this measure as what I've done does not hold any merit in what would work best for them (though I've never refused an aspiring writer the information they would want/need to make an educated move of their own).

            "answer_text": "How can I become a writer? I want to write a book, but I don\u2019t know what the first step is. Firstly, the question is slightly baffling. You say that you don\u2019t know what the first steps are, but that you want to become a writer. Simply put: you can\u2019t become a writer without writing; if you aren\u2019t already writing, why do you want to become a writer? How do you know? Anyway, ignoring that for a second, my recommendations would as follows: Find out if you enjoy writing first. Is this something you yearn to do, even if the money isn\u2019t great? Is it something you\u2019re willing to do as a hobby while you also work full-time? Would you go out of your way to find the time to write?Start a few short stories and see what you think. If you\u2019re struggling for ideas, try some of these: Writing Exercises and PromptsMaybe read some writing books or take a course to see what other writers say about form, plotting, character development, beginner mistakes etc. In a way it\u2019s true what they say - you can\u2019t teach writing, but you can learn good practices, what to do, what not to do etc. The same way you teach a sprinter to run fast, but you can teach him the techniques to enable him to run at full capacity.You\u2019re going to need a circle of readers who are willing to give you some honest critiques. And not family either. They will just say, \u201cthat\u2019s great, honey\u201d because they don\u2019t want to hurt your feelings. Look around online for people who are willing to critique your writing, or friends, other writing group members - and learn from them.When you feel comfortable enough with your writing, find some short story competitions to enter. They offer a few advantages:It will give you a goal and something to aim for - times and dates, word counts, genres etc. - and give you a small insight into what it means to write for a living.Your writing will be critiqued by professionals.Your name may become known.You may even find yourself being introduced to literary agents if you are lucky enough to win.You may also pick up some extra cash.Once you\u2019ve been honing your craft and feel you\u2019re ready to \u2018write a book\u2019, do it, send it to agents and get some feedback.Becoming a writer isn\u2019t easy. And prepare yourself for some soul-searching, criticism and rejection. I think Stephen King says it best: By the time I was fourteen the nail in my wall would no longer support the weight of the rejection slips impaled upon it. I replaced the nail with a spike and went on writing. If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to start as a writer, please understand that there are two types of writers. There are the traditional writers that work for publishing houses or deal with magazines or media, and there\u2019s everybody else. These are internet writers. The best way to get started is to become an internet writer. You just go to places like Fiverr, put up an ad and when an order comes in, over deliver. You should create a portfolio from your past works and then advertise that. You can also try platforms like http://freelancer.com or Upwork. There are just so many places you can get work from as a writer. But one of the best ways is to become part of a writing roster for a writing company. Basically, what they would do is they would get clients and then they would farm out the work from the writers on their roster. They make money by, of course, adding a profit margin to the amount of money they pay the writers. Pretty straightforward, buy low sell high. If you want to apply for a higher paying roster writer freelance project and earn $10 per 1000 words article, email richardcortez21@gmail.com. Don\u2019t forget to use the subject line $10 Rewriter. I recommend this person because their team sends out rewrite work. They don\u2019t send out original composition work. If you want to make money as a writer, please understand that your main investment is your time. If the writing assignment that you took takes too much time to research, then you\u2019re losing money. The great thing about being a rewriter is that they give you the original source. The research is already done. You just stick to the original source, put it into your own words, reformat it, reorganize it, and you come up with something new. So look into rewriting instead of original composition. Start there and then eventually scale up to the kind of writing that you really want to do. ",

The question is how to become an effective communicator which ultimately will lead you to become an effective writer. The basic premise of becoming effective writer is the connect you are able to enjoy with your audience and to what extent have you impacted them to take action. For making the connection between the audience you should have - Understanding people pysch and emotions. There cannot be good story which doesn't talk of emotions. Watch people closely. See how they interact, inspire, despise, relate to others. Try to catch nitty gritty, mannerisms, words used, impact.Judge the impact of the message - Try to judge what impact is the emotions making on the other. This will help you understand the strength of the message.Words Used - You make your writing interesting when you use apt words. Learn about them by watching live conversations, reading quality books, watching plays.Imagination - This is critical. A good imagination is a must for a good writer. Think of unique ideas, try to talk people around you and take feedback, write on social media to judge response.Style - Have your own unique style. All writers who have succeeded are those who had a unique and powerful style.Let's talk about few movies which had good scripts. All these movies have beautiful stories which connected with masses as they arouse emotions and push people to act. Jaane Do Bhi Yaaron -  Taare Zameen Par  3 Idiots  ",

Okay let's see how we could get you to become an author, First of all define your intention because your question here doesn\u2019t explain your intention. Do you just want to be an author? Do you want to be a famous author? Do you want to be a published author? Do you want to be a best selling author? Depending upon above four, \u2018one\u2019 has to adopt different pathways to achieve those individual objectives or sometimes altogether(requires bit of luck and tonnes of effort). Again, we presume you want to be a famous and published author, Decide W's and H\u2019s of your writing. Fiction, novel, novella, horror, romance, series and so forthUnderstand your audience for whom probably you might be writing. Some say I write for myself. Well then good luck reading and praising your own book.Read as much as you can before you start punching words.Workout your art and craft (plot, character, transition and stuff like that)Eat, Sleep, Write, Read and Repeat.Draft, draft, draft and draft.Find a literary agent. A good and reliable one perhaps. If not, find a publishing house and approach them directly. Have guts to digest rejection.Finally comes the promotion part. Do it online and offline.Interact with your readers.Enjoy the fruits!For publishing part you could do it online in form of ebooks on amazon, lulu, barnes and nobles, etc. Look, becoming an author is simple. Anything original you write under CC entitles you as an author. But the quest is all about the destiny of your creation and what shape you want it to take. Cheers! ",

One should also be a voracious reader and must read content in different genres simply to understand how different writers use different words in different and creative ways. This can give useful insights about different yet effective writing styles. One should write rough drafts and then revisit those written drafts after sometime to better edit those written drafts.Simultaneously one can join some writer's club if one such club exists and take inputs from other budding writers of club on one's written content. This feedback,if taken positively, can help budding writers improve their writing . To be a good writer one should write in an easy to understand language to ensure that the written content reaches more audience.Budding writers should write keeping in mind the mental level of targeted readers. Try not to write just to impress readers with your knowledge and avoid using jargon. The only way, I think, to improve writing skills is to keep on writing more. The more practice will help improve writing skills.Write rough draft and then edit this rough draft further before finally submitting the written content to the publisher or online forum.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m asked about this quite a bit, partially because I often tell our influencers they need to be writing more. I\u2019m going to assume that you\u2019re trying to establish yourself for expertise reasons more than make money, at least in the beginning. As you\u2019re offline at conferences and meeting those in your community that command speaking slots, have you noticed anything about the majority of them? They write. The reality is, authors are sought after for the best interviews, speaking slots, and media offers, which of course leads to the best product sponsorships (i.e. the goal of many top tier influencers). Disclaimer: I\u2019m CEO of Intellifluence and therefore tend to link to our stuff. Telling you to become an authoritative writer is easier than actually becoming one, so let\u2019s start from scratch and walk through the process from never having written to self-publishing your first book. I\u2019ll try to do this in under 1,000 words so you can focus on the actionable and less on the puffery that this topic usually attracts. Getting Started The trite advice on how to get started writing is to just get started writing. Thankfully Mike Troiano is a bit more detailed in his post on getting started writing online. At this point you should already understand the \u2018why\u2019 behind writing for the purpose of both improving visibility as well as becoming an authority, so from his article let\u2019s look at his \u2018how\u2019 \u2014 as you can see, most of the important process for him is brainstorming and saving those as drafts, editing them after a day, kicking them around to others for feedback, and then incorporating that feedback over time as he mulls over a post. Note that not all the processes are the same. For instance, I created a list of 29 topics related to influencer marketing, worked on sorting them into an outline with 1\u20132 sentence descriptions of what the articles would be about, and then each week I did a sprint to build out an article from title to final draft. Thankfully I have a good editor in Andrew to make sure I don\u2019t come off as too much an idiot (sorry Joe, yes you do). Damnit Andrew! Editor\u2019s note: That was all Joe; I didn\u2019t do it. I swear. My process therefore is actually more similar to Jeff Goins and how he goes about writing novels. He starts with the rough story idea, has it roughly outlined, backed with appropriate research and study, and only then fills in those gaps to complete the story. This is the process that works for me, but you may find that Mike\u2019s approach works a bit better for you. Tools to Keep you Moving After you get started writing and are knee deep in the sludge of prepositions, oxford commas, and\u2026ellipses, you might need some tools to keep you organized and push you towards the finish line. Editorial planning, research, and the basics \u2014 CloudPeeps compiled a solid list of a variety of tools. You\u2019d be amazed how much can be accomplished with the right research and grammar checkers when it comes to organized writing and meeting deadlines.Productivity \u2014 pet peeve: life hacks for aspects of my life that don\u2019t require hacking. However, Chris Danilo has a list of some tools I definitely agree with, when it comes to simply keeping you focused on putting the words on paper rather than refreshing Facebook. ToDoist and Evernote alone can keep you really focused. I couldn\u2019t get the meditation tools to work on me, but maybe they\u2019ll help you more.Market your work \u2014 As Copypress says: like all forms of content, if you\u2019re creating your masterpiece in a vacuum no one will know about it; get it shared out, tell people what you\u2019re working on, brand yourself alongside the writing you\u2019re producing, and collect your best work for compiling into that major authoritative piece.Publish that Book  This is the stage I\u2019m at, as a FYI. After this article is in the can and I get through the next two topics I\u2019ll be able to provide a comprehensive guide on becoming a top tier influencer, and then pair it with my previous guide to create a book. As an aside, I\u2019m also going to promote it primarily via Intellifluence; how is that for dogfooding?! Let\u2019s talk about your book though. I\u2019m still working on my first, but Yann Girard has cranked out 9 books as of March 2017; much of his advice is similar to what we suggest throughout our blog on constant promotion and audience growth. The same was true of Poornima Vijayashanker on her self-publishing experiments. There\u2019s really no magic to formatting and selling on Amazon; I just want to point to these two pieces so you understand how vital promotion is to getting success with the book, which of course leads back to the beginning of our journey on leveraging the published material as a means to gain authoritative status in your niche. If you need additional details on how to specifically self-publish on Amazon Paul Jarvis has written a monster article on how to do it \u2014 yes, I did it again, because he also speaks to the absolute importance of promoting it. Or Podcast? If writing isn\u2019t for you, the same appeal to authority can be found by hosting a niche podcast, interviewing other niche experts. This is exactly what the PositivePhil Podcast does, interviewing a wide variety of experts, which also helps to satisfy the going offline for networking purposes component to audience building \u2014 the man is always hustling! This can provide the same allure as an author, because if you remember back to the co-citation importance of authority, his constant airtime with other positive and powerful individuals gives him that similar allure. Whether you decide to focus your words onto paper or into a microphone, when it comes to building up authority, there\u2019s no better way over that 10,000 hour \u2018becoming an expert\u2019 period to actually show off your expertise. It takes time and effort to be seen as an industry expert, but by focusing on the above approach, any influencer with a desire to succeed can make it happen. ",

            "answer_text": "Preliminary The first step to good writing is reading. It is 100% necessary to be active and participatory reader before becoming a professional writer. Read good works. Read bad works. Read literary giants. Read tabloids and magazines. Fill your head with written words. Think of writing as using Lego blocks. You are only able to build certain things with certain blocks. There are limits. If for instance you only have square blocks, then you can only make those configurations. There is a reason the more complicated sets of Legos include different shapes and pieces - they offer more potentials. Your words are your blocks. You sentence structures, phrases, metaphors, etc. are never original but pilfered from life experience. The more you collect the more sophisticated your writing can become, and the more options or potentials you have in store for yourself. Once an avid reader, writing because a method of constructing not mimicking. You stop borrowing from source A and B and you start synthesizing to create all sorts of combinations of As and Bs, AAB BAA BBA ABA etc. Train No master comes to her skill without training. Malcolm Gladwell famously said we need 10,000 hours of progressive work to master material. This works out to be about 5 years of 40 hours a week - and that is to attain the mastery of your potential, not the world\u2019s. Meaning, you can play piano at increasingly difficult measures for 5 years, 40 hours a week and never become Mozart, you will simply become the best you can be based on your personal potential. To be a writer, professionally, you need to train. There are many who informally train - they write blogs, enter competitions, attend workshops, write journals etc. But the time commitment is the same. There is formal training such as degree programs or certifications - creative writing, journalism, English, majors etc. at undergraduate and graduate levels. But again, its about time commitment. Informal training works for independent, self-driven and self-motivated people. Formal training offers structure and guidance. Fail Then you have to be willing to fail. I sign my books with this phrase: \u201cCelebrate the times you have failed, and continued to try. Winning is fleeting. Learning from mistakes will last you a lifetime. Go and make as many mistakes as you can.\u201d I queried nearly a hundred agents and publishers before The Marvelous Paracosm of Fitz Faraday and the Shapers of the Id was picked up by a small, independent publisher. As for my nonfiction articles, the same was true. But each time I failed I learned what not to do. Sometimes the hardest part about being a writer is not the writing, but the promoting and the connecting. Onward! ",

            "answer_text": "What\u2019s the first step to becoming a writer? You\u2019d think it would be \u201cwrite\u201d, but it\u2019s not. In speaking to other writers and from what I know of my own journey to becoming a writer, I\u2019ve come to realize that the biggest obstacle for new writers is that they don\u2019t think of themselves as writers. They have trouble developing the belief that they are writers and yet it\u2019s something you have to do. When you haven\u2019t developed that belief, that conviction, it becomes a source of sabotage\u2013you don\u2019t value your work enough to give it the time and the space it needs. How do you come to think of yourself as a writer, especially when you\u2019re not earning a paycheck as a writer? Here are a few tips: What Happens When You Write? If you want to be a writer, I\u2019m assuming you feel you have something to say and a strong desire to say it. You may not know how you\u2019re going to say it or in what form (poetry, novel, essay, etc.) but you know something is there. Okay, you pick up your pencil or pen or you sit down to your computer or typewriter. Write something. Whatever you write, just make sure your heart is in it. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, it doesn\u2019t have to be neat. It does have to be expressive. Next, as painful as it may be, you have to show this writing to someone. It can be a friend, it can be a family member. Then, pay attention to what happens. Did the person reading your work cry, laugh or get angry? If so, you did that! It means you can have an effect with your writing. It\u2019s worth something. You have to keep going! A teenager recently wrote to me concerned because she\u2019s writing fiction and she\u2019s worried her mother will read it and get upset because she thinks it\u2019s stuff the teenager really did. On the one hand, that is a bummer to have to explain yourself to your mother, but on the other hand\u2013wow, that means the young lady\u2019s work is believeable and effective. That kind of feedback is hard to ignore. It\u2019s powerful motivation to keep you going\u2013if you take the time to notice and honor that it\u2019s happening. I once had a writer say to me, \u201cI don\u2019t know if my stuff is any good. I just know that when people read it, they cry.\u201d I told her you can\u2019t get a message any clearer than that kind of response. Now she just has to listen to it. Cultivate Silence If you\u2019re having trouble thinking about what it is you have to say, it may help you to spend some time each day in silence. Some writers pray. Some meditate. The idea is to get used to clearing your brain space and tuning in to your inner voice. You\u2019ll also be more aware of those little scraps of possibility floating around in your head that can later grow into big ideas. What Do You Want to Write? Experiment! It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t know what you want to write about. It may take a long time journaling for you to see what keeps coming up for you. And it may take longer to find the form that fits you best. I went from poetry to essays to long-form letter writing before I settled on fiction. It took me years to do that. It doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t do anything else in those genres, but what I\u2019m doing right now just fits. I encourage you to experiment until you find the form that suits your writing best. Continually Remind Yourself You Are a Writer As you develop your belief that you\u2019re a writer, it\u2019s helpful to set up reminders that will jog you back to that brain space that you need to be in to write. When you sit down to write it\u2019s easy to get distracted and starting thinking about doing laundry or what\u2019s for dinner. You\u2019ll want to have something either on your desk or on the wall in front of you that reminds you to get back to work and that you are a writer. It might be your list of values that remind you that writing is a part of who you are. It may be simple words such as CREATE or INSPIRE. Isabel Allende, who writes beautiful, historical novels will sit in her office with photos around her, old photos of people who essentially represent her characters so she\u2019s surrounded by them. That puts her back into the brain space of her book because she is sitting in their world; these people are all around her. What world do you need to be in? The journey you take to get there will be one of many you\u2019ll take as a writer. I hope these ideas will help you take those first steps. What you write\u2013and where you go from here\u2013is entirely up to you. Bon Voyage. ",

            "answer_text": "Writing like other creative mediums is an art form. Like all art forms writing also needs skill, talent, and dedication. However, these are not the only defining qualities that you'll need to become a writer. The most important qualities are patience, persistence, and perseverance. You may succeed in some forms of writing without the former three qualities but you wouldn't without the latter. You will have to devote yourself towards the artform to achieve anything. So, at the outset, it is important to make it clear that to become a writer you must be patient and persistent. Now, as the question states that you want to know the first step towards becoming a writer, I am assuming that you want to take up writing professionally. First of all, welcome to the tribe. It is not all that dry and windy out here like it was believed to be a few decades back. To become a professional writer, you must have a voice. Everyone has it, you just need to find your own. To accomplish that you'll need to read. Read extensively. There is no alternative to it. Read as much as you can. Finding your style and perfecting the tone is the most challenging part of becoming a writer. This wouldn't come till you start reading voraciously. Identify the writers you like and find the reasons you like them. This will help you in synchronizing your thought process and presenting it in an understandable manner. Without reading you wouldn't really understand the process to present an idea successfully. Understanding something and driving that point across on paper are two very different things. This is a skill you'll master with time and experience. Grammar, vocabulary and other parts of the language are the tools of any writer. I am assuming that you will have them honed by the time you actually start writing anything professionally. There is no level of perfection in writing. Even if you don't write like Charles Dickens you will do good. People never loved Ernest Hemingway any less. You don't need to put any level of difficulty in your answers just for the sake of it. Be natural. Writing is a creative form and believe me, you won't be able to fake it for long. Develop a natural form of writing. Language will get rich over a period of time as you read and write. However, style is something that needs to be mastered. It will get stuck with you and it keeps getting rigid. If you are thinking of becoming a non-fiction writer then the road is fairly smooth as presenting facts is comparatively easy. Writing fiction is a tricky business as in that sphere along with technique your level of imagination and compelling thought process also take precedence. I have observed that both types of writers feel that the other one is doing a tougher job. But, both are difficult when it comes to keeping your thoughts clear and cohesive. Again, this is something you'll learn slowly and gradually as you read and write. I am not giving you an advise to write daily or write so and so as I believe that you are already serious about it and would be doing that on your own. The first and foremost thing to do is read. Explore various styles of writings. Find someone whose style you really like. Clearly, understand the things you like about the writing and why you like it. This is a repetition of the earlier fact but it is a very important fact. This will be the beginning of building your own style. Like fingerprints, the writing styles may look similar but they are never identical. It will always have an imprint of your personality. It will make you stand out in the crowd. There may be thousands of writers but each one of them has a unique style. A tone that makes them different from others. This is a development which takes place slowly. But, this is what makes you unique. Just remain true to yourself and stick to a plan. It is an enriching journey. You will learn a lot. It will give you a lot of time for self-introspection and you will develop an eye to look closely at things and look at them from various angles. Bon Voyage! ",

            "answer_text": "How does one become an Author? To be perfectly Honest, I don\u2019t actually believe that one does! Some of us have this Naturally deep Rooted Instinct; it\u2019s just that not everyone (I include Myself In this) is Awakened by the Fact of this \u201cgift\u201d for many years and we therefore Believe ourselves to be any more capable than Writing an Essay! Surely if you don\u2019t feel that longing to begin Writing wether it be Poetry of Fiction of your own Free will, then just maybe you\u2019re not really cut out to be a Writer. In my situation, my Writing Talents just needed a trigger to begin the whole process. That trigger may present itself in many Shapes and Forms and once that happens, there\u2019s no turning back! The Ink shall Flow from the Pen onto the Sheets of Paper or alternatively I-Pad or even MacBook Screen. I find Writing on my I-Pad a lot easier than pressing Keys on a Laptop. My Hands can\u2019t cope with the complexities of a Physical Keyboard as opposed to a Virtual one. As I stated earlier, it often takes or needs a trigger to begin the Writing process in those Individuals where this may have lain Dormant for many years. My particular trigger was a TV Fantasy Drama Series made by MTV \u201cThe Shannara Chronicles.\u201d So enthralled was I by this post-Apocalyptic World of the \u201cFour Lands\u201d and an Elven Princess who had to Sacrifice her own Life to become the Ancient and Magikal ELLCRYS TREE so that she may Save her World (our World, many Thousands of Years hence) from a Daemonic Apocalypse, that I felt Inspired to Write something of my own! This initially was going to be a \u201cLong Poem\u201d but soon turned into a Story using the whole post-Apocalyptic Scenario as my Template. The main difference being that the Storyline was centred around an Intimate Relationship between the Elvenn Princess Kyreena and a Rover (Gypsy) Girl Angel. My greatest Challenge as I saw it was Dialogue! I had never Written a Word of Dialogue in my Life; let alone in a Fantasy Story. To begin with a followed the Dialogue as Scripted for the TV Drama until I eventually developed the confidence to Write my own. Now it comes as \u201cSecond Nature\u201d and I often really enjoy Creating this. Take a given Situation in which 2 People may have to Interact with one another and then Create a Conversation which they may share but at the same time, one that is actually Believed. \u00a7 Lucie Lou Snowfall \u00a7 / 2019.

            "answer_text": "There is no thumb rule to writing a whole book at a time for the first time. Once you do complete a book, that's when you look back at the chaos you left behind and pick up from there. We learn and improve and mature with every page you write. Every twist or maybe a page you write gives you more clarity about where your chapter is headed. The best way would be to first write down a summary of the idea you have in head. Keep it seperate from your actual story but handy so you can look at it time and again to know of you are on track. You can keep updating it as you move along in the story, since you will tend to find new things to improve it as you keep writing and the more you write the better your story gets. Also, on a seperate page like the summary, keep a seperate page to map the characters. It does not need to be complete before you start writing, you can keep adding to it as you go along. This helps because as you get deeper into your story, you may tend to forget to build characters or the fact that they could your story better than you imagined. Having the map in front of you will help you make use of them better. And finally, just write, you may love or you may hate what you write, but at least you haven't lost the idea or sat on it. Once you write it, you have the tempo to move on or you have content you can rework and fix or it helps you know that it may not be needed at all. That is what editing and reworking is all about, but that happens later. You first put ideas to words, let them flow even if disconnected, you can connect them later, but if you lose tempo or forget getting it back won't be easy. Target writing about a page a day (there will be days you can't, but then aiming for it keeps the hunger to write alive) Keeps revisions of your work (you never know you may like an older version better), don't just throw everything way. In the final edit you can pick and scult your story based on everything you need. Noone gets the story right in the first draft. Even experienced writers finish, read, rework, fix, read again, rework again and continue till then finally appreciate the final product. The important thing is to love it yourself. Whether other like it or not comes later. Write for yourself and not for others, that is the only way you can be true to your skill and art. Then leave it to people to decide whether they like it or not. You will have learnt a whole deal lot about writing a book by then. ",

Thoughts become our actions and intentions, so long long before writing a book we must review our thinking; put it to print; review, reread and edit it for another and another go-then get feedback and editorial support on the way to having anything worth putting in a book that may benefit others and yourself for the effort. I was told once and it stuck: \u201ctight writing is the result of tight thinking!\u201d Have you checked your thinking; really checked it? Have you obtained feedback? We all have a flair or style but if it\u2019s not unusual, interesting, exceptional\u2026 it won\u2019t garner much interest, following or reimbursement. Assuming you have a winning flair or style to assist presenting your position-what is your position, point, thesis? There are very very few completely original new ideas that haven\u2019t already been poised and or printed (more likely none;) so your starting point is what? An old idea rewritten? How novel? That may work, sort of!? So where to start? Pick an idea that resonates with you and will be of interest to others. The subject should suit you, not be so far beyond you that it fails spectacularly or dismally; unless your intent is humor, sarcasm, witticism or plonk. So given you have an idea you have thought well about and want to write about; who is your intended audience:preschoolers, skateboarders, politicians, cosmologists\u2026? Ok, so you have thought and thought very well about quarks and black holes-what do you want to say to who? Writing well starts with thinking well; then as a wall builder who has experience and knowledge-moves on with construction. Wrong foundation, wrong materials, wrong procedure and steps leads to wall collapse-so to with a sentence, letter, journal entry or book. All parts are necessary to get cohesion-staying power, support and finished product-be that wall, sentence story or book. Suggestion: read, read, talk, think-repeat, repeat-then get good support to write your book. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I want to be a writer, what is the first step? Do you write with your feet? ::: From the usual development of a child, we can learn from teachers and parents as to how to get used to the letters of the alphabet and how to write these down and keep writing these down till we become ready, willing and able to respond to what is required of us in the School lessons. Homework is usually the way we learn to develop a more free attitude towards the use of words and descriptions and characterisations, too. I remember the required essay on the MY DIARY experiences. This chore was forced upon the class and we ploughed our way through the usual ways to stretch out the words across each line. We had no desire to relate our boring days to our teacher. Just a few words on each line was my way of rebelling against this chore. However, as I approached the last years of Junior School, I learnt enough to give my Headmaster something to think about. He set the class a task we\u2019d never encountered before. We were to describe a piece of music that he played for us. It was lively and forceful. I described what I felt was happening and he wandered around the class to see what was being written. When he saw how furiously I was writing, he was amazed. At the end of the task, he chose my words to be read out to the class. That wasn\u2019t my intent, as I was only trying to please him. The rest of the class wasn\u2019t even on my mind. At a later time, when I was keenly interested in poetry, I had a book that outlined different writing styles for poems. I came across a poem called YOU BID ME TRY. This was about a poet being challenged to write a poem. So he wrote it in a special poetry style, one I\u2019d never even have considered. I was interested in the way that the poet was enthusiastic, rather than merely showing off. He was pleasing an audience of one and yet eventually his words were to be included in the book I held in my hands at that time. It was as if I had been guided to it. It was as if I had been encouraged to write on the spot like he had done. I remember others who could do this. Famous songwriter Sammy Cahn could write songs one after another. He explained this in his autobiography, I SHOULD CARE. I was interested in writing songs and also came across Sammy\u2019s Rhyming Dictionary for songs. He explained how he had memorised hundreds of songs. I\u2019ve written hundreds of songs, too, yet can only remember a few, in part, just snatches of the words yet more often I can remember various tunes. I lived in the times of the Beatles and Brit Pop was really on top as far as I was concerned. So I became aware of different music styles and performances. I could appreciate great singers as well as those who read poems that had been set to music. When it came to writing songs, I checked the libraries for further advice and found it quite easily. I gained from such advice and continued writing for years. One day, I realised that the names of the girls I fell in love with kept changing, while the lovey-dovey romantic phrases remained the same. I fell out of love with love songs and very soon I stopped being involved with songs. Only rarely writing some new song. I concentrated on poetry from then on. I am sharing my thoughts about my experiences because my writing journey has spanned decades and rarely have I received enough money to make any sense out of being a writer at all. So I wouldn\u2019t advise anybody to become a writer. It\u2019s like a vocation as if you become an unpaid evangelist. You share what\u2019s on your mind or what\u2019s come to mind. Many writers can begin a brand new story or poem and get somewhere with these so much so they become established writers. Their works regarded highly, money coming in and so on. Most of us invest our time and money yet without a fair reward for doing so. It\u2019s sometimes called vanity publishing since publishers exist to share both the brilliant and the average. They make money, we don\u2019t. Even so, should we choose to become writers, there are writing classes we can attend and learn what\u2019s what and what\u2019s not. We can progress just by studying punctuation and so on and on and on. We can use Internet resources like the grammarly-dot-com error checking for our documents and even store a copy online after checking and revising the text. We can use free images for our web sites and blogs and other interests. We can benefit from web sites like unsplash-dot-com and pixabay-dot-com as well as favourite images found on pinterest-dot-com or Google search results. So we won\u2019t be as limited as previous generations were. My concern is towards creating poetry I can help others read easily the very first time. I keep editing a new poem and read it several times to get the phrases working well. I recommend using a computer so as to create different versions during the writing and editing times. title1a.rtf and title1b.rtf to start off with and then continuing with further name changes to identify the updated versions. You know, like switching lines or verses around to create a better flow. The initial draft is up for grabs. It isn\u2019t considered the be all and end all of the new poem. What matters is not the writing but the dedication to getting a finished product. It may depend on the intended audience but the Internet users grab what we write and use it elsewhere. I wrote a poem about Wonder Woman saying how lovely she was and later found the same poem being used on another web site praising the beauty of cats and kittens. Some of my Stephen Gayford poems have been used by English Literature teachers to develop their students to appreciate poetry and the way it was written, what descriptions were employed, characterisations and whether the poem had a pleasant or inspiring conclusion. Maybe a funny poem was chosen, such as I AM AN ELEPHANT! In any case, my 2,300+ poems are on the poemhunter-dot-com website. These may be downloaded as a complete collection in the form of a PDF file. I update some poems every now and then and save the updated collection to make that available instead. Many of the poemhunter poems are found elsewhere on various poetry collections and poetry databases. So a Google search can find these if the titles are known. That\u2019s how I found my poems on other websites and PDF files, too. All of this info is to explain a journey so that others can see that money isn\u2019t the chief concern. It\u2019s basically being called to be a writer in some fashion, for a general purpose or just becoming a dabbler, not restricting ourselves to just one course of action. I can write poems and poems, various poetry styles, songs, stories and parables. I can imitate how others would sing songs or recite poems. I can imagine how an actor would portray such words if sharing the text on YouTube and it\u2019s no big deal. Many children can do what the adults would do. It\u2019s all about being dedicated enough to follow whatever talents exist or may yet exist. It\u2019s like Smallville, the TV series, in which Clark Kent learns how to develop his range of superpowers, even to the point that he can fly like Supergirl. We see how he can use super strength and supervision and micro vision, too. He is even equipped with Kryptonian instincts that are superior to here on Earth. A writer follows ideas and develops instincts, learning to listen to phrases that come as thoughts that are meant to spark more than an interest for just a few seconds. So a title can lead to a poem, a song or a story. If not followed, it remains as it was. To become a writer is nothing new. The themes remain the same as before. Either fact or fantasy. Either basic or complex. The language kept simple or deliberately eloquent. But is the writer just playing with words for personal pleasure or trying to please a few educated minds or reaching out to try to help Mankind? Complex words? Yeah, great, super, wonderful, marvellous, but not meant for one and all. Remember, the people aren\u2019t going to send us loadsa money. Poetry and poverty aren\u2019t just words that are close to each other in the dictionary. But sell just one pop song and you can buy a house. If that\u2019s all you require from being a writer, then good luck with that. The other end of the scale is living as a writer and dying as a martyr because of the importance of what you write and believe. The Christian apostles lived for Jesus and died for Jesus, all because of the promise of Heaven. If there\u2019s no opposition to what each of us may write, then maybe we aren\u2019t effective writers after all. If we don\u2019t make other writers jealous of what we can do, then maybe we ain\u2019t all we think we are. But\u2026 if we truly know we\u2019re meant to write and to keep writing, then what on Earth is it that we\u2019re REALLY meant to be writing about? What will stand the test of time? What will prove of profit to Mankind, not just our bank accounts? And are we willing to count the cost and to pay the cost? Imagine the pens and the papers, the computers and the printers, the cost of Broadband and the hours spent just checking our emails\u2026 then the checking of errors in the text, the updating of current events, facts and figures and so on. I tell you, there are days when the computer drives me crackers, when the poems just don\u2019t work right, when ideas get rejected or overlooked or sabotaged. It\u2019s no wonder that any success is regarded as a miracle! PRAISE THE LORD! ",

If you read inside your genre you can see all the things they are doing that you need to do, and also what they aren\u2019t doing that can make you stand out. Outside your genre, you can pick up tricks to help round out your writing. Reading is important, but you can\u2019t call yourself a writer if you don\u2019t write. There are a lot of people out there talking about writing and tweeting about writing and setting up their perfect writer\u2019s nook and messing around with fonts, but they aren\u2019t writing.Learn to write poorly.

There\u2019s an aura of charming authenticity around the self taught artist, and it\u2019s a lie. There are thousands of artists who have gone down your path, fallen into mistakes and successes, and now offer insights. You\u2019re a fool if you don\u2019t take them up on it.

Many a time we fear to start new things, sometimes because we fear that we wont be good at it and we will be made fun of or maybe because we fear that we can never do even a decent job compared to all the great people who have been there or maybe purely because of procrastination. As for me after reading a great book I was afraid 'what good amid these' I would be !! So whenever i started to write just after writing a paragraph i would edit it re edit it and again edit it till i get bored or frustrated and let it go. I tried many things. a blog, writing short stories, poems, essays about my friends and all but all i could manage are few short stories, two days of blogging, a couple of poems and emotional pieces about my friends. And now answering questions on Quora. This is my second question and i hope this won't be my last. look.. from what i see, i feel, i failed because i quit. didn't try hard enough. If you have a passion for writing don't give up, no matter how stupid it looks and what people say. you will only get better. One advice though. Never let your work look like a copy. I believe that literature has to be original, we already have a lot of copies of copies of copies (fight club reference. yes i know. ironic). Well thats all i could manage to write. I am bored :P If you me to add more, you could always text. ",

If you want to write a book then you need to find yourself a tribe, or a community or group of likeminded people who are willing to encourage, offer critique, help you stick to deadlines and make you accountable. This is perhaps the funnest way to go about writing a book. There is always that image of someone locked up in a room writing the hours away, but I tell you, doing it in a friendly setting with the criteria I mentioned above will benefit you tons and uplift your spirits everyday. I practice here: The Write Practice - The Write Practice and I honestly believe it to be THE best community for writers. You say you want to write a book \u2014 TWP will motivate you and help you get started. You want to practice \u2014 TWP will help you to do that too. I get no monetary compensation in return for telling you about the group. Nada. But telling you about it gives me immeasurable pleasure. There\u2019s one place you can find me any day of the year.

Then you write a bunch of stuff that is slightly less crappy.  Then you keep writing, and maybe most of it still sucks.  After many, many years of doing this, you become a decent writer.  Then you keep on writing.  You must write for 10,000 hours before you achieve mastery, which is the threshold at which someone might actually want to publish you. It helps if you have people who tell you how much and exactly how you suck, but you have to be willing to listen to them: In writing workshops, the rule is that you are not allowed to talk (in particular, defend) when other people are discussing and criticizing your writing.  This is an especially good mindset to develop so that you can set aside your natural reaction to ego-wounding and learn to accept criticism in order to improve. In summary, the steps to becoming an author are:  Write a lot.When you get criticism about your writing, focus on figuring out how it is valid, rather than how it is invalid.Keep writing a lot.In between all that, it might be useful to have some interesting life experiences.

It helps with the picture of you that I have in my mind. A very clever question, I must say. Clever because it is always better to look before you leap, according to an age old truism. Considering the prospect of becoming an author as a job, presupposes that you are qualified as a writer or you intend to qualify yourself in some or other way to become a writer. That being the case, you have to be able to afford to be without an income, or have a steady income until your book sales can support you. There is no time limit in that respect as it may take a long time before you hit the road to riches. Once you have started writing, you have to have some start-up money, should you want to self-publish, as there are some considerable costs involved. Once you find a publisher to publish and sell your books then he burden will lift somewhat. To start off with, you have to at least, have a publishable and sale-able book or two to publish, of course. You may need some guidance that may require an agent to help you over the few bumps in the road. That\u2019s about it. How long it will take to earn a live-able income depends on your talent, skills and dedication. Good luck, my dear. It is rewarding to create another world for people to delve into.

(And by system I mean magic system or physics system, where magic or physics act the way you want them to; such as: (For Physics System: You may want to have it where the planet you start your story on doesn\u2019t have as strong gravity as the real world so you research and make sure that the inhabitants of your planet jump really high or everything falls slower, etc. (For Magic System: Pretty much the same as the Physics System, except there would be no research involved. You can have people be able to shoot fire from their hands or whatever, but you make limits to what they can do. ",

            "answer_text": "FWIW, I suggest you start following these published writers: Mercedes R. Lackey James Altucher User-13574788118874627179 Tom Occhipinti Their expertise and experience count for more than my opinions. Now, on with the show\u2026 From what I can gather, the traditional approach requires an author to submit his/her manuscripts to an agent, and not directly to a publisher. Why? Because it is the agent\u2019s job to separate the professional, well-written manuscripts from the dross of poorly-written, poorly-formatted material that\u2019s known as the \u201cslush pile\u201d\u2014  (photo stolen from Mercedes R. Lackey) ALL of the manuscripts in this picture were unsolicited by the agent; all are poorly prepared. (Some are apparently hand-written (!), in spite of the proliferation of computers in the past 30 or 40 years\u2026) Whether they are any good or not does not matter, because they will NOT be read by the agent; because they are so poorly formatted, they send a signal that someone is too lazy to properly prepare a manuscript. Into the trash they go.  You need to find out how to format your manuscript: Scribophile (How to Format a Novel Manuscript) How to Format a Manuscript - The Specifics Guidelines You Need Manuscript Format : Novel Format Then you could consider going to the WGA website (east or west) and finding a list of agencies in New York City (or elsewhere): Agents & Agencies (WGA East) Signatory Agents (WGA West) The reason so many writers live in New York is because they want to meet agents face to face and make a stronger impression. I have never lived in New York city, but there are forums that will let you learn some info about finding apartments there: New York City Forum (City-Data.com) \u2026However, there is a new trend among publishers: some of the smaller ones will accept manuscripts that are submitted directly by authors who do not have agents:  You\u2019ll have to search for one that publishes the sort of material that you write. And, last but not least, you might want to read a book that has a blank sample contract that authors might be asked to sign:  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to break this down into some easy steps: Establish a routine, share with your friends, revise according to criticism, seek professional help, share with the community, and make bank. 1. Establish the routine. Regardless of whether you write out what you want to write about or if you just write to discover what you want to write about, you\u2019re going to want to find a way to keep yourself writing. I know some of you have high stress jobs, and you just don't have the willpower after work to write after work. You might have to write like crazy on the weekend. You might have to write before you go to work or make writing part of your de-stressing routine. De-stressing not distressing. The important part is that whatever you decide, you\u2019re going to want to keep in consistent. Sit down with the same cup of coffee, tea, or whatever your poison, in your house, with your laptop, with a pad of paper, your inkwell and quill, or your typewriter. Once you have yourself set up, spend the entire allotted time to writing. Worry about research later, outside of your writing time, as if you worry about details, you\u2019re going to spend the whole time researching, or God forbid, watching adorable cat videos. 2. Share with your Friends If you don\u2019t have friends yet, it\u2019s time to make some. A good way to do it is to look up some acquaintances from high school. Say, hey, it\u2019s your old pal from high school, I finished writing this story and wanted to know what you thought of it. People hate reading. They\u2019ll often talk about things they\u2019ve read in high school, but it\u2019ll be like pulling out toe-nails to get them to read your work. If it\u2019s been a week and you haven\u2019t heard anything on twenty pages, just poke them and say, hey, have you finished reading my piece yet? (They would have told you if they did, so it\u2019s clear they didn\u2019t). Say, it would mean a lot to me if you did. If you could just read it until it gets boring and let me know where that first boring part is, it would be a great help! Don\u2019t contact them again unless they message you first\u2014you already tried once, and you don\u2019t want to become obnoxious. My personal advice is don\u2019t share the same piece with the same person. If they read it once, then chances are you didn\u2019t respond to every piece of advice that they gave you. Share it with the next person instead, and see where those pieces of advice intersect. If they say to change the same thing, chances are that you need to change it. 3. Revise according to Criticism So you see all the places that people have told you to change things\u2014it\u2019s going to be hard because they\u2019ll tell you large swathes of work are boring that you need to be there out of technicality. Let\u2019s just try to listen to them for once. Don\u2019t change the things that are absolutely essential for the piece, but all other things, let them be up for grabs. You can always go back to the original piece if you don\u2019t end up liking how things turn out. Give it some time. When you first write it, you had a good experience writing it and remember the very act of creation being a good one. Looking back at what you created in a week, a month, or even a year can be an eye-opening experience. What you wrote in a flurry of inspiration is riddled with typos, you clearly just rewrote a sitcom that you watched earlier in the week, and you tried to do an accent, just because you haven\u2019t done accents before, and it\u2019s some fake country accent that anybody would quickly deride. Correct the errors, change it to be original, and take out that accent\u2014or maybe ask somebody with an accent to proof it for you\u2014hey that could work! 4. Seek Professional Help Seriously, get help. You can send your work off to a professional novelist who advertises for helping with manuscripts. You can join a writing class in your local community. Attend a big writing conference where authors talk about writing like AWP. In addition to that, you\u2019re going to want to read craft books. Not arts and crafts, of course, I\u2019m talking about serious books by authors talking about how to write well in your genre, whether you\u2019re writing poetry, screenplays, novels, or video games, you\u2019re going to want to see how the best do it. Now lastly, if you\u2019re loaded with money\u2014you might consider a bachelor\u2019s in Creative Writing, followed by an MFA. It\u2019s not for everyone, but what you can learn from a close mentor and peers will forward your writing in what you would do on your own by about ten years experience, if you do what you\u2019re supposed to\u2014like you actually read the books, do the exercises, and respond well to criticism. If you\u2019re unwilling to do any of those things, then maybe the schooling just isn\u2019t for you. You can always do all your own reading and arrive at some very well written stories if you're particularly talented and have good taste. 5. Share with the Community I think at this point, you\u2019ve written your novel or a handful of short stories. You\u2019ve revised. Maybe you\u2019ve gone through school. Some of your peers are saying that your work is ready for publication, as in it\u2019s as good as it\u2019s going to be. There are some who would suggest immediately that you ought to self-publish. Although it\u2019s a viable path to take, you\u2019ve put far too much work into writing to take the back-path now. You\u2019re going to want to make a listing of all the publications that you want your work to be in. Yours might look a little bit different than others. At the very top, you\u2019ll want to have the notable publications\u2014for me, that would be the well known magazines like the New Yorker, the Atlantic Monthly, Harper\u2019s, and so on. Check to see their submission guidelines, read some of their issues to know what you\u2019re submitting to, and write a good cover letter saying a little bit about yourself and what you like about the magazine. Chances are, you will get a rejection notice or you won\u2019t receive anything back and after the allotted time, you know your story is ready to submit to somewhere else. Save your rejection notices and look for any positive feedback that you might receive. Often times, you\u2019ll have standard pre-written responses for rejection, but look for ones that deviate from the standard response. If you couldn\u2019t tell yet, this is a long, patient process. You might look then for notable online publications, regional magazines, university magazines, or small publications. Look for what pays, look for what agents are reading, and look for what has a larger reader-base. I like to look at where the big awards are being pulled from like the O\u2019Henry prize stories. You\u2019ll be more likely to win such prizes if you\u2019re being read in those same publications. As you can imagine, this will require a little research on your end of things. 6. Make Bank A joke. I hope you weren\u2019t expecting to make any money off of this. Daniel J. Dupuy +JMJ+ ",

Pay attention to the WRITING parts as well as the BUSINESS parts. That kills most new writers faster than a bad review. LEARN the BUSINESS of writing. Next, read. Read everything on everything. Learn how experienced writers use language to express their thoughts, emotions, and ideas. Read dime store crap, and the greatest novels in western civilization. Read it all. Read every night before you go to bed. Next, learn your craft. Take courses and study the use of grammar and language. Take a poetry class. Yea, boring as heck, but true poetry (not this modern stuff) will teach you how to use language to paint a scene. And get a word a day calendar. You need to know a lot of words if you are going to be using them. And be sure your classes are taught by tight-a$$es. You want hard critiques of your work. This is the time to learn, not be pampered. If you just want to be pampered then give your stories to your mom. She'll kiss you on the forehead and put your story on the refrigerator. But no one else will ever see them. Finally, write. That's right, write. Everyone wants to be a writer, but no one wants to do the work involved. If you want to be a writer then you have to write something every day. Write about anything, but write. Good luck. ",

The Door Test is a very simple procedure: Open a door that has two handles, one on each side.Grab a door handle with each hand so you are facing the edge of the door.While holding onto the handles within eighteen inches or so (or half a meter) of your body, bend forward with great force, causing your head to collide with the edge of the door. Do it with sufficient force to create severe pain and dizziness.Repeat steps one, two, and three until you are rendered unconscious.Upon recovery, if you still want to be a writer, repeat steps one through four, or stab yourself with a knitting needle.If you still want to be a writer, check yourself into a mental hospital.On the other hand, if you are very rich and don\u2019t have to work, do whatever you want, but understand that writing will bring you nothing but rejection, humiliation, and disappointment.",

            "answer_text": "Recently, I've been thinking of a quote/adage I picked up back in university: \"Writers write. Authors edit.\" If anyone can attribute that back to a source, please feel free to leave me the citation in a comment.  Now, I'm extrapolating your question to mean \"good author\" or \"known author.\" The designation \"published author\" is easy to achieve with modern self-publishing, but huge tracts of self-published worked are clearly first drafts.  To be a \"good\" author - \"good\" being very subjective of course - you need to edit, especially with your audience in mind. If you're writing fiction, refine it to the greatest impact. If you're writing non-fiction, then make sure it is clear, concise, and easy to read. Whatever you write, make sure it's the best it can be. And always get feedback. You don't have to agree with your feedback, but you need some. You may be Hemingway in your own mind, but there's no guarantee others will agree unless you ask them. Ask friends who are willing to be honest and who like your genre of writing. Don't ask your mother. If you don't know anyone personally, there are online communities that critique each other's work. Check out Critters Writers Workshop, for example. Make edits based on the critiques if you feel it improves your work.  But if all you want is to see your name in print, sign up for any of a host of ebook publishing platforms: Kindle, Barnes and Noble, Kobo, iBooks, Smashwords, and so on. Write something and put it up. It's just that simple. ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing you need to really understand is that writing is not a goal, but a journey. You never reach the end. Do some reading. What do you like about certain authors\u2019 writing styles? How can you incorporate their styles into yours? Do not write like them; write like you, using their techniques to enhance your style. Before you start, you must be adept with the tools of the trade: spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc. Unless you know how to use the tools, your work will be crap. You need a story (easy part), then you need to develop the story (hard part). Almost every book is about people facing challenges, overcoming obstacles, being fallible and human. Stay away from superheroes unless you can make them believable. Have a plot, a story arc. Place yourself inside the story and write it from there. Become intimate with your characters, scenes, dialog, the period when the story takes place, and everything that will end up on your pages. Never believe your first draft will be a winner. It will suck, believe me. That\u2019s okay. Edit, re-edit, and re-re-edit until your work is smooth and compelling. Enlist the help of others to critique your work. Join a writer\u2019s group. The opinions of others can be worth its weight in gold. Get your book professionally edited. It will be worth it. Oh yes, if you think you\u2019re going to make a million with your first book, forget it! Be grateful to be able to afford a pizza every month with your winnings. That is reality. Still, writing is like fishing: you\u2019re always hoping to catch the \u201cbig one\u201d and you\u2019re willing to do what it takes to make it possible with the right hooks and enticing bait.

But if you go in expecting to be perfect from the get-go, you\u2019ll probably end up giving up in dismay/anger in a few months.Read a lot. Write more.Figure out whether you prefer to plan or just start writing and see what happens. Most people end up somewhere along this spectrum. (Personally, I like to write out a very basic plan with plot points to hit, and then start writing and do my best to keep to those points, but if I stray it\u2019s not a big deal.)Keep writing. That\u2019s the only way to be sure you\u2019ll improve. Courses, tips, tricks - they can be useful, but the only surefire way to get better at writing is to keep writing.A good technique is to try \u201cfree-writing\u201d if you haven\u2019t already. All you do is sit down in front of an empty page of a notebook or empty word document, set a timer (usually for five, ten or twenty minutes) and then write whatever pops into your head. Doesn\u2019t have to be a story. Just write. It loosens you up and can surprise you with the creativity you prompt in yourself.",

            "answer_text": "First of all, why do you want to be a writer? And secondly, why do you want to write \u2018a book\u2019? Because trust me\u2026 you probably don\u2019t even know what the real job is about. That\u2019s the reason why, if we are talking about writing novels, I disagree with the previous answers. 1) you should start with \u2018scenes\u2019. Scenes are incomplete parts of a SINGLE plot. Until you can\u2019t master the art of writing good scenes trying to write \u2018a book\u2019 is entirely useless. 2) you should then start trying to master the art of writing \u2018short tales\u2019 because if you can\u2019t master the art of writing a short tales trying to write a book is entirely useless. 3) you should then start trying to become a good writer at writing descriptions. Creating a image inside the reader\u2019s mind is extremely difficult but, sometimes, you just need it. As a matter of facts, it\u2019s more a matter of choosing what to describe NOT. Descriptions are the most difficult part of writing and yet, you should do your best to become a decent writer at writing desciptions anyway. 4) you should then start trying to become proficient with characters development, because when writing a novel, you spend much more time with your characters rather than when you write a short tale and you must build them up much more seriously then the way you are used to do. Points 1\u20134 are just the first and biggest parts of the creative process only. Beginners usually focus on the creative process only as if style was a non-existing problem. On the other side, for me introducing you to the basics of style would require me to write here a full book, so I won\u2019t even start indroducing you the main points. On the contrary, I will give you just a a single one million dollar advice: In order to become a good writer, you have to be a bad writer first. Take your favourite writers,ok? Now take the one of them who has the simpliest style of them all. Take something you wrote in the past and compare your stile to the style of this very famous writer. If you honestly don\u2019t see where his style is far, far, far better then yours, and you see a difference in terms of \u2018content-only\u2019\u2026 Congratulations! You are a bad writer, and now you know it. You are so ignorant about your job that you can\u2019t even see how his style is better then yours. Now you know it. A good beginner is able to see how much his style sucks compared to famous writers. As a matter of facts, it usually takes years just to start \u2018seeing\u2019 it. That\u2019s the reason why I use to say that to become a good writer, you have to be a bad one first. ",

TravelThe world is far too big to be summed up by someone who has not seen the way of life of others living in a different part of the globe. Add on to your experiences so you build up a repertoire of exciting, wondrous tales that you can narrate or share with others.   2. Be adventurous with your reading habitsRead books, magazines, poetry- old classics, upcoming authors- every brilliant piece of literature that exists on this planet.Every person has something to say, a story to tell and you will never find that out if you are confined to a particular taste. You don't have to inculcate it in your writing necessarily but even a single sentence can be an inspiration for a new novel. Hence, the reason we are obsessed with quotes and excellent one-liners. 3. VolunteerI have found that old people at shelter homes or young children in orphanages often have a unique, unbiased and enchanting view towards life. Perhaps it stems from the fact that they don't have anything to lose so they can be honest and unhindered by the societal pressures in their opinions.Their stories of life are by far the most compelling I have heard and it is only in such sadness that we find the beauty of life which you can put in your writing.After all, we all hope to change the world with our words so the more heartfelt your writing is, the better it will be.All the best! :) ",

It\u2019s not just the writing you do, it\u2019s also all of the planning, plot structure, correct word use, punctuation, and character development. If you really want to be a writer, do it for the love of it. It has nothing to do with fame or attention. People who do that are making a big mistake. Writing is a great experience that some people can do it with the talent, but know that not every person has it that easy. Just do whatever you want to do in your life, let it be a writer, musician, actor, whatever. If you have what it takes, then do it. ",

That\u2019s not going to get you anywhere. Just because your stuff sucks now doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll suck forever, and you have to suck before you can be any good, unless you were born as some writing prodigy or something. Also, the first draft of everything is terrible, even novels written by professional, highly skilled writers. It\u2019s a universal rule.Write because you enjoy it: You might have heard of people talking about writing like it\u2019s some kind of \u201cartistic struggle\u201d and how it\u2019s \u201cpainful\u201d to get the words out. Someone once said \u201cWriting is easy. You sit at a typewriter and open a vein.\u201d The writer\u2019s struggle is a farce, or at least I hope it is, because if this many writers are torturing themselves we kind of have a problem. You should write because it\u2019s fundamentally enjoyable, not out of some painful artistic obligation. You wouldn\u2019t play soccer for the feeling of grass burns on your knees, so why would you write for the feeling of mental torture? Just let loose and have some fun.Read a lot: Strong writers are also strong readers, because they learn from the material they read. You\u2019ll do yourself a disservice if you only read one genre, but it is important to read lots of books in the genre you\u2019re writing - for example, if you\u2019re writing fantasy, read lots of fantasy, both good and bad, but also mix some other genres in there to keep your worldview wide. Books on writing are also really helpful, both for theory\u2019s sake and for learning practical skills.",

I might say that have authored some novels, but I\u2019d be far more likely to say (if I\u2019m asked, especially in a social situation) that I have written some books, or even say that I have had some published, but the word \u201cauthor\u201d as a self-descriptive makes me cringe because to me, it sounds like the user is putting on airs. Because I write fiction, I most often describe myself as a novelist. But however you label yourself, before you can claim the status of author, I think you need to be published. ",

Maybe the first step to be a good writer is to be a good listener and an avid reader! And maybe some stories are as successful as they are because somewhere the authors connect with their readers somehow\u2026 Also like very frequently said to see a rainbow we must have some rain! We can not truly write our heart out unless we are hurt..unless somewhere even for a bit our world was crushed or we struggled for simple pleasures and happiness in life or we have had absolute joy, peace and calm. A good novel is basically just a good story As a reader I like stories i can associate with\u2026stories than have an influence on me! The greatest stories for me are the ones which change me and make an imprint on my life! Like literally i am some other person before starting to read and by the time i am finished it is somehow that i lived the novel, that somehow i feel a growth or change in myself no matter how small!

Make it a game.Write one word, any word.Then go for a walk.When you come back, read your word and write a sentence based on the first thing that comes to mind.Then, in your mind, play with that sentence. Go for another walk (having a dog really helps!).When you return, add another sentence to it. Play the game by seeing where it takes you. You will be surprised.If you find yourself getting up in the morning with a need to write, you are a writer. Just keep practicing. That being said, writes don\u2019t always feel passionate about writing. Sometimes, many times, they need self-discipline to sit down and do the work. Another activity a writer does is research. As a technical writer I do more research than writing. I also do a lot of walking. Getting a dog helps because it justifies why you go around the park 10 times every morning; you are walking your dog (or perhaps the dog is walking you). Have fun and thanks for the question. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re asking about writing fiction, though I guess my advice is true for non-fiction as well. First of all, What A J Kohler (below) says is spot on. If your English (or whatever language you\u2019re planning to write in) skills are lacking, you can\u2019t write a readable book. The rule I remember hearing that really made sense to me is that you can\u2019t break the rules (and every genre has rules) unless you know them, so polish your grammar, your spelling, your sentence and paragraph construction. Learn what makes dialogue work and the tenets of storytelling. If you\u2019re comfortable with your skills, you need to figure out what you want to write and read in that genre. I have always loved romances, mainly because one of the tropes of the genre is that there has to be a happy, or at the very least, satisfactory, ending for the protagonists. Before I ever wrote a word, I read a lot of romances, figured out which authors appealed to me and used their style as a rough guideline for my own work. I wrote my first book, one that will never see the light of day, but it taught me that I could finish a book, that I knew how to write a beginning, a middle, and an end, and I learned things in the process of writing it that gave me the confidence to seriously pursue a career as an author. I joined Romance Writers of America where I attended panels and workshops with authors whose books I had read and enjoyed, and the networking at conferences proved to be more valuable even than the workshops. I met editors, publishers, production people, but most important, I met other authors. I\u2019m not sure how it is in other genres, but I\u2019ve found the community of romance authors to be amazingly helpful with those of us learning our way. The policy of paying it forward is alive and well with so many of the wonderfully talented folks I\u2019ve met over the past twenty or so years, and many of them have helped me, and continue to help me, as my career ebbs and flows as so many do. My 67th book was just published last week, and I\u2019m currently working to bring out some of my reverted titles. I guess my best advice to new writers would be to know the language, read the kinds of books you hope to write, and then write something that\u2019s totally different. It doesn\u2019t take long for a writer to discover their voice, that manner of throwing words together that\u2019s entirely their own, but you have to write a lot of words to find that personality in your work. So the best advice I can give you is to write. Set aside time every day to put words on paper (or on a screen!) but don\u2019t give up. And, as AJ Kohler said, don\u2019t quit the day job. That comes after you\u2019ve established yourself as an author. Best of luck to you. ",

Summon all your energy together, meditating about the thing you want to write, and all the words will come to you easily. If this is also hard, try to do an experiment. For 1 month write everyday about 4 pages. Try to write them extremely fast. Don't think too much about what you are writing, but continue. Don't ever read what you wrote. After you wrote the 4 pages, put them on you desk, and don't read them! Do this for 1 month, and after that you may read and see how much you evolve from your first to the last page. Why to do all of this? Because it's necessary to improve your skills being a natural and an original writer. Before you start your experiment, if you choose to do it, read C. Bukowski - So, you want to be a writer. Being authentic it's the most important philosophy that can makes a difference between you and others. Good luck! ",

Really, that's it.Read lots in whatever subject area and/or genre you most enjoy, because you can get excited about it. Then you start writing stuff down which excites you. Once you've got the writing bug, you can start refining technique. Listen to writing podcasts, watch online lectures, and join a writing group (online or in person). But keep reading and writing. Then you can start learning about the industry you're getting into: agents, editors, big publishers, small presses, modern indie publishing, and how they all work. But keep reading and writing. Learn about everything that surrounds the writing life, and how to manage your writing time whilst maintaining a day job, by following successful authors in your chosen area and seeing how they do it. But keep reading and writing. If you get all that down, you can expand your reading and perhaps your writing into new areas which spark your interest or which have things to teach you. There is a lot to get to grips with, and you'll never stop learning about the craft and the business, but there are two things you must do: keep reading and writing. HTH K ",

Be it novels, newspapers, magazines, journals, sex stories, spiritual content etc. Anything you can think about should be read by you. Reading from different sources makes you think in different ways, which will help you while writing.Write. Write as much as you can. You can write answers on Quora. You can write letters to the celebrities you like to tell them how much you admire them. You can write to the politicians asking them to do some work(anything) in your locality. You can put RTIs. The more you write, the more you learn.You might be confused about where you should start from. If yes, then the answer is anywhere. Just as a circle doesn't have any edge, you should not wait to find an edge to improve your skill. Just pick a pen, and start writing. If stuck somewhere, pick a book and try to find how other writer has written his content regarding that particular topic where you are stuck. ",

That let me build up a clippings book that I could take to a newspaper and look for a job as a part-time \u201cstringer,\u201d covering municipal council meetings in Greater Vancouver. That led to the newspaper assigning me feature stories to write, as well as a more or less constant beat to cover anything that happened on campus. Eventually, I was taken on as summer staff. That gave me enough experience to get a job as news editor on a suburban weekly, then editor of a weekly tabloid on Vancouver Island. That led to a job offer to be assistant to a newly elected Member of Parliament, where I discovered I had a natural knack for writing speeches. I then spent more than forty years as a speechwriter, mostly freelancing. Could a beginner follow the same path today? Probably not. Journalism now requires a degree. In my day, it required the ability to write news copy and to know what the important part of a story was, so you could ask the right questions. But my approach might still work on small-town newspapers, although they seem to be shrinking and drying up. Or get that journalism degree. Journalism can still lead to several different writing career options. ",

            "answer_text": "You can start with a detailed outline or skip it completely. I tend to be somewhere in the middle, with a loose outline of where the story\u2019s going. I don\u2019t get into the details too much because I like to make things up as I go. It adds an element of fun to the process for me. But everyone\u2019s different in how they plan (or don\u2019t). Beyond that, you write. You stubbornly write every day. Set a number of words you are determined to write every day or block out a chunk of your day\u2014every day at the same time\u2014when you\u2019ll commit to distraction-free writing. The first draft will be a chaotic mess. There will be plot holes and all kinds of \u201cjunk\u201d in there. Don\u2019t worry about it. While you write, the editor/critic in you needs to be on vacation. Just write and write and write with abandon. Clean up the mess later. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd suggest you start at the beginning. Walk outside and look at something, a tree, a bird or maybe a building. Write one quick sentence about it. Read the sentence and then rewrite it with more detail, more exact descriptive words. When finished, edit it. Take away unnecessary words, innacurate words. When you're done, put it into a paragraph and again go through the same process. This won't make you a better writer instantly, but if you're unwilling to try, you may not be ready to try and write. Everyone will tell you to read, and you should. But you must read actively. How does the author use language? How does she vary sentence length and structure? Are characters flat or are they three dimishional? Did the writing evoke some emotion? Study the craft. Read on Writing by Stephen King and Bird by Bird by Anne Lamont. There are tons of good books on the skills of writing. Good luck ",

To elaborate, you must be clear about How\u2019s and Why\u2019s. Be a voracious Reader. - This is the trainee/novice step. Read for hours and just read like a madman. Read like never before. Read novels, newspapers, articles, online articles and everything around you. Beginning days will be painful, but once you get hold of the grammar and language flow, it will be fun. The more you read, the better you will develop as a writer.Jot down important points. - After the training is done, its time to sharpen the skill. Take a article, read it and jot down important points. This will create a mapping in your brain about the structure of an article. This step might take time but it will be worth.Try composing small articles - This is the \u201cImplementation step\u201d. Once you\u2019re abreast of the structure, sentence formation and language flow and usage of tenses, its time you chose a random topic of your interest and write a 500 word article on it. Proofread it at least thrice and make it even better. Now, ask a friend, senior, father or someone to read it and provide their review comments. Now, is the point where you need to repeat the 3rd step over and over till the day you are a fantabulous writer.Practice heavily to minimise mistakes and improve on language flow and sentence coherency. Well, I myself am not a Writer but these above steps I believe will improve your overall understanding and writing skills as it has done mine. Hope this helps! ",

What really makes a writer is hardwork and discipline.Consistency and being true to your work. You have to write everyday, no matter what happens.Passion and love are the two driving forces that make a writer sit and write those words. Your love for words should be strong enough that you cannot imagine your life without writing.Patience and perseverance are the backbone of every writer. You have to write even when no one is reading. You have to be patient and hopeful even when all publishers are rejecting your manuscript, or when the book sales are dropping.You should have a brave heart because the journey of a writer has its fair share of tears and heartbreaks, be it rejections or negative reviews.",

Get comfortable with writing first- after that, it will come naturally from you. Everyone is different, and everyone has their own unique way of writing. Writing short stories helps you feel out the path for a more detailed writing. But don\u2019t get caught up thinking that you need to write a perfect chapter book right away. Once you think you have a feel of your own writing, then you can start with the bigger writings. Also, you must realize a couple of things first Description is important for the reader, but don\u2019t go overboard- the reader will get boredMake sure what your writing is something that you enjoy- if you grow bored of writing the story, don\u2019t force yourself onward.If you grow irritated, or have writers block, just get up and do something else for a moment. Clear your head. It depends on the person, but you might want to wait a day and daydream.Good luck! ",

You can become an author just by creating one content in any social media, but professional authors are not like that. They will post contents (original content) which they found. If you are just an college student and if you want to become an author please do this important step: Write some contents in professional websites (my preferences - blogger ) Write contents regularly and for your reference few sites even pay you money for what you write (example: VMCREATIONS ). From that you can easily get some money and also get recognition for what you done. Thus my simple advice is go to some websites like VMCREATIONS and post your blog. (You won't get millions from posting, but can get recognition). ",

Few skills are as important as the ability too \"persuade on Npaper.\" Plus, writing can be a source of pleasure throughout your life. But, I think you need to answer some questions before proceeding further. For example, Why do you want to write? What do you want to write? Fiction or nonfiction? Articles and books, or short stories? Do you want to write in an agency or corporate environment? Or, does a self-employed environment appeal to you? if you responded Yes to the last question, my next question would be \"Are you comfortable prospecting for new business and selling your services?\" What kind f work are you doing now? What kind of time do you have available to set aside each day for writing and career-based activities? I'm trying to persuade you to not take action, or tell you to commit your self to writing on any timetable? But, I do want you to define your goals and proceed with your eyes open. Best wishes on your journey! Roger ",

You might try a few different genres. You might not. Fact is - everyone writes their own way.

I will recommend you to do a self evaluation and understand what really interests you so you can identify what kind of stories or articles you would like to write about. Read as much as you would wish to write on anything that presents knowledge. It will help you have multiple ideas when writing. Having identified what you really like relax and write just anything that comes up your mind about it. Let words flow freely and don't hold back, editing will take care of what is not suitable. If you plan to use a computer, train yourself how to type properly. If it is pen and paper get a nice book and pen. Once again do not hold back, you will learn as time go by and you will improve.

            "answer_text": "Hi. Simply write. Starting to write is essentially the first step you should follow. Try different forms of writing and genres as well. Forms vary from poems to short stories to novels. Genres vary from horror to romance to comedy. Once you figure out the form-genre combination you are the most comfortable and happy with, explore yourself and try to write more specifically into that genre. (Although, you can very well opt for writing any form and any genre anytime. A free approach like this is equally good.) After you\u2019re done with a bit of experimentation with your work, start publishing. Don\u2019t be afraid of getting judged at this stage. Judgements make you a better person and a better writer. Eventually, when you\u2019d publish, you\u2019ll get suggestions - accomodate them in your work. This is how you can start. Hope it helps! :) ",

For instance, West Side Story was just a retelling of Romeo and Juliet, and that famous play was stolen from a classical tale, Pyramus and Thisbe. Good luck! I look forward to reading your first bestseller! ",

And do you read all kinds of books, screenplays, poetry \u2013 the classics as well as modern and popular? Does the structure of language fascinate you? Do you experiment with writing the same sentence a hundred different ways? Do you know who first developed writing? Do you love thinking up or telling stories?

If possible, get someone to listen to you reading your own work out loud. Someone who isn\u2019t a family member or an editor, but simply someone who can report to you about what words they noticed, what they imagined, and how what you wrote made them feel. Keep doing that. Give up all expectations of money, recognition, fame. Write as if your life depended on it, but only if it really does. Otherwise, find something else to do. ",

In addition, have a habit of writing. Start writing answers in quora. Start writing short essays, then long essays then short stories and followingly long stories. Becoming an author is a process. it is more like running a marathon. All you need to do is prepare each day by sticking to reading and writing routines; test your abilities periodically; then push your limits (try to write on different subjects). If you want to become a novelist (fiction writing), enroll in a creative writing course and practice the art. If you want to become a self-help author (nonfiction writing), read self-help books and gather insights of how successful authors write, how they present different info, how they illustrate, how they use metaphors, how is their basic style of writing, etc. As you read more and more of others\u2019 work and try writing your write-ups, eventually you can write hundreds of pages of text, which can be submitted to a literary agent for publication. Practice, practice, and practice!!!. Runners practice running for miles before kissing the gold medal; Pianists rigorously pratice fingering and music-reading for thousand of hours before getting a winning applause in concerts. Ballerinas go through strict diet and flexibility exercises and rigorous auditions under great masters before giving a spellbounding performance. So, you want to become an author? Read, absorb, assimilate, digest and write killer content. ",

That is, analyze everything you read to see how that writer was able to make you, the reader, see a scene so clearly, or feel a certain emotion. It\u2019s not alchemy; it\u2019s just a skill. Also read critically: was it really necessary, when a character walked into a room, to freeze-frame that scene and describe everything in sight? This is a sadly common bad showoff habit of writers of historical fiction, and one of those that drove me writing HF of my own, that doesn\u2019t do that. Did you, the reader, feel your energy drain while you reluctantly read a lot of stuff you didn\u2019t need to know, and lost track of the character\u2019s purpose and urgency? And a lot of other stuff. Have fun!! ",

If you are just writing to entertain, it still should have an underlying message. Good triumphs. Overcome your failure. Etc. Next figure out your target audience. That should dictate novel length and reading level. You can plot your story using the Snowflake Method by Randy Ingermanson. Then schedule a few hours each day to just sit down and write. ",

But if you feel like your ready to jump into it, there is no one stopping you. Just know that writing takes time to perfect. A first book is rarely good, not even ok. Most first novels are crap.

If you do run out of ideas, find inspiration however you can, be it prompts or pictures or other works. Don't be scared to recycle other people's ideas. I know that this may not be the best advice, but if you can turn an existing idea into your own original content, then you won't get in trouble with plagiarism.

You have to love reading and writing anyway. There will be years and years of that before anyone wants to read your stuff at all. But anyone who actually is famous loves reading and writing because they really love reading and writing. It\u2019s really good for you and helps you live your life. Write because you want to write, not because you want attention. Of all the kinds of fame you can achieve, it is the loneliest. ",

You may have heard that an author knows how to transition from non-author to author, but this is just the kind of thing that authors say to non-authors to get them to pay money to attend their writing workshops. My only advice if you wish to go from non-author to author then do not seek authorisation (it takes too long and the paperwork is ridiculously complex) just be author. ",

In those moments, when you are writing, you should have nothing on your mind. Not even an iota of your life, anything other than what you are doing should enter your consciousness. Now, as to what you are writing, it will flow by itself. Yes you will have to think about it, you will brainstorm, you will pull your hair out, but the moment you put the pen to the paper all of it will vanish. The ink will flow in unision to you, not your thoughts and before you realize it you will have had penned down some immortal words. All of these thoughts are precursors, a part of the process of leaving everything. True writing happens when you have nothing but yourself. ",

Second, don\u2019t give up your day job - or your second job, if you have one. The likelihood is that while you may make some money from writing, you won\u2019t make a lot. If you\u2019re lucky, you may break even on your marketing efforts, but the sad truth is that your chances of getting picked up by a major publisher and making it big are not unlike your chances of winning Powerball.

For example, if I yell at you \u201cWas!\u201d, what comes to your mind? Nothing. But if I yell \u201cRun! Fire!\u201d, you know to run away from a fire in the vicinity. Replace dead verbs with strong verbs (verbs that provide images to readers) as often as you can. I\u2019ve seen more growth in beginning writers from this one tip than anything else I\u2019ve taught. A few years ago I collected up this tip, and 6 other common writing problems into this online course with exercises and lessons: 7 Lessons for Becoming a Standout Writer. ",

EXTRACTS FROM THE EXTEMPORANEOUS AND PROLEPTIC THOUGHTS OF JOHN ROSS MCGLADE. With Parisian Cat. Jardin de Plantes. 1984. Photo. Jaques Serviere. BACKGROUND OF JOHN ROSS MCGLADE . I have only recently considered myself a poet and this was prompted by a friend flicking through my notebooks, I have maintained since my late teens, to do with my main pursuit as a visual artist. I have worked many jobs through out my life from labourer, fibreglass laminator, welder, to university lecturer across the fields of fine art and design including ceramics, sculpture, drawing, life drawing, history and industrial design; I use a lot of photography in my work. I am also a belated Citroen and other cars mechanic and have an ongoing interest in philosophy. I have had my own 3D design business in Melbourne. As designer-maker where I primarily worked on commission from my design exhibitions in metal, timber, ceramics and glass, producing everything from furniture to complete shop fit-outs through to signage and architectural fittings. I worked for 5 years as an automotive clay sculptor at the Ford research and design centre and co-set up a course of the same at RMIT. After leaving Ford I was accepted into post-graduate studies at the Slade school of Art at London University but couldn\u2019t afford to continue. I have been painting since 1980 from my first return to Australia while doing philosophy for a year at Melbourne University. I took a leaf from the book of one of my main influences, the artist Marcel Duchamp, by working in private and not exhibiting my fine art work which is primarily interested in processes and systems; some early work using electronics and lasers. In the late 1960\u2019s I was also composing electronic music and plan to work, digitally, with these old tape recordings soon. In 2005 I received a Masters degree from RMIT titled \u201cMaking in Landscape, Transient phenomena and Creative Method\u201d In 2015 I completed a PhD in Architecture from RMIT, titled \u201cThe Epiphenomenal in Architecture and a Creative Sequence\u201d applying my fine art and poetic sensibilities to architecture. I have won the prestigious Castlemaine cup for poetry ten times but have deferred competing for now. I have no memory of poems I have just written, or theihttp://johnrossmcglade.wordpress.com .  ",
