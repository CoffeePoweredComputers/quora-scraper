            "answer_text": "Foundation is very important. Don\u2019t think you are learning basics.Take best training on latest technologies, API testing, WebServices Testing using SoapUI tool, ETL Testing, Mobile Apps Testing, Selenium Automation Testing training and more.Learn about Test plan, test cases, RTM, Security testing, SQL, Joins, UNIX / Linux, Web servers, App Servers, Basic programming languages like Java, Python scripting, Java Script, HTML etc.Hands on Practice on real time like projects. This is highly important to get job.Practice mock interviews, take the feedback and fix the issues after mock interviews.Prepare a good resume, do not copy and paste from some other people.Review the resume by experienced people.Create a short 2 minute video based resume / profile and make it private. do not share with every one.Post your resume in job boards like Dice.com, monster.com, techfetch.com, Indeed etc.Ready for face to face interview. you need to tell the vendor / client that you are ready for face to face interview.Build confidence.Try to avoid lying like \u201c I am strong in SQL joins\u201d but when you answer you don\u2019t even give any example or proper explanation but just reading definition. Interviewer understand that you don\u2019t have any experience and know only theory.If you prepare technically strong no one can stop you.Good Luck.. God Bless you to become a good Software QA Tester.",
