            "answer_text": "Is it a bad idea for white writers to make their main characters people of color? Is it wrong for a man to make his main character a woman, or vice-versa? Is it a bad idea for a gay person to write about a straight person? Or the other way around? Is it a bad idea for a human to write stories about Elves or space aliens as their main characters? Why do you think that a non-white writer can\u2019t have enough imagination to write about a white character? White writers do write about people of color, after all. All it takes to write about a person who is different than you, is observation, imagination and empathy. And probably a little more research than it would take to write about someone who is like you. The only time it would be a bad idea for anyone to write about someone who is different, is if that writer had an ax to grind, and deliberately set out to demonize characters who are different. But then, that is a whole other problem\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "You answered your own question in sentence two. You read a book about a white character and never guessed the writer was black, So\u2026that made you wonder if she should have written the book? The color of a writer\u2019s skin\u2014along with gender, age, and ethnos\u2014doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that characters are three dimensional, complete human beings, and that if the writer is reaching outside his own personal experience, he does his research and handles the subject matter respectfully. If writers could not write characters that differed from themselves, there would be no fantasy novels, no science fiction, no novels set in the old West or the Empire period, very few crime novels (how many hardcore criminals write novels?) , no animal protagonists\u2026you get my drift. Fiction as an art form *depends* upon a writer\u2019s ability to step outside his own skin. If it\u2019s well done, you won\u2019t even know they did that. As you didn\u2019t here. ",
