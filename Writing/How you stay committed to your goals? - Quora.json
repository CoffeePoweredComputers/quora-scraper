            "answer_text": "It seems focus, concentration, discipline, distraction and such like are related. I keep my focus, concentration and so on through wanting to achieve the goals. Sounds obvious, but let me elaborate: While there are links to 3000+ related answers to you question given below it may be useful to start with considering your wants and needs. Are you doing what you want? Consider the following: If you want or need to achieve a goal, will you be automatically committed, motivated and focussed to achieve/obtain it?If you don\u2019t want or need to achieve a goal will you be automatically focussed to achieving/obtaining it or will focus, commitment, motivation and so on likely be a problem?Simply put, if you want to achieve your goals, even if you are faced with major challenges, you will be focused, disciplined and so on to achieve/obtain it; if you don\u2019t you won\u2019t. Having problems with focus may be trying to tell you something about your goals and what you want and need. Are you actually doing what you want to do? The mind is a complex thing and it could be what you think you want is not what you actually want. It can be useful to consider your wants and needs and where they have come from. People change in response to living their lives and their experiences. What you want now may not be what you want tomorrow, in a week, in a year and so on. Change is to be expected and accepted as is adjusting your wants and needs accordingly. People are different. This is obvious from the many different approaches to dealing with focus indicated below. Some people influenced by others take on the wants and needs of other people. If these do not align with their own wants and needs there will be no problem. If they find they do not align focus problems will occur. Focus, commitment and the like isn\u2019t static For most people, focus is not static over time but goes up and down. It does not stay at the same \u2018level\u2019 all the time. A lack of focus could be a result of you being a bit tired and the like, indicating a need to rest. At times, a lack of focus can be helping rather than a problem to overcome. Only you can work out if a lack of focus is helping or a problem as only you are living and experiencing your life. You will do things you don\u2019t like to get something you want Working towards goals often involves doing things you don't particularly like. If you really want the end result focus will return without much effort; even to do things you don't like. Again, if focus does not return with minimal effort this is indicating consideration of your wants, needs. It could be you need a change if you find you are not doing things towards what you want. If doing what you don\u2019t want to do\u2026 If you are set on working towards goals you don\u2019t want, or if goals are somehow imposed on you, there are plenty of views on about improving focus, reducing distraction and so on: I quickly picked up the following questions on Quora. They may be helpful in addition to the answers you receive here: How can we completely concentrate while studying? \u2013 2100+ answers How can I improve my focus? \u2013 1000+ How do you keep yourself disciplined? \u2013 600+ How can we control our mind from distraction? \u2013 380+ What are some ways to keep yourself from getting distracted while working or studying? \u2013 270+ What are some tips and tricks to increase concentration power? \u2013 450+ How do you keep yourself focused on your goals? \u2013 340+ How can we control our mind from distraction? \u2013 300+ How do I become more self-disciplined and avoid procrastinating? \u2013 200+ How do I develop razor-sharp focus? How do I improve concentration and increase my productivity? What are proven ways to improve focus? From searching Quora you will find there are quite a few similar or related questions with a varying number of answers. Additionally, an online search will give you many more possibilities. There is no single approach to focus, distraction and the like is guaranteed to work, there\u2019s no \u2018magic bullet\u2019. Many ways to deal with focus can be found because people are different as are the situations they find themselves. Looking online makes it obvious there isn\u2019t a widespread consensus or agreement on a single approach which will work for everyone. No one has the \u2018magic bullet\u2019 when it comes to maintaining focus and concentration. What works for one person may work for some other people but not everyone. As everyone who has struggled with focusing on goals has done, you will have to find what works for you. What works at one point in time may not work at another point as people change. What works may be is an approach found from answers, found online or something you come up with yourself. Everyone is searching for the elusive one easy answer for them, the way that guarantees their focus. People can\u2019t find it out there in books and online so they come up an approach that works for them. When they find what works they often let others know about it online, hence, many different views. In the end, it is up to each individual to decide if they want to continue to do things they don\u2019t want to do or take steps to find and do what they want to do, recognising that what they want may change over time. Hopefully, this will give you something to work with ",
