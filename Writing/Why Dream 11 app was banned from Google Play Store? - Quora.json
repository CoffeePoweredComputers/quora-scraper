It is a platform of sports that is based in India and that allows its users to play fantasy cricket, hockey basketball and kabaddi also. This platform enables its users to win cash prizes along with bonuses with every win. However, the question regarding Dream 11 app being banned from Google Play Store has been in the news for quite some time. The reason being, Dream 11 was not a part of Google Play Store as Google does not support paid fantasy in the Play Store. The version of Dream 11 app in which we can play fantasy league never formed a part of Google. There were two versions previously, the Dream 11 Pro and the Dream 11 Free Leagues. The latter was only available because there is no place for \u201cpay and play\u201d applications on Play Store. However due to growing users of the application in the recent years, the free version was removed and the Dream 11 Pro, which is now Dream 11, is considered as the official app and is available for download only through the official website. If you are a sports person, or even interested in sports, you can try your luck on online betting as well. You can get yourself registered on Parimatch India and try placing bets on several sports like cricket, football, volleyball, hockey, ice hockey and even tennis.

            "answer_text": " Dream 11 is a fantasy sports platform based in India that allows users to play fantasy cricket, hockey, football, kabaddi and basketball. Dream11 was co-founded by Harsh Jain and Bhavit Sheth in 2008. The version of Dream 11 app in which we can play fantasy league was never a part of google. Earlier there were two versions of the app - Dream 11 Pro and Dream 11 Free Leagues. Only the later was available in google play store because the play store does not allow \u2018pay and play\u2019 apps. After the investments from Tencent, their registered users grew from 2 million in 2016 and to 45 million in 2018. They decided to remove the free version of the game and now only the Dream 11 Pro - which is now Dream 11 official app - is available for download from their official website. In 2017, a case was registered against the company in an Indian High Court. The court, in its ruling, stated that playing the Dream11 game involves superior knowledge, judgement and attention. The Court also held that \u2018the element of skill\u2019 had a predominant influence on the outcome of the Dream11 game. However, the law does not allow Fantasy Sports in few Indian States like Assam, Odisha and Telangana. A challenge to this judgement was filed with the Supreme Court of India, which dismissed the appeal. The judgement provided legality to the company and allowed them to run their operations throughout the country. Despite it being adjudged to be a game of skill, experts believe that the company operates in the country's regulatory grey area. ",
