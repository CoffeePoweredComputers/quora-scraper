            "answer_text": "Some Good Reasons to Choose SEO as Your Career 1High demand for SEO services Once SEO was not a separate profession \u2013 Web masters performed some basic SEO for the sites they managed and that was all. But as sites began to grow and make money, it became more reasonable to hire a dedicated SEO specialist than to have the Web master do it. The demand for good SEO experts is high and is constantly on the rise. 2A LOT of people have made a successful SEO career There are many living proofs that SEO is a viable business. The list is too long to be quoted here but some of the names include Jeff from Theseowhiz, Jill Wahlen from High Rankings, Rand Fishkin from SEO Moz and many others. 3Search Engine Optimizers make Good Money ! SEO is a profession that can be practiced while working for a company or as a solo practitioner. There are many jobboards like Dice and Craigslist that publish SEO job advertisements. It is worth noting that the compensation for SEO employees is equal to or even higher than that of developers, designers and marketers. Salaries over $80K per annum are not an exception for SEO jobs. As a solo SEO practitioner you can make even more money. Almost all freelance sites have sections for SEO services and offers for $50 an hour or more are quite common. If you are still not confident that you can work on your own, you can start a SEO job, learn a bit and then start your own company. If you already feel confident that you know a lot about SEO, you can take this quiz and see how you score. Well, don't get depressed if you didn't pass \u2013 here is a great checklist that will teach you a lot, even if you are already familiar with SEO. 4Only Web\u2013Designing MAY NOT be enough Many companies offer turn\u2013key solutions that include Web design, Web development AND SEO optimization. In fact, many clients expect that when they hire somebody to make their site, the site will be SEO friendly, so if you are good both as a designer and a SEO expert, you will be a truely valuable professional. On the other hand, many other companies are dealing with SEO only because they feel that this way they can concentrate their efforts on their major strentgh \u2013 SEO, so you can consider this possibility as well. 5Logical step ahead if you come from marketing or advertising The Web has changed the way companies do business, so to some extent today's marketers and advertisers need to have at least some SEO knowledge if they want to be successful. SEO is also a great career for linguists. 6Lots of Learning For somebody who comes from design, development or web administration, SEO might look not technical enough and you might feel that you will downgrade if you move to SEO. Don't worry so much \u2013 you can learn a LOT from SEO, so if you are a talented techie, you are not downgrading but you are actually upgrading your skills packages. 7SEO is already recognized as a career Finally, if you need some more proof that SEO is a great career, have a look at the available SEO courses and exams for SEO practitioners. Well, they might not be a CISCO certification but still they help to institutionalize the SEO profession. Some Ugly Aspects of SEO 1Dependent on search engines It is true that in any career there are many things that are outside of your control but for SEO this is a rule number one. Search engines frequently change their algorithms and what is worse \u2013 these changes are not made public, so even the greatest SEO gurus admit that they make a lot of educated guesses about how things work. It is very discouraging to make everything perfect and then to learn that due to a change in the algorithm, your sites dropped 100 positions down. But the worst part is that you need to communicate this to clients, who are not satisfied with their sinking ratings. 2No fixed rules Probably this will change over time but for now the rule is that there are no rules \u2013 or at least not written ones. You can work very hard, follow everything that looks like a rule and still success is not coming. Currently you can't even rely on bringing a search engine to court because of the damages they have done to your business because search engines are not obliged to rank high sites that have made efforts to get optimized. 3Rapid changes in rankings But even if you somehow manage to get to the top for a particular keyword, keeping the position requires constant efforts. Well, many other businesses are like that, so this is hardly a reason to complain \u2013 except when an angry customer starts shouting at you that this week their ratings are sinking and of course this is all your fault. 4SEO requires Patience The SEO professional and customers both need to understand that SEO takes constant effort and time. It could take months to move ahead in the ratings, or to build tens of links. Additionally, if you stop optimizing for some time, most likely you will experience a considerable drop in ratings. You need lots of motivation and patience not to give up when things are not going your way. 5Black hat SEO Black hat SEO is probably one of the biggest concerns for the would\u2013be SEO practitioner. Fraud and unfair competition are present in any industry and those who are good and ethical suffer from this but black hat SEO is still pretty widespread. It is true that search engines penalize black hat practices but still black hat SEO is a major concern for the industry. So, let's hope that by telling you about the pros and cons of choosing SEO as your career we have helped you make an informed decision about your future.

            "answer_text": "Most definitely. There\u2019s a few routes you can go with working in SEO as a search engine optimizer. It\u2019s become a skill that\u2019s increasingly in-demand over the years because many business owners realize they need to have an online presence in some shape or form. Even if their brick-and-mortar business caters to a local region, having the site optimized for SEO can increase sales. In fact, research showed that 72% of people who did a local search visited a store that was less than 5 miles from their location\u201428% of those people would even go on to buy something! Some of the skills you\u2019ll need to be a top SEO include: Coding - you don\u2019t need to be a programming whiz by any means. Basic HTML and CSS skills will be enough, but you need to know how to look at a website\u2019s source code and make sense of it.Writing - content is king, as they say. Being able to produce quality content can be the difference in your site getting found and the content being lost in the ether. Writing for the web is a particularly specific skill - learning how to keep people\u2019s attention is key.Research - SEO is all about how to get your content found on search engines. Knowing what types of keywords people punch into Google and why they\u2019re searching for these terms helps you pivot and create a solid content strategy.Analysis - research and analysis go hand in hand. After generating the data, you need to know how to make sense of it. What is their behavior when interacting with your site? How long are people spending on pages? How many pages do they visit before leaving? Which ones attract the most attention?If you\u2019re seriously thinking about becoming an SEO, you can become a salaried employee (usually working in the marketing department), a freelancer, or using those skills in your own business. The average salary for an SEO is $50k according to Glassdoor. This will fluctuate depending on where you work and your experience, but that doesn\u2019t factor in the employee benefits. You\u2019ll at least have job security and a steady stream of income each month. As a freelancer, you\u2019ll have more room to maneuver and you can take on different projects for as many or as few clients as you want. This gives you more flexibility since you have control over your hours and workload. However, your income is determined by how much work you can find at this time, and whether clients are willing to pay you at your desired rate. Freelancing can often be heavily influenced by your network and relationships with previous clients. You can search on job boards but it might not yield the results you want. Lastly, there\u2019s starting up your own business. You don\u2019t have to drop everything and put all your eggs in this basket. In fact, many entrepreneurs work on a side business outside of their 9\u20135 job during evenings and weekends, slowly sowing into a blog or content site and adding content/optimizing the site to rank higher on Google. Once you\u2019ve got enough content on there, you can start applying for display ad networks like Google Adsense or affiliate programs (if your site has product reviews and it makes sense to include these links). After some time, roughly a year or so later, this project can yield so nice results and give you another stream of monthly income. It\u2019s not unusual for content sites to provide ~$2k-$4k each month in net profit. And the great thing about content sites is once you\u2019ve done all the hard work at the beginning to get it off the ground, you can actually work fewer hours on it since traffic will continue trickling through. As long as your content is evergreen and your niche community is active, people will visit your site. Alternatively, if you have the skills but not the time to start up a business, you can buy a content site. This can really save you a lot of hours and sweat equity because you\u2019ve already got a profitable business in a niche that\u2019s earning money through a solid business model.

            "answer_text": "Very Important:Yes, just like any other career options, SEO/Digital Marketing can be a great career if the learning process is more practical, accurate, organized, ever persistent, result-oriented, complete, relevant and innovative. Absence of any of these would make an SEO job painful. 1. Work NatureUnlike other careers, where uncertainty & compliance are limited and manageable, SEO is a highly result-oriented career where uncertainty & compliance play a lot of role. Although, it is not a complex subject it is often considered to be toughest because it requires an SEO person to think analytically, relating things with one another, observe behavior patterns, investigate issues, solving complex problems, create workarounds, find out trends and implement the best practices. Also, as SEO evolves quickly it is often considered to be one of the most challenging careers. 2. PayAlthough it is not a high paid job when compared to the tech jobs, you'll still be able to make a decent salary in SEO career. It is difficult to mention ranges because it depends on several factors like industry, location, work experience etc. But on the whole, if you gain a good work experience of at least 2 years with a few achievements on your resume, you can expect a good compensation. 3. Job satisfactionIn any career, job satisfaction is an important factor apart from other aspects. Regarding SEO, I can tell you that an SEO guy is one the happiest persons on the planet because the work is challenging in nature and you'll experience the taste of success when you achieve something with lot of persistent effort and dedication. Trust me on this, I've been the most happiest guy for the past 7 years of my SEO career. PS: During my learning all these days, I've been putting my best to implement all the things what I've mentioned above in the 'Very Important' section. And I'm still learning. 4. Demand for SEO in futureYes, you start with SEO and you'll end up as a Digital Marketing guy. And, as long as search is out there, the web needs SEO people. You can be rest assured that SEO is a great promising career. PS: Watch out for people or companies who make false claims regarding SEO. Always, do your own research and try to get valid references for claims. Don't take things for granted and don't make or rely on baseless assumptions. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "It is, but maybe not in the way you'd think.SEO is a wide field these days with multiple branching paths. I'd also add that SEO isn't really a singular career; it's increasingly rare to find someone that does purely optimization work or link building, so you should think of it as more of an area of specialization in a broader marketing career. A lot of SEOs start off as search analysts, link builders, content writers, social media marketers or web designers. The outcome for many is to advance into a director or VP of search role, take a wider role in inbound or content marketing, or start their own agency. Some of the more technically minded SEOs get into product management or start marketing software companies. It's wide open. Check out the Moz 2014 Industry Survey - it covers the breadth, depth, and diversity of paths pretty well. Why do so many people think they can make a career out of this?For one, there's a lot of hiring demand for both in-house and agency SEM/SEOs and there is lots of work to go around, so one could make a career for themselves as a corporate marketer, freelancer, consultant. Refer to:SEM Research - SEMPO: SEMPO Salary SurveySEMPO State of Search Industry ReportAlso, there aren't really any barriers to entry - you don't need a specific degree or a license to call yourself an SEO. The basics are easy to pick up, but the learning curve steepens quickly once you start working on complex projects or in competitive markets. This makes for a rather wide knowledge gap between a good and average SEO so it is becoming harder to find, hire, and retain good search talent. ",

            "answer_text": "SEO is a career, and a lucrative one. The fact is that right now, companies are tripping over themselves to optimize their web presence over that of their competition. Given that SEO is a somewhat labor intensive, specialized skill, market demand for it is insane at this point. And given that SEO looks like magic to the average business owner, the money is considerable - if you can deliver the results. The beauty is that there is no barrier to entry for SEO services, so anyone can do it. The downside is that there is no barrier to entry, so anyone can do it. Competition in the SEO market is savage. It isn\u2019t based upon any formal schooling degree, but based upon the results you can deliver to a company. This means that you can\u2019t fake your way through it. Posers are quickly sniffed out, and cast aside. However, anyone can become proficient. There are many resources out there for anyone interested to tap in to, and luckily, MOST people while work at it for a while, and then give up or lose interest. So if you can give it a legitimate go, you\u2019re already going to be way ahead of your competition. Advice: If you\u2019re considering getting into SEO as a career path, it\u2019s easy enough to develop your skills immediately. 1. Tap into the vast archive of SEO information available online. You can find enough free information out there to get a great start. 2. Offer to do SEO for a friend or family member, and track the metrics. See how it goes, see how you like it. Are you beginning to understand the interconnectivity of the SEO process? 3. When you get good enough at it, and can show provable results, offer your services locally to small/mid-sized businesses. This is where you start, because those are the people who need it most, and that\u2019s where you can have the most impact. 4. The more you can refine and perfect your skills, the more you can charge, the more clients you will take on, and the more successful your SEO career will become. ",

If one can master this art and change with the times, it\u2019s definitely a skill that is highly in demand. From a training and learning perspective, if you want to increase your site traffic, SEO and content promotion is the best way to accomplish it. SEO is all about the content you create and how you promote it. Without the necessary promotion, your website or blog will just get lost in the mix. No matter what niche market you are in, it\u2019s extremely important to know your audience and what type of content they want. This will help with SEO and ranking for long tail keywords that your audience is likely typing into Google. Also make sure you niche down as much as possible, as this is where you are going to find opportunity and be able to potentially establish your site as an authority and trusted resource for information. If you want to improve your site\u2019s SEO and make your content better than what\u2019s currently out there, it\u2019s all about the content creation and content promotion plans you have for your site. These are the two most important things to remember. CONTENT CREATION - Only create great content that provides real value and is better than what\u2019s currently already out there. Google your competition, see what type of content they have, then create something better and be sure to include stats and visuals when possible. CONTENT PROMOTION - With over a billion active websites and blogs online, there is already way too much content out there. Without the necessary content promotion, your site is just going to get lost in the mix. You need to continually promote your content to new audiences. To better explain all of the above and how you can use such methods to increase traffic on your own site let\u2019s cover the many components that go into a great marketing and branding plan to grow a website or blog. Not only will content creation come into play, it\u2019s also how much effort you put into your content promotion as well. In the world of blogging, this can be done in a number of ways.

            "answer_text": "Let me give this answer as a story There was a girl, passed out IT Engineering in the year 2013 with great CGPA around 72.5% applied for PHP and programming work as a fresher. Got a Job and good trainer who can make her understand everything about PHP and MySQL. The girl has a very low interest in a logical language, she tried a lot to run her logical skills and done hard work to understand Database and MySQL but at that time she couldn\u2019t deliver anything because she did not find it an interesting job. Her trainer made her clear that PHP and programming is not your cup of tea. You try something else other than coding and programming. At that time she thought her career is collapsed and she is useless and she can do nothing being an IT Engineer. Also, her friends were placed in good MNC companies with good payments. She felt bad about her career choice. At that time his friend, who was her PHP trainer suggested her to do Digital Marketing and explore the things in the field of SEO and Digital Marketing. She started exploring the videos and guides by taking the help of other seniors in the group and learn a lot of things within 6 months and also find it interesting. But the problem was, it was all theory. She was good at theory and she now can crack the interview of SEO as 6 months of working experience. She got a chance to give an interview in one of the well-known companies in Ahmedabad as Associate SEO and passed there and got selected. Now the hard time started, as she had all knowledge, in theory, she can understand the concept, but she couldn\u2019t execute the things properly in the project. Again, a tough time started for her. But she didn\u2019t give up in a tough situation with lots of political environment in the big company and a tough trainer. She survived for the 9 to 10 months in that big company and because of the name of the company she got too many offers in the other companies and got work and as time passed and with good work, she became an expert in SEO and digital marketing and handling projects alone. Now, she is in a good position and earning well. Though the starting period was struggling and the earning was too less as compared to her friends in programming but now she earns an equal amount and respect as compared to her friends. So, everything you do in life takes your hard work and honestly, you will reach your destination with these two qualities. But You must be clear about what you want to do? And for whom you want to do? And that girl is me :) I am happy choosing SEO as my career and it makes me happy to work hard in the same field. ",

            "answer_text": "To add to great answers already posited: SEO quite simply is the act of increasing sales in the online marketplace. I'm oversimplifying, of course, due to the nature of the question, but essentially SEO involves a set of best practices and strategies that help businesses augment their visibility on the Internet.  As for the 2nd part of the question regarding the possibility of a person making a living from SEO work, the easy answer is yes. Most of the other answers so far address SEO from a freelance or entrepreneurial standpoint, explaining that the market is saturated and full of unsavory characters all vying for same business. In this way, it can be difficult to make a living, since there are always \"black hat\" SEOs promising unrealistic results by essentially spamming google. Unfortunately, many of these phony hacks blindside local business owners out of hard earned cash, only to damage the company's online presence with bad linkbuilding techniques which break Google's terms of service and lead to a penalty that can completely remove that business from the search results page.  I am lucky enough to work for a large, enterprise level search marketing company (8th largest in terms of ad spend) that services many Fortune 500 clients. For me, it isn't just possible to make money from SEO, my entire livelihood depends on it. And right now, I'm making a pretty decent living from it-- more than I have from any of my other marketing jobs. If you have a good deal of diverse experience, a person can easily make upwards of 80k a year working for a large SEM company.  Hope that answers your question! ",

Well SEO in my opinion is not just SEO anymore, it's marketing. Anything that can help the process such as web design, programming, writing is important for SEO. SEO and Digital marketing have opened up new career choices, which didn\u2019t exist earlier. I have been part of the industry for past 8 years and have seen the ups/downs of the industry. You have so many options available within the industry that one would need to find an area of specialization in a broader SEO / Digital marketing career. A trick a lot of people are doing is using sites that boost your social signals and credibility for newbies. Since its just shares and likes, we continue to use them for social signals on backlinks we earn, especially big news articles. The site we use is Devumi.

Sure, SEO has changed over the years, but without a doubt, search rankings will be integral to the marketing strategies of online businesses for years to come. The industry will make (and has made) changes over time, but I can\u2019t think any scenario where SEO will no longer be important.

            "answer_text": "I wouldn't recommend it. I have been involved in SEO for the past 6 years and I have seen all major Google updates and all these updates made thousands of people unemployed. SEO is and will be alive in foreseeable future but there is problem about this speciality that people tend to overdo things. They are looking for shortcuts and the truth is that there is NO shortcuts. This is where all specialists fail and they don't learn from their mistakes and fail again and again.  And SEO is becoming less and less about manual optimization (categories, interlinking, backlinks, kw density, proper titles, etc) and moves toward content and organic links. It was always like that but Google is getting smarter and smarter and there are almost no flaws that can be used to rise quickly in ranking. SEO specialists always finds a way around it but Google is slowly but winning this game completely. Personally I would suggest to learn something technical such as frontend web development or internet marketing in general just to have a backup with some knowledge other than SEO because there is not really much to know about SEO itself rather than how everything is connected, why marketing and advertising works so well etc. You need a broader view and better knowledge about global things and SEO can come as bonus but never as your main focus.

            "answer_text": "That depends on certain circumstances, one being how much knowledge you have regarding SEO, do you understand the technical terms associated with Serach Engine Optimization, such as Google\u2019s search algorithm, how it works (not in depth) but one should have a fair idea of how it works.What are the factors that contribute to the search engine such as keywords, social media ( yes , it does play a role in SEO), etc. SEO is again something that you learn with your own experience and observation. We all know that if your product is a hit on Social media, it will climb up to the ladder of top 5 results on google, resulting in free traffic for those sites. Thus, social media plays a very important role in SEO. Thus, to make a career one needs to understand all these aspects. Once you gain good knowledge and experience, then your results will speak for yourself. In my opinion an internship of a part time job is a good start to your SEO career. After you have worked for a couple of months and have gain expertise in this subject, you can look for a full time job in a start-up ( corporate giants also look for SEO experts but only hire highly experienced experts who have an experience of minimum 2 years). So the best thing for SEO experts is that they can become free lancers and charge accordingly, or they can work in a start up that are open to digital marketers as well as SEO experts. Thus in my opinion, SEO is gaining momentum really quick in the world of start up as well as in the whole E-Commerce industry. It is a good career, but the initial days are a struggle like in any other profession. I would like to conclude on a note that an SEO expert earns around 184000 INR currently in India , and if you have an experience of 10 years , it is indeed a high paying job. ",

            "answer_text": "Once SEO was not a separate profession \u2013 Web masters performed some basic SEO for the sites they managed and that was all. But as sites began to grow and make money, it became more reasonable to hire a dedicated SEO specialist than to have the Web master do it. The demand for good SEO experts is high and is constantly on the rise. SEO is a profession that can be practiced while working for a company or as a solo practitioner. There are many jobboards like Dice and Craigslist that publish SEO job advertisements. It is worth noting that the compensation for SEO employees is equal to or even higher than that of developers, designers and marketers. Salaries over $80K per annum are not an exception for SEO jobs.  As a solo SEO practitioner you can make even more money. Almost all freelance sites have sections for SEO services and offers for $50 an hour or more are quite common. If you are still not confident that you can work on your own, you can start a SEO job, learn a bit and then start your own company. For somebody who comes from design, development or web administration, SEO might look not technical enough and you might feel that you will downgrade if you move to SEO. Don't worry so much \u2013 you can learn a LOT from SEO, so if you are a talented techie, you are not downgrading but you are actually upgrading your skills packages. ",

I have no idea if that makes sense but the point is, SEO as a career is one of the most globally competitive job on the planet and that no matter where you are in the world, you could be competing against people that will be happy with US$ 1.00/hour wages.  The key to survival is the be creative as SEO is part of marketing (although it crosses tech as well, it's generally marketing), it should be creative. And you should be able to communicate your creativity which is something hard to do as well. ",

As such, SEO should be that skill you think about as a large skill-set - like being a good writer, or being good with people. These are extremely valuable skills, but ones that often accompany others to truly be extremely valuable. Sadly, SEO came and went without every being a definitive career choice. Nobody currently in SEO ever decided to be an SEO, and before we entered the time period where SEO became an attractive career choice because of its potential lucrativeness, it was taken away as a potential exclusive option.

            "answer_text": "SEO is about lots of research, data analysis, hacks, tricks, trying out new things in an ever-changing environment. You can\u2019t stay in one place if you are in SEO, yesterday\u2019s tricks might not work today. But with all the change it\u2019s also about routine (as is any other work though), some things have to be done over and over again in order to get results and it usually takes time to see those. I\u2019d say if you\u2019re hungry for information, good at analysis, like finding new things before anybody else does, like figuring out how big systems like search engines work, are dedicated and patient, becoming an SEO might be a good option for you. As for the career perspectives, some say the demand is declining: http://www.conductor.com/blog/2016/03/digital-marketing-salaries-2016/ but it looks like it\u2019s the first time in 4 years and we can\u2019t say it\u2019s definitely going to decline later on. I personally think SEO is going to evolve. It may not be the same as we know it in the next several years, because hey, the world won\u2019t be the same, but it won\u2019t die either. All that being said, I think SEO is a good career option. ",

But the Search engine is being developed day after day. Everything is being manual. Can SEO be a career? Yes. But an SEO expert has to revolve as a search engine revolves. Day after day, the strategy behind rank is being less. The priority of quality content is going up. So every SEO expert should have deep knowledge about content. The priority must be on content. Otherwise, the short-cut techniques or bulk link building techniques will not give the result as most of the people think and would think. SEO careers will exist until the search engine extinct. But the strategy on link building will be being changed dramatically. The guys who depends on only link building should change their strategy and hone their ability to comprehend the content and to take content as a career. SEO can be a career but only understanding link building as a career is at risk. Once anyone wants to take SEO as a career, they must emphasize content today or tomorrow. ",
