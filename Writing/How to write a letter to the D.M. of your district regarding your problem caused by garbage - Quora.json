            "answer_text": "This is better taken care of by the Mayor, and the City Council. Unless they have an ongoing problem to do with garbage, water quality, flooding, Spring Cleaning days to clean up the city streets, serial killer, missing child, hot weather, elections, they will have a City Hall, or Town Hall meeting for a problem like this. If your neighbors are having problems, and there are children, and or the elderly, make that a big deal. Smell? Take some in with you or pictures, etc. I\u2019m not talking about getting picket signs, City Hall meetings should be kept calm. The City Attorney is always in the meetings, so if you can get a neighbor that is an attorney of some kind, have them sit in with you so they can direct your actions and words, also if it involves them\u2026 better for you all. Or if he has kin there in city and worried about them. I\u2019m not making light of your situation, I\u2019m just pointing out what gets heartstrings pulled in a city. If this is a bad area you live in, or if it is a brand-new subdivision, don\u2019t forget the old adage, \u2018The squeaky wheel gets the oil.\u2019 I don\u2019t know where that phrase came from, but my grandma told me that a lot, and boy does it work. Not aggressive, or rude, stay calm, if the first meeting does not go well. Go to plan B. and so on. This gets my blood boiling, but like where I have lived, the area by the courthouse, attorney offices, police station, bail bond agents galore. The city can dig up, and put down a beautiful streets clearly marked, sidewalks, street lights at night in less than a month, whereas the bad part of town can take up to two years to finish. Especially, garbage, water lines, street lights, police patrol. garbage pick up, city buses, etc. You get the picture, where you live is going to be the greatest outcome. So, plan, don\u2019t just show up mad before you even get to address the Mayor, (whom you and your neighbors voted for? the City Council whom you voted for?\u2019 Going for flattery, respect, staying calm, will get you a bunch of steps ahead of the game. You will be addressing narcissistic people who are there mostly for attention. Get some on your side so when they vote, it will be in your favor. Even greater, you have sought out some of them and was nice. Talking about it before it is presented is a no-no. At least in my book. When they get together for lunch, you want them to plan how to help your neighborhood, not get rid of a pest. Apply for a grant from the government, that way if you have to follow-up with Town Hall meetings you will have the title and the money to help along the project. I saw a lot places where I lived and covered for the newspapers, in the City Hall meetings and the Town Hall meetings, and on to the Board of Education meetings, where you might want to attend, when they want to raise taxes to pay for this depending upon how deep it will get. At the meeting you won\u2019t have but 5 minutes or less, because there\u2019s usually 5\u201310 things on the agenda. Don\u2019t forget the Chief of Police, and most of the city cops will be in attendance, Some might be your friends, family, or church members, etc. Get them on your side. Don\u2019t want to get arrested for \u2018disturbing the peace.\u2019 (If you get in trouble, like disturbing the peace, because these meetings go smooth until a disgruntled, the way they perceive complainers, these narcissistic show-offs, can hit below the belt, they will say or do anything to discredit or get you to blow your top. When you go in to jury trial, wave to your friends in the jury box. When they wave back, you will hear a big groan, \u2018Mistrial, all can go home.\u2019 This is why you must go prepared, and have done research. I\u2019m sure you want this taken care of in a timely manner, promise some votes, or call them on their promises during the election. Look up what they promised, remember the names and what they stood for. Call them on it, have that at the ready. Plan ahead, find out when the next meeting will be. When I was the political reporter, and crime reporter, and wrote an editorial column, we knew ahead of time when it would be. At night, 7\u201310 pm. once a month unless a crisis is going on. Don\u2019t get it so bad that they start having closed Executive Meetings, stay calm, and keep going like a turtle across the desert road. Write out points, pics, petitions if needed, keep your eye on the ball, keep it in their court, keep them on the offence till you get the outcome desired. Most of all very important, call your local newspaper, whoever handles the crime and the meetings at school, courthouse, hospital board meetings, elections, call the reporter in that department, get him or her on your side and cause, so she can write what you didn\u2019t have time to say or produce. Take pics, save them time, and have the important notes and points for her. Otherwise, she might get busy with one of the other LOUD complaints and you will go on the back burner, you want top billing. If this is a water, sewer, garbage problem, remember who runs it\u2026be nice, play nice. Stay safe, get as many involved as possible, keep paper trails, notes ongoing. If this is a big problem, one that involves ripping up the city, or an issue of rich and poor, and who gets help first, make some money out of this, and get the problem solved. I always say, \u2018there\u2019s a solution to EVERY problem. Your creative mind, or brainstorming with neighbors, and the Holy Bible which has an answer to EVERY problem. People in these positions depending on the size of the town, little\u2026 they think they own the place, big town, they already are living on grants and kickbacks from the U.S Government. You would be surprised at the many and varied grants are out there for the easy picking. AND you will find your grant writer at all the town meetings. USE the grant money for what you said, or you all will have to pay it back to the government, keep clean records if you have to go that way. Might as well get rich and elected as mayor\u2026LOL why not?? You have a right to get a grant from the Government. If you have a place or people in mind, and a grant you are 3/4 of the way. Saving time for the city council, secretary, and the Mayor, and making him look good. But, geez he can\u2019t just flit around the city shaking hands, remind him with a smile, you need help and know what he promised in his political speeches and ads, the political reporter probably will have written most of it for them. You want funds for all your efforts to clean up the city, but play nice, and know WHO you are playing marbles with in the schoolyard. Too much? Too close for comfort, quietly bow out and give it to God, put it in HIS capable hands. (Pray and make your requests made known to God. (paraphrased) Philippians 4:4\u20137 NKJV.) God Bless you all, and I will pray for a hedge of protection for your project. ",
