            "answer_text": "You can do numerical experiments with a mathematical model and report the results. You can develop a new and better mathematical model. You can develop a new and useful mathematical or analytical method or mathematical proof. You can write a review of recent literature in your field. You can do laboratory or mesocosm experiments. You can analyse data that are publicly available (Open  Data) in a way that they haven't been analysed before, or re-analyse data that have been published by someone else to reach a new conclusion. You can analyse data that are available to you, though not publicly (data mining or otherwise analysing the literature in your field, for instance). You can conduct a meta-analysis of published data on a topic. Do any of these well, and write up the results, and you will have a research paper. ",

            "answer_text": "Some of my friends in the past have been researchers, and some don't do field studies. They do it by buying raw data from other universities. After that, it's just a matter of doing your data analysis and writing up your research paper as if you did the field studies to obtain the data. The only thing you must mention is that you acquired the data. ",
