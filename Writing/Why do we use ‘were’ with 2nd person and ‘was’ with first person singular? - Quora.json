            "answer_text": "I think we use \u2018were\u2019 when we talk to someone, (the person or persons we talk to, are referred to, in grammar, as the 2nd person) . The grammarians are to blame for the misunderstanding here, it should read \u20182nd person(s)\u2019 as the audience of the 1st person could be 3,4 or 10 persons. So the 2nd person is referred to in the plural,\u2019were\u2019. The 1st person; the speaker, is mostly always one person, speaking to his audience, so we use the singular form of the verb, \u2018was\u2019, in, \u201cI was enjoying myself watching the dog play\u201d Thanks for your question. I also struggled with this problem of understanding for years, but in the end threw the grammar books away, and did my own mining. ",

            "answer_text": "Because English speakers prefer not to use the proper pronouns that match singular, and \"YOU\" is really the plural form being misused as both singular and plural. Therefore YOU requires matching plural verbs. The archaic form for singular didn't have this problem which confuses most students learning English grammar. Thou art You are he hit thee hard thou wast most superb etc etc etc. ",
