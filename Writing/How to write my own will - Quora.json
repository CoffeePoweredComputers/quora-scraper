            "answer_text": "Yes, it's possible to write your own will.  Is it smart to do so depends entirely on your circumstances - the amount of your assets, any \"weird\" family situations (such as specifically disinheriting a child, spouse, or other relation), etc.  If you do want to write your own will, you want to make sure that you understand what the specific requirements are in your state or country for a \"valid\" will.  There are many source books that may provide insight, including those published by Nolo Press (the mention of which should not imply any endorsement on my part). ",
