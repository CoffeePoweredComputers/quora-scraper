            "answer_text": "Luke 6:31 is more frequently called the Golden Rule. \u201cDo to others the same way you want people to treat you.\u201d - NASB* This is a more succinct and easier to remember version of the same idea contained in Matthew 7:12. If all mankind were to do this, the world would know peace and harmony. All would be right as rain and good as Gold. Jesus said all that God has instructed, all that God desires of us can be summed up in two commandments, \u201cLove the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.\u2019 This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 This \u201cGolden Rule,\u201d \u201cDo to others the same way you want people to treat you.\u201d is an effective way to love your neighbor as yourself. *I use the NASB version, as it is the most accurate version word for word regarding the original scriptures.

            "answer_text": "The so called \u2018Golden Rule\u2019 is to be found in the teaching of many religious leaders, including the Jewish Rabbi, Hillel, in 20 B.C. It is said that a Gentile challenged him to sum up the Law in the time that the challenger could stand on one leg. In response, Hillel, like others before and after, formulated his rule negatively: \u201cWhat is hateful to you, do not do to anyone else. This is the whole Law ; all the rest is commentary\u201d Jesus on the other hand, formulated the so called \u2018Golden Rule\u2019 positively \u201cSo in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you\u201d (Matthew 7:12). Back to the question: Why is Matthew 7:12 called the \u2018Golden Rule\u2019? It is called the \u2018Golden Rule\u2019 because the term suggests strongly that what we have here in Matthew 7:12 is a rounding off, not just of the immediately preceding verses, but of the whole Sermon on the Mount in Matthew\u2019s Gospel. To many, what we have here is a summary of the will of God for our lives that is flexible enough to be applied to other situations (\u2018everything\u2019) in addition to those already explicitly dealt with. The problem of course, is, that if this saying does \u201csum up\u201d the whole rest of the Law, where does the love of God fit in? I ask this because the similar reference to the \u201cLaw and the Prophets\u201d in Matthew 22:40 includes BOTH of the great commandments \u2014 namely \u2014 Love for God as well as love for neighbor. Here in Matthew 7:12 Jesus is clearly only referring directly to the second commandment, but that does not mean that the first is absent from his mind. There is a personal aspect in all the teaching of the Sermon ; we are to rely on our heavenly Father. Prayer is to begin with the name, kingdom and will of the Father. In 6:24 serving God is explained as loving and being devoted to him. Clearly, this commandment (Matthew 7:12) must not be used as a substitute for the gospel of grace. This is not a rule to obey as a means of winning salvation. Nor is Jesus saying that we should do this as a matter of self-interest, in order to have the same done to us. The Christian must be motivated by gratitude for God\u2019s good gifts (Matthew 7:11) and love to the One who has first loved us. This is the natural response of one who understands the blessedness of being a child of God (Matt. 5:1\u201312). The trouble is that Christians have reacted so forcefully against the abuse of the verse that they have neglected to obey it. It is said that the Roman Emperor, Alexander Severus, had it written on his wall in gold. Certainly it is a good motto to have constantly before our eyes, to obey, not just admire. Let us apply it to showing mercy (Matt. 5:7), being forgiven (Matt. 5:23\u201324). giving to the needy (Matt. 6:2) and judging (Matt. 7:1\u20132). We may use this principle to illuminate the commands of Scripture, to examine our words and deeds, our reactions and responses, to stir ourselves up to action, and to avoid the misunderstanding of others.
