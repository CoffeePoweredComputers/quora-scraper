            "answer_text": "Ellen, thanks for the A2A. I\u2019m fascinated that you find refuge in writing dialogue when so many struggle with that over writing narrative. Score a big point for you! To get better at creative writing, and specifically at narrative, you can start here: Don\u2019t beat yourself up when you write \u201crubbish\u201d (or \u201ccrap,\u201d as we call it here in the States.) Even seasoned writers will have barf sessions on a bad day or with a new project. Sometimes our creative bodies need to rid themselves of some toxins first, just like our physical ones do.Write down a short list of writers\u2019 whose work you love. Then:Read a piece of work, and in your case, pay close attention to how they handle narrative.Analyze what makes their writing so appealing (especially the narrative for you). They likely use phrases that \u201cshow instead of tell.\u201d For example, instead of saying, \u201cHe ran quickly through the forest,\u201d the passage may say, \u201cHe ran through the forest as though pursued by a maniacal killer, the bushes and limbs ripping at his face and clothes with each stride.\u201d That creates a sense of tension and urgency, maybe a little panic, for the reader\u2014certainly much more so than \u201cquickly.\u201dWrite down what you analyze and practice writing narratives like that. In fact, you could use one of those passages as a prompt to rewrite the scene in your own words.Don\u2019t assume what you write is rubbish. Get some feedback from a friend, a family member, a writers\u2019 group (in person or online) or in a class environment.Read articles online from such publications as Writer\u2019s Digest(R) Magazine and The Writer Magazine. There are lots of smaller publications with sites, too. You get informational articles, samples, advice from famous writers, contests to enter\u2026you name it.Have some fun practicing with short fiction, anything from a sentence to a couple thousand words. The library and bookstore have plenty of books with writing prompts, and they can be found online as well. Experiment with different voices\u2014the page is your stage! Characters don\u2019t always demonstrate their feelings with dialogue. What narrative would you give to describe the old fellow on the park bench? The 5-year-old girl arguing with her mother for five more minutes on the playground, as seen by a woman who cannot bear children?We all get discouraged at one time or another. But let it pass and try again. When your effort yields that one paragraph at last that makes you leap out of your chair in victory, when you get a tear out of a writing buddy, when you support your dialogue with an active voice (not passive) description of action\u2026 You realize the rubbish was just the tinder for the fire. Happy writing to you! ",

            "answer_text": "You wrote: I\u2019ve been trying to do some creative writing and I end up writing most of the story in speech because I just don\u2019t know how to narrate things, or I end up purposefully trying to narrate in a way that sounds rubbish. I don\u2019t hear a sense of purpose or enjoyment in your statement. Mainly I hear frustration. Is there a reason why you\u2019re trying to do this? Reading books like Anne Lamott\u2019s Bird by Bird and Ursula LeGuin\u2019s Steering the Craft will help. I chose those in particular because of the kind of writing they suggest, and the insight they give into the writing process. Classes help immensely. (I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re not already in a class and asking this question because you\u2019re struggling.) In a class with a competent instructor, you\u2019ll get valuable feedback, and suggestions to help improve your prose. Hopefully you\u2019ll also have reading assignments that will help you \u2018see\u2019 how voice and style develop in writing. The most important thing you can do, though, is keep practicing. It\u2019s not a skill that you can pick up in a few days, or even several dedicated weeks. It\u2019s often a lifelong process. Here are some things you can consider doing to give yourself the best chance to make progress: Apply yourself \u2013 keep striving to do better, and put in the hours.Get good feedbackLearn how to use that feedbackTake advantage of your strengthsMitigate the effects of your weaknesses or eliminate them using good grammar and literary techniquesContinue your education through classes, reading about writing, and reading authors whose work you admire to see how they solved their narrative challenges.I\u2019m concerned about one thing in particular that you wrote in your question: I end up purposefully trying to narrate in a way that sounds rubbish. Purposefully? I\u2019m not sure if you meant what this sounds like you meant, or if you\u2019re consciously or subconsciously resisting narration in your work. Maybe you think it\u2019s a waste of time, or something about narration intimidates you. Until you untangle the source of that resistance, it\u2019s going to be hard to move forward. Remember that writers are the worst judges of their own writing. Often the things that they love or think that they excel at need work, while the parts that frustrate them turn out to be some of the parts that work the best. This is why educated feedback is important. Creative writing instructors, professional writers, and developmental editors are all good sources of educated feedback.It\u2019s almost impossible to write well when your inner critic is tearing you down while you\u2019re putting words on the page. Try meditating beforehand, distract yourself with music while your writing, or some other technique to rid yourself of the inner critic.First drafts aren\u2019t supposed to be perfect. A draft is just one step in a process that leads to good writing. The amount of revision and editing that\u2019s required after the first draft varies with the writer and their individual process. But all of us do our best to write honestly, from the heart, using all of our senses and inventiveness to get that first draft down. After that, revision and editing are a matter of mechanics and artistic judgement. Some people love first drafts and despise revisions, others go the other way, and still others enjoy the whole writing adventure. If you struggle with one aspect of writing, don\u2019t assume that you\u2019ll always struggle and always hate it. In time your process, and whether or not you enjoy the various parts of that process, will change.I hope this helps! ",
