            "answer_text": "One more time\u2026magic is neutral, not \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cwhite\u201d. If by \u201cblack\u201d you mean aggressive or with the aid of inhumane spirits or deities, why anyone would go to them for \u201clove\u201d, I don\u2019t understand unless the objective is truly vengeance. Being real, much of the time when people ask for love spells, what they want is either closure or vengeance. They don\u2019t really want the target or want them back per se. They just want the opportunity to end it on their own terms. In this, I have been very successful many times, but this is partly because I don\u2019t buy a lot of the b.s. that potential clients come to me with. Otherwise, I\u2019m shooting for the wrong target. I will help someone achieve vengeance if they were wronged. I\u2019m not going to waste the risk that an actual love spell involves to save a family or something, on a quest for vengeance. I would venture that most of the inexpensive \u201clove spells\u201d one sees advertised for under $100 wherein someone actually does some work, are works of vengeance because this is commonly known information by most spell casters. Vengeance is cheap because it is easy and doesn\u2019t really require even a lot of investment in wrathful spirits so long as one is reasonably observant. Most of us who do witchcraft regularly have to be observant to a balanced array of deities and spirits in our pantheon simply to function well, and some of them are going to be wrathful/aggressive. So it\u2019s basically some little offerings to make what goes around come around a bit faster. If someone got dumped badly or harmed in a relationship, you make it official that the person who did wrong should not get off clean and easy. So some may advertise this as \u201cblack magic\u201d, but it\u2019s really just a strong push for balance. The reason so many new agers these days are running around throwing shade on love spells is because they\u2019ve been affected by male privilege. They don\u2019t like women or feminine people being able to answer back, and want their physical force to be the only force there is to defend one\u2019s self. They fear women and want to go around dipping and doing what they want with no consequences, so they try to make people feel guilty for wanting justice. You don\u2019t have to feel guilty, and your desire to have the chance to wipe the smirk off your ex\u2019s face is perfectly legit. Just make sure you know what you\u2019re doing to hire or enlist someone who knows what they\u2019re doing. Blessings! ",

            "answer_text": "A word of advice to you, doing a black magic love spell can have unwanted (and downright scary) results, such as obsessive behaviour, so be careful. Unfortunately, I saw this happen to one of my closest friends years ago, we'll call her Jenny. Jenny was very infatuated with one of her coworkers but he was in a relationship. She had two spells cast for her, one to make him leave his girl and another to make him fall for her. These spells were cast by the Crotona Fellowship so I know that this was some heavy duty magick. Her spells worked and initially, she was very content. He followed her 24/7 like an obedient dog. It actually put a strain on our friendship because whenever we wanted girl time, he insisted on tagging along. Plus, I was uncomfortable around this guy. The way he looked at her wasn't romantic, it was creepy, like he literally wanted a piece of her soul. Anyway, after about two months, she started complaining to me about him. She was tired of him being around all the time. He wanted to know her EVERY move. She tried performing a reverse spell but it didn't work. In fact, it seemed as if he became even more obsessive. The breaking point came one night when Jenny came over for tea. We were just hanging out and having a chat. Around eleven, someone starts banging at my door. I opened it and there HE stood, looking very upset and disheveled. He walked right past me and went straight to Jenny. He started screaming at her saying that she should have let him know where she was. Apparently, she hadn't been replying to his texts. Anyway, he's screaming at her and I started telling him that he better leave my home immediately. He ignored me and grabbed Jenny by the arm. At at that point, I ran into my bedroom and woke my husband up (he's military, super buff and an all-around badass). He grabs his gun, walks to the living room and tells him to leave or he'll shoot. He finally left. After that incident, she got a restraining order against him but that didn't keep him away. She ended up moving to another city. As for the man, he finally left her alone after the spell had run its course. To this day, she doesn't like talking about it. As I said, be careful with black magic love spells. ",

This probably means spells to make someone fall in love with you, or to interfere with someone else\u2019s love life. It doesn\u2019t matter whether anyone\u2019s successfully used them or not, because you shouldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s just plain unethical. Sure, some people have had success robbing banks, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should do it. Spells like these also tend to backfire, so even if you were successful, it probably wouldn\u2019t be fore the best. As others have said, love spells are really risky. You don\u2019t have to stay away from them entirely, but unlike most spells, you should remain as general and vague as possible. When you do spells involving other people, you should leave the details up to the gods. ",

But dont cast for that one for one person or two for two people. Cause then it is getting fucking messy. The two spells fight its other n u wont like the results. personally I wouldnt do it (again) cuz all u get is a stalker after all with no free will, and those things might end up pretty bad. In ur place I would try a \u201cfind me attractive\u201d spell or something to bring love and affection. Love spells r a mess 90% of the time they work against u \u201cbe careful what u wish for\u201d is the only advice I want to give u ",

To make someone do something they do not want to do, to behave differently than is natural for them is so fundamentally wrong, it is akin to rape. It is inconceivable to me that someone would want to impose their will in such a way, and gain any type of real, healthy satisfaction from such a reprehensible act.
