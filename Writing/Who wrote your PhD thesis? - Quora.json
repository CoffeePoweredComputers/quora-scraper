            "answer_text": "He was a guy I once knew. Incredibly hard-working, committed and always had an aura of unwavering spirit that was almost impossible to perturb. He had a huge heart. Once he would start a piece work, his attention was almost laser-like. Moreover, he had the capacity to sustain this sort of attention for multiple hours. So, I decided that he was the most suitable candidate for undertaking a work-load as taxing as a PhD thesis. He was my last hope. Almost. He is generally quite an intense person, pursuing multiple goals at the same time. So, I was a bit hesitant to contact him. I knew he would decline because he had better jobs to do. And why he, afterall, do it for me? I had to make up my mind. Time was closing by. I now only had 4 months left to submit. Should have contacted him earlier. Alas! I always thought I could do this by myself without anyone\u2019s help. How wrong was I?! I now had no other choice. He was my last resort. Surprisingly, he too knew this. He had always been watching me but without entering my radar. With a heavy heart and lots of sweat, I finally approached him. He looked straight into my shame-filled face. He almost had that evil grin on his face. An expression that read, \u201cGuess who\u2019s in trouble now?\u201d Of course it was me. Why would he be in trouble? He is an achiever. Never has he failed to excel. He stared at me for a couple of hours. Damn this guy! He did not accept to help me immediately. He asked me a couple of hard questions which I was unable to answer: \u201cWhat were you doing all these days?\u201d, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have thought of me a little earlier?\u201d, \u201cWhy do you always approach me closer to a deadline?\u201d, \u201cAre you trying to exploit me?\u201d, \u201cYou know that I am a busy person, still you count on me?\u201d These were tough questions. I had no answer. He was right. I always took him for granted. I always approached him right towards a deadline. I never engaged with him during normal days. Never paid him any respect. But he was my man. Time was running out and I now only had three more months. Negotiation! Negotiation! Negotiation! The guy wouldn\u2019t budge. You may ask me, \u201cWhy not just write the damn thing off yourself?\u201d I hear you. The answer is I can\u2019t. I am very less focused, distracted and quite playful. I waste a lot of time on youtube videos and reading random science articles. I even read articles like \u201cCommunism Vs Socialism in the 21st century\u201d although I don\u2019t understand anything and which has nothing to do with my PhD. But not him. He is damn focused, articulate, sharp and fiercely committed. Anyday, he could write about 6\u20137 scientific paragraphs in a day. And we are talking of a quality, robust paragraph that would require very less editing or corrections. Finally, with just two months remaining and at the point I was almost about to cry, he agreed. Everything else was easy. Day 1: 1000 words to start off with Day 2: 1500 words Day 3: Day 4: . . . . . Day 55: 79,910 words submitted! Day 84: Viva passed! Day 84.5: Dr\u2026.. Deal over. All thanks to him! In order to repay his timely, invaluable and magnanimous help, a help that I can hardly think of repaying, I allowed him to attend my graduation ceremony instead of me. Funnily, no one from my university or my friends spotted him. It has turned out quite good for both of us. I really wish I don\u2019t ever contact him again. I want to be like him- sharp and focused at the job at hand. He lives extremely close to me. He is my inspiration.  Although it can be quite risky, I am going ahead and sharing a pic of him from my graduation ceremony.   I hope this answers your burning question. ",

            "answer_text": "Truly, this is a disturbing question. First of all, the point of obtaining one\u2019s PhD is for that person to reach that achievement. What purpose is served if someone else does the work, other than a dishonest claim of a doctorate? Also, many universities, including the one that I attend (Capella University) require an agreement that there is no plagiarism. By having someone else write your thesis, you are likely violating one, if not more, academic honesty policies at the university that is being attended. In many cases, that would be grounds for expulsion. Finally, what is your purpose for obtaining a doctorate? It would seem that if you are not inclined to do the work that is involved (and believe me, it is work, even for those of us who find academics easy!), then you would be further ahead to set your sights a little lower. There are counseling programs that provide \u201ccertifications\u201d where the work involved is quite low (especially compared to a doctorate). Granted, I cannot speak to the value of the certification, but it would be more honest if you attained something on your own and if that is easier, maybe it is an option. But, for the sake of the honesty of the position of the doctorate, please do not consider muddying it with dishonest methods of having someone else do the work that is supposed to be done by the doctoral student. It is not appreciated and it is not respected within the doctoral community. Thank you. ",
