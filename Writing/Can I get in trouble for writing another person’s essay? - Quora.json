            "answer_text": "Well, I did it once in college, and the professor knew right away from the other writings my friend had done, that it wasn't the same style or vocabulary my friend had. You can't fake style or depth of sentence structures. My friend was asked to write another essay to prove it was hers. Now what were we going to do? I couldn't take her final in class essay for her, either. So we both went to the professor and apologized. The professor could have failed my friend in the class. It's in the handbook. She failed the paper and let my friend do extra credit. My friend ended up with a \u201cC\u201d, and we both learned a good lesson. My friend learned to write on her own, and I learned that in the long run, a friend can help, but taking over someone else's work is prideful and wrong. ",
