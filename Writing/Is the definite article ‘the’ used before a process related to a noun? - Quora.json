            "answer_text": "Since the process (multiplication in this example) is a noun, you would treat it just like any other noun. You\u2019ve asked about the sentences in the form of: [Condition[ [affects] [process] of [noun]. There is no rule that governs this structure. Sometimes, you should use the definite article, sometimes the indefinite article, and sometimes no article. It depends on the process you choose. The standard usage for any process is arbitrary; you just have to memorize it. Examples: Warmth promotes the growth of bacteria. Anemia causes a decline in the number of red blood cells. Elephantiasis causes thickening of the bones. ",
