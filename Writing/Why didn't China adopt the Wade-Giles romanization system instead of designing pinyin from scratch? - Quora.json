            "answer_text": "The Wade Giles system is clunky. I have read his logic behind all those apostrophes, but I think it was a stupid idea to write ch\u2019 and ch, t\u2019 and t, and so forth. It does give the writing an exotic look, I suppose, but it\u2019s just not practical. Usually, especially with names, people would end up leaving them out, so \u6d82 T\u2019u and \u675c Tu both became Tu. There are advantages to Wade Giles. For example, \u5b8b Sung is better than Song, and \u7109 yen is better than yan. This is said considering that the Wade Giles system is based on English, and that English is the main foreign language in China now. Where Wade Giles had ch\u2019, now you have q, and instead of hs, you have x, which people who don\u2019t know Chinese have no idea how to pronounce. Even if you had never heard Chinese, you could more or less guess how to pronounce ch\u2019 and hs. But of course, people will go out of their way to mispronounce words (in English, there seems to be a fad to pronounce the silent t in often). Beijing should be pretty easy for an English speaker to guess, bei you could guess would be like bay, and jing should be a no-brainer, jingle bells, for crying out loud! But now many Westerners pronounce it in the Russian or French manner, Beizhzhzhzzzhhing. Ridiculous. However, as far as I know, awful spellings like Peking, Tientsin, and Kiang (\u6c5f\uff09 come from the English postal system, and are supposedly based on either dialectical pronunciations or British attempts at Chinese, and should not be blamed on Wade Giles.

            "answer_text": " According to the table above, the only thing you can see is that Hanyu Pinyin is much shorter than other romanization schemes, although other romanization schemes might be easier to pronounce for a native English speaker, especially \u201cXinjiang\u201d, as in the last column. Bopomofo looks pretty concise actually, but it is not a romanization scheme and therefore difficult for internationalization. Actually, the Hanyu Pinyin scheme was a part of the Chinese characters Latinization movement (\u6c49\u5b57\u62c9\u4e01\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8). The aim was to abolish Chinese characters, rather than just phonetics. There were many these kinds of movements, e.g. Latinxua Sin Wenz (\u62c9\u4e01\u5316\u65b0\u6587\u5b57). While the Hanyu Pinyin scheme was developing, Mao Zedong (\u6bdb\u6cfd\u4e1c) announced, \u201ccharacter system must be reformed and we must obey the common romanization direction as the world does\u201d (\u6587\u5b57\u5fc5\u987b\u6539\u9769\uff0c\u8981\u8d70\u4e16\u754c\u6587\u5b57\u5171\u540c\u7684\u62fc\u97f3\u65b9\u5411). As a result, Hanyu Pinyin scheme was trying to be made as simple as possible, as short as possible, regardless of logic. Thus, many awful spellings came out, such as \u201cq\u201d and \u201cx\u201d. As time went by, Latinization movement failed. Consequently, Hanyu Pinyin became just a phonetic scheme. ",
