            "answer_text": "not that big of a difference if you\u2019re a good writer. sometimes it\u2019s a little difficult because you\u2019ll start writing in first person again, but if you\u2019re doing it to improve you\u2019re writing you keep that in the back of your mind, knowing you need to stick to third person pronouns and actions. at first it seems a little odd but it\u2019s not difficult to get the hang of. hope that helped :) ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, it\u2019s an adjustment. But not impossible. Remember to focus on that character\u2019s POV. The way I look at it is writing the main character from first person with a couple supporting characters in third. And place them in separate chapters. Although everyone\u2019s different. ",
