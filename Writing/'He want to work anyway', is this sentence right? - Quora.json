            "answer_text": "No, the sentence is incorrect. We have discussed this on Quora a NUMBER of times. I think you should often go through English grammar answers on Quora - and you'll get the answer even before you ask. Third person Singular (He/She/It) goes with an - s suffix verb in the PRESENT TENSE. Thus: Third pers. Sing. + verb+s. He/she/it work+s > He works, She works, It works. He sleeps, She sleeps, It sleeps. He plays, She plays, It plays. He goes, She goes, It goes. He drives, She drives, It drives. He supplies (books/food), She supplies (books/food), It (The van, for ex.) supplies (books/food). Note that after an \u2018-o\u2019 ending verb (go, do) and after a verb that ends in \u2018consonant +y\u2019 (supply imply, carry, party), spelling rules apply in accordance with rules of English spelling. No changes occur for the past tense, regardless of person (1st, 2nd, 3rd), or number (singular plural). Thus: I drove /slept /cooked/walked You drove/ slept/cooked\u2026 He/She/It drove /walked\u2026 They slept/cooked\u2026 We cooked/drove\u2026 Thus, your sentence should be either: He wants to work anyway (present /future) OR: He wanted to work anyway (past).

            "answer_text": "No, and there are two possible ways to correct the sentence depending on what you mean. 1. \u201cHe went to work anyway\" as in \u201cHe didn't feel well, but he went to work anyway\". This means that he did go to work despite feeling unwell. 2. \u201cHe wants to work anyway\" as in \u201cHe didn't feel well but he wants to work anyway\".This means that he still has the desire to work despite not being well.
