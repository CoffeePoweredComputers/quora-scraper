            "answer_text": "I once nearly drowned as a teenager. It\u2019s a long story, but I wasn\u2019t breathing when they pulled me out of the water, and I ended up in hospital. Funny thing was that I LOVED swimming. But after that episode, I sincerely disliked swimming. I was nervous in the water. I felt something was going to attack me from below\u2026 I was actually scared. Bear with me - this IS relevant to the question and to my answer to the question. A month later, I was at university, but swimming was still intensely anxiety-triggering. But I wasn\u2019t having any of that anxiety bullshit. I enrolled in a scuba diving course and learned to dive in the snow, with an ancient wet suit full of holes and ancient equipment. It was horrible. But\u2026 I lost my anxiety. I started to enjoy the water again. And I ultimately ended up working as a scuba diving instructor (years later) for about 12 years\u2026 What is the point of my tale? \u201cWriter\u2019s Block\u201d isn\u2019t a thing. People use it as an excuse. It\u2019s a lazy way out. \u201cOooh, I have writer\u2019s block, so there isn\u2019t any point in sitting down and writing\u2026 So I might as well goof off. But as anyone knows who is serious about writing knows, writing is really, really hard work. There will be days when the words flow almost on their own, and there will be days where you struggle for hours with a single sentence and feel useless and incapable. And here\u2019s the trap: If you now convince yourself that you have some made-up mysterious ailment like \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d, then you will end up actually convincing yourself that you can\u2019t write. And each time to try to do so anyway, you\u2019ll ascribe failure to write productively to this \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d, which reinforces your conviction that you are useless. And this brings us back to the tale at the beginning of the answer. Don \u2019t let this anxiety, this \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d take control. I\u2019m convinced that there is no such thing because I find it is not useful to believe that it is a real thing. My tactical approach to kicking the ass of \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d real or fake\u2026 is to sit down every single gorram day and write. No matter what. Write. If I think I have \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d or constipation of my creative flow\u2026 I still write. Because I\u2019m not letting myself get in the way. Some days what you write will be shit. Shrug and move on. But keep at it. Don\u2019t let your fear that you can\u2019t write actually get a name and all. Just get out there and kick its ass. Like I did when I thought I\u2019d never be able to swim and enjoy the experience again. I faced that fear and kicked its ass so thoroughly that it\u2019s still looking for its bum thirty years later. Do the same for your writing, if you\u2019re serious about writing as well as you possibly can. Don\u2019t let some piddling worry that you can\u2019t write get in your way. Get out there and show it that it\u2019s wrong. Just do it, basically. Then this \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d thing has no more power over you. Just write. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it writer\u2019s block. I look at it as an obstruction to write which can be caused by a number of things. We\u2019ve come to a stopping point in our story There are times when I\u2019m at my keyboard, or with a notebook and pen and I just can\u2019t seem to write fast enough. I have so much to say, I\u2019m excited and the words are just filling the pages. I type and type , the time whizzes by and then suddenly it comes to a halt. It\u2019s like someone just turned off the switch. Some will refer to this as writers block. For me it\u2019s just a stopping point in my writing. I\u2019ve simply reached a point in my story that I need to sit back and think more about before putting pen to paper. When this happens, I don\u2019t stare at the manuscript, frustrated and in despair, waiting for the words to begin to form again. No, I walk away. It\u2019s time to regroup myself, refresh my mind and find other activities to do. I remove myself entirely from my writing activities. Sometimes a cup of tea will do the trick and I\u2019ll return fifteen minutes later. Other times it maybe a few hours, but when I do return, my mind is fresh, I have new ideas and I\u2019m anxious to write again. The key is to walk away and give your mind a break. You want to write but can\u2019t come up with any ideas We are writers because we love to write, we love to create and we have many stories to tell. But sometimes our creative juices runs dry. This is when we need a little push to get us inspired again. There are so many methods one can use to ignite fresh ideas. Here are just a few: writing promptsPictures from magazinePhotographsLook out your window - Write about what you see and create a story from the scene .Newspaper and magazine articles.Your petsFinding that inspiration is just like writing. You need to be creative. Look around you, there are so many things to inspire a story. You can find more writing prompts on my website Weekly 7-day writing prompts Archives - Tina Hogan Grant Life gets in the way Another issue writers experience, is finding the time to write. As much as we want to write, our busy lives keeps getting in the way. Sometimes we can\u2019t even find one hour out of our busy schedules to write. When this begins to happen we have to remind ourselves that our writing is just as important as those dishes that are calling us to be washed, or the grass that needs to be mowed. We need to get into the habit of putting time aside to write on a daily basis. If we don\u2019t it can sometimes turn into days if not weeks before we attempt to write again. Periods like these can mistakingly be referred to writer\u2019s block when it fact it\u2019s your everyday life that is preventing you from writing. Knowing the reasoning for your lack of writing, it can be rectified pretty easily. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWriters\u2019 Block\u201d (WB) is an affliction almost unknown among writers, something akin to farmers\u2019 lung or housemaid\u2019s knee. There are three forms of the affliction. By far the most common form, and the one most widely discussed here on Quora is a strange phenomenon. Thousands, perhaps millions, of people, who could not by any stretch of any imagination (apart those imaginations of other members of this group) be described fairly as \u201cwriters\u201d discover that they have nothing to say and/or don\u2019t know how to say it. These people are not writers, so cannot suffer from WB. They are simply people who say they are writers, yet they cannot even start, let alone complete, a work that anyone other than highly sympathetic friends or members of their family would want to read. These are the kind of people who suffer from altitude sickness walking up the hill to fetch a pail of water. This is not WB. This is just a combination of attention seeking behavior, laziness and an absence of talent. It\u2019s very common. More than 99% of people suffer from it, but the symptoms do not become obvious until they decide to call themselves writers for no clear reason. That\u2019s what most people on Quora are suffering from. Lack of ideas, energy, originality or talent. Little snowflakes. Then there are two forms suffered by people who \u201canyone\u201d would describe as a writer, not just themselves and their support group. There is an answer somewhere by Andy Weir, author of The Martian, in response to one of the many question from those non-writers above asking how to cure their WB. He says, \u201cGo for a walk.\u201d This answer satisfies \u201creal\u201d writers completely, but lacks the depth and complexity necessary to satisfy those who are living in fantasy land, but who can\u2019t write about it. You see, most things you think of as WB are just a combination of laziness, boredom and a lack of ideas. It\u2019s not some magical Jungian affliction, though I think there is a Robertson Davies novel about a blocked writer seeking Jungian counselling, but that is the next group. You know when kids don\u2019t want to school today, or when you don\u2019t want to go to work? Coal miners block, first graders block. Almost all WB is nothing more than a lack of ideas, and frankly, it can only be suffered by \u201cwriters.\u201d I almost never have any ideas, I almost never feel like writing, I am almost always too lazy to be bothered writing, just like most of the world and certainly most of the people above. It is the normal human condition. It only really matters for writers and people arrogant or stupid enough to call themselves writers. For a writer, it is only a problem when it starts to interfere with their income - and yes, that is the definition of a writer: a person for whom writing forms a substantial part of their income. The way to cure it is to go for a walk, get stoned, have drink, bake a cake, masturbate, watch a movie, go to the shooting/golf range, drive your car around the backroads,, have a nap, strangle a chicken. It\u2019s not a \u201cthing\u201d any more than any other lack of enthusiasm for work is a thing. Then there is REAL WB. This is a medical condition, a psychosis, and it does not happen a lot, but it does happen. Some writers simply find themselves unable to write, even afraid to write and it is a bit like erectile disfunction (ED), the more you look at it, the worse it becomes. \u201cToday, I\u2019m going to get it up and give my missus the shag of her life,\u201d is not a mindset that will cure ED , nor will pulling yourself together, no any of the other homespun remedies for mental illness. In short, WB, real WB, is a very rare psychological condition which affects a very small number of writers. It can be cured by therapy, it may just go away of its own accord or you may be stuck with it forever. It is not something you need to worry about before your third or fourth novel. ",

            "answer_text": "Writer\u2019s block is not an equal opportunity affliction. Non-fiction writers rarely experience it. Their work depends on organizational skills and clear thinking. Both are pretty sturdy. Fiction writers are prone to writer\u2019s block because their work depends on imagination and imagination is one of the by-products of self-confidence. When fiction writers experience diminished self confidence\u2014they\u2019re facing a writing problem they don\u2019t know how to solve, ideas just aren\u2019t coming to them, their inner editor tells them their idea or their work isn\u2019t very good\u2014they have trouble facing the blank screen or blank page. So, what\u2019s the cure? Do things that increase your self-confidence, but don\u2019t rely much on creativity. Do more research. You know you need to. Research provides you with the facts you need to make your book credible, but more than that, it sparks ideas. Work on your outline. Add details. Fill in the blanks. Deal with story holes. Excise the unbelievable. In other words, accomplish something\u2014not the writing of text, but something else, something useful, something that will give you a feeling of accomplishment. That will raise your self-confidence. What should you do with the tiny amount of renewed self-confidence? Pick out the part of your book that is easiest for you to imagine. Write that. Go on to the next easiest, and the next easiest. In that way, by the time you confront the hard stuff, you will have a pile of pages beside you of completed or well-drafted work. Nothing is better for your self-confidence than accomplishment. This is not a one-time solution to the problem, by the way. You can use it whenever you run up against a stone wall. It will give you the self-confidence to bust through the wall the next time you try. ",

It is a distressing condition in which the writer suddenly and inexplicably becomes incapable of the inspiration and the creative energy needed to form words out of thoughts with the style and elegance that fire up good prose. Another one of the writer's really bad times are those times when an event or subject he wants to write about, stubbornly defies coher\u00adent narration because all the facts are standing on their heads. I find myself confronted by both barri\u00aders from time to time. Take heart when the bogey strikes. Sooner than later, he departs, and you can go to work all over again. ",

New things and new places always excites a person.Go for long walks. Walking results in talking with brain.Try reading a good, less paged book.Listen to music. I recommend Classic.Watch interviews of famous writers.Spend time with your family and friends.If possible try spending your time with little children.Visit a temple/church, any holy place. You\u2019ll be surrounded with positive aura.Watch Movies.Try to forget the pain. Very important.",

Writers will get obsessively stuck on a section of their book, paragraph, or even one word for hours, day and yes sometimes weeks on end. The idea is to redirect and pull your craft in another direction momentarily then come back to it. Think of it as your friendly GPS saying, \u201cRerouting.\u201d Sitting in the same spot waiting for that highway repair blocking your way for construction workers to finish just does not make since.

In the most simplest of terms, a writer is said to be suffering from writer's block when they stare at a blank paper or screen and just blink. It is a period of utter dejection, loss of interest and loss of ideas. A writer is not able to write and enjoy their craft. Even if they do feel like writing, no words come to them. If the words do come, then the writer absolutely hates them because they make no sense, or the hand does not move to type or pen them. A writer's block is most commonly a manifestation of a burnout, loss of interest and priorities, fear, laziness and lack of a writing routine. ",

Basically what you have planned for the book is wrong on some level or in some way, and your subconscious is putting a hold on things until you fix it. You need to sit your ass down in a chair and start trying to think of all the other things that could happen in the story from that point.
