            "answer_text": " I\u2019ll recommend three free websites that I\u2019ve tried and liked. They are 750 Words, Hemingway Editor and Slick Write. And I'll tell you about two books that will help you get over your grammatical superstitions. You can\u2019t improve your writing until you have some writing to improve. To get started, try 750 Words. It\u2019s a website run by Buster and Kellianne Benson. The first thirty days are free. After that you\u2019re free to leave without subscribing if you don\u2019t want to continue using it. The Bensons won\u2019t bug you.  Among the things I liked about this site were the personal data visualizations. At the end of each session the site generates a chart. It tells you how many words you wrote, how long it took you to get to 750 words, how fast you typed and so on.  The site makes guesses about your feelings and concerns based on what you type, and charts them. It also makes guesses about your mindset, time orientation and other factors.  The site kept pegging sight as my primary sense. So I tested its algorithm by writing about tactile things. Lo and behold, it identified touch as my primary sense for that session. Hemingway Editor is another great site for improving your prose. I use TextWrangler, a free text editor from Bare Bones Software, for writing. So I write first and then copy and paste my stuff into Hemingway Editor. But a friend who uses Hemingway Editor prefers to write in the app itself. She then edits it according to the site's suggestions. Yellow highlights tell you when you\u2019ve written hard-to-read sentences. Red highlights show you sentences that are even harder to read. Green identifies instances of passive voice. The site uses violet to highlight phrases with simpler alternatives. It uses blue to highlight adverbs. It\u2019s not foolproof, mind you. Hemingway Editor misidentifies names ending in ly as adverbs. So Curtly, Twombly and Edgerly get blue highlights. Holly and Molly are kosher, but you get the finger-wagging routine for McNally. That\u2019s about the only limitation I\u2019ve encountered. Apart from that, it\u2019s a good way to practice concise writing. Slick Write is, well, pretty slick. This is a deep, full-featured site. It lets you customize your settings for writing essays, fiction or whatever. And it helps you write clear and vivid sentences. When you paste your copy into Slick Write, it analyzes and critiques your prose. And it gives you lots of statistics. So you\u2019ll know how many adjectives and adverbs you\u2019ve used. Also how often you\u2019ve lapsed into passive voice or used too many prepositional phrases. I first used Slick Write in November 2015, and didn\u2019t like it. The site was set in a sans-serif font and there was no way to fix that. So I used the contact form and sent a note to the site owners suggesting they change the font to Georgia. I explained that serif fonts are easier to read since serifs aid horizontal eye movement. They also aid comprehension. That\u2019s why newspapers are set in serif type. I added that designers who read know this and designers who don\u2019t, don\u2019t. Got an email from Craig Russell the next day saying he\u2019d changed the site\u2019s writing font to Georgia. Gosh that was quick, I thought, and thanked him. If you only have time to use one website to improve your style, I\u2019d recommend Slick Write. It will help you master the art of readable writing. Get a copy of Theodore M. Bernstein\u2019s Miss Thistlebottom\u2019s Hobgoblins: The Careful Writer\u2019s Guide to the Taboos, Bugbears and Outmoded Rules of English Usage. Also John R. Trimble\u2019s Writing with Style: Conversations on the Art of Writing. These books will help you overcome your grammatical superstitions. Take serial commas, for example. Good writers use them when they feel they need them. The trouble started when someone said that the serial comma was once called the Oxford comma. Pedantry became the rage. Pretentious people started saying \u201cOxford comma\u201d as if they had a lolly in their mouth. They even included the words \u201cOxford comma\u201d in their Twitter profiles as a badge of erudition. I once dated a woman who read law at Magdalen College, Oxford. When I asked her about Oxford commas, she looked confused. When I explained what they were, she said, \u201cOh, you mean serial commas.\u201d The thing is, punctuation is for pacing. Raymond Chandler understood that better than anybody before or since. That\u2019s one of the reasons why he\u2019s still a delight to read. Chandler knew he could speed up the pace of a sentence by skipping a comma. Here\u2019s an example of how he did this (the line is from his short story The King in Yellow): I\u2019m an occasional drinker, the kind of guy who goes out for a beer and wakes up in Singapore with a full beard. Some editors frown on using the serial comma only when it suits you. They cite the need for consistency. But as Emerson said, a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. Read a lot and write by ear. As a rule of thumb, if it sounds right, it probably is. If it isn\u2019t, you can be sure some busybody will tell you about it. And then, since this is the Internet, you can always fix it.
