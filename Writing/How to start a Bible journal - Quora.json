            "answer_text": "I've been live tweeting my reread of the Bible on Twitter, under the hashtag #VerityLTstheBible. I'm doing it so publicly because I had a specific purpose for this read-through: To evaluate the claim so many evangelicals have made to my face, that the Bible is self-contained, inerrant, and cannot possibly fail to convince me of the omnipotence of God, the saving power of Christ, or the necessity of voting Republican. Anyone can read a text as complex as the Bible on their own and find ways to interpret it to fit their expectations. By rereading it publicly, I'm challenging my followers to challenge me as I unpack the text. That's one way to do it. Another way, which I have also done in the past, is to read a chapter/verse/passage a day and then respond to it in my journal. What do I think it means? How might it apply to my life today? What other events in my life does it make me think of, and how might it help me to see those events in the context of this Bible passage? Unlike the live tweet, my journal is completely private. That gives me a sense of freedom to be vulnerable and honest with myself, especially when it hurts. Rereading the Bible publicly takes a very thick skin, I'm discovering, as well as the ability to separate the public analysis type of reading from a personal introspective type of reading. For that reason, I recommend doing the private, introspective one before trying to do a public, analytical one. ",

            "answer_text": "I would set out a concrete plan as to what it was I expected to be in that Journal. The Bible is written for ease of reading so an outline for each chapter as you finish reading it would be a first start. If it were myself I would write a mock up Journal as a person viewing from the outside in. Each chapter would be captured in a few sentences that stated what I felt they meant. Characters lives, adventures, experiences, and interactions from the beginning of time through to the death, burial, and Resurrection of Jesus the Christ. Then when I had finished the whole bible I would go back over my work and organize it into a final Journal. That is just me. If you were speaking as Journal in what to study daily, I know it is possible to read and cross-reference five or six chapters a day. I hope that helps some. ",
