            "answer_text": "Copywriting and content writing are the two most powerful tools of digital marketing. Truth is, every business aims at targeting more audiences and influencing their choices to gain more sales, as well as move the needle in terms of profitability and they do so by employing both these writing techniques. Here\u2019s an explanation, as well as examples of copywriting and content writing: Copywriting is about selling and the art of persuasion. Ad legend David Ogilvy said, \u201cI do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information. When I write an advertisement, I don\u2019t want you to tell me that you find it \u2018creative.\u2019 I want you to find it so interesting that you buy the product.\u201d Historically, copywriting mediums included primarily print ads, radio ads, billboards, tv commercials - only. This is about all you saw in the \u201960s during the Creative Revolution lead by icons like Mary Wells Lawrence, Bill Bernbach and Jerry Della Femina. Classic ads include Volkswagon\u2019s \u201cLemon\u201d and Alka Seltzer\u2019s \u201cPlop Plop, Fizz Fizz.\u201d But over the years, with the advent of the Internet, marketing has changed dramatically, and with it, the mediums used to engage customers - and sell products. Content writing is about writing anything, i.e. blogs, articles, interviews, etc. It\u2019s journalistic in style and substance. So it\u2019s less \u201cselly\u201d but still, it seeks to engage the consumer and aims for conversions aka sales. However, content also involves other mediums like infographics, videos, etc. It\u2019s an umbrella term that is wider in scope. Content marketing is a strategic marketing approach that focuses on creating and distributing valuable, relevant and consistent content - which can include both copywriting and content writing - to attract and retain a clearly-defined audience \u2014 and, ultimately, drive profitable customer action. Examples of great content include Coke\u2019s \u201cShare A Coke\u201d campaign. It gave everyone the opportunity to personalize their favorite drink. They took the 150 most popular names in Australia and added them to the side of the bottles. And, well\u2026 people went crazy for it. Another is Microsoft\u2019s \u201cStories.\u201d This campaign features individuals who benefited from their products. And what better place to tell theses stories than a blog? But why was it successful? Enjoying a good story is in your DNA. You\u2019re hardwired to connect with it. It releases oxytocin, the feel-good hormone. If you can get your audience to feel emotion with your story, they\u2019ll trust you and buy from you. Here\u2019s two articles that are a deeper dive into all of these topics. When you understand the differences, you can more efficiently implement them into your overall marketing approach.

I don\u2019t worry about the semantics much. All i care about doing is helping a business getting more leads and sales, which is what all three of these terms refer to. though I do tend to be most into the idea of content marketing because it ties very closely to SEO, which is also what I do for clients. In my job, I\u2019ve done email marketing copy, blog posts, articles, landing page text, press releases, Google Adwords copy, social media content stuff, and a whole ton of other different things which could be classified under those categories. It\u2019s just like when i\u2019ve seen SEO jobs under a bunch of different names, but see that in each role, you\u2019re doing 90\u201395% of the same stuff. SEO Specialist, SEO Content Writer, Content Marketing Specialist, Digital Content Marketer, the list goes on and on. It can be very confusing at times, but I hope this comment helps clear some stuff up. Roberto Severino is a passionate digital marketer well versed in SEO, PPC, content marketing, and more.

Through this, they become aware of you, and perhaps are educated on why they should purchase from you.
