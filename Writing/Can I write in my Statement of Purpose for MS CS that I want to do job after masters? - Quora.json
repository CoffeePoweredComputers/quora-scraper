            "answer_text": "Yes, why not. Adding your career plan details (post Masters) will give the SOP reader an insight as to what your career plans are and whether they are related to the course you plan to study. If you can even list the kind of roles you want to work in then it depicts a clarity of thought. If you are not sure how to go about further or need any further help then I suggest that you get in contact with SOP experts such as ExpertScribe \u2013 Your personal Statement of Purpose (SOP) writer.

You could mention something along the lines of being able to work well in the industry or contribute to it etc etc. Specifically informing them may seem immature. Dont write this: I want to do an MS because i want a job afterwards. Thanks for A2A ",
