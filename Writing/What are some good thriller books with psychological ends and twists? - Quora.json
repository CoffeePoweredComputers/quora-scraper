            "answer_text": "My suggestions for the same would be: 1.The day of the Jackal by Frederick Forsyth (1971)- A master piece of an assassin and many a times, I felt he\u2019s depicting a true story. It\u2019s a real thriller with a psychological ending 2. The girl before by JP Delaney (2017) : It\u2019s rather a psychological story with a practical ending but a good one. 3. And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie (1939) : This is one masterpiece. Even when you knew the ending all along, it keeps your heart beat at high rates till the end. 4. Bourne Series by Robert Ludlum - Loved the Bourne Identity, Bourne Supremacy in particular 5. The Shining by Stephen Kings - A psychological novel and read it even if you have seen the movie. The must for a thriller fan 6. Tell me your Dreams by Sydney Sheldon (1985)- I loved it. The concept may look old but still a book to read ",
