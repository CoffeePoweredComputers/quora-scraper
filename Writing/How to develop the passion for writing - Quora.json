            "answer_text": "I started writing in 2015, wrote 7 books back to back, at the time I was in pain, my mother was ill, I had divorced my husband, I was searching, looking for something. I have always loved to read, always been a pretty good story teller when I was young. So, I began. Once I started, I could not stop, it was so refreshing, so liberating! To date I have written 9 books, 8 published and one just about ready to drop. Just begin, give your book a title and write from the title. That is what I was initially advised to do and that is what I adhere to always. Example: Mary loved John with all that was in her, the only problem was, John did not seem to love her with the same passion. She had caught him cheating on her at least 5 times in the past year.. How was she able to sustain a relationship with a man that constantly cheated on her yet professed his love to her when she confronted him? Her heart had been broken over and over again, What was she doing or not doing right to hold his interest in her, and only her? At this point, she was willing to do anything and everything to stop his infidelity, to profess his love and faithfulness to her, and only her. To finally put and end to his manipulative and deceptive behavior.. Title: Lies of Deception Author Dia Stone ",

            "answer_text": "Not sure you can \u2013 if it isn\u2019t there already, it never will be. But assuming it is \u2013 which is why you asked \u2013 but hidden away. So now you have to discover that passion. And you do that by reading as much as you can, as many diverse authors and genres as possible. And by experimenting with your own writing, but not so that it becomes a chore. You work to develop your imagination and your curiosity, especially about people and their lives. Above all you have fun. Learn to enjoy the process of writing - the idea, the research, the words going down and the editing. Do that and you\u2019ll be fine. Best of luck! ",
