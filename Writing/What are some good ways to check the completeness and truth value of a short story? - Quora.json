            "answer_text": "Does the story include all the senses?  Does the reader feel part of the scene or does it seem that the story is happening against a white background (meaning there's not a sense of reality)? Does the story ring true even if it contains fantastical elements? Even fiction should feel true. Does the main character in the story change in some way, for better or worse, because of what happens in the story? Answering these questions will help you write a complete story that will allow the reader to get involved and experience your tale.

            "answer_text": "Well, one way would be to have others read or hear it. Many people have a fine sense of story and if something is missing or burdening the story as \"extra\" they will notice it. The best would be to offer a writer or teller to experience it. Remember that truth in story is not about the facts but about \"the moment of truth\" which as mentioned in the question creates a sense of completeness whether it's a story with a \"good\" or \"bad\" end. If it is complete you will notice the reader or listener relax at the end and go into a form of subtle contemplation or a sense of good nature. Another way to check completeness would be to check if it answers the basic requirments of story form. This might not be a tight enough validation for it's truth value but it can be helpful to quite a good degree. ",
