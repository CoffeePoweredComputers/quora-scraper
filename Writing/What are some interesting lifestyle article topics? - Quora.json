            "answer_text": "These are a few lifestyle topics that are most engaging and widely used. Fitness:- You can write about meditation, different excercises that you do everyday and that others can do, and how they are beneficial.Food:- wether you're dieting or not, you can write about how one can eat healthy.Productive routine:- how you manage time in a day. What are the ways you can be productive with etc.Fashion:- what you or others can wear on what occasion.Learning:- last but not the least, this is a topic I haven't seen many people use in their blogs, but it can be a great way to attract traffic. Lots of people are looking for things to learn and many times they're not sure what to look for, so blog posts of these kinds will be very much helpful. Also learning does not just limit upto books, it can be new and daily small things one can learn.I hope you find this post helpful, have a great day. ",
