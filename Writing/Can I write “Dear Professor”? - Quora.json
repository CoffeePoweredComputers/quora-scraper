And then that\u2019s why \u201cDear\u201d is consistently chosen! \u201cPlease, Professor\u201d sounds like a whiny beggar. \u201cAttention\u201d without please seems kind of commandeering. \u201cGood day, Professor\u201d sounds like good bye before hello. \u201cGreetings, Professor Last Name\u201d, \u201cProfessor Last Name\u201d, \u201cAttention: Professor Last Name\u201d \u201cBeseeching Professor Last Name\u201d\u2026 So, most letter writers use the standard \u201cDear, Whomever Whatever\u201d and no one seems to consider it\u2019s foul or too familiar.

            "answer_text": "Yes, no, maybe. Yes, unless the professor is a snob or it is not customary in your school or school country. Check it out to be sure. Ask a professor you like and trust. No, if it is against school policy, not a custom where you attend school, or it might be misunderstood, e.g. a male student writing to a female professor in a very bpe5rsonal tone. Maybe if it is considered an option the professor permits for non-personal questions and advice. Sometimes it is more proper to write, \u201cDear Doctor [last name]. You can write \u201cDear Professor\u201d to me any time\u2014rememberingI\u2019m approaching 90 and have been married to the same woman 66 years. I love you. Doctor Larry Winebrenner ",

            "answer_text": "I would have welcomed it from any of my students - it\u2019s a perfectly valid salutation. (And certainly better than just \u201cHey \u2026 \u201c or something.) I think how to address someone in a communication is always a little bit fraught if it is the first contact. I welcomed emails from my students - and usually tried to respond fairly soon (at my convenience). And it was fairly common to have students be a bit uncertain how to start. I was always fairly informal in class and in my emails to the class, but most students would still start with \u201cProf. Brown,\u201d or \u201cDr. Brown,\u201d or sometimes \u201cDear Professor,\u201d or maybe just \u201cHi Professor, this is Sally from your physics class\u201d or something.
