            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve had a few long term relationships over the years and a few not-so-long term ones as well. Relationships usually start out the same way - everything is sparkly and shiny and new and most of all, easy. They often end the same way- badly, with one person walking away feeling finally free and relieved and one left behind in tears, angry, alone and shattered. You\u2019ve decided you want to be free\u2026 for whatever reason\u2026 fine. There\u2019s nothing inherently \u201cwrong\u201d about not wanting to keep seeing someone. It happens. Things change. I\u2019ve been on both sides of this situation- I\u2019ve been the \u201cbreaker\u201d and the \u201cbrakee\u201d and it\u2019s never a pleasant experience. But I\u2019m also old school. I feel very strongly that if you were there for the sparkly and shiny when it was all easy, you need to be there when it\u2019s none of the above. You need to show up, man up and end it with your soon-to-be ex-significant other. Your also going to have to listen to what they have to say. It probably won\u2019t be very pretty. It certainly won\u2019t be any fun, but you owe that to them. You\u2019re getting what you want. They should at least get to tell you how you\u2019ve made them feel. You\u2019re not there to argue. You\u2019re not there to quibble over the details. You\u2019re there to say good-bye and this is the price you pay to get what you want\u2026 Every time I\u2019ve parted ways with a lover in my life, it\u2019s been face to face. If you\u2019ve been in an intimate relationship with someone and that relationship is going to end - especially when it\u2019s going to end because you want it to - you owe it to that individual to do it in person. It\u2019s about respect. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear Mary I am no longer interested in pursuing a relationship with you. Unfortunately, however, I lack the courage to face you and tell you face to face. You will be aware that this is actually a positive: that I am now demonstrating that I am too immature to be worthy of your attentions. You can undoubtedly look forward to a better life with someone else that you could have hoped for with me. Ideally I would wish you well for the future, but clearly I am the sort of person that will for the rest of life carp about your good fortune and how you ruined my life. John ",
