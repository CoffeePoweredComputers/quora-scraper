            "answer_text": "No. You should do something, but you should not write your letter, poem, thing. Look, I'm going to lay this out for you. Let's say you write this letter. \"Dear Indecisive Girl with lukewarm feelings for me and her boyfriend - I'm going to be traveling soon, but I want you to know, that even though you're not my girlfriend, and not single, and have given me plenty of reasons to think you like me only a little at best, I want you to know that if you break up with your boyfriend, you'll still have me, far away, in another country, pining for you and thinking of you.\" Wow, exciting! She, naturally, responds with \"oh, that's really sweet, thank you, I'm going to continue having luke warm feelings towards you, but if I'm ever feeling down and need validation, I'm glad to have you sitting on my back burner.\" With your relationship clarified, you travel to the United States. There, you meet someone who actually has strong feelings for you, but oh no! You've promised luke-warm indecisive girl that you'd be there for her! Just like she isn't willing to make any moves with you, since she's luke warm to her long distance boyfriend and isn't willing to leave him, you can't make any moves with this new woman who likes you, since you've made an ambiguous commitment to luke warm indecisive girl. Do you really want that? Fuck no you don't! Dating is a lot like jumping over a pit. If you're going to jump, jump hard and far. If you jump half-heartedly, you're not going anywhere, and you're going to get hurt. You either fully commit yourself and risk the rejection, or you dismiss it and move on to something else. The luke-warm is the worst of all worlds. So no, you should not \"write a letter.\" You should ask her on a date. \"Hey, I really like you, Wanna come fly a kite with me Saturday?\" If she says yes, you go on a date. You hold hands. You flirt. You kiss each other. Eventually, you have sex with each other. She discovers that she actually does have strong feelings for you, and she leaves her boyfriend. You aren't interested in being her backup guy, or stalling around while she lets the universe make all her choices for her. You want to be with her, and you act on that. You demand that she give you a \"yes\" or a \"no.\" If it's no, fantastic! When you come to the US, you'll have all the benefits of being an exotic foreigner here for a short while. You can have all the sexual adventures you want guilt-free. Why would you let her rob you of that when she's not willing to commit to you? So make your jump dude, or don't. Ask her on a date and put it all out there. Ask her for a clear \"yes\" or \"no.\" If she gives you luke warm BS, make her clarify. \"OK, so that's a no?\" If it's a no, great. You're free. Move on. You have better things to do. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I think a letter is a little old fashioned, but it would depend on the details of the situation. For instance, I worked in Alaska for several years, and if you were out on a boat for the fishing season or working on a biology camp in a remote location that may be the only secure way to communicate. But asking this on Quora leads me to believe you have options. It might be better to start with more informal interactions. Become Facebook friends, (or whatever) and/or ask a mutual friend to alert you when a group of friends including her is going out and become part of the group. Sometime during the outing arrange to be next to her (not obviously) and engage her in conversation. If you don't know her well enough to informally interact like that, you need to get to know her better, because if you have a crush on someone that you don't know well, you may have very little actual information about the person. The problem with that is that we all have a tendency to fill in the \"blanks\" in what we know with the best possible characteristics. In reality she may be nothing like what you imagine.  For instance, we tend to judge people on their appearance. Not that we screen only for appearance, but that a person with certain characteristics is a particular way. (Academic reference: the Timbuk 3 song \"Hairstyles and Attitude\") For instance a girl with blue hair is a rebel, a guy with tattoos is tough, a girl in cowboy boots listens to country music. Actually maybe she just likes the boots. Maybe she borrowed the boots from her sister because they \"look cute with this outfit\".  You find out to your surprise she despises country music and now you're crushed, because you are a country musician.  Once you know more about her, if you have common interests you should have things to talk to her about, even if you are so shy that a letter seems like a good idea right now. Hopefully you can spin that into a conversation that leads to asking her on a date or maybe eventually a relationship.    If you don't have any common interests you'll realize it was more imagination than reality and move on. ",

            "answer_text": "Well that is a bit of a dilemma. Well I'll open up a little here.  When I was at university there was a girl I liked. We got close in the first term but I had a girlfriend. I couldn't decide and we decided to leave it as I was going to try and make it work with my girlfriend over the holidays. Interestingly we got drunk on the last night before leaving and both told each other how we felt. Well it didn't really help the situation with my girlfriend. I text the girl I liked a couple of times but apart from that there wasn't any contact. The next time we saw each other was when we both returned to halls about a month or so later. We eventually (about a week later) got together and were together for several years.  How is that relevant? Well I didn't write a letter. I write a lot as well. I was the guy with the other half though. I didn't know whether I wanted to break up with my girlfriend or not. That means I am on the other side.  If she really likes you then it will likely happen. If she doesn't and it is more that someone is actually being there for her where she is missing her boyfriend then she will know. You can't actually do anything to change the situation, much.  So my advice. If you want to say something do it in person. Be honest, you two clearly are happy talking about a lot of things so that should get rid of some of the awkwardness. If you can't share your true feelings any other way than a letter then here is what I would do. talk to her and give her the letter. Wish her well and then explain the letter. Tell her you really like her but you understand she has a boyfriend. Give her the letter that isn't all creepy and forward just an I'll be there for you type of letter. Tell her only to open it if she does break up with her boyfriend. If she doesn't then she can give you the letter next time she sees you and you will get rid of it. While there is mystery involved you haven't put her under too much pressure. Do remember that the only thing you want here is her honesty. You don't want her to break up with her boyfriend because you think she should. You don't want her to feel that she will lose you as a friend if she doesn't. You don't want to make her feel that you are only with her because YOU want her.  You want to give her the chance to make the decision by herself. You want to let her know how you feel about her. You don't want her caught with a letter of undying love by her boyfriend.  So I'll leave it up to you but I would err on the side of talking to her and telling her in person. Thanks for the A2A. Hope I have helped. ",

Anything but writing it in a letter. If you want to write your feelings down in your personal journal, go for it. That helped me get over what humiliating tale I\u2019m about to share. I\u2019m not sure how old you are, but I wish that I had had someone tell me that writing letters wasn\u2019t a good idea when I was younger. I asked our mutual friend at the time if she thought I should. I was absolutely smitten. I thought he was the bees knees. I was also incredibly shy and nervous as hell around him at that age. I had had a crush on this guy for years. I poured my heart into it. You don\u2019t wanna hear what he did with said letter, but I\u2019ll let you in on how it went down. I gave it to him in the morning and when we were lining up for lunch, I saw him showing it to all of his guy friends. Some I knew, some I didn\u2019t, but they all knew exactly how I felt about him now. I was mortified and wanted to die on the spot, but then he saw me. He kept on smiling and laughing with his friends. One of them handed it back to me, while they all walked off laughing. I didn\u2019t like him after that. I didn\u2019t like anybody for a while after that. Please save yourself the potential hurt and embarrassment and just confront him about it in person. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it would be very sweet and romantic. I still have some love letters that were sent to me in middle school somewhere at my moms house in a box. Is long as you hand write it and not send it in a text or something then it will be a memory she will hold onto forever. I always encourage my children to send thank you notes and hand write letters to people versus sending a text or an email. Every single person that shops at my store gets a personalized handwritten thank you card from me included in their package. I think that handwritten letters make a huge impact on a person's perception of yoursincerity as it applies to your relationship with them. For me as a seller they don't see me as a faceless corporation anymore they see me as a person directly selling them something that they need or want. For you it would be you showing her that she is worthy of your time and effort. And that you put enough thought into it to write her this letter instead of sending a generic text like you would any other girl. I wish you the best of luck keep us updated on what happens. PS here's a little tip use a very high stock stationary when you send it and if you can send it by mail that would be even more impressive. A trick that women have used for centuries is before you start writing spray one just one squirt of your favorite cologne that you wear most often about 18 inches away from the paper. Put the paper on the table hold the cologne 18 inches above it and spray this will leave a very faint scent of you and since scent is the greatest sense tied to memory then she will always associate that smell with the warm feeling she had when she got the letter. So when she's around you and you were that scent it will instantly make her feel more connected to you. And when she's not around you and she smells a scent similar or the same as the one you were wearing she will forever think of you. My ex-boyfriend Joey used to wear cool water and to this day every time I smell it I think him and this was back in the 90s when we dated so that just goes to show you how long certain scent ties into memory. Ps I used a lot of sense sent since and scent in this answer and AutoCorrect cannot figure out which ones to keep changing so please excuse any miss spellings as I assure you they were correct when I initially typed this out.

Better then texting write? (Ha get it?) Anyways writing a letter, is taking your time and effort and how much you love this girl, and putting it into a page that you spent countless hours getting it fixed so it has no mistakes, or doing it over and over again till you can get it spotless of mistakes. Letters can also be your voice as well. I did it too with my crush. I wrapped my scarf around my smile and gave it to her, and look the other way in embarrassment by what I\u2019ve just done. I hear her giggling, I peek around to see her against the wall, smiling to what she was reading. I blushed to see her appreciating the note I wrote. I turned back around only to notice she saw that. She slid my phone with my notes towards me. She said it was interesting and asked if I could write more. Wow, I can\u2019t believe it, she likes it?! I\u2019m on Quora and she is too, and we share each other articles and answer questions that relate with each other. Letters can be your voice if you\u2019re too shy! Thank you for reading my answer, who knows , maybe you\u2019ll find a women through a letter.~ ",

This was in Highschool, the problem with a letter, that I see no different than email, tweet, a Quora posting, etc.. is it can be shared easily, it is in writing, kind of like a contract, that everyone seems to go back to in business, when the s#*t hits the fan.... plus the written word stares at you and is taken sometimes out of context, unless you write your love letters like a lawyer writes their documents and have a lot of \"safe harbor\" statements in front of it :). Probably not the most romantic, unless you are a lawyer, and courting a lawyer, then it may be kind of funny.  Personally of what really had worked, a long time ago, but is probably still applicable today, i.e. face to face, telephone, then some kind of written communication if it is going well, so at least you do not come off as some kind of stalker.  * Safe Harbor: I am not a lawyer, but I am in no way a Doctor Johnny Lovedart , just personal experience from a 45 year old guy.

            "answer_text": "Psychological research seems to support the idea that intense feelings of infatuation persist when you are uncertain about the other persons feelings. Clearly, this is you. However, writing such a letter is a big mistake, because it effectively eliminates uncertainty for the other person.  I feel your pain. I have been there many times and through the agony of crushes. But I believe writing a letter would be doing a disservice to yourself, and you run the risk of depriving them of the chance for any existing feelings to grow more intense, and so you are doing them a disservice as well. Here is the research study on infatuation. After 500 interviews, this psychologist determined that the main commonalities in people who became infatuated is that they had hope the other person returned the feelings and uncertainty that they actually did. This roller coaster would grow until it was a full blown obsession with the other person. Love and Limerence: The Experience of Being in Love: Dorothy Tennov: 9780812862867: Amazon.com: Books I know it sucks a lot to feel these feelings so strongly. I feel your pain. Don't feel bad about it. This full blown infatuation has obviously happened to you. But if you want it to happen to the other person, don't eliminate the uncertainty of reciprocation by writing a letter. Your best bet is to tease them and send mixed messages to them in person, while simultaneously showing genuine interest in their life. ",

Ease up here.  Start with a friendly, non 'love' approach.  Try a casual phone text.  Keep it light.  See what her reaction is.  Ask about school or work or some movie or event that's coming up.  Be sure to send her something that she has to answer and not just some comment.  If you ask her something and she answers you, you have opened the door to a friendship.  From friendships, love can grow.  Don't rush her.  Work up to some easy, fun flirting, in time.  If she ignores you... you have your answer.  She will never be friendly or close to you. ",
