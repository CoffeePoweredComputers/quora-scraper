            "answer_text": "Actually, it depends on your interest, there are so many science fields for becoming a scientist and some of them you can check below. An agronomist specializes in soil and crops.An astronomer studies stars, planets and galaxies.A botanist specializes in plants.A cytologist specializes in the study of cells.An epidemiologist studies the spread of diseases.An ethologist studies animal behavior.A geneticist studies how traits are inherited.A geologist specializes in the history of Earth.A geographer studies Earth's surface.A marine biologist studies ocean plants and animals.A meteorologist studies weather and climate.A microbiologist studies microscopic plants and animals.A paleontologist specializes in fossils.A physicist studies matter, energy, and how they are related.A seismologist studies earthquakes.coming to the courses and branches. The Physical Sciences Physics: The study of matter and energy and the interactions between them. Physicists study such subjects as gravity, light, and time. Albert Einstein, a famous physicist, developed the Theory of Relativity.Chemistry: The science that deals with the composition, properties, reactions, and the structure of matter. The chemist Louis Pasteur, for example, discovered pasteurization, which is the process of heating liquids such as milk and orange juice to kill harmful germs.Astronomy: The study of the universe beyond the Earth's atmosphere.The Earth Sciences Geology: The science of the origin, history, and structure of the Earth, and the physical, chemical, and biological changes that it has experienced or is experiencing.Oceanography: The exploration and study of the ocean.Paleontology: The science of the forms of life that existed in prehistoric or geologic periods.Meteorology: The science that deals with the atmosphere and its phenomena, such as weather and climate.The Life Sciences (Biology) Botany: The study of plants.Zoology: The science that covers animals and animal life.Genetics: The study of heredity.Medicine: The science of diagnosing, treating, and preventing illness, disease, and injury.And most of them are. 1.
