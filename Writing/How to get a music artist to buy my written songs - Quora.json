            "answer_text": "My best answer is to join a local songwriters association and then attend their meetings. They are all amateur songwriters like you, and many times they bring unfinished songs to bounce off of their peers for constructive criticism. Occasionally, these organizations will bring in professional producers or song scouts from New York, LA or Nashville. You will be able to audition your song to them (usually for an additional fee) and if they feel like your song is \u201cready\u201d and suitable for one of their artists, they will offer you a one song publishing contract. If they feel like your song isn't ready but you show promise as a songwriter, they will offer constructive criticism. I realize this probably isn't what you want to hear, but it's the best advice I can give. Be prepared for a lot of rejection and preservere! Good luck. ",
