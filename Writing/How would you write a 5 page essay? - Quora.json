            "answer_text": "This sounds like a school assignment. Back when we wrote our essays on papyrus, a school essay had a format one could follow. It\u2019s suggested for a 5-paragraph essay, but I don\u2019t think you should have paragraphs that long. However, you can divide the essay into five parts: State simply what you\u2019re going to say\u2014the premise.Give three examples of why your premise is true, or if the opposing view is not true.Restate your premise with a couple of references back to your proofs presented in sections 2, 3, and 4.The essay doesn\u2019t have to be a debate\u2014that is, you\u2019re not proving a point, but simply stating a bare fact then bolstering it with your central paragraphs. This format also helps you sketch out what you want to say. Write a 5-point outline, then expand the outline with more words. But not too many words. Writing a cogent essay of whatever length it needs to be. Filling up five pages with blather defeats the point of the exercise. However, if that 5-page is set in stone, then restate from a different approach each of your points to fill up the empty space. ",
