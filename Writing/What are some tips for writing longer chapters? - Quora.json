            "answer_text": "I want to remind you of a chapter in the book, As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner. The entire chapter is My Mother was a fish.That was the entire chapter. Please, please, please do not confuse length with quality. But, if you must: For every topic, describe in detail, ask the five W\u2019s, include cost and history. By doing this, you can add relevant content to your chapters. My advice is to not do this. Consider the novel Moby Dick, by Herman Melville\u2014this book, (which I admit to loving) shares almost a hatred from my students. I set out to figure out why do they hate this book? (Most of them actually liked the Scarlet Letter, Red badge of Courage, Huckleberry Finn) Well, it turns out, instead of action, Melville uses long descriptions of things. Hmmm, I recommend that instead of long chapters, you writer no more than is needed. Bring us in with pithy prose\u2014get us to the point, and wow us with your action. But please, for me, for the children, and for my students, don\u2019t make those chapters any longer. ",
