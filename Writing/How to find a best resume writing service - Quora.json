            "answer_text": "Great question. Simply put, the best resume writing service is the one that helps you get the interview\u2026 and ultimately the job. However, as someone who has been in recruiting for nearly 10 years, finding a resume writer who truly understands how do this is very difficult. Most resume writers probably won\u2019t produce anything better than job seekers could do themselves with a bit of time and research. Here are the top 3 things you should look for when hiring a resume writing service... 1. The best resume writing services know first hand how hiring managers will screen your resume. When you apply to a job via a career website or job board, more often than not your resume doesn\u2019t go directly to the hiring manager or HR manager. Instead, it\u2019s usually filtered first in a piece of software called an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) with a set of predetermined keywords. What happens after this computerized filtering step differs from company to company. But generally speaking, there are a few rounds of evaluation before a final list is compiled to interview. What you need to know about this evaluation is that it\u2019s a lot briefer than you\u2019d expect. Sometimes as little as a few seconds in the first round to check for relevancy. That may sound unrealistic, but if a hiring manager receives 500 resumes for a role, spending just 20 seconds per resume would mean the initial screening takes 166 minutes - almost three hours! What this means\u2026 Before someone really sits and looks at your experience and skills, you could be weeded out simply because you didn\u2019t have the right keywords or your accomplishments weren\u2019t presented correctly. Even if you're a great fit! This is where a good resume writing service can and should help. They\u2019ll know which keywords to include so you\u2019ll get through the ATS (over 70% of resumes are filtered out before a human ever sees them). And they\u2019ll also know how to best present your experience so that it stands out in the hands of the hiring manager you\u2019re trying to impress. Note: This kind of expertise is usually found in resume writers who have worked in recruiting or have real-world experience in the HR or Recruiting industries. It\u2019s best to ask your resume writer what their background is before you hire them! 2. The best resume writing services will actually talk to you. A common misconception is that hiring a resume writer means you just turn it over to them and they do the work. Nothing could be further from the truth. How will a resume writer know how to showcase your skills if they don\u2019t spend time getting to know you? Furthermore, how will they know how to best present them if they don\u2019t take time to understand the job you\u2019re going after? Good resume writing services know that they can\u2019t write your resume without you. They\u2019ll always insist on collaboration. 3. The best resume writing services customize their approach to your job search. This is not about the formatting of your resume. If a format works, it works. But a writer should still spend the time to customize the document to showcase your skills. This is key because most hiring managers expect your resume to be tailored specifically to the role to which you\u2019re applying. That\u2019s why one of the most important things to look for in a resume writing service is that they treat your job search and resume as something unique: Do they take the time to thoughtfully consider who you\u2019re trying to impress?Do they ask questions to understand who you are and what you\u2019ve achieved that could impress them?The resume writing service I\u2019d recommend... As someone who has been in the recruiting industry for almost a decade, I got tired of seeing job seekers being misguided by writers without the proper background or credentials. So I started my own resume writing service, ResumeSpice, to provide people with an option that takes each of these things above (and more) into account.
