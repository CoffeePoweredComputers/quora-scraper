            "answer_text": "Hi there! Paraphrase means to express the meaning of (something written or spoken) using different words, especially to achieve greater clarity. It\u2019s a process of rewording or restating a phrase or a sentence so that it has the same meaning, but with different words. It\u2019s most important for writing and speaking sections. It also helps in the reading and listening sections. Prior to taking the test, mastering paraphrasing is one of the most crucial things to do. Your paraphrase can be longer or shorter than the original one. Do not change concept words, special terms, or proper names. There are various ways to paraphrase: An effective paraphrase includes more than one of the following ways. If you use only one of these techniques when paraphrasing, you have not paraphrased effectively! Using synonyms of phrases and words(try replacing most of the words). Use words with the same meaning and not similar meaning.By changing the word orderBy changing the form of the wordBy changing the voice(active to passive or passive to active)By changing the sentence structure and use different connecting wordsThis ensures your new version is entirely different from the original version but keeping the meaning. Rather than being about words, paraphrasing is about ideas. In the nutshell, writing a paraphrase means restating the idea of other people in your own words. To do it efficiently and effectively, read the original text more than once until you have a clear understanding of its meaning very well. You, then, write the idea of the author by using some of the key terms in your own sentence structures and words. Learn new vocabulary regularly to improve your English for effective paraphrasing.
