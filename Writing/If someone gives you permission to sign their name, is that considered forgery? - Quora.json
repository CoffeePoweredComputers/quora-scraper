Signing someone's name with only their verbal permission distraught with legal ambiguity. And depending on your particular jurisdiction may or may not be legal. The best course of action is to get a legal document called a power of attorney. This document allows you (now called the attorney in fact) to legally sign your name on behalf of them. (Called the principal). There are two major types up powers of attorney, a general power attorney that allows you for any action the principal legally could and a limited power of attorney which is limited to specific authorized actions. These forms can be obtained from any licensed attorney in your state or on a legal document site. Notice I am NOT in attorney and did not say at a Holiday inn Express last night. Please contact a licensed attorney in your state for legal advice. ",

            "answer_text": "Colorado law CRS 24\u201321\u2013509 allows a signature by proxy for a disabled person who cannot write their own signature. The disabled person directs someone (a proxy) to sign for them, while in their presence, and in the presence of a notary. The notary writes a note, near the signature: Signature affixed by [name of proxy] at the direction of [name of disabled person]. The notary witnesses the signing and verifies identification to prevent fraud. Under the Law of Agency, a principal can issue a Power of Attorney to direct a trusted agent to sign a document on behalf of the principal. The signature would read: [principal name] by [agent name], then agent or attorney-in-fact or power of attorney or POA. For example: Bob Principal, by Joe Agent, POA. ",
