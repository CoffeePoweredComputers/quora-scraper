            "answer_text": "Rickles\u2019 humor was different and on the shocking side for his time. He was an equal-opportunity insulter and (in my memory) didn\u2019t single out people for gender, race, etc. and was never really cruel. He didn\u2019t \u201cpunch down,\u201d he punched everyone. But there wasn\u2019t any nastiness or real hostility there. It was just a quick-witted ability to puncture vanity or satirize. And from all accounts, that was an act that didn\u2019t carry over into real life. His lifelong BF Bob Newhart said, \u201c . . . he was one of the kindest, caring and most sensitive human beings we have ever known.\u201d After his death at 91 there were countless tributes from many people in show biz acknowledging his influence and talent.

In his Las Vegas act for instance, after he had given a person a bad time, he made sure to talk to them after the show, and even comped their table a bottle of champagne for being \u201cpart of the act.\u201d As for his peers, offstage, he was nothing but supportive, even while busting their chops. It takes a true talent to be a friend of Frank Sinatra\u2019s while telling him onstage, \u201cMake yourself at home Frank, hit somebody!\u201d ",
