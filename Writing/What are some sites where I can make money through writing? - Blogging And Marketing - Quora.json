There are countless ways through which you can make money writing online. The following are some of the ways through which you can make money writing. Here are some ways through which you could make money writing: Through your Blog:Having your own blog where you write stuff you know the best. Just write a damn good article once a week and you will make money after 5 to 8 months depends upon your niche and the marketing tactics. You can make money through different ways through writing on your blog; through affiliate marketing, running Google AdSense ads, sponsor posts, selling your own stuff, or getting paid readers. Through freelancing writingThis is where you could make money by writing articles for blogs or startups. They will pay you based on per word. You can give a try to different freelance websites like Fiverr and Upwork. You need strong writing skills to make money in this way. Some writers are generating $1K+ a month from freelance writing. This job is good for making quick bucks in a shorter time. Make money writing through third-party platformsIf you are a video creator then the best platforms for you is YouTube and Facebook but if you are a writer, the best platform for you is Quora and Medium. Quora: Quora pay you through two programs; Quora partner program, probably, they have not invited people to this program anymore. They might have disabled this program for more people. The other program to make money writing is through the Quora space earning program. If you are a space admin, you make money from your space. Medium: My favorite platform and probably a favorite platform for a lot of medium writers. They have a high domain authority and it is easier to getting ranked there. They only pay to writers based on their paying members' reading time. I have written a lot of articles about earning from Medium. You can check it on my Medium publication: Menlo Blogging I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Before you think of making money through writing, make sure your writing skills are good. If you are a beginner, I\u2019d suggest you to find local clients and work at low rates. At the same time, learn COPYWRITING and further polish your writing skills. Once you are ready to work with foreign clients, make a profile each on Fiver and Upwork, learn how their algorithm works. Make sure your gig is SEO optimized, offer services at low rates in the beginning. And once you have got 10\u201315 reviews in your profile, gradually increase your rates. Happy writing and earning!!! ",
