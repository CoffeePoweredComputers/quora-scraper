            "answer_text": "Uh, no. The US hasn\u2019t drafted anyone since the 1970s. So, if no one gets drafted, obviously, no officers will be drafted. Now, back when we had the draft, or conscription, there was time when you could be drafted. But, there was a problem. If you drafted people who had vital skills to serve, you left openings that had to be filled. This means it took time to train them as well as find people who could do the jobs. OK, this was fine for women working in factories, but for police, fire and rescue, this was bad. To prevent this, certain people were ruled exempt from the draft. How do you think Trump avoided going to Vietnam? He stayed in college, chasing girls and worrying about getting STDS. Oh, and he had bone spurs that mysteriously cleared up. SO, he was 4F, or at least 2F, while he was F-ing around. I want to say, at the time of the draft, that those who couldn\u2019t pass the exam could become police officers or fill in other professions. Kind of a second chance thing for not being fit enough to get killed. But, I know several men and women who have enlisted even though they were immune to the draft, should it start again, and didn\u2019t have to enlist anyway. Some people feel so strongly that they will risk their lives even when they don\u2019t have to. I may not agree with the reasons for the war, but my hat is off to every man and women who has the guts to serve and I\u2019ll damn well die backing them up, no matter what. ",

            "answer_text": "Even though all males over 18 register with selective service there are things called critical jobs. Short explanation. In WWII Britain did a full draft to get ready to support France after they declared war. They took all men regardless of their job. A month later most factories and critical services were nearly shut down because the Police, Fire, miners, the only guy who knew how to fix the press at the arms factory etc etc were all in Boot Camp. They were quickly recalled from service and lists of critical occupations were drawn up. Also if you had a job that wasn\u2019t on the list but you were critical to any given company they could get you a waiver from draft. We here in the USA instituted the same policy in our last draft ..Vietnam. I think that last one ended in 73. Anyway we expanded it to include kids in College and a few other areas. This on a side note had the effect of making sure that only the poor or people that couldn\u2019t get into school due to grades or cash went to Vietnam (unless they volunteered). My own father flunked out of Grand Valley State College..knew he would be drafted and joined the Marines so he could at least pick his branch. I guess they straightened him out cause he became a PhD. Imagine how seriously you would study if you knew getting an F meant you were going to be a rifleman in Vietnam 18 week later\u2026lol. So..no. Police, Fire, Teachers and many other professions cant be drafted as those are exempted fields. ",

I worked with the Brazilian Military Police for sometime and while they do not accept straight draftees, some of their officers entered the military under Lei do Servi\u00e7o Militar. And while some people may argue that the Gendarme is different, France filled the ranks of the Gendarme with conscripts for much of its existence to the end of conscription. In the United States the Posse comitatus acts prevents drafting of police forces. The draft in its current and former creations was a tool to enlist military soldiers. By definition, the military cannot enforce laws. That is why FBI agents are attached to military units overseas, and why many military law enforcement branches cannot use agents who hold regular commissions. ",

Every year at least 2,000 to 3,000 draftees chose to serve as law enforcement officers, and quite a few of them rose to the top ranks. ",

They took that away, but I got married and claimed that deferment in 1969. They took that away but I had a child so I claimed that one, which they then took away all deferments and instituted the draft lottery. The first drawing draft lottery was December 1969 for the year 1970. Luckily my number came up 174 so I wasn\u2019t in danger of getting called up. ",

The answer to the first question is usually, though there are some circumstances (high need area) that might allow them to stay out. The answer to the second question is that in some Native American tribes, men are expected to take their turn at being peace officers. When the tribal leaders select them, they do their civic duty as a sworn officer. At the end of their term, they go back to \u2018real life\u2019. ",

A police officer is there to maintain the law, investigate offences, prevent crime, liaise with the community, provide first responder duties, seize evidence. They usually work fairly autonomously, not in squads or units. If someone has been drafted into this then I highly doubt they would be very effective unless they had desired that career anyway, in which case they would have just joined normally. I suppose if you were to consider an emergency service that could impose the draft then it might be the fire service, but that is a bit maybe. ",

When the lottery happened everyone, no matter what the job except a few national security personnel, everyone 18 to 24 with a number of 95 or lower got drafted.
