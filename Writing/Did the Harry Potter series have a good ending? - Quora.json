            "answer_text": "Indeed, it was a happy ending, a good one. The wizarding world was free from Voldemort and the terror which he had created for the past many years. Harry Potter was free of burden of being the chosen one. He could now live a peaceful life without thinking about death. He could think of a future with his loved ones. The ending not only sorted Harry\u2019s life but the entire journey of each character. Yes there were mourning of death of many characters. But there was hope of a better world for the future generations. Dumbledore\u2019s plan and schemes finally proved worthwhile. Snape\u2019s sacrifice and death didn\u2019t go in vain as he played a vital role in Harry\u2019s survival. Neville had turned into a man of courage and was no longer a forgetful-boy. Ron and Hermione found their love. Deathly Hallows was silently solved. Last but not the least, Harry had a chance to spend the rest of his life with Ginny the way he wanted. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, it did. The only better thing would've been if it had never ended. :)  If Rowling hadn't killed Voldemort, she could have never ended the series. Good always has to triumph over evil in the end. So killing Voldemort was essential. That leaves us with Harry. If Rowling would've killed Harry, then she would've upset a lot of fans. I think Sirius' death was the first big blow that the fans suffered. Following that were the deaths of Dumbledore, Snape, and everyone you've already mentioned in your question details. We were already in shock over all of their deaths, and if Harry had been killed too, I think that would've been too much to take. Hence, I think Rowling wrote the perfect ending to Harry Potter. ",

A series starting with a young boy and ending with the fully grown person emotionally,physically or whatever.In the ending Rowling without trying really hard gave comfort to the deathly hollows , Dumbledore's life and his brilliance , almost all the characters ever mentioned throughout the series , What else can one expect ?Everyone can connect to the emotions in the last part of the series and I think its the best conclusion Rowling could have given without messing with any part of the story or characters who lived in the book. And what is a great ending?I believe the sum of moments that lead to the ending of Harry Potter were themselves so great and it got the ending it deserved. ",

            "answer_text": "Wasn't it a happy ending? The wizarding world was saved by not one person but all those who had suffered through the hands of voldemort and death eaters. Everyone could contribute. Everyone had a story featuring themselves to tell to the generations to come in their family. The hallows were safe. No person who intends to misuse them could ever find them again. As for Dumbledore well he too died saving the world he didn't regret it. As for Snape. Yes. I'll say Snapes death was very tragic and sudden, not expected. And after knowing the back story, well didn't very feel very good  <3 there. ",
