            "answer_text": " I didn't want to be a writer. I loved reading and had read four digits' worth of books by the time I was 10. I loved making stuff up and writing it down, especially if it would make people happy. But I didn\u2019t believe I could actually be a writer. Not because I couldn\u2019t express myself, but because I\u2019d end up with my commas in the wrong place. I was wrong. I have language and can speak. Because I can speak I can write. The same is true for you. Unfortunately, many writers struggle to find their voice because they mistakenly believe people are looking for professional, intelligent, or authoritative, when what they really want is friendly and informative. Writers worry that if they write in their own voice, it will somehow minimize the strength of what they have to say. Nothing\u2019s further from the truth. The more you write in your natural voice, the more you will write like you speak. Your language will be clear and your message easier to understand. There are some exceptions in the technical writing field where jargon trumps style and you need to be very specific. This book isn't for technical writers. So how do you find your voice? First, let me say that when you first start out, you'll probably unintentionally ape some of your favorite writers. This is perfectly natural and so long as you don't do it intentionally, or try to sound like someone you're not, don\u2019t worry or fight it. In time, after you've written a lot, you will find your own voice. You'll find confidence in your style and your voice will become as unique as you are. Your voice is the aggregate of all the minutes of your life that have made you who you are. It's all you've ingested, from other writers' words to your own experiences. It is the verbal framework for how you see life. It's what makes you interesting to your audience. Your voice will help you reach first-time readers, turn them into lifelong fans, and give you the base you need to become a full-time writer with a catalog of completed projects. First you must find it. Which means you need to get writing. And it's not just writing in your chosen niche, which will help, you find your voice. All writing helps you move forward, no matter the job. Being a ghostwriter is one of the best things that could have happened to my writing. I\u2019ve been commissioned to write everything from SEO keyword copy, to long sales letters, to fiction, to heartfelt and powerful letters, to autobiographies. I\u2019ve learned and loved it all, and am a better writer because of it. I can write poetry, emails, or blog copy, all in a way that connects with readers because I pour my voice into everything I do. I write fast because I know it\u2019s the best way to capture my voice, but I always put more \u201cme\u201d into the edit. That\u2019s the magic of writing as you speak, and doing it fast \u2014 not giving your brain time to question what your heart is saying. If you write like lightning, your voice is forced to the surface. Teach yourself to write like you speak and you\u2019ll wield the secret weapon of prolific writers and million-dollar copywriters the world over. So how do you actually learn to develop an engaging voice? Here\u2019s are my top 5 tips. 1. Write Like You Speak Writing fast is the best way to capture your most natural voice. Done well, it also leaves you with copy that\u2019s easy to edit. Manipulating your thoughts into elegant prose takes a long time. Capturing unedited thoughts as they fly through your mind, however, can yield clean, concise copy, with clarity and voice. Imagine you\u2019re having a conversation with someone you love. You probably wouldn\u2019t use big words to try and impress or stop to think of the best way to say things, right? That\u2019s the same immediacy you want to harness in your rough draft. The important thing is to get your copy down as quickly and naturally as possible. You'll use your editing phase to trim away run-on sentences, unnecessary words, or anything else that will dim your delivery. If you think it will be hard to capture your natural speaking voice, or have no idea what you sound like, record yourself in conversation. You may feel silly speaking into a microphone for five minutes, but it\u2019s worth it. Take your cell phone (or any recording device) and record a conversation between yourself, and a spouse, good friend, or anyone willing to hear you yammer for a few minutes. Listen to the recording. What do you sound like? Are your words big, small, or medium? Is it easy to understand your point? Is your tone warm, friendly, conversational? Do this exercise a few times, trying to balance the way you speak with how you write. Once you can make this second nature, communicating with your audience will be as simple as sitting down and letting your fingers fly. If you\u2019re still unsure, pretend you\u2019re writing an email to a friend. You don\u2019t get self-conscious when returning an email, right? For most people, emailing a friend is as easy as thinking. That\u2019s the immediacy you want to capture. Try taking a topic you\u2019d like to write about. Turn your topic into a question and send yourself an email. Answer the email thoroughly, then copy and paste your reply into a doc. Chances are, you\u2019ll have a solid rough draft requiring little editing. The best part is, if you write the way you speak, it will be easier to get to know your audience. 2. Know Your Audience You\u2019ve heard it before: Know your audience. This is true no matter what you\u2019re writing, but it\u2019s especially true when your purpose is to drive behavior, influence thought, or convert your fans into buyers and lifelong customers. To enter the conversation-taking place in your customer\u2019s mind, you must be fluent in the story they\u2019re telling themselves. In other words, don't see your audience as an outsider. Try to see them as they see themselves. For instance, if anyone looked at my friend David a decade ago, they would have seen this loser guy wasting his years behind the counter in a gas station. However, if you were to get inside David's head, you would see him as he saw himself \u2014 a talented guy who just needed a chance to prove himself. If you were going to market to David back then, you wouldn't pitch to him as you saw him, but rather, how he saw himself. Getting to know how your readers see themselves takes some time, experience, and observation. Some questions you should consider: What are the roadblocks standing in the way of their successes?How can you move those roadblocks and pull them closer to the results they want?What are their biggest fears?What strangles them in the moment and keeps their heels in the dirt?Never be afraid to ask your audience questions to get to know them better. They want to be heard and many will be happy to answer. Create a simple survey for your readers using a service like Survey Monkey, then post it to your site or send it to your subscriber list. If you don\u2019t yet have an audience, that\u2019s okay. Look for another blog in your niche with a large audience, then head to their comment section and read what people are saying. What questions are they asking? What are their concerns? What do they want? Once you have some basic information, you can start building a buyer profile \u2014 a specific description of your ideal buyer that will help you speak directly to her. I\u2019ve opted into more lists than I can count over the last three years. Some are worth my attention because the information is valuable. Sometimes, I want to see what other writers and marketers are doing. It\u2019s amazing, the difference between a good marketer and a great one. Great marketers know how to put their prose into an engaging story. Most of all, great marketers know who they\u2019re speaking to. A marginal marketer will send an email telling you to \u201ccheck something out,\u201d that\u2019s little more than an excuse for them to make a quick buck, with little value to reader. There\u2019s a huge disconnect and the subscriber can feel it. Those writers have no idea what their buyers want, or worse, they don\u2019t care. That\u2019s churn and burn business, and the wrong way to do it. Do your homework. Find out what your audience wants. Know their hopes, dreams and desires; know what they hope to achieve so you can give it to them in a way no one else can. 3. Be Funny Laughter is contagious. How many times have you found yourself snorting at something simply because your friend was nearing tears? The joy of making others laugh is a core human trait, for both recipient and teller. When you can make people laugh, you are seen as attractive (even if you're a tall, lanky writer with a big nose) and a pleasure to be around. Jokes are passed from person to person, which is why if you can use humor well, you\u2019ll wield one of the sharpest writer\u2019s weapons. While many writers don't think they can be funny, they're selling themselves short. If you can laugh, you can make others laugh. Writing humor may not be easy, but it isn\u2019t calculus. As long as you know the basic laws of all humor, you can make people laugh, too. The trouble with trying to teach funny is that every person has their own rhythm of humor. You don\u2019t teach a person to be funny (unless you work at a clown college, which is less funny, more Stephen King novel waiting to happen), you empower them to unleash their inner hilarity. Which brings us to our first tenet of humor \u2014 not everyone will think you\u2019re funny. Give up on that idea. Now. Seriously, it won\u2019t happen. Even if you aim for a bland, inoffensive brand of funny, like Bob Hope or Erma Bombeck, somebody will be offended or hate you and declare it loudly on the Internet. The thing is that humor, by its nature, is always poking fun of something painful to someone. The good news is those two both died rich, so if bland, inoffensive humor is your strong point, you might be in luck! Don\u2019t be afraid of the easy, obvious joke, but don\u2019t let it be your crutch, either. Easy jokes will make people laugh, but you\u2019ll get the greatest rewards by aiming outside your comfort zone. Keep it simple. Resist the urge to explain. Drop your bon mots and let the people experience the joy of unwrapping them. People enjoy the incongruous and unexpected. If you can zig when they think you\u2019ll zag, or make them think twice to interpret what they\u2019ve read, you\u2019ll succeed in making them laugh. At its essence, humor is about the unexpected. You set people up to expect one thing, and then deliver something out of left field. Your humor will depend on your audience, but chances are good that you don't want to be mean-spirited or tell jokes that offend anyone's race, sex, or religion. The safest path to humor is self-deprecating. Nobody can get mad at you for making fun of your foibles, right? Well, someone still will, but those people will be mad no matter what you write. Although most people will say they love dry humor, like that classy stuff on PBS, wild-eyed ranting peppered with plenty of curse words and descriptions of bodily secretions can work well, too. As long as you hit it out of the park every now and again, people won\u2019t remember all the times you fell flat unless they have serious issues, in which case them not laughing is probably the least of your problems. Adding a bit of humor to your writing is an effective way to get and keep reader attention and stand out from the crowd. All things being equal, who wouldn\u2019t want to go with the guy or gal who makes them laugh? It will take a bit of practice and probably some humiliation, but the more you let loose and let your funny flag fly, the easier it gets, and the more you\u2019ll make people laugh. And getting your audience to laugh is a terrific way to get them to love you. 4. Make Your Readers Love You You can't make everyone love you. This advice is as appropriate in life as it is in writing. The sooner you stop trying, the better off you'll be at making the ones who matter most fall in love with your words. While you can't capture the hearts of everyone, you will need some dedicated fans before your writing dreams can come true. While you can\u2019t soak your copy in Love Potion #9, there are four things you can do to inspire affection from your readers. Be consistent and build trust. Everything you do matters, especially in the long run. Never write under the faulty assumption that every project is an island. Everything you do is somehow related, even if it only strips from your legacy. Do your best, no matter what you write or where it\u2019s published, and you will be thought of as a consistent writer, worthy of trust.Take the time to do things right. Never miss a deadline, but if you\u2019re late with a blog post, or delay the launch of your eBook because you were tending to excellence, your attention will be rewarded. Always put quality first. In a culture where we have timers at the drive-thru which guarantee the opportunity to deliver high blood pressure and heart disease in under 60 seconds, that type of care is rare and easily noticed.Tell a story that connects. Be memorable, and foster a connection with your audience through honest storytelling. There is only one you and no one tells your story better. Whatever your personal narrative, find a way to make it relate to your readers and they will naturally relate to you. Look life\u2019s regrets in the eye and let your audience see you swallow fear in the face of your online adventure. Brilliant writing is sometimes as simple as being able to leave a genuine lasting impression in the memories of your readers.Talk to one reader. When writing blog posts, address a single reader. I'm not saying to call one particular reader out by name and dedicate your post to that person. Instead of addressing plural readers, address them in the singular. For example, instead of writing, \u201cI couldn't wait to share this with you all\u201d write, \u201cI couldn't wait to share this with you.\u201d It's a minor distinction, but it works to bring your readers closer.Be consistent, take your time, tell a story that connects, address your reader personally, and put out superb product. Your readers will love you and you will reap the reward. 5. Put Yourself in Everything You Do Because a writing career harbors the promise of unlimited potential, the Internet is bloated with writers in search of opportunity. The pay is solid, the flexibility fantastic, and (let\u2019s face it) the commute is about as good as it gets. How are you supposed to compete against the flood of freelancers on Upwork, Guru, and Constant Content, many of whom are willing to work for rates that would barely pay the rent on a fifth-floor Bangalore walkup? The problem with a lot of online writers is that too many are singing in the same key. You want more, so you\u2019re going to have to do more to get it. Whether you\u2019re building your brand or looking for work, the only way to stand out is to distinguish yourself from the crowd. You don\u2019t necessarily need to be a better writer. The Internet is brimming with remarkably talented (and broke) wordsmiths. You must be memorable. I have a simple tactic I learned from my decade running a flower shop. When you create a bouquet, you must finish it off before handing it across the counter. A completed bouquet needs a beautiful ribbon to tie it together, but if you give it a focal point striking enough to catch the customer\u2019s breath, they\u2019ll come back again and again. The same hold trues for writing. Whenever possible, take the time to include at least one line that sets you apart from every other writer out there; one sentence that could only come from you. That sentence, that final \u201cbow on the bouquet,\u201d will draw your readers toward you. Most writers won\u2019t take the extra time to really make their copy shine. They\u2019re rushed, they take shortcuts, and it shows. You can\u2019t compete with the world, it\u2019s way too big. Besides, why would you ever want to be anyone other than yourself? You can compete with every writer your clients have worked with before you, or the other blogs too tired to inspire, or the mess of novels in your genre. If you\u2019re willing to take the time to tie a bow around your copy, you\u2019ll stand head and shoulders above the rest. ",

            "answer_text": "I was recently asked how I\u2019ve been able to make my writing voice sound so unique. I\u2019d never really paused to think about that before, but the answer came pretty quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s the voice in my head!\u201d I said. It sounded a little crazy when it came out of my mouth\u2026but it was true. The first draft of anything I write (when I\u2019m writing as me, not a client) is pure stream of consciousness onto the page. And by putting my inner dialogue onto the page (unfiltered), the writing voice is a reflection of my personality, my quirks, and how I sound in my most natural state. And guess what? You can do that, too. Your voice needs to shine. Maybe it needs to work in \"that's what she said\" jokes or say things like \"YAS QUEEN!\" If that's how you sound in your head, that's how you should sound on the page. Let\u2019s talk about how you can do that...better. Step One: Remove Filter The first major obstacle to overcome is getting rid of that pesky lil\u2019 thing that gets in between you and the page: Your internal filter. If you\u2019re editing your inner voice as you write, you\u2019re essentially diluting yourself. You\u2019re taking out your cute quirks, your speaking cadence, and the language you\u2019d really use. Stop that. Let it flow. Don\u2019t worry about editing until later. Instead, write like you\u2019d speak. Better yet: Write like you were telling a story to a group of friends. Don\u2019t be afraid to give your writing voice a little performance element. Step Two: Embellish with Humor You have a sense of humor, right? Of course you do. Maybe it\u2019s sarcastic, or punny, or pop-culture based. Whatever it is: It should come through in your writing. Look back at your first draft and ask yourself: Where would a dash of humor make sense? Other questions to consider as you sprinkle in the comedy: Is there a joke naturally prompted here?Would some humor add to what I\u2019m saying, or be distracting?Would people get the joke?Bottom line: Look for places to punch up what you\u2019ve written with your inner comedian. Step Three: Be Brave (and open to feedback) Sharing your true inner voice can feel scary and exposing. Maybe you\u2019re thinking, \u201cIf people know the real me, will they still like me?\u201d I\u2019m sure the answer is yes. In fact, maybe more so for keepin\u2019 it real. Anyone can churn out another boring article. But if you can write with a voice that sparkles with charming personality, you\u2019re doing something that truly only YOU can do. That\u2019s kinda brave. AND VERY AWESOME. Does that mean you should never be open to tweaking said voice? Nah. Feedback is a good thing. If you get some constructive feedback on how to make your writing voice better, run with it. It\u2019s only going to help make you better. Your inner voice is one people should hear. Let it out (and onto the page.) ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few things you can do: Become more self aware Part of developing your voice is becoming aware of who you are in relation to the world. People tend to start by writing from a self centred perspective, and this is a guaranteed way to produce bad work. I know that my own artistic voice has developed as I have developed as a human being, and I imagine it's the same for anyone... What do I mean by writing from a self centred perspective? Well for example - you might take someone who you disagree with (or who has wronged you) and write them as a bad guy, while a character that represents yourself is the hero of the story. I literally used to have ideas based around precisely this - when I was at school there was a guy who beat me up quite badly for no apparent reason. It made me so angry and I couldn\u2019t understand why anyone would do that. I would want to write stories with him as the bad guy. Then I got a bit older and gained more perspective, I started to realise that it probably wasn\u2019t his fault, I imagine he didn\u2019t have a very nice family and I'm quite fortunate to have a decent upbringing - if I didn't I may have ended up the same as him etc etc.  If I was to write this story now it would be a lot different to when I was a teenager. Humans are naturally wired to be self obsessed - they have an in built scale of what they consider to be \u2018best\u2019 and \u2018worst\u2019. Whatever the worst thing in their life is will be the worst thing in the world to them. They also have a tendency to see themselves as the hero of their own story. They will view their own way of doing things as the right way and others' as the wrong way. What you need to combat this is a bit of perspective - learn about life in other cultures, read about psychology and try to understand why other people do the things they do. You must also consider and question your own beliefs and motivations. A writer needs to be able to put themselves in other people's shoes as well as their own. A good place to start is http://youarenotsosmart.com Realise that learning to write is like trying to learn a whole new language Learning to write is very much like learning a whole new language (see phrases like finding your \u2018voice', learning the \u2018language\u2019 of cinema etc). At the start of you're writing career you're not very fluent in the language of story... You can attempt to communicate, but since you don\u2019t properly know the language, it\u2019s unsurprising if your writing ends up a bit clunky, or doesn\u2019t quite have the desired effect. You can even have the best of intentions and may have ideas that, if written correctly, would make fantastic stories. The problem is that it's very easy to imagine the broad strokes of an idea. Try to actually write the thing though and you\u2019re suddenly brought back down to earth, you know what you want to achieve, but have no idea how. The only way is to sit there and practice, trying over and over again until what you want to acheive and what you actually end up writing are one and the same. Once again it\u2019s about perspective... When you write your first story, you may not think it\u2019s that bad. You don\u2019t know the language so you're basically unable to tell how much your writing sucks. After you\u2019ve written another five stories and become a bit more fluent though, you\u2019ll look back at your first efforts and wonder what on earth you were thinking. Don\u2019t worry too much about your first works being truly amazing or original. Unless you\u2019ve already been writing since you were five and have parents who are published authors then they probably won\u2019t be. Children learn about the world by imitating adults, without even realising they're doing it. It's just the same with writers. Whether you realise it or not, your first works will probably be unoriginal and somewhat derivative of your favourite authors. Not to say you should intentionally copy the work of others, you shouldn't.  Just try to do your own thing and go through the process of writing as many times as you can. Don't beat yourself up if your first efforts are lame rip offs of established authors - keep going and eventually you'll start to find a unique voice of your own. Finally... There is another factor which prevents people from developing as a writer and that is ego. There is a part of your brain that doesn\u2019t like feeling stupid, or doing hard work. This means that when you read your own work your brain will tend to let you think the work is better than it actually is, either to avoid having to do further work or to stop you from feeling stupid. It doesn\u2019t do this when you read other people\u2019s work though and this is why it\u2019s much easier to judge whether someone else\u2019s story is interesting or boring than it is for your own. You can trick your brain to combat this though - when you\u2019re reading your story, do your best to imagine that it is someone else\u2019s story you\u2019re reading. Be truly honest with yourself and ask - is the story something you would enjoy if it was written by someone else? ",

Your initial writing may reflect your favorite author ( or not ) but as you keep on writing, you will fall in love with your characters. At first this love will be superficial but as you start talking to them, understanding them and then writing about your conversations, your thoughts, your views, their views, your love will become deeper.  And when you have fallen deeply in love with your characters, one or more will break your heart. Once that happens, you will know what you want to say to those heartless characters. And when you do tell them, you will find your voice. All the best! ",
