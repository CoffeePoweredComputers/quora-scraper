            "answer_text": "My suggestions to become an excellent writer are as under: Write for a specific audience. Do not write merely to express yourself. If you target an audience then you will write with the focus that the said audience has certain expectations in terms of content, quality, frequency and length of your writing. You are then able to narrow down your thoughts and style to meet the expectations of your audience. Occasionally, you would get feedback from your audience and that can motivate you, help you course correct, give you ideas for more content etc. Be disciplined. Write regularly. Ideally set a fixed time and place to write. If you simply wait for ideas to flow, then the chances are that your written output could be sketchy, sporadic and simplistic. Discipline will ensure your output is prolific, you get to exercise your thinking powers and with the practice you get from being prolific, the quality of your output would be better. Increase your vocabulary. Repeating words, using an inappropriate word and getting stuck for lack of a suitable word when writing, are the bane of aspiring writers. Reading more, making notes of new words, using a thesaurus when writing are my suggestions to expand your vocabulary. Carve out your own style of writing. Since we tend to learn by rote, there is a danger that we would also end up aping a writer we like or a style we adore. Hence it is imperative that you carve out your own style so that your writing is different, distinct and discerning in content and presentation. ",

            "answer_text": "Good writing is the result of hard work and consistency. But hard work at what exactly? Write as often as possible. Everyday, if possible - it will pay off bigger than any other activity. Otherwise, write often and always with a regular pattern of time away from, and time at writing. Don\u2019t be sporadic about it.Read a lot. No writer can afford not to be a reader. Reading develops your feeling for how good stories are written and structured. It also develops vocabulary rapidly.Read books on writing. One or two \u201cHow to Write\u201d books are useful, but if you\u2019re hell bent on really getting into the depths of writing, read John Gardener\u2019s book \u201dOn Becoming a Novelist\u201d, it\u2019s one of the best books that\u2019ll take you down into the depths of what writing a novel is all about. Lajos Egri, \u201cThe Art of Dramatic Writing\u201d, gives you great ideas about every aspect of story. Reading these books will give you a guide to practice good habits while writing stories.Take an interest in the world outside of your writing ideas. Try and understand something about psychology, politics, relationships, people from different generations - life itself and why people do what they do about sums up the interest a writer should have. This means developing the habit of observing people; listen to conversations, accents, intonations you hear in passing conversations. Ask yourself questions about why people dress like they do, and why they seem to act in contradiction to their words. This is common, and great fun to observe.Be yourself, write what you want to write but find out what the main theme of your writing is. Be passionate about your subject and then you will begin to understand what type of readers will probably read your work. If you are writing about lives, people, conflicts, then for sure, someplace out there in the World there are readers for your work. Aim towards defining your topic and theme and dig into it, understand it deeply , and your writing will improve.Habits are the way we do things repeatedly. Don\u2019t try and elicit other people\u2019s strategies just because it worked for them, find out who you are and follow your own path - that\u2019s a top habit.",
