            "answer_text": "After a pretty decent (although I believe widely misunderstood and yes, almost completely unrelated to the book) opening for the franchise Starship Troopers, they decided that (A) audiences were primed and ready for more, and that (B) none of the stars of the original movie were apparently the cause for the first one\u2019s success. The first one was populated by the likes of Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Jake Busey, the ALWAYS stellar Clancy Brown and Neil Fucking Patrick Harris. So they rushed out this steaming load, which took a whopping month and a half to make it to video, so barely avoiding the direct-to-video label although that\u2019s pretty much what it was:  No one returned. Neither did the vast majority of the fans. Sitting right now on a big ol\u2019 33% on Rotten Tomatoes. I think that might be a tad generous. ",
