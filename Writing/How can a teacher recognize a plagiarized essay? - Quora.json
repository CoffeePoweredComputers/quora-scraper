            "answer_text": "Q: How can a teacher recognize a plagiarized essay? A: There are two things that usually set off an alarm bell for me: (1) The student is writing beautiful and authoritative prose citing arcane sources, and then is suddenly writing like a college sophomore (or high school junior). This is followed by more scholarly prose. It is the \u201creal you\u201d sentences that link the plagiarized paragraphs that are the giveaway. (2) The references are the second place I look for hints of plagiarism. If for example, the essay is about knife violence in the UK. and the most recent reference is say, two years old, it is probably copied from the internet, an old text book or article, or paper from the fraternity files. In addition: If a sentence or paragraph seems too familiar, I Google it.Software such as Turnitin is a good check\u2014as well as paraphrasing software.Finally, if I am suspicious, but lack proof, I resort to the ancient and secret technique known only by its Latin name, defraudat capiens. Defraudat capiens is entrusted only to the wisest teachers of teachers of each generation when they graduate and are inducted into the ancient order of Prudens et Magistra. Teachers are bound by blood oath or pinky promise by spitting never to reveal this ancient wisdom said to have been developed by Socrates himself. So if you are a lazy kid trying to get information on safe ways to cheat on essays, don\u2019t even try. Your Teachers know how to catch you, and you will be punished. ",

            "answer_text": "Look for sophisticated vocabulary choices, sentence structure, and other clues. If you suspect that an essay is plagiarized, sit down with the student to talk. Be pleasant. Ask them to tell you about the essay. Where did the ideas come from? What parts were easy to write? Difficult? What strategies helped them? If they\u2019re at a loss to answer your questions, they\u2019ll soon admit it\u2019s not their own work. But if you\u2019re teaching essay writing as a process, your students won\u2019t be able to use an essay service. You can prevent the whole problem. You\u2019re teaching students how to write essays, right? So they should be bringing each stage of the essay to class: freewriting, outline, rough draft, revisions, and so on. Pair students up or put them into groups to discuss and revise their work. Give them checklists. Walk around, pick up their work and look at it. Whenever possible, make sure your assignments require critical thinking. If you\u2019re really teaching essay writing and requiring students to talk about how they\u2019re working through each step - sharing their work - helping one another - getting feedback from you - they\u2019ll be forced to do their own work. The way essay writing has traditionally been taught is crazy, in my opinion. The teacher announces the topic and never says another word about it. Students are lost. They write weak essays - or get someone else to write the essay for them. The weak essays require hours of correcting from the teacher - who already knows how to write well. Why not require the students to do the corrections? \u201cThey can\u2019t\u201d is the teacher\u2019s response. Well, isn\u2019t it time for them to start learning? What are they going to do on the job later on, when there\u2019s no teacher standing behind them to edit their work? ",

            "answer_text": "A teacher can often detect plagiarism just by consistency. If the style and syntax change, especially if they suddenly and inexplicably become better than the rest of the text, one can suspect plagiarism. A really good plagiarist could work around this with hard work, but but that defeats the purpose of most plagiarists, which is to get by with less work. In the old days, it would be difficult to prove plagiarism unless the writer copied something that the teacher remembered. But today it is relatively easy because of plagiarism-detecting software, such as Turnitin, that can find obscure text (and just about any text). ",

Imagine a mediocre student who suddenly starts to write like Shakespeare or two best friends who accidentally wrote similar papers. It seems suspicious, doesn\u2019t it? Try to avoid such coincidences. Plagiarism softwareThere are plenty of online tools that help teachers catch dishonest students when plagiarism is not so obvious. Plagiarism detection services like Unplag (https://unplag.com/) provide an accurate pagiarism report and confirm/decline teacher\u2019s apprehension. It goes without saying that the latter method is more relaible and well-grounded. ",

            "answer_text": "There are different ways to detect plagiarism: one of them is to use specific software that analyses your text and gives back a report on the amount of original and copied text you\u2019ve used. Another option is using your own experience: teachers have seen plenty of papers that were taken from online sources, they\u2019ve probably learn\u2019t most of them and can detect plagiarism from the first sight. Also, it is easy to notice when a student have been submitting papers written in one way and then gives a paper with a writing style that totally differs from previous works (of course, you can improve one, but again, it can easily be detected if you\u2019ve been using what someone else told or not).

I highly do not recommend using absolutely free plagiarism checkers - it\u2019s a waste of your time. There are no good and absolutely free checker. There are good paid checkers, but you will spend much cash on finding the good one. So the best solution - use partly free plagiarism checkers. For example, Free Plagiarism Checker Plagramme allows teachers to use their software for free, but they hope you to inform your students that you prefer them. All their system is built, that teacher may use software for free , but you are gently asked to inform your students about plagramme. ",
