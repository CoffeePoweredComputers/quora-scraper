            "answer_text": "First, let me say that I object to the use of \u201cobjective\u201d as a term to describe how humans think. Human consciousness, by its very nature, is SUBJECTIVE. There\u2019s nothing \u201cobjective\u201d about it. When teachers tell students to write an \u201cobjective [you name it]\u201d they are being inaccurate and sloppy in their use of language. What your teacher (or what you) want is this: to write a summary that is an ACCURATE representation of the text to be summarized. Therefore, an accurate summary must:1. State or explain the main points of the text2. Occasionally quote the text (using quotation marks), but generally restate the main ideas in your own words. However, depending on the length and complexity of the text, a summary can be as short as a single sentence, or as long as a long essay (5 or 10 pages or more), or it can be anything in between.Generally, if you\u2019re summarizing 1\u20132 pages of text, you should condense each paragraph into a sentence, making sure that your sentences all work together, making sense as single paragraph. The core issue in writing an accurate summary requires that you accurately understand the text you are summarizing. If it\u2019s a story (or the opening scene in a story), what happens in it, or who (or what) is being described? If it\u2019s a history text, you need to talk about when, where, what and who. If it\u2019s a science text, you need to describe what knowledge is being conveyed, and why that knowledge is important. Once you understand the text, the summary should be pretty easy to produce. ",
