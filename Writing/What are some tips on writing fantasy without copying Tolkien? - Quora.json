            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll copy others here on saying that the first thing to do is read more. If you\u2019re having trouble not copying Tolkien, it\u2019s probably because you don\u2019t have much experience with other types of fantasy. I\u2019ll add Ursula K. Leguin to the list of really great fantasy authors who write nothing like Tolkien. Definitely don\u2019t expressly avoid every single thing Tolkien ever wrote about, though. If you\u2019re reading some of these answers and thinking you have to create something utterly unrecognizable, that\u2019s going a bit too far. The real trick is to make sure everything you write is intentional and you always make it your own somehow. Every time you want to include some kind of common fantasy element or trope, think about why you want to include it\u2014is it because it\u2019s best for your story? Then that\u2019s a good reason to include it. Is it because that\u2019s what Tolkien did? Because that\u2019s what you view as the \u201cright\u201d way to write fantasy? Because you\u2019ve seen it so often that you\u2019ve never questioned it? That means it\u2019s time to change it up, think outside the box, rework it, ask questions about why it\u2019s often been included in fantasy works, look into what inspired it, think about what direction you could take it that\u2019s best for your story, look into other sources for inspiration (African and Asian voices are severely lacking in fantasy!). Or avoid it if you want to\u2026 but don\u2019t lose sleep over feeling like you have to avoid it. The main thing is, if you notice yourself answering \u201cyes\u201d to any of the questions at the beginning of this paragraph, to ask questions and brainstorm until you get it to the point where you\u2019re answering \u201cyes\u201d to the question at the end of the third paragraph instead.

            "answer_text": "Do you mean High Fantasy? Because there are plenty of types of fantasy that don\u2019t really borrow from Tolkien. What Tolkien did was to create his own fantasy world which had a variety of races that were mainly drawn from Northern European mythology. He then created a huge amount of back story and added a couple of races that were his own invention. He also created languages based on European languages. In essence he drew on his own specialist knowledge and created an in-depth world based on that knowledge. He took the time to write something that felt not only like a medieval saga but also real. Now if you don\u2019t want to write like Tolkein then first off, don\u2019t do any research. Then don\u2019t bother with any world building and instead just make things up when you get to a problem. Don\u2019t bother plotting things out in detail. Lastly don\u2019t add your own creativity to the mix. You ought to be able to churn out a fantasy book like this in 3 months, so I look forward to reading it. ",
