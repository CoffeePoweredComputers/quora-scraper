            "answer_text": "As Thomas Moser replied, all numbers in an ordered list get a tab. What you can do is adjust the tab stop slightly to accommodate the larger number. Select all of the lines that you have tabbed. If this is difficult, click at the first line and then shift-click at the last line so you don\u2019t have to scroll.  Visually determine where on your ruler you\u2019d like the new tab spot to be and click.  Your numbers should now have more breathing room. When you create a new list, it\u2019s easier if you set the tab first. ",

            "answer_text": "All numbers in an ordered list get a tab. The default list tab is pretty close to the numbers and, in your case, the number is large enough to go beyond the tab stop for the list. It then acts as a \u201cdefault\" tab of 1/2 inch. Use a smaller font, redefine the list style to make the list tab stop larger (best way IMO), or fix the list's tab stop using the ruler. ",
