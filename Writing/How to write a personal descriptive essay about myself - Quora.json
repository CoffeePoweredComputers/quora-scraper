            "answer_text": "Writing about yourself can seem embarrassing at first. Cover letters, personal essays, and bio notes about yourself come with some specific tricks and tips that can make it a lot less intimidating when choosing style and content. Learn the basics and you will be able to make your personal writing stand out. 1.Introduce yourself. Writing about yourself can be tough, because there is so much you can say. You have a lifetime of experiences, talents, and skills to summarize in a paragraph, or two. Whatever kind of writing you are planning on doing, whatever your purpose, just think about it like you are introducing yourself to a stranger. What do they need to know? Answer questions like: Who are you?What is your background?What are your interests?What are your talents?What are your achievements?What challenges have you faced?2.Start with a short list of your talents and interests. If you are not sure where to start, or if you are limited to one thing for the assignment, start by making a list. Brainstorm good ideas that will help you decide, then sketch out as many different answers as you feel necessary. 3.Narrow your topic. Pick one specific topic, describe it in detail, and use that to introduce yourself. It is better to pick one thing and use a lot of detail, than to give someone a big long list of general items. What is your most interesting or unique quality? What word(s) describes you the best? Choose that topic.4.Use a few good details. When you have a specific topic to narrow in on, give the reader unique details to hold onto. Remember, you are describing yourself and add details that show you in a positive light: Bad: I like sports.Ok: I'm a fan of basketball, football, tennis, and soccer.Good: My favorite sport is football, both to watch and to play.Better: When I was growing up, I would watch Big Ten football with my dad and brothers every Saturday, before we'd go outside and toss the football around. I've loved it ever since.5.Be humble. Even if you are very accomplished or talented, you want to come across like a down-to-earth person. Do not write about yourself to brag. List your accomplishments and your successes, but temper them with some more humble language: Braggy: I'm the best and most dynamic worker at my company right now, so you should want to hire me for my talents.Humble: I was lucky enough to be awarded three employee of the month awards at my current job. Turns out it was a company record.",

            "answer_text": "Personal descrpritive essays about yourself are very particular; you are, or should be, highly knowledgeable about you; descriptive details can be very broad but must match your target audience- a prospective employer, lover, business partner, political party, charity seeking volunteers\u2026 Naturally what you divulge or share is determined by your objective and the recipient/audience. Assuming this is not high stakes, complex or in some way problematic, it generally works well to be open, honest, sincere, truthful, modest, considerate, cooperative and creative. These are not physical details but character and personality traits that identify you as you; the looks, appearance matters but is secondary. Again, objective and audience matter. If you were meeting your adoptive parents at the train station how would you\u2019d describe your appearance so you would be recognized? How would you describe yourself to your fianc\u00e9\u2019s parent so you would be well received? Descriptive writing can be very persuasive- or misleading. It starts and ends with you, and is determined by your objective- to gain favour, get the job or\u2026, and depends largely on the circumstances of you vs what your intended audience needs to know, should know. Take care to know your audience and objective, and balance your descriptive details suitably. Description can range from sparse to superfluous, get it right, reasonable under the circumstances, in a most viable median -descriptive essay writing. ",
