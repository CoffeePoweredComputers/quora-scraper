            "answer_text": "Thank you Ashlynn Cunningham for your A2A. Your Question: What do you feel about the Oxford comma? Let's look at some sentences. (To answer your question, I am using sentences from a short memior I wrote a couple of years ago.) Sometimes the Oxford comma is appropriate. Being supported by my hospital bed, I could feed myself, drink from a toddler's sipping cup, groom my face and hair, practice writing, and flip pages of a magazine. The Oxford comma helps the reader understand the list of predicates to the sentence. The length of each item in the list requires the Oxford comma. I determined that I would go home, practice yoga, get physically stronger, and take fewer medications. The Oxford comma helps the reader understand the list of verb phrases. Sometimes the Oxford comma is not necessary. The elderly women spoke about how yoga had allowed them to take lower dosages or fewer medications for their physical problems with their hearts, lungs, and their pain. The Oxford comma is not needed here for clarity. In this memior because I am using Oxford commas in other sentences, I placed an comma here. Generally, writers are encouraged to either use the Oxford comma throughout or not at all. Since I needed the Oxford comma for the previous sentences, I used the Oxford comma throughout the memior. Due to my writing style, I often find that I must use the Oxford comma against my will because I often write complicated lists. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there can be situations in which it\u2019s useful, and ones in which it\u2019s not, and I think people should apply it accordingly. In other words I don\u2019t believe people should have some universal policy to include or not include it, as if there was a point in such an inflexible rule. Since I am a linguist rather than an English language prescriptivist such as a teacher or copy-editor I don\u2019t believe in a \u2018correct\u2019 or incorrect practice, and I also see speech as primary and writing as secondary. Commas basically correspond to pauses, or at least it should be possible to read out a text with commas in where there is a perceivable difference in the prosody corresponding to the commas, such as pauses or intonation changes. Therefore there will be a difference in pronunciation between the situations where a comma is useful and ones where it is not. If Jane enjoys cooking her family and cooking her dog, then \u201cJane enjoys cooking her family and her dog\u201d will sound different from if Jane enjoys cooking, Jane enjoys her family and Jane enjoys her dog. Or even from if Jane enjoys her dog and cooking her family. If I invited firstly Steve, secondly a murderer, and thirdly a policeman, then \u201cI invited Steve, a murderer(,) and a policeman\u201d will sound different from if I invited firstly Steve, who is a murderer, and secondly a policeman. They will also both sound different from if I invited Steve, who is both a murderer and a policeman. Prosody is barely ever represented in writing in any language, and English is certainly no exception. Nevertheless punctuation does some work to cover the essentials and the comma can be used to represent differences of meaning that in speech would be covered by pauses and intonation differences. As Morten points out it\u2019s not always perfect, and in fact it\u2019s hardly perfect in speech - people sometimes have to interject to ask what exactly someone means by what they said - but as long as some clarity can be gained from it I think it should be used. If no clarity is gained, and it does not correspond to a prosodic equivalent or a difference in meaning, it makes no sense to use it. ",
