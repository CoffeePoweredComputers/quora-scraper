            "answer_text": "I am not sure what you mean. Do you mean to ask a question similar to \u201cWhat are some English names that name professions\u201d and the answer would be \u201cSmith, Taylor, Butler, Butcher, and Baker for example?\" If you had asked the same question of English names, then I am not aware of any English names that name death, and death is even more taboo here in Japan than it is in the UK. However, at a tangent perhaps, and if the pun four (shi) is of relevance then surnames pronounced Shibou written \u56db\u574a, \u829d\u751f puns on a more academic word for death (\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff09as does (interestingly) the Japanese word for ovary. The womb is a tomb in Japanese too. Alternatively if you not looking for names of people then there are many other words for death and dying as there is in English, such as takai suru (lit. do/go to the other world), yuku (go or die when written with a special character), naku naru (become nothing / de-become?!), sossuru (graduate!), Kokeru (fall), and kotogiru (run out of things). Some of these too pun with names such as Takai meaning high well \u9ad8\u4e95, \u9ad8\u5c45 High place to be, \u9df9\u5c45 hawks place to be (nest) which is at least a placename. And Yuki a conjunction of Yuku, to go, is a common given name for both boys and more often girls. It is written with other characters to give it other meanings but it puns on \u201cgoing.\u201d As for proper names of death itself, there is also Yominokuni, the country of death which probably originates in the yo of yoru meaning night, perhaps the country where one sees the night. The characters for Yomi mean literally, Yellowspring. There are people that call themselves this on the net but not as a real surname (afaik). ",
