            "answer_text": "Chetan Bhagat is mostly read by the school going teenagers and the college going youth of India. The characters of his novels and their problems are such that these readers can connect and identify with them. IITs and IIMs have always attracted them, and Chetan Bhagat's first novel, Five Point Someone talks about the life in IITs. Revolution 2020 presents two guys preparing for IITs falling for the same girl. The one who gets IIT also gets the girl. His second novel, Two States present the picture of IIMs. Moreover, it also speaks about overcoming the social divisions, in order to arrange a love marriage, which is a common concern of the young Indian couples. Then there is One Night at the Call Centre and Three Mistakes of my Life. Both of them are typical tales of love, friendship and professional aspirations. So, in a way the characters of Chetan Bhagat are representative figures of the Indian youth. So, to some extent he is right when he calls himself a writer of Indian youth. His works are simple in language and plot, without any complexity and ambiguity. Another important point is that his books are pocket friendly. They cost you less than half of the books of the big names like Amitav Ghosh and Jhumpa Lahiri. Chetan Bhagat scores only in his choice of subjects. But his treatment of these subjects is absolutely average. This is where he proves to be undeserving of the name and fame he has achieved. He writes what sells. His books are mere stories and lack artistic quality of the greats. But for the uninitiated readers literary merit is secondary and their primary concern is entertainment. So, Chetan Bhagat sells. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it is fun to read. There are some books which are difficult to understand. You have to read the same chapter again to basically understand what the author is trying to convey. These kind of novels impact you, stay with you for a very long time. Chetan Bhagat\u2019s books are very different. His books are very easy to read, he has a good sense of humor and his characters are created in such a way that their one-liners can make you laugh in places you least expect. In an early morning flight or late night when you are not feeling sleepy and you feel you need a small dose of reading to ease your mind, Ayn Rand or Milan Kundera will definitely not be a choice. You need something light, Chetan Bhagat\u2019s books fit the requirement there very conveniently. His books do not stay with you. There are no ground-breaking thoughts or chapters that makes you go, \u201cWhoa! I never thought of that thing in that way\u201d. But his books are fun. Maybe he is not the \u201cyouth icon\u201d as portrayed generally but he is a good story teller. His books are like a rom-com movie that entertains you when you are in the theater but you forget all about it once you are back home. BUT his books are definitely not those movies you wish will get over before interval. ",
