            "answer_text": "It really depends. Let me clarify that there is no \u201caverage\u201d pay for freelance writing. There are literally unlimited niches and types of freelance writing and the average pay for each of these depends on: the amount of research neededstructural workdescriptive languagevocabularyargumentsconclusionsintegral depthAs well as organisational factors such as: academic citationsimagescaptionstitlessubtitlesThe list goes on. Instead of giving you an average, I can go over a few of the thresholds for different writing rates and what they mean. Typically a rate of 5 cents per word is respectable as a minimum payment for any and all kinds of writing. It may be high pay for a very simple piece of work, for example articles or scripts about common sense or common knowledge topics, or very low pay for complex technical work, such as science papers and engineering manuals.This is why 10 cents per word is often suggested as the minimum for technical writing. To me, this sounds like a fair idea. Some topics require a deep level of knowledge and a skilled specialist writer.Just because 5 and 10 cents per word are the generally accepted minimum wages for writers in simple and technical writing does not always mean that they are acceptable, and absolutely does not mean that they are the suggested wages.My rates are 10 to 20 cents per word. These rates reflect my skills and abilities as a writer, and fairly compensate me for the time and effort (and occasional research cost, although I am usually reimbursed for research materials) that the work takes. I\u2019m working on marketing myself towards larger clients all the time and usually I propose rates higher than my 10\u201320 cents per word average. I expect that after the current summer sales slump ends, my rates will increase as they usually do at that time of the year.People\u2019s perception of prices and opinions on what is and isn\u2019t a good rate varies so much. I was once told by an author friend of mine that I was pricing myself at a rather inexpensive level with my 10\u201320 cents per word rate. Around the same time, I was giving advice to a fellow freelance writer who was seeking my advice and he told me that 5 cents per word is \u201can amazing rate\u201d.Needless to say, I told the beginner freelance writer that he was wrong. I can accept opinions about prices but his use of \u201camazing rate\u201d suggests to me that his clients are exploiting him, or that he does not fully understand the value of his work and is consequently pricing himself low, which is sad. To some writers, 5 cents per word might be good. But it\u2019s never amazing.One of the reasons why writers are setting lower rates for themselves and failing to understand the value of what they do is because the gig economy is destroying the freelance economy. Note that these are, and should be, separate entities. The gig economy is generally flawed, and although it is possible for some people to erk out a living from the gig economy, it is, on a whole, plagued with a number of problems, greatest of which is the disrespect towards fair rates for freelancers. The prices offered by the gig economy for freelance work are often 3\u201310 times cheaper than what the freelance economy will offer. Writer\u2019s rates in particular are dropping fast. The worst I\u2019ve ever seen is someone offering to do 10,000 words for $10. It kind of breaks my heart, because their work is probably (most likely) worth way more than that. In my opinion, the gig economy is ruining everybody and is best left dead.Many writers like to set and enforce very strong boundaries for their rates in order to only work with the very best and high-paying clients. Which is completely fair, and is usually a good tactical move. However, when some so-called pro writer arrogantly toots their horn and boasts that they have never charged less than 50 cents per word and when clients ask them for lower rates they tell them to f*** off, firstly, it\u2019s BS, secondly, it\u2019s rude, and last but not least, it\u2019s BS and rude mixed in an ugly concoction of lies and disrespect with a garnish of BS. Lol. Don\u2019t lie to people.",

            "answer_text": "Ah, the pricing problem. We consultants struggle to hit upon that rate that doesn\u2019t turn potential clients away but that pays our bills and leaves something in our pockets. Remember this, if nothing else: you must be able to pay your bills. I hope to offer some advice here to keep newer professionals or those considering a writing career from making some painful mistakes. I\u2019ve been writing and editing professionally for 16 years, and I still revisit this universal issue periodically. I don\u2019t charge by the word. I did once, long ago. But I won\u2019t do it again. Per-word contracts are often handed out by clients that seek to take advantage of budding, and often young, talent, or by clients that neither understand what goes into effective writing nor appreciate its value. Both are unpleasant to work for. The per word rate is usually relatively few cents or the equivalent in another currency. Editing services often charge by the word, though that\u2019s another story. Content factories frequently pay low per-word rates and sometimes expect you to churn out thousands of words per day. Unless your research constitutes intellectual property theft (scraping other websites), it involves reviewing several sources and takes significant time. What about meetings with the marketing department? If writing digital copy, what about keyword analyses? Interviews? Transcribing quotes? Structuring cogent arguments? Revisions to hone the quality of your work? None of these activities are typically considered in your per-word rate. Of course, you could charge $1 or more per word to accurately reflect time spent and value created, but many clients would balk at such a proposition, or find this billing model strange. Choose another route. Respectfully, I am troubled by some of the answers to this question. The idea of charging $5, give or take, for 300 words is simply outrageous. Think about what this means: 1.67 cents per word. Not many can survive on that\u2014at least not where I live and have lived, in Europe and the US. But not everyone lives in high GDP regions, right? This is an important point. Yes, the online gig economy makes creative services available for pennies, largely because the marketplace has become truly global. If you want to compete on price with alleged professionals from all corners of the world, you will lose. You will be competing with people in countries where a $5 daily income goes far enough (hey, maybe that\u2019s you). What they offer is an extremely low price. So don\u2019t compete on price. Compete on quality and results instead. And the good news? The vast majority of those offering writing services for ridiculously low prices are poorly skilled writers that deliver low-quality work. If you have a relevant eduction, or better yet, innate skill, and are willing to work hard and continue learning to improve your abilities, you will be able to offer a much better product than most\u2026and charge a much higher rate than some purported global average. This will take some time. But to get at numbers for a starting point: research what your market (market, not just industry) pays for services. This means you have to go beyond Quora. Talk to people who work in your desired writing niche(s): copywriters, content writers, technical writers, etc., who live where your target customers do. Talk to businesses in the region to get an idea of what they pay for services like yours\u2014you might be surprised at what they are willing to tell you. Look online for any competitors in the region who provide pricing on their websites, and compare their work history and client lists with your own. Scale your rates accordingly, whether you charge an hourly rate, a project rate, or bill in another manner. If you want to break into the writing industry, consider keeping another full-time job and performing some writing projects for free for non-profits or friends\u2019 businesses to create a portfolio. You might ask, \u201cIf I object to charging extremely low rates, why would I work for free?\u201d Because you need experience and concrete examples of what you can do before you can charge a reasonable professional rate and expect to get it. If you want to charge very low rates in the beginning of your career to get the same experience and build a portfolio, you can, but know that this sets a dangerous precedent for what those clients will expect in the future. Or, you can try to get a job working for a company that will train you and give you experience before you launch out on your own. Whatever you charge clients, you have to consider that you will spend much of your time marketing yourself and hustling to get new business, especially early in your career. And you will likely not have jobs coming in all day, every day. There are naturally periods of higher and lower activity, and as a freelancer, you don\u2019t get paid when you\u2019re sick or on vacation. You only get paid when you produce. Consider your costs. Outside of basic living expenses, you should expect to pay for your own computer hardware and various software tools to help you do your job better. You must consider taxes or get a nasty surprise when they are due. Determine what weekly or monthly income is sufficient for you to cover all of your expenses, how many hours of paid work you reasonably think you can get per month for the near future, and determine what you need to charge per hour or word (if you wish). Does this equal only a few pennies per word? The answer is likely a resounding \u201cno.\u201d Consider the impact that your writing project will have on your client\u2019s business. Could your thoroughly researched and well-written article of 1200 words generate 5,000 views to the company website, and ultimately bring in 250 new leads? Yes. Is that worth more than $20? You bet it is. Don\u2019t sell yourself short. This answer is 1104 words long. At even 10\u00a2 per word, I would be paid $110.40. That seems like some money. But is it worth it to me to have written it for that, taking into account the value of my time, taxes (around 50% in Sweden, where I live), and other expenses? If instead of basing my answer on personal experience, I needed to research it for two hours before setting fingers to keyboard? If to make it search-friendly, I had spent another 20 minutes researching keywords? No. Is it worth my time to have helped other writers from going broke or getting used by companies who undervalue them? Absolutely. ",
