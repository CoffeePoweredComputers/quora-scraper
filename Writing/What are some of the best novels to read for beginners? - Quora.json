            "answer_text": "I find this question both inane and offensive (somewhat). The OP has given almost no information about themselves - age, cultural background, education, interests etc - all of which factor into the kind of novels one would like.   Do you like science fiction? Try one of the 3 greats of Sci-fi literature - Asimov, Heinlein, and Clarke. Also throw in some Douglas Adams and Philip K Dick in there.Or specifically dystopian fiction? Fahrenheit 451, 1984, Battle Royale, The Children of Men?Are you a horror addict? Dive into the numerous works of Stephen King - Carrie, Dreamcatcher, The Stand, Salem's Lot, Misery. Also, explore the works of Poe, HP Lovecraft and Bram Stoker (especially Bram Stoker's Dracula)Or a romantic? You could start with Nicholas Sparks' works.Would you like to learn about History? If yes, what aspect of it? Ancient, medieval or modern? Focus on the rise of civilization or their demise? The great wars? Or the journals of interesting and historically significant people?Or read a few classics? Pick up Shakespeare, Dickens, Austen, Twain Fitzgerald, Tolstoy et al.Do you wanna build a snowman, er...I mean fantasy world? How about reading Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion, A Song of Ice and Fire, Malazan, The Dark Tower Series, The Inheritance Trilogy, and The Wheels of Time saga?Or indulge in some Young Adult fiction? Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, Divergent series, The Hunger Games, etcThe point is there are millions of books already written. Some of them are good, some are not. Some of them are easy, some are not. Some of them have prerequisites - certain things you need to know before reading them - and some don't. Some are meant to be read on a rainy afternoon with a cup of tea, and some with your laptop ready, to understand what is being said. Some would appeal to the child in you, and some to the skeptic adult.  So, figure out what you want to read. And then search for \"best <insert genre/style> books to read.\" ",
