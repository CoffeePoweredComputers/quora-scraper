            "answer_text": "Officially, Coca Cola first started using the word Coke in an advertising campaign back in 1941, and later copyrighted it in 1945. But it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the word wasn\u2019t already in usage before that. We have a habit of shortening words, and nicknaming them long before the Big Bosses get around to acknowledging them. ",

That began an entire ad campaign in which we connected the names \u201cCoke\u201d and \u201cCoca-Cola.\u201d We actually said that \u201cCoke means Coca-Cola\u201d and told people it was OK to use just \u201cCoke.\u201d Source : Coke means Coca-Cola ",
