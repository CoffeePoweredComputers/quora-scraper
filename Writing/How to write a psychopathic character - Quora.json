            "answer_text": "Some observations that might be helpful. Their thought process does not involve emotions. Thus they do not do what they feel is right, but what they think is right. This may make them more logical, but skewed thinking is still possible.They appear to have a belief system, but instead of believing in these things, they act as thought they know them to be absolute truths.They often don a social mask. If they are mask wearers, they do not remove them. Thus they seem like normal everyday people until you get close enough analyze their behavior patterns.Convinced of their rectitude, they often seek to wield power over others who do not follow their guidelines, or to bring people within their guidelines. This may be done in a clumsy manner, or in an extremely sophisticated manner that acknowledges other people\u2019s ability to do as they please. If they are clumsy, they are unlikely to also be sophisticated and vice versa.Athena Walker is an example of a sophisticated psychopath, while my mother-in-law is an example of a clumsy one. She complains constantly about everything except her own shortcomings, which are entirely ignored, promotes her moral rectitude (part of her belief system is that she\u2019s not only right, but morally right as well), and says things like \u201cWould you like to do the dishes?\u201d and \u201cGo get the paddle.\u201d, thus forcing her victim into becoming an accomplice and punish themselves. She got a masters degree in social work so that she could prove her theory that Satan is behind mental disorders, but made the mistake of sharing her workspace with a sane person who would not tolerate her desire for control. Now this venture is never spoken of. I am not an expert. These are merely my observations of one person\u2019s behavior. ",

            "answer_text": "You unfortunately haven\u2019t provided enough information for me to be able to give you any direction. A large part of it is what tense are you writing in and is she your main character? If she is a subsidiary character you would describe her one way, if this is told from her perspective as though this was her story, that is quite another. You also have much more to decide on when it comes to who she is. You have describes what she isn\u2019t. To be honest, that\u2019s non too helpful. Great, she\u2019s not a killer, glad you got the memo, please don\u2019t take offense. However, that doesn\u2019t tell me what kind of personality she has. That is tremendous part of being able to give direction. Psychopathy is not the main part of who I am, it is a peripheral thing. Yes, it affects everything I do in some form or another, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is the primary focus of my life. The same would be true of your character. As to where to find information on it, it is difficult. You have chosen to write abut a female. There is not a lot known about female psychopaths. The ratio of male to female psychopaths is estimated at 20:1. The reason that I believe that there is so much disparity in the numbers is that it is less assumed in females than males. It is more likely to not be considered as females are meant to be nurtures. It is also thought that the traits present differently. I am not so sure about that. There are certainly aspects of being female that change what we are capable of. Males can be more aggressive for instance, they have they physical strength to make that possible. That doesn\u2019t mean that if our physicality weren\u2019t different that we wouldn\u2019t be as aggressive. You can look into psychopathic researchers like Dr. Joseph Newman, Professor Kevin Dutton, or Dr. James Fallon. They are doing excellent work in the realm of psychopathy. Avoid Robert Hare. He dislikes psychopaths and his work reflects that. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. ",
