            "answer_text": "Illegal? Probably not. Academically dishonest, and possibly in violation of the policies of whoever asked for the essay? Maybe. \u201cHelped you write it\u201d is a phrase that covers a multitude of actions. If I am a student and my parents went to the library to get all of the books that I might need, but I did all of the reading/writing on which the essay is based, then I definitely do not think that they need to be credited. If someone else did all the research and writing, and I just put my name on it, then clearly that is academically dishonest. There is a continuum of assistance in between. If it is a commercial essay, that you have submitted to a magazine or newsletter, or have posted on a website, then the easiest thing to do is to assign appropriate credit. Depending on the level of assistance provided, this can be a joint writing credit (by [a] and [b]) or a credits paragraph at the end of the essay (e.g. \u201cthe writer would like to thank [a], who provided the information about [topic x] which appears in this article\u201d). The fundamental rule is that it is wrong to pass someone else\u2019s work off as your own. This is true in school, in business, in science and in life. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not (at present) illegal. The ethics of the thing will vary depending on what \u201chelp\u201d the other person gave you. I say \u201cat present\u201d, by the way, since I know some countries are looking at bringing in laws against so-called \u201ccontract cheating\u201d. That\u2019s usually more along the lines of someone writing the entire thing for you, but the principle holds. To go back to the point about \u201csomeone helping you\u201d, it really depends. It\u2019s usually a good idea to have another pair of eyes look at your work every now and again to pick up on spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, redundancies, and so on. That\u2019s a kind of \u201chelp\u201d, but it\u2019s the kind you should take advantage of. My entire Honours thesis, for example, was read cover-to-cover by at least five different people, each of whom made suggestions, some of which brought about alterations to the final document. Such parts of my PhD thesis which exist at present have been read by four or so people already - and my advisor has read some parts at least five times already. Poor him\u2026 Alternatively, if you mean that someone actually wrote the essay for you, that\u2019s a different game, and a bad idea. You don\u2019t want to go claiming that someone else\u2019s work is yours. It ends badly. ",
