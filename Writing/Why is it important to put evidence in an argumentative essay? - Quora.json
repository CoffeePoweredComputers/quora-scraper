            "answer_text": "Argumentation is pretty much one person trying to change another\u2019s mind using a string of logic, personal values, and evidence. Evidence is key because it applies the reasoning you are providing to what other\u2019s influential and expert minds have said or shows how your reasoning affected the world by showing a cause and effect relationship. It also increased the credibility of your own reasoning because it is echoing the minds that have been accepted as being experts in the field. When I teach my classes, I teach them the concepts of: Logos: Reasoning/Evidence that promotes logic/cause and effect Pathos: Reasoning/Evidence that promotes values and elicits an emotional response Ethos: Reasoning/Evidence that supports your ability to argue or gives credibility to your argument through like-statements made by experts/influential minds in the field. Telos: The purpose of the argument. This reasoning or evidence that is used to present the main idea or sharpen the focus of the points of the arguments. Kairos: The perfect timing, or drop the mic moments. This done by using each reasoning and evidence to build a case, and then finally making sure the last reasoning and evidence is the final nail in the coffin that contains your opposition.  Other than Telos (purpose) and Kairos (Timing) Logos, Pathos and Ethos all can be backed up with evidence. Evidence from Logos will seek to back up reasoning with evidence that is logical in nature, cause and effect. Evidence from Pathos will be evidence that is factual, but also appeals to the values of humanity as it pertains to your purpose (Telos) and evidence from Ethos will back up your reasoning to increase the weight of your argument because you have used facts that are presented by ultra credible sources so as to make sure that your argument is not just the spouting of your opinion. To answer your question about why it is important to use evidence involves what I touched upon above as well another factor: Credibility via breadth of Knowledge by other experts. By including evidence from a broad spectrum of knowledge from different credible sources, it strengthens your argument because more than on expert in the field is supporting what you are trying to say. Having more professional and influential minds supporting your argument is always better than having no support. I hope this helps you out! ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the assignments you will do in university will ask you to make an argument, to take a stance, or to prove a hypothesis. And this is mostly do in doing argumentative essay. The best way to do this is to research the topic, develop a thesis statement, hypothesis, or claim and then use evidence to support this claim. It is important to put evidence in an argumentative essay because it lends credibility to your argument or claim. Without evidence, you appear uninformed, and your argument is weak. Like a building without a strong foundation, an argument without evidence will crumble. ",
