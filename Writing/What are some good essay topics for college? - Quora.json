            "answer_text": "I have crafted this answer using what I have heard from fellow students who have applied for UK/US universities and forums I have been reading, so do take this with a pinch of salt. Honestly, it depends. Some colleges have requirements which they would expect to be fulfilled in your essays. Say, they would want you to talk about how your high school experience has been packaged. In other news, they would want to know how the various activities you have participated in such as (but not limited to) extra-curricular activities: sports/aesthetics/clubs, volunteer service, leadership andon the academic front: research programmes, work experience (internships) andother skills which you may possess: coding, public speaking, bilingualism, etc.And how the confluence of talents come together to demonstrate your interest / passion in the subject area you are applying for. These many bullets are expected to prove you to be holistic, well rounded yet be the best option (in the sense, despite being multi-talented, you have done things to show your interest in a particular field) for the course you have chosen. E.g. Engineering \u2014 being well versed in Coding and Arduino (of course, this is a very general example. For specific engineering courses, say CS, knowledge in certain languages may be imperative). is likely to give you an edge. Now, they don\u2019t want you to list what you have done. Because, very well, they can read it via your Curriculum Vitae. Be insightful in the information you provide. How have these very experiences and programmes shaped you as a person, and how will this person that you have been groomed into cater to be an Engineering student that fits the Institution\u2019s ideals, and how will this person impact the wider community? Otherwise, if it is any topic where you have total freedom (this is good as it does not constrain you to specific parameters, but be careful not to deviate from your purpose of writing the essay)\u2026 Write about something that shows who you are as a person, that talks about your passion. Remember it is a personal statement, a reflective essay that is supposed to convince them that you would be the best person for the vacancy. Best - academically, and personally (as can be seen through your character: leadership, service) and any other skills which can boost your portfolio. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on what your instructor allows and what you can find research on. But there are a few things to keep in mind when picking your topic. Are you passionate in the topic you chose? Does it relate to you? Why do you care about the topic so much?Try to make it a social issue, a problem in societyI\u2019m an aspiring game designer, so my first essay was, \u201cHow Crunch Time affects the game industry, and how does it affect the health of the developers\u201d. Not only is this topic about something I find interest in (Being an avid gamer and a game designer) but it\u2019s also an issue within the video game industry. But also keep in mind what research you\u2019ll be able to find. I was lucky with my instructor and he didn\u2019t even care about what font we used, much less the research, his focus was writing a good essay. But others instructors may want upwards to 3\u201310 sources. But all in all, you want something you can relate too, something you can divide into 3 separate points, and something you\u2019ll be able to find a decent amount of research for. ",
