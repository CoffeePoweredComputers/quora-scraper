            "answer_text": "According to Wikipedia: \u201cYoung adult fiction (YA) is a category of fiction written for readers from 12 to 18 years of age. While the genre is targeted to adolescents, approximately half of YA readers are adults. The subject matter and genres of YA correlate with the age and experience of the protagonist.\u201d While different book publishers may have various age groups into which they slot their acquisitions, most adhere pretty closely to Wikipedia\u2019s age range, mostly for the benefit of their sales departments. Book marketers and sales folks have to know to which age range a book is geared in order to sell that book to a store our online outlet. It\u2019s important to note that YA books aren\u2019t necessarily fiction OR nonfiction but can be either. Although the subject matter for YA books is wide open, the majority of YA\u2019s appeal to those areas in life that cause pre-adolescents and teens the most concern, including sex, drugs, alcohol, and family life. Surprise, surprise! Some of the category-bending attributes of a YA that might entice adult readers to jump onboard include advanced subjects as well as the main character\u2019s advanced level of social awareness, experience, and activity. In other words, if you have a YA as your main character and he/she is more aligned with adult circumstances and development, adults are more likely to pick up and read the book. That\u2019s true even with the sappiest (oops, did I say that?) and least \u201cmature\u201d examples of tween-sex series such as Nancy Drew and Trixie Belden. Often, adults will pick up and read a YA simply because they\u2019re often easier to read than adult books, faster paced, and shorter. Oh, and did I mention \u201cmore fun\u201d? One special note of caution for developing writers in search of their first book sales: Contrary to popular opinion, YA\u2019s are NOT easier to write than adult books. Just because the level of sophistication may be somewhat lower than for adult books doesn\u2019t make them a walk through the park for a writer. In fact, knowing what interests YA readers these days is not always easy for an adult to determine, and wording the book to a certain educational reading level can be trying. Still, for YA writers who really want to make a difference in the world by influencing their reading audiences from a young age on, YA\u2019s are definitely worth considering. Hope this helps. ",
