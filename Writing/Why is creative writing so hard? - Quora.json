            "answer_text": "It really can be hard, especially when You're just starting out, or starting a new story or other work. To me, fiction was the most intimidating at first, but we spin fictional stories in our heads CONSTANTLY, like how we think our boyfriend is flirting with that girl we hate and they're probably going to have a baby and the baby is going to look like a monster, but they'll probably love it anyway, they're so stupid, and they will move away to some island, but not a beautiful island, like the bahamas, some cold rocky island and they will eat eels all the time, and grow eelish looking, because they never see the sun... You see what I mean. Most of us just make up the Best or most accidentally hilarious or horrific stories in our minds all the time, but we feel free to do it, because we know that no one else ever has to know how our sneaky little brains work. They're genious!(I'm not saying my eel story was genious, though, but I could actually work on it to the end and it would be pretty good) My writing was always instantly recognizable to my best teachers, I thought because it was bad, but it was because it was filtered through my own mind, which is different. Thats a good thing. Just take it one step at a time for a story or two, Promise yourself that no one will ever see them. You can create a cast of characters as if you are writing a play. Many writers \"learn \" everything about every character. Even the minor ones. Like \"Mrs. Blanket, the maid, saw a man murdered when she was 8 years old. It never really effected her, strangely. Her favorite body powder is Calumet. It reminds her of that summer she almost got asked out. She doesn't really envy her wealthy employers, the Duvets, as much as she hates them. She would hate them if she just saw them walking down the street. But Mrs. Blanket did indeed need money. Didn't everyone?\"But I think the thing that Still worries me from time to time about \"writing a story\" is plot. Plot is not such a huge driver as it once was. True and interesting Characters , well just interesting, make stories best, I think. Newer fiction isn't NEARLY as plot driven as we might think. Try to think about some of your favorite movies. There is maybe half a plot if anything You can also just write a kind of a long vignette. (that would have an indie feel) But don't go for a feel or a style. Just play with the people in your brain but put it on paper, and for your own enjoyment, you could draw out little stick figures to illustrate it for yourself. Just have fun doing it, and if you do have fun, You might be on the New York Best Seller List Next Year. But don't think about ambition or fame at the same time you're writing, it just won't come out right. ",

            "answer_text": "Not as much as getting paid for creative writing\u2026 : I\u2019ve tried writing songs as well as hymns and poems and haven\u2019t given up on the whole idea of poetry after wrote had at little lot I knew I\u2019d never be willing to go through such experiences again. So, I\u2019d say that creative writing can become not only hard but more bitter than sweet as time drags on. I\u2019d not encourage any writer to keep at it when writing for weeks and months. I like to see brilliant writing completed and seeing it as being well-received, successful and getting its share of the profits, but, frankly, I don\u2019t get that impression after all these years. : I kept writing poetry because I enjoyed it and wanted to share it, too. If any other writer finds their writing experiences unpleasant, then that\u2019s because they may not be suited to extended writing projects after all. Painters can\u2019t complete every canvas on the same day but with a disciplined mind can persevere towards greater progress over time. Finally, they can\u2019t see anything left to add or take away. Writers can\u2019t always tell when they think the project is completely complete. A little edit here and things change later in a story as well. Where does it really all end? Poets can usually know that everything\u2019s worked out right. No need for additional verses, for example. So I believe that some writing is hard and may be so hard that it should be avoided or even abandoned. That\u2019s not what some writers would dare to say. But there it is, in black and white. As they say, be careful what you wish for\u2026 : ",
