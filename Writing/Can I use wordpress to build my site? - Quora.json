            "answer_text": "Yes it is entirely possible to build such a website. Ar\u016bnas Liuiza mentioned, you can use custom post types, taxonomies, post meta fields to define extra parameters.  There are some great membership plugins available for WordPress which will allow you to manage members, teams, etc. If it is a website that needs collaboration from teams, then there are also many plugins that will help you do that.  As for search, I would recommend that you build your own search utility that allows users to search by attributes. you can also use Google Site Search feature. If it is possible you can add a meta box at the end of your posts/articles which contains information like category, time, location, people involved, summary, details, reports Then use a php form which allows user to pick any of these options from a drop down menu and type a search term.Example:  Bottom of your post has: Category: News and MediaTime: 12:59 03/26/2012location: NYC, NYPeople Involved: Mark Smith, Sara Black Now a site visitor picks up people involved and types Mark Smith. your script takes them to google site search looking for \"People Involved\"+\"Mark Smith\". I know its not ideal but it will work.  It will be best if you hire a professional developer. You can do it yourself too. but a professional developer with experience will be able to tie things together more perfectly. This will create a better user experiences and a better website. ",

            "answer_text": "An experienced developer could build you a site like this in WordPress. Content with custom atributes can be done using custom post types and post meta fields.Built in search functionality in WordPress is not very powerful, so this area will require more customization, but it is also possible.As for membership, there are ready-made plugins (http://www.wilsonmattos.com/wordpress-membership-plugins-list-comparison-reviews), a custom system can also be built on top of WordPress native roles system. What payment processor are you planning to use?To sum up, it is definitely achievable, but you should look for an experienced developer, with good understanding of inner workings of the system. ",

If you do decide to hire a Professional, based on my personal experiences I would recommend you to ensure that the developer fully understands the workflow of the business and how a typical website user would use the website. In fact documentation for the requirements of the website should be created for everyone's clarity. ",
