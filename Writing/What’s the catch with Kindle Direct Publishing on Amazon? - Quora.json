            "answer_text": "The \u201ccatch\u201d is to write a good book, then have it edited and proofread by these 2 different professionals. Spend time (and $) on a professional cover design, write (buy-$) a \u201ckiller\u201d blurb (stops the reader in their tracks-thinking I have to read this book.) DIY covers from KDP stick out (as awful) compared to professionally designed covers. If your book isn\u2019t selling\u2014problems with cover, blurb, ads. KDP Select requires selling (e-books) thru Amazon exclusively. Love or hate Amazon, they are the 10,000 pound gorilla in the room. They account for 80+% of all books sold. The revenue I get from KU page-reads pays for my AMS promos, which means the e-book/print sales are profit. If Amazon didn\u2019t have Amazon Ads (formerly AMS) I\u2019d be less enthusiastic about KDP. AMS generates 80% of my book sales. For me, AMS is better than FB and BB for finding readers who click the \u201cbuy\u201d button. Finally, KDP revenues. If an author signs with an agent and then lands a contract with a Big-5 publisher, the author earns less than 15% of sales and add-ons. If an Indie author does the above in editing, proofing,etc., the author receives 70% of the royalties. In another post, we can discuss Publishers expectations of what the author must do to promote their book (It ain\u2019t a free ride.) KDP is what an author makes of it. I spend 4-hrs/day writing and 4-hrs/day promoting my books (AMS ads, BB ads, FB ads, writing new copy, and keeping social media contacts current (Showing my face regularly.) It\u2019s a job! There are no benefits, no sick-days, and no vacation days. KDP is what you make of it, and right now, it\u2019s working for me. ",

            "answer_text": "The catch is this: IT\u2019S WORK. I\u2019m an internationally-bestselling indie author, and have been doing this full time for nearly a decade. Before that I was a partner at a Los Angeles law firm. Everything you\u2019ve heard about how much lawyers work is true. That said, I work twice as hard as an author. Additionally, most people who \u201cwant to be a writer\u201d actually just want to write the first thing that comes to mind, then put their feet up and let money rain in on them. It doesn\u2019t work that way. Just about every successful author I know worked two jobs for a decade or so: their day job (paying the bills) and their second FULL-TIME job as an author. Consider it like an intensive graduate program, or going to medical school while working a second job to pay your way. If bent over the table with a doctor behind you who was putting on a rubber glove, and you asked, \u201cSo, where did you go to med school?\u201d and the doctor replied, \u201cNever did, but I went to a crappy doctor once and I figured \u2018I can do THAT,\u2019\u201d you would be out of there so fast the Vaseline would fly off his glove. But that\u2019s exactly the attitude most would-be professionals take toward self-publishing. It is hard. It is work. You have to have a great story, a great cover, a great product description, and then be willing to burn the midnight oil for years. Final word of advice: your first book sucks. So does your second one, and most likely your third, fourth, and fifth. Practice. Don\u2019t get good, get GREAT. Because that\u2019s the only way people will look at your work next to Stephen King or Brandon Sanderson or whoever\u2026 and will want to buy yours. check out my Amazon page at http://amazon.com/author/michaelbrentcollings ",
