            "answer_text": "There are two ways of naming the large numbers. The short-scale always multiplies by one thousand. That is the American system, now adopted in the UK, and widely used in maths and science. 1,000,000 = million. 1,000,000,000 = billion. 1,000,000,000,000 = trillion. 1,000,000,000,000,000 = quadrillion. And so on. Three extra zeros at each step. The long-scale always multiplies bu one million. That is used in continental Europe, Spanish-speaking Americas, and sometimes in Canada 1,000,000 = million. 1,000,000,000,000 = billion. 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 = trillion. 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 = quadrillion. Six extra zeros at each step. The French and Germans call 1,000,000,000 a milliard, and 1,000,000,000,000,000 a billiard. If you think this is complicated, try the Indian and Chinese numeral systems!

No. You only get 1 from points: Thousand ([math]10^3[/math]) thousands is a million ([math]10^6[/math]). A million millions is a trillion (short scale) or billion (long scale) ([math]10^{12}[/math]) A billion billions (short scale [math]10^9[/math]) is a quintillion (short scale) or a trillion (long scale) ([math]10^{18}[/math]). A billion billions (long scale [math]10^{12}[/math]) is septillion (short scale) or a quadrillion (long scale) ([math]10^{24}[/math]). Names of large numbers - Wikipedia ",
