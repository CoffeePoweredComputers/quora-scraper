            "answer_text": "I've seen the Taj Mahal. What does \"I've\" mean? I\u2019ve is short of I have. I have seen Taj Mahal. While writing or even speaking some words are used with contraction. A contraction means a shortened form of a word (or group of words) that omits certain letters or sounds. In most contractions, an apostrophe represents the missing letters. The most common contractions are made up of verbs, auxiliaries, or modals attached to other words: He would=He'd. I have=I've. They are=They're. Did not = Didn\u2019t and so on. ",
