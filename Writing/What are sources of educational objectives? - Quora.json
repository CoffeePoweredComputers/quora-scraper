            "answer_text": "Objectives are the milestones to reach the destination i.e. to attain the aim or ultimate goal of education. Objectives are specific, direct and practical in nature. The objectives are meant for both the teacher and the students. Even at the planning stage i.e. before entering the classroom the teacher asks himself, \u201cwhat changes in the behaviour of the students can I bring about through this lesson\u201d? Such changes constitute his (teacher\u2019s) educational objectives. An objective is thus: 1. A point or an end-view of something towards which action is directed; 2. A planned change sought through an activity; 3. What we set out to do. Types of Objectives: 1. Educational Objectives: Educational objectives, therefore, consist of the changes we wish to produce in the child. If education imparted to a student is effective, he will \u2018behave\u2019 differently from the way he did before he came to the school. The student would know something about which he was ignorant earlier. He would understand something which he did not understand before He can solve problems which he could not solve before. He favourably revises his attitudes towards things. (ii) Instructional Objectives: The objectives of teacher and students are called instructional objectives. In this context, an objective is a statement of measurable learning that is intended to take place as a result of instruction. Instructional objectives are derived from the terminal behaviours the students are excepted to display as a consequence of receiving instruction.
