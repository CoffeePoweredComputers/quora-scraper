            "answer_text": "It really depends. I have been doing writing sprints this past week (I only learned what they were about a week ago and I love them), and I can write between 700\u2013750 words in 30 minutes. By that measure, theoretically it would only take me about, let\u2019s round up, about ten hours to write 10,000 words. But that might be because I\u2019m currently at the end of my manuscript, I know my characters, and I\u2019ve dot-point planned out the last few chapters. I doubt I would be as efficient for my first ten thousand words. That being said, my first novel was 169,000 words and it took me ten years to write. The reason for the slow pace was that I would work on it for a few weeks, and then shelf it for a few months (I think one time I left it for over a year). Each time I came back to the project, I read/ edited what I had before adding to the story. When I was writing my children\u2019s Christmas story (a lower-grade novel for kids in years 1\u20134), I wrote 16,000 words in five evenings after the children were in bed. My deadline was to get the project done before Christmas. I finished at midnight Christmas Eve. For me, my speed depends on: How well I know the charactersHow well I know what is is going to happen in the story (I tend to be a pantser until I get into the story and figure out what\u2019s happening, then it all flows much more quickly).If you have to do a lot of research for your essay, this will definitely blow out the time needed for the project. Usually the research takes more time than the actual writing of the essay. While you can probably write a 10,000 word essay in ten hours, it may take you several months if you factor in your research and planning. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m totally undisciplined. There, I admitted it. Last night I worked until midnight on organizing the second half of my current WIP, a second memoir. The first 25K went so fast I was super excited. Less than a week\u2014to answer your question. A goal for many is 2500 words per day. Then I stalled\u2014completely. Dead, distracted. I watched the three Bourne movies on Netflix and two Oceans movies that I\u2019d missed on the big screen while living in Mexico. Next, I began to outline Code Raven 8. I have a rough idea of the key characters but a very fuzzy concept. The Plot Gods are not doing their job at all. Last night back to the memoir. Totally inflow. I took the notes down off my organizational wall, and everything became clearer. Today should be a writing day, but I have an unexpected guest who doesn\u2019t want me to write! And that works for me. So, to answer your question, 10K words can take a week or a month, or a couple of months. You need these three things. You can mix up the order. Passion Skill Discipline The most important is to have all three going on the same day! Good luck.  ",
