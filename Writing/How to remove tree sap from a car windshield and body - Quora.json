            "answer_text": "I have this problem all the time. It's near-impossible to avoid parking under trees where I live, and my wife's car usually occupies the garage. I tried the Turtle Wax Bug and Tar and the Goo Gone automotive version. I'd say Goo Gone works a little better but not great. Then I saw this video:  Top product was straightforward isopropyl alcohol or rubbing alcohol. Tried this, it works great! Downside, it also strips the wax from your paint. In fact some detailers do an isopropyl alcohol wipedown to make sure all wax or polish is removed in certain circumstances. So make a point of re-waxing the paint afterwards. You might also try a hand sanitizing gel (that contains alcohol) if you typically carry some in the car as I do. Good for removing sap from windows when out and about, but I don't like to use it on paint unless I'm also going to wash and wax. Any leftover mark on the paint can be removed with a little bit of auto detailing clay bar, before washing and waxing. ",

            "answer_text": "How long the sap has been there and the condition of the paint under the sap will play a role in how difficult it will be to remove. The first thing to do is to get a quality bug & tar remover (Turtle Wax, Chemical Guys, etc.). Use a microfiber towel (this will prevent scratches to the car paint) and the bug & tar remover, spot spray the sap and use the towel to remove. Keep at it. It may take time and/or effort and you may need to soak the sap in the bug & tar for a bit. If the bug & tar won\u2019t do it, try a different brand, or a stronger concentration (the Chemical Guys, for example, is to be diluted into water - the more you dilute the weaker it is, so try a less diluted concentration). If it still won\u2019t come off, you may have to resort to using something like a clay bar or a polisher. If you aren\u2019t comfortable with this, a car wash that does car detailing should be able to take care of it for you. Once the sap is gone, you will need to re-protect the paint. The bug & tar will remove any wax or sealant - you should reapply. ",
