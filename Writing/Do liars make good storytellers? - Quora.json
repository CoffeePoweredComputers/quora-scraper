            "answer_text": "The great ones sure do. Here\u2019s Rule #1: The power of storytelling rests in the specifics. Great storytellers are able to pack their stories with specifics that seduce the listener. Listen to the details of con men and serial killers \u2014 it\u2019s their most common attribute \u2014 the ability to seduce their audience with specifics. In fact, just last night on 60 Minutes they had a great segment on \u201cThe Theranos Deception\u201d \u2014 all about Elizabeth Holmes who built an entire billion dollar biotech company based on lies and fabrication. Every time she would get cornered she would dive into more specifics of all the breakthroughs they were having, seducing the skeptics with the specifics. The wheels have come off her cart, but not before spinning endless lies and even still she continues to raise money despite all the exposing of her fraud. Another perfect example of this trait is the popular recent 6 part podcast \u201cDirty John\u201d from the LA Times. That was exactly the deal with John \u2014 a con man from Orange County. He spun out lies that were so specific people couldn\u2019t help but believe them. You hear the women he seduced telling about this \u2014 they just couldn\u2019t believe what he was saying wasn\u2019t true \u2014 it was all so full of details and sounded so real and convincing. ",
