            "answer_text": "A novel is a complete and detailed story. Usually the novel is in a narrative form written from a particular point of view by either a character, or by the person telling the story. Often a novel is a lengthier story that would give deeper description which may personify objects to give them deeper meanings to the story\u2019s context. If we look at just size - short stories are usually stories that can be a page to about 80-pages in length and a novella is usually 80 to 120-pages and full blown novels are over 120-pages, with no upper limit, but within some reason. The difference between the formats has to do with how complicated and layered you wish your story to have. Creative writing usually encompassed the idea of short story. A book starts to be artistic at the novella length, and novels should be written in attempt to be seen as Literature. I have a textbook called Creative Process for Writers: A Reference available on Amazon which does cover such a question, and more. ",

            "answer_text": "The length is the main factor in deciding if a book is a novel. Generally, a novel will have a minimum of 50,000 words, give or take a few thousand words. Anything less than that is a novella, novelette, or short story. This length allows the writer a little luxury in settings, characterization, backstory, and so on. He can develop subplots, have flashbacks if he needs them, and can generally develop the story to a fuller extent than a short story. Also, a novel may have a character arc for the protagonist. He goes through experiences that allow him to overcome a character flaw during the course of the story. ",

            "answer_text": "I wrote short blog posts on this topic in year 2006: Literature \" khuram Below I am quoting relevant posts: 1- Difference between story and Novel: \u2018Story\u2019 is a description of some inter-related course of events that usually has a meaningful (happy or tragic) end. \u2018Novel\u2019 is different from \u2018story\u2019 in that it is not just description of \u2018events\u2019 because it also describes the details of environment plus the feelings, emotions and thinking of various characters. A good novel makes us feel that we are also a part of that environment. Some novels may not have any end. Story of novel proceeds slowly due to its details about environment etc. 2- Some Relations and Differences between Novel and Drama: Drama is more similar to Novel than with Story. In a story, the writer describes the events; in Novel, he also describes details of environment and thinking/ feeling of various characters. In Drama, \u2018environment\u2019 and \u2018thinking/ emotions\u2019 of characters are not \u2018described\u2019 but are \u2018presented\u2019. Environment is presented through stage design whereas thinking/ emotions of characters are presented through background music plus facial expressions etc. of actors (i.e. characters). A Story proceeds in the form of just description of interrelated course of events. Novel states the background of its story just like in short stories but rest of the proceedings is \u2018evolved\u2019 out of description of environment and interactions between characters. It means that author of a Novel doesn\u2019t tell all the story to readers because here readers have to understand the story proceedings out of the description of situations that are faced by characters as well as out of dialogues between those characters. In Drama, everything including background, emotions and dialogues between characters are not \u2018described\u2019 but are \u2018presented\u2019. All the story proceedings shall come out of dialogues between characters or even out of \u2018self-talking\u2019 of characters because this \u2018self-talking\u2019 technique is often used in Dramas with the view to \u2018present\u2019 the background of the story of Drama. Unlike a Novel, In Drama, even the relationship between characters is not described. Audience should understand the relationship between those characters just out of type of interaction between those characters or out of exchange of dialogues between them. 3- Doesn\u2019t a Novel become bore because story proceeding in a Novel is quite slow? Yes story proceedings have to be slow in novel. So if someone wants to enjoy the \u2018story\u2019, he/ she may really feel bore. But a novel reader is not supposed to find charms in the story of novel. Readers should find charms in the elucidation as well as beautiful elaboration of environment and feelings of characters. Different characters shall assume their own unique and consistent characteristics in novel. Readers should find charms in considering those characters as some lively beings whose possible behavior can be judged while reading the different situations of novel. For example consider the Asghari and Akbari characters of Novel Mirrat-ul-Aroos by Deputy Nazir Ahmed. Beauty of this novel is not in the story but lies in the opposing and contrasting qualities and characteristics of different characters. ",

If anyone can create a living soul from his mind of interpretation, if any could have it in his or her mind, then it is the spirit of a novelist and anyone who can it in the form of fascinating links of words, then a good novel is produced.
