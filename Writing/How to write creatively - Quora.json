            "answer_text": "Personally, I've found news articles to be slightly, well, drab and matter-of-fact (they're hardly made to be engaging anyway). The only way to write well is to read a lot. Find a few good blogs and/ or websites online (not talking about the ones that use emoticons in every sentence\u2014those won't help you). Read (well-written) fiction. Read The Economic Times, or The New York Times. They have great articles. Maybe even National Geographic (or any famous magazines in the US). Practise writing using different techniques you notice writers have used in the things you read. Highlight interesting word choices/ phrases and figure out ways to incorporate them in your own writing. Just being a passive reader won't help; you'll have to write proactively if you want to improve. Thanks for the A2A, and good luck! ",

So, here\u2019s what you can do; Start reading novels. And majorly read fiction. Any fiction. It will make you familiar with thousands of styles of writing along with various mind boggling stories and plots.While you are at it, write and write. Write whenever you can and about whatever you can. I, being an engineering student, wrote about legal and entrepreneur stuff and I still do sometimes. Such contrast help me with my general knowledge as well as my writing skills.A creative writer needs to know how to tell a story. In short, write about stuff that you can explain deeply and in a manner that attracts everyone to it.Finally, make sure you have some honest and strict critics for your work. Whatever you are writing, show it to your friends or family or teachers. Whoever you feel will judge your content in a true unbiased way. Take their suggestions in a positive manner. Never, and I mean never ever get offended when someone is judging your content for you.You will learn as you write. Be creative in your imagination and it will come down on your paper automatically with a little patience and practice daily. So, all the best. Happy Writing! PS: Thanks for the A2A, User ",

Trust me when i say this , people tend to ignore simple things in life such as the beauty of a sunrise . If you write about it , they will come to notice it and realize what they have been missing on . So creativity is all about mentioning things , which people don\u2019t . Go for it brother ! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Creative writing and content writing are two different styles completely in my opinion. For content writing, you have to be crisp and to informative, while creative writing gives you the luxury of spinning tales. A good way to conquer both would be to pick a neutral topic and write two sides to it. Say if you pick something like the current currency scenario: write an informative post as well as a story that revolves around the topic. Hope I helped :) Good luck! ",
