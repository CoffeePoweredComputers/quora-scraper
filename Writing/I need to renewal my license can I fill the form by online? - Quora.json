I can also renew my TV licence online, and probably many other types of licence too\u2026 But I have no idea where you are, nor what sort of licence you are talking about.

Maybe you\u2019d be better to ask whatever licencing authority handles your licence renewal - they will be able to give you an accurate answer. ",
