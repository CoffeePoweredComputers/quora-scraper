I am an author in wattpad and they told me that they\u2019ve found \u201cpotential\u201d in my story. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a scam but I\u2019ll try asking questions like; what story did they read that has the potential they\u2019re talking about, or why did they contact me? it also finds me suspicious if they even read my book. margaukie_ -my acc in wattpad, feel free to read my books (i\u2019m unconsciously promoting) ",
