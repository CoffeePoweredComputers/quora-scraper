            "answer_text": "There\u2019s something called \u201chistorical context\u201d and I personally believe that it comes with certain liberties as well as certain restrictions. The most obvious restriction is that it can only safeguard you in the event what you are writing is actually historical fiction. (I mean, historical fact works too, but you said this was a fictional novel). That means it takes place in the past and is to some extent historically accurate (by no means does it have to be TOTALLY accurate, people fudge up history in fiction all the time.) However, historical context can still be offensive if you use it the wrong way or if your setting/culture/race you are talking about is different/views things differently than the context you are using. For example, I am writing a book myself that takes place in Victorian Era England. Back then, black people in virtually all English speaking parts of the world were referred to as Negroes. However, the connotations of that word back in those days wasn\u2019t nearly as hostile or offensive as it is taken to be now. In England, for instance, it was just a word for coloured people. When it fell out of favour in the 1880\u2019s, no one missed it because in England, slavery had been abolished for a good 30 years prior to the American Civil War. So in England, at the time, using the word Negro to reference a black man wasn\u2019t seen as particularly offensive unless you used it that way. (which hardly ever happened except with older families and generations; however, black people were fairly uncommon in England, so they often got stares or almost-innocent people asking what a Negro was doing in England \u2014 not in the sense of \u201cget out of our country\u201d but \u201cwhy the hell are you here, we never see your kind\u201d type sense. Cultural relations. They\u2019re important.). In America, in the same time period, the Civil War was happening. So a lot more cultural sensitivity to the word Negro. If, for example, a pageboy called out on a black man asking the same as above, (\u201cwhat are you doing in XYZ?\u201d) it would be taken to be \u201cyou aren\u2019t welcome here\u201d as opposed to \u201cWhere the hell did you come from?\u201d. Again, cultural relations. But by and large, for nobility in particular, it was strangely okay to call a black person a Negro, so long as it wasn\u2019t used in a name-calling or derogatory way. For the upper class especially, the word Negro was pretty much just that \u2014 a word. Assuming you are writing about a story in America, historical context does give you a lot of wiggle room for derogatory language, simply because that\u2019s how people talked back then. BUT I do have one caveat: The word Nigger has NEVER been a non-derogatory or non - insulting word, in either America or England. Historical context does give you the slightest bit of wiggle room because there was racism going on all over the place during that time period and everybody was calling everybody a Nigger at some point or the next. In America, the black people and native americans got the brunt of the insulting word. In England it was Indians. BUT I would use it very cautiously or very sparsely, for it always has been and always will be a pretty offensive word. ",

            "answer_text": "Am I allowed to use racist terms in a fictional novel I am wanting to write about slavery? Of course. Especially if writing dialogue, or from the perspective of a character who is racist. Now, I\u2019m going to go with \u201cRacism Lite\u201dTM, because I don\u2019t want a BNBR hit, so bear with me. But lets say you\u2019re writing dialog. Johnathan: \u201cWilliam my friend, I must beg you for a favor.\u201d William: \u201cOf course, what do you need?\u201d Johnathan: \u201cYou see, its nearly time to bring in the harvest, and a goodly number of my negros have become too ill to work. I\u2019m afraid the weather will set in and much of the harvest will spoil before they are well again. I was hoping I might borrow some of yours.\u201d William: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that! That is quite the calamity. I\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019ll have them harvest my fields as quickly as possible, and when most of the harvest is in, I\u2019ll send some to you to help. That way, even if they become ill, we won\u2019t both lose the year\u2019s crop. But you\u2019ll have to house and feed them when they\u2019re working for you.\u201d Johnathan: \u201cThank you, Will! I can\u2019t tell you how worried I\u2019ve been. This eases my mind greatly.\u201d Of course, that\u2019s not the word they\u2019d likely be using. But the point is, everything has its place in context. Used this way, the racist terms are not glorified, nor gratuitous, but historically accurate. Sanitizing the work for modern sensibilities would simply ring hollow. Nor should you overuse them to show just how racist and mean the slave-holders are, as that would likewise ring hollow. The goal should be authenticity.  For more, read Quill and Ink ",

Do you think portraying a racist slave owner from Civil War era would call his slaves (property) African Americans? It\u2019d be unheard of, it be just as crazy for him to call them buy a non demeaning word/name than it would be for him to suddenly invite them to date his daughter and become his son in law. The 1960\u2019s saw tons of racism. People attacking Dr. Martin Luther King weren\u2019t calling him a \u201cgentle, amazing smart human being\u201d, they probably called him n****r, negro, monkey, boy or another other terribly demeaning words. Similarly, you\u2019ve heard the tropes of older people who are less culturally sensitive call the Irish, \u201cMicks\u201d, Italians, \u201cWhops\u201d, Chinks, Japos, Gooks/Charlie right? Well let me tell you, no matter how many times you try to tell great uncle Hank, we can\u2019t say faggots anymore, they\u2019re going to call gays that. They\u2019ll call your Hispanic friend a Spic and maybe even mutter the \u201cn\u201d word at a black man who\u2019s cut him off in traffic. I can\u2019t tell an accurate story about \u201cmy closeted racist Great Uncle Dumbledore\u201d if I don\u2019t portray him properly. However, you can\u2019t use racist terms to describe your characters\u2026 i.e \u201cLejon Brames is a cotton picking, big lipped, black as tar \u2018n*****\u2019 who looks like a monkey\u201d.

            "answer_text": "If this is a work of fiction, and set in the past, then you will probably (at certain times) have to resort to the slang and language and idioms that were used at the time. But \u2014 I would not usually expect to see much of it in the \u201cnarration\u201d of the novel. Not usually. I would expect that each and every time a character in this story \u201cspeaks\u201d \u2014 then words coming out of that character\u2019s mouth would reflect that particular character. That is necessary. If the character is one who is alive in 1848, and from the deep south, I would expect them to speak the typical slang and usage and idioms and phrases and language that would have been used by that particular character during that time period, who is from that particular area or location. And, if that character is male, it might speak differently that the next character who speaks, because it is a female. If that character is a wealthy doctor who has bought lots of real estate, the language might be slightly different than the next character, who happens to be a poor, white blacksmith. So, the same is true when it comes to everything, even to the slang phrases they might use when referring to certain minorities, or to slaves. So, mostly I would expect to see those terms only inside of quotation marks: \u201cSure, I did,\u201d Tom said. Didn\u2019t mean ta\u2019, I even tried darn hard to stop him, but there weren\u2019t no way. There weren\u2019t no way!\u201d Tom gulped, looked down, exhausted. If it NOT dialogue, though: If it is a \u201cthird-person narrator,\u201d it is just a voice. The voice that is telling us this story. In that case, it may never use those same slang terms, or language that we consider racist. Is that clear? If the one telling us the story (the narrator) is a first person narrator, then you need to decide WHO this character actually is, and all of their descriptions and story telling will reflect that. Hope that helps. ",

It just comes down to how you use the term. For instance, you might use term as dialogue for a character who\u2019s nature and personality causes them to use racist language. Another example is where you use the term as a quote from another person. You may also potentially use the term as a cultural moniker if you are writing directly to that culture. I\u2019d research this completely before doing so. Where you will run into trouble is when you use a racist term as a description in the first person. In other words, you, the author, are describing another person with a racist term. As the writer you have the freedom (at least here in the U.S.) to use that language. Just remember\u2026 you don\u2019t have the freedom to escape the consequences of what you write. Regardless of how you use a racist term in your writing, you are going to offend someone, somewhere.

For instance (and I\u2019m not totally sure this is idiomatic for the mid-19th-century American South, where I\u2019m assuming your book might be set, but it certainly was in use in Britain in the period), blackamoor is unlikely to get people as hot under the collar as the N-word. But do the research really thoroughly if you pursue this route. Otherwise it\u2019ll feel wrong to anyone who is familiar with the time and place of your story. Also, bear in mind: even a racist person in a racist era would not be constantly talking about how racist they were. It was probably pretty rare that a white slave-owner said \u201cD\u2019you know, Mary, I believe negroes are inferior to us white folk\u201d. It was taken as read by his contemporaries that he believed this. That was just the way things were, for them. So - show us your characters and their society acting in racist ways, by all means, but try to avoid making racism overtly an issue for the characters, even if it is one for the readers. It was an unremarkable part of the characters\u2019 world, not necessarily something to be commented on. ",

            "answer_text": "to write about slavery in this modern days you have t find the very start of things. first find out what slavery is . there's a slavery created permitted by god and there's slavery created by men. 1- slavery by god is what we live today we work for someone to get rich, without inheritance. slaves was to work for seven years and when the time was done the master had to give them something to move on even a wife and land. slavery was created due to the son dishonoring the father . now the slavery out of Rome perhaps this is why its called bootleg was imitated out of Babylon. white people did not invent slavery they just bought on to a business created by pirates black selling blacks into slavery for deadly games . god had the original slave laws and Rome imitated the bootleg version distorted history. before you do read the god slave version and keep in ind that slaves was treated like he sons of the house hold ,both at the time rewarded for the good or even put to death for dishonor .

            "answer_text": "It all depends on your presentation. Do you make it seem glorified by a repetitive usage that doesn\u2019t add anything to the story and through making the characters who use the term seem sympathetic because or in relation to their racism? Having sympathetic racist characters is fine. The majority of people you\u2019d write about 300 years ago would be racist in some way or another, and yet they can still be compelling characters. It\u2019s very likely that many of the communist revolutionaries were bigoted against women, even though they sparked radical changes that led to feminist prominence in many countries. It is not fine, however, to not treat their racism seriously and to allude to it just \u201cbeing a part of them like bone and flesh\u201d. ",

The better question is whether the increased chance of causing offense is more or less significant than the increased accuracy, and I think that question can only be answered by someone who both would be the target of said racism, and enjoys historical fiction. If you\u2019re looking to make money off the book, the decision also should consider the fact that some people will boycott it simply because it offends their sensibilities (whether the actual targets of the racism would be offended or not).

You need to just remember that some of these terms used to not be as offensive as they are considered now. If you are planning on writing a small section on a few facts about racism, it probably wouldn\u2019t be the smartest idea to use racist terms. Some people might think that you yourself are racist, which I\u2019m assuming you aren\u2019t considering that you\u2019re asking whether or not its okay to use racist terms in a novel about slavery. Slavery is a topic that will almost always come into contact with racism. It\u2019s recommended that the narrative parts of the story aren\u2019t too racist. For instance, use similes instead of metaphors. Instead of \u201cThe Chinese men were borrowed machinery\u201d, Say \u201cThe Chinese men worked as if they were borrowed machinery\u201d Hope this helped Good luck writing a novel! ",
