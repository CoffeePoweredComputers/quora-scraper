            "answer_text": "Shorts are proof of concept, like studies in art. Paragraphs are more concise than that and can provide premises or other elements to expand from. Notes are nice since they can be fairly unformatted and saved in a folder somewhere. Then connect between the dots. Try the forty or fifty thousand word length. Do several of those. Vary protagonists if have gone as deep as possible, or switch focal to antagonist or a secondary. Move them through settings. Assign arcs to the symbols and emotions also. For any lines show what is on the sides and how they mix or split. Like producing particles out of the ether, but for articles from the nether. Some of it may adapt things going on externally. Sometimes it seems to preview them. Or it can reinterpret the past which is sort of intense when that intuits what others were going through because of it. Take opposite sides. Throw everything at it, like dialogue, description, tense, terseness, and so on, to see where it goes. Spot a portal to the parallel space. ",

            "answer_text": "In your head, of course! However, I understand that not everyone has a seemingly boundless imagination, so here\u2019s a few tips: Creations are never truly original. They always borrow from other pieces, ideas, and methods. Feel free to take inspiration from other images, books, movies, etc. Don\u2019t outright copy, but think of something similar to a certain setting, like a frozen land riddled with crypts like you\u2019d see in Skyrim. Beef up on references for worlds to make them more exciting. Everyone has something to teach you that you didn\u2019t know, after all. Type in, \u201chow to make a world interesting,\u201d or, \u201cworld-building 101.\u201d Add interesting monuments, landmarks, or natural oddities. Fill it with fascinating creatures. Populate it with great forests and blooming flora, bustling cities and great civilizations. Or make it a desolate wasteland devoid of life with no hope of survival inside, that\u2019s interesting too. And pick a feeling. Sound weird? Sure does. But close your eyes a sec (after you finish reading, obviously) and imagine how you would feel being placed in your world. Scared? At peace? In awe? Sometimes, if we feel like we\u2019re in our world, it\u2019s easier to describe what it looks like, or how a character would feel walking about in it. And don\u2019t worry about immersing yourself too deep, you\u2019ll come back. Probably. Hope my rambling helps! Have a good day/night. ",
