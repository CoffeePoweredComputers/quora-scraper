            "answer_text": "Google Docs really suffers from this tremendously! Lacking a MUST FEATURE in collaborative writing is almost insane in 2019 \u2026 It\u2019 logical for collaborative writing to know WHO wrote WHAT. It\u2019s even crazier that Google Doc already has it in the Version history, but it's not a solution when we want to see the integrative final version and see whose part is what - to go through all the versions to try to get it?!? :D So, \u201cGoogle\u201d, please, just enable it for the integral, final version to turn on some coloring that shows WHO wrote WHAT.

It will show you a complete record of who wrote what, when the changes were made, and you can also \u201croll back\u201d the document to an earlier version, if needed. This is a good overview I found that shows how it works (run time 2:01).  I hope that helps. Cheers! -Naomi ",
