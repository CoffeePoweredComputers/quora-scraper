            "answer_text": "I realize we live in a modern world of global networking and technological progress, so you might wonder if some things have simply gone out of style\u2026 For example, like sending out a thank you email and asking if one is willing to catch up. But the truth is, politeness and gratitude will never go out of style!!! However, sometimes the way you communicate this needs to change. A \u201cthank you/let\u2019s catch up\u201d is you expressing your gratitude and showing that you are hoping to continue a conversation to build the relationship. This will give you an edge over anyone who chooses not to catch up with their network. How do you do it? Email every person involved in your interactions with a client, from client assistants to the client, him/herself.Be sure to write something unique to each person! Why? Because they will compare notes about you, literally. You don\u2019t want them to see that you used a template. It is frowned upon as insincere. Believe me: it\u2019s worth it to write unique emails.Timing is important: Send the email when it is relevant and you have something to talk about, not just to say, \u201cWassup?\u201dThe email itself (see below):Add a Clear Subject Line Don\u2019t make it more than five or six words. Short and clear is the best way to go. Good subject lines include: Hi, [name of recipient]. Catching up with you.Great speaking with youEnjoyed our conversation about [insert]2. Open With a Personal Greeting Double-check to be sure you have the correct name and spelling. 3. Express Gratitude for the Last Time You Spoke A straightforward statement works well, such as: \u201cThank you for work with me on the ABC Company.\u201d You might add additional detail: \u201cI appreciate the time you took to [add details of the interaction].\u201d \u201cI was very impressed by [insert what impressed you]\u201d \u201cIt would be great if we could catch up regarding [insert your reason for catching up]. Would you be open to a quick call next week?\u201d 4. Provide an Invitation to Further Connect Show yourself as being easy to get in touch with by adding: \u201cI am easy to reach at this email address or my number at ***-***-****. Feel free to contact me anytime. I look forward to speaking with you.\u201d 5. IMPORTANT: You are NOT shmoozing or boot-licking! One of the most important reasons for catching up is to show you are still interested in working with a client again. This is called, \u201cbeing classy and respectful.\u201d If you think otherwise, I invite you to examine why you think being nice to clients is a bad idea. Hope you think this answer is helpful! ",
