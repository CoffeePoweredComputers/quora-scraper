That means that every sector has a different range of optimal conversion rates, let\u2019s say, for an email open rate or landing page CR%. Unbounce publishes dozens of studies and articles every year, here\u2019s an excerpt: So what\u2019s the average landing page conversion rate? We\u2019ve analyzed lead generation landing pages across 10 different industries (with a total of 74,551,421 visitors), and the average landing page conversion rate was 4.02%. The lowest-converting industry is higher education at 2.6%, and the highest-converting industry is vocational studies & job training at 6.1%. Remember, that 4.02% is just an average of the different industries, just for landing pages; it\u2019s a starting point that you can use to orient yourself, but it\u2019s not useful or directly applicable to a real project. You have to figure out your own metrics and extract your own data sets.

            "answer_text": "One which delivers a positive ROI. Most make the mistake of judging their metrics against a percentage reported to be the industry standard for that format. But each situation is unique, and that only tells part of the picture. For instance, let\u2019s say you have two ecommerce product pages. Page A converts 2% of it\u2019s traffic into a sale, while Page B converts 5%. So page B is better, right? Not necessarily. Say the product on Page A has a profit margin of $100, and the one on Page B has a earns $25 for unit. Assume 100 people visit each of those pages. Page A would earn $200 in profit. Page B would only earn $125, even though the conversion rate is higher. So what you need to do is figure out your cost per conversion and break even point. Of course this is easier said than done, especially when you are measuring conversions that aren\u2019t direct sales. What you need to do for that is investigate your funnel and attribute a value for each step in the process. Also, don\u2019t forget about lifetime value. Sometimes it makes sense to even lose money on an initial sale if you can make up for it in future transactions. I hope that helps. ",

These days readers do not pay attention to their emails; therefore, it has become arduous to convert them as customers. If the email is innovative and attracts customers, then anything above 2.5 to 5 per cent will be considered a success. Note that companies email address will play a critical role here; spamming the readers with the bulk of emails will lead to disaster and catastrophes for the business. Add value for the reader; let them select their plans or products; do not market your products aggressively; one day or other they will buy from you. ",

            "answer_text": "100% is a very good conversion rate. Not realistic but very good. The problem is not knowing what part of the system you are in when measuring. Also need to know the product or service, and the media. Email, FB, online, snail mail and every other media will have different conversion rates for initial prospects versus previous buyers. The segmentation of the prospects and the message also affect conversion. With all those variables, we add in the generic \u201conly about 3% of people are ready to buy at any given time. \u201c And don\u2019t forget those who see your ad, online or offline, and have a conversion rate to action. Those who take the action may be sent to a webpage. That is another conversion. Those who actually order instead of leaving are another conversion rate. The simple answer to your question is: it\u2019s complicated! Hope that helps! ",
