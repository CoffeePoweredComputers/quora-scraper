            "answer_text": "Short answer no. Longer answer, well\u2026 There are 3 kinds of characters that can be possible centers for a story: hero, protagonist, and main character. And yes, they\u2019re all different. A hero is someone who\u2019s morally good. (generally speaking) A protagonist is the one we as the reader/watcher/listener are rooting for to succeed. But the main character is simply the lens through which we access the story. An example of these three things being different within the same story is the Great Gatsby. Gatsby is the protagonist, but he\u2019s not a hero as he\u2019s not very moral, and Nick Caraway (one of his friends) is actually the MC, because the book is told in his perspective as the biggest third wheel in fictional history. So, can you tell a story without a person who\u2019s telling the story? I\u2019ve read many books with multiple MC\u2019s, where the point of view shifts from person to person, but I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve read a book with the other possibility; that there is no character telling the story nor pushing it forward at all. Hm\u2026 I only say that a story doesn\u2019t have to have an MC because I think it\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s honestly blowing my mind to try and imagine one. Because even stories with the narrator as not any of the characters, there\u2019s still an MC (the first that comes to mind is 1984, which is implied to be told by someone who lives long after the main character of the story, Winston, is dead.) If you want, I listen to this writing advice podcast where they discussed this very topic in a recent episode. Rather than re-listen to it, I\u2019ll just give you the link if you\u2019re interested on some actual experts\u2019 take (and not a rando on the internet, lol.) 13.1: Hero, Protagonist, Main Character ",

EX: Bob has just purchased a 2 million dollar home, he had been lucky and won the lottery! The day that he and his family left their previous home, with only 2 bedrooms and 5 sons, they were elated! His wife Martha was so overjoyed, and so were the boys. Finally Bob could quit his job as manager of a supermarket and enjoy his family. . Bob and Martha had never bought lottery tickets before, but Bob was in a convenience store buying candy for the boys when he saw the bright red and gray scratch off ticket, the ticket seemed to beckon to him. An instant win for 5 million! Life would be good for he and his family from now on.. Summary, Bob and Martha had been struggling with 5 children and only 2 bedrooms, Bob is the main character, Martha is the secondary main character. there is no requirement to introduce the 5 children in the story line\u2026unless we give them a first name. ..BILLY, BAILEY, BAXTER, BRIAN, AND BRICE ",

You could write a story with a huge cast of characters but I would still make at least one of them more central to the story than the others. Or, if I split the book between locations I would have a main character or a small group of core characters in each location that my reader could grow to care about. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it does not. Your novel can be whatever you like, or however you want it to be. There are no rules. Look up postmodernism and popular books in this genre. As a theory it says that chaos is all around us and all we can do is exist within it. It can have very interesting implications when it comes to literature. There is no need for a central character, plot or theme, there does not need to be any widely accepted structure to your book even. Hope this helps! ",
