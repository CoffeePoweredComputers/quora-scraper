            "answer_text": "Possibly, but probably not. Especially if the book\u2019s free on Amazon. Why? Because Amazon makes offering a book for free difficult. If the publisher has figured out the steps needed to make a book permafree, they\u2019re probably doing it for a well-thought-through reason \u2014 ie, using it as a loss leader, away to market other books. If a publisher can operate at that level of sophistication, they hopefully realize that they need to exert at least a modicum of editorial discipline. ",

            "answer_text": "Usually, no. Many authors use a free ebook as a marketing tool. They offer the first book in their fiction series for free to entice readers \u2014 and then they make their money on sales of books in the rest of the series. Authors can also create Kindle promotions to give away any of their ebooks at a discount or free for a limited time. Again, this is a marketing technique to hook new readers. Most of the free ebooks I\u2019ve read have been well-edited and professionally written. And they\u2019ve introduced me to some wonderful new authors. ",
