            "answer_text": "The first thing you should do is determine what requirements your school has for allowing such a long absence. Any letter you write must be sure to address the school\u2019s requirements. Second, you ought to show why it\u2019s important for you to be absent now. Why can\u2019t your event wait until school is out? Third, I\u2019d make sure I had my parent or guardian come in to the school and make a pitch. You\u2019ll want to show that you haven\u2019t made all this up. Last your actual letter needs to be formal, spell checked, addressed to the right person, etc etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, that depends on the circumstances of the absence. If you were sick for 4 days, you could say that you had a late case of the Flu, or whatever disease ailed you, if it is something that the attendance office will believe could make you miss 4 days of school. If you skipped 4 days of school for a trip or something of the like, and you don\u2019t want to get any unexcused absences, I would make something up. A family crisis, perhaps, or just claim that you had a major sickness. You probably should\u2019ve let the attendence office know that you had a major illness during the first day you were sick, or perhaps you could\u2019ve lied about the sickness if you were just skipping school. Really, your course of action should just depend on WHY you were absent. And if you were just skipping school\u2026do yourself a favor and don\u2019t, it will hurt you in the long run. ",
