            "answer_text": "First of all, you need to be clear that your professional biography is probably the most important copy you have ever written about yourself. This is the first introduction to who you are, what you do and what interests you - whether it's a blur on the social media platform, a personal website, or a company page. What you choose to play can play a role in others who choose to follow you, call you for an interview, or invite you to participate in the event. This is an opportunity for you - in several lines - to show your work, competence and field of knowledge. In short, this is a first look at your personality. Because of this, writing is not only important but also very difficult. To think about who you are as a person is how to practice mental gymnastics. You are essentially tasked with trying to prevent who you are and what you are doing that compels job seekers, potential clients, colleagues and influential people right away. In any case, you can always seek the help of professionals. ",
