            "answer_text": "To actually write and revise it: About two weeks, if you have nothing else planned. More, otherwise. Less, if you push it and/or are working with collaborators. Some people can piss out a paper in a day. Keep them close as potential co-authors. To do the research that merits a research paper, regardless of length: Indeterminate. Something between 2 days and 2 years. It really depends on how much you can build upon. A colleague of mine had developed a new tool for his PhD, he spend a couple of years on it. Never published anything on it. I was new in the lab, I thought let\u2019s do a user study on it for evaluation. We set the thing up, used crowdsourcers as users. Then some math to evaluate the results. Between the idea for the paper and the submission were roughly two weeks all things considered. But obviously he had spend years prior in preparation. ",
