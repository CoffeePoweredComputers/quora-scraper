It used to be that you could randomly come across a person that would speak with open disdain of the government, but most reasonable people understood that the government, while flawed, generally tries to help and make the country run a little smoother. Now the tide has flipped. The majority of people openly discuss how deeply flawed our government has become, how they can\u2019t do anything correctly. And you know what? At this point in time, they are correct! So while life was good with our current administration when no tough situations were present, Covid has shown just how broken and incompetent our current administration is. My brother races cars. His favorite quote applies: \u201cThe race shows the weakness of your car.\u201d Same thing here. The pandemic exposed the weakness of our administration. When people see that the people in charge are buffoons, they panic. They do stupid things. They buy useless crap. They get angry over toilet paper. ",

I don\u2019t think that toilet paper was first on the minds of people who heard there was a serious epidemic in the country. Not knowing what was going on does make people nervous, lockdowns were necessary and nerve wracking. But they had to be done to slow the progress of the virus through the population and keep the hospitals from getting slammed. This was far worse and far easier to transmit than any previous virus except possibly for the Spanish Flu a hundred years earlier. ",
