            "answer_text": "You can use your own name, of course. But if you wish to identify second or third parties in a statement which is personal to you, you invite personal rejoinder from those named. Their privacy may be broken to support some evidently important point in a statement that allegedly is just about you. If what this/these other party/parties did is germane, allude to what they did, but please don't supply identifying hints such as \"second cousin on my mother's side born a month after I was.\" I'm sure you can extrapolate your own situation: do not provide information which could lead to identifying any other party, unless explicitly permitted to do so, and with their editorial control over the part of your statement which involves them.
