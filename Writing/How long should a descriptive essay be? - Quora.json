            "answer_text": "I cannot imagine a descriptive essay going on for more than a few pages. Even that might be a bit much, unless the descriptive essay is about something a bit broad. For example, if you are writing a descriptive essay about a green apple, you might discuss the difference in green apple varieties including the smell, shapes, size, flavors, etc. if you are desperate for more description than just the one apple itself. If, however, you are writing a descriptive essay about an old home with a lot of history, you could end up with a short story. Consider the subject itself when thinking about pages. An instructor should always give a page amount for guidelines. The best way to learn to write is to learn to constrain the amount of writing that must be done. ",
