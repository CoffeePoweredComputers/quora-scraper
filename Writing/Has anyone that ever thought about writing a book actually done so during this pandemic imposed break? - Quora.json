            "answer_text": " Yes! At the beginning of 2019, I liquidated my life in Mexico and began to travel. I bought a series of one-way tickets to so many places I\u2019d always wanted to go\u2026plus I had people to meet and my destiny awaited me \u2026. So I began to write my second memoir, my first hit #1 LOVE The Beat Goes On, in three categories this month in Amazon. It wasn\u2019t as easy to write as I expected. First of all, I began right before we were qurantined. (I\u2019m currently in Istanbul). Then someone very close to me lost his father. I admit I was a wreck and all over the board even though I\u2019d created an outline before the pandemic hit. The final result is beautiful. I now have 17 books on Amazon, but this one is precious to me and the people that are in my life that I met along my journey. In 2008 I was given 6 months to live! I\u2019m definitely a \u2018kitten\u2019 with 8 lives left to live! If you would like to see what life is like when you choose to live out of a suitcase, my book is on pre-order with Amazon, and will be released Sept. 30 CAFE CONFIDENTIAL,Unfiltered and intimate. Thanks!! Stay safe and healthy everyone! ",

            "answer_text": "I ramble in this answer a little. I have not written a book, nor really worked on one during the pandemic but NaNoWriMo is coming and the pandemic will still be happening so I can -and you can - still answer yes to this question! Ironically, my workload has increased during CoVID so I have not had much of a break. I guess I have saved some time that I would have spent on social events - restaurants, gatherings and even concerts in the summer. My CoIVD pandemic experience has been unusual, I think. When the disease closed schools in Ontario, Canada, I weighed 96 kg. That was in March. In early August, I was 78 kg! I had run a half marathon, completed a 7km swim and done 300 push ups in a day. Oh, not all of those in one day, those were three different days! I have thought about writing. I read through a draft and looked at: problems and confusing writing -that might have made sense a few years ago when I was deep into the story,found gaps where I need to explain more,refreshed my memory of the characters,worked to complete the story and give it a good ending -it had ended roughly 80% of the way into the story.But I have not worked much on the story. In November of this year - of every year - National Novel Writing Month takes place and people try to write a story - 50,000 words of one at least - in the month. the link is at the top of this answer. I love it and have completed it -the 50,000 words - many times but not actually completed a book. Maybe this year. ",

It\u2019s due for release later in the year. Plenty of people are doing it. I have heard stories of authors having troubles writing during this crisis, but just as many where nothing has changed for them, or indeed, they\u2019re writing faster now. It\u2019s been a mixed blessing for everyone. Personally, I\u2019m ahead of my normal schedule this year with 6 books out, and at least another 2 to come this year. But then, I am something of a Hermit Writer, and the only thing different for me, was the food delivery service not working for a month early on. ",

After all many other ex-cons have already done it , plus there several ex-cons on YouTube, so whats the point. Although one Youtuber said I should start my own channel. That\u2019s just not me. If I did anything, it would be a book. Another reason that I haven't done a book is I do not want young people thinking its cool when it is not. If anything, I would want them to learn from my experience instead of praising it. I absolutely detest young people saying \u201cYou were in prison? Wow that is cool!\u201d No it is not! ",
