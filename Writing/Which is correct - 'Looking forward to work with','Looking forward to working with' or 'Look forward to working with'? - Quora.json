            "answer_text": "\"Looking forward to working with you\" is most likely what you are going for.  What it says is that you are looking forward to doing the act of working with the other person(s).  Not only is it grammatically correct, but even More importantly, it sounds correct to native English speakers . However, if 'work' refers to a place or activity, \"looking forward to work with you\" could be technically correct.  Imagine that you are taking a college class with your friend:  you might say \"I'm looking forward to Stat 110 with you!\" and it wouldn't sound weird.  Now substitute the activity \"Stat 110\" with \"work.\"  It now says that you are looking forward to doing the activity called \"work\" with the person. I would say that both can be correct, but you almost definitely want to say \"Looking forward to working with you.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Which is correct: 1. \"Looking forward to work with,\" 2. \"Looking forward to working with,\" or 3. \"Look forward to working with\"? In sentence 1, if \u201cwork\u201d is meant as a a verb (i.e., \u201cto work\u201d) then this sentence is incorrect. What is looked forward to must be a noun, participle, or gerund, not a verb. However, if \u201cwork\u201d is intended to be a noun, then this sentence is correct. By substituting the noun \"life\" for the noun \"work,\" a sentence can be constructed to show that this is true: \"I am looking forward to life [work] with you.\" Sentences 2 and 3 are correct. ",
