            "answer_text": "Of all the answers, I favor what Rahul D\u2019Silva wrote. I will just add to some points of his and contradict the others. :-) \u201cA content writer can earn as much as his skills are worth, or rather, as much as he can negotiate from clients based on his skills and negotiating ability. It\u2019s true that content writing jobs that are advertised by companies, or on sites that outsource content writing to freelancers, pay very little for new graduates, and not that much higher for experienced writers.\u201d Agree and Disagree both! I will quote from my own career graph. When I started out, I was being given INR 120 by the agency that had hired me for a 500 word piece and my first hourly salary on Upwork (then oDesk) was 900 bucks. (You can calculate the dollars yourself.) From there, I have come a long way to making 60k per month from a single project (and I was handling 11 projects together at a time with 2 people working under me. This was my \u201c3rd Year in B.Tech\u201d). As of today, I am being paid around $150 for a single content and I write as much as I can. (Truth be told, I do not get a lot of time.) \u201cAnd while the salary/fees are low when you're starting out, perhaps 10-15k/month, with a lot of time spent writing and learning (take online classes, read as widely as possible, follow good writers in advertising and bloggers like Ramit Sethi and Tim Ferriss and Ryan Holiday), you can boost your earnings very quickly.\u201d Agreed! However, what Rahul mentioned was the salary that you will get by taking up a day job or a 9\u20135 job. Here, in India, it is sad to say that the employers are looking for cheap labor rather than quality and sadder is people ARE settling for these meager amounts. I am not asking you to quote 50k when starting out but it is only fair to make your employer understand that 15k will only go towards paying rent, commuting, food and electricity bills. What will you have for sending back home, save and spend on yourself, God only knows. It is fair to ask for anything between 20\u201325k in today\u2019s content writing scenario. Just make sure, your employer does not regret hiring you. :) \u201cPart of a content writer\u2019s job (a term I\u2019m not a big fan of, which is why I use \u201cconsultant\u201d rather than limiting myself to only a writer) is to educate clients as to what he or she does, which is not just writing copy, but actually thinking about how to refine the client\u2019s brand, how to get people more interested in a product, etc. This involves some marketing thinking, some sales, even some design and business development type thinking. A content writer writes things the client asks for. A consultant comes up with ideas for what the client should have as written content, gives the client advice on how to bring in more clients using the web content, how to pitch the business, etc.\u201d This is where I disagree. Content writing and Content Marketing are two different things. Related but different. A writer is only limited to producing quality content. He/She is not responsible for marketing the same. Having said that, a lot of companies today are looking for a mix of both in one individual and this only makes sense. You can have a better pay and get hands on experience. But, tagging yourself as a \u201cConsultant\u201d is not legitimate unless you have the relevant examples to showcase the same. It is like asking a kid to file a tax return. Harsh truth is, you cannot call yourself a consultant before a hard core experience in the designated field until at-least 5\u20137 years of working in the same. My advice, focus on making yourself a good (nay, great writer) and learn Marketing from Moz etc. Try implementing all of this whenever you can but don\u2019t be too harsh on yourself. After 5 years, I am in a position to have a little command over what and how I write but I still do not feel eligible enough to call myself a consultant. \u201cImagine that rather than signing up on 10 websites for content writing freelance jobs, you spend time going out and meeting people (or reaching out online via LinkedIn, social media, etc.) to companies that might need your services. Imagine you also distinguish your service from that of other writers by showing examples of previous work in your portfolio, etc. Yes, you can\u2019t do all of this (have examples of past work) if you\u2019re just starting out. But even just starting out, you don\u2019t have to accept what the company is offering without negotiating. If you really believe you\u2019re a great content writer, even if you don\u2019t have 5 yrs of experience, offer to do a small piece for the client free, with the understanding that you can then discuss further work if they\u2019re interested. Now you have some leverage to negotiate a higher rate for your work, rather than simply accepting the rate they offer to every single content writer they talk to.\u201d I do the same. If I come across a genre/niche unknown, I offer the client a trial before he/she hires me for work. Also, take it from a fellow freelancer, try not to travel in 2 boats at the same time. Instead of signing up for 10 websites, sign up on only one. Keep working and reach the top level. \u201cSure, you might have to sign up with sites that offer freelancing opportunities for content writers, when you start. But don\u2019t depend on these for survival and get addicted - they won\u2019t pay very good rates, and you also can\u2019t develop your own client base since you get no contact with the clients.\u201d I strongly disagree! My whole writing career started on from a freelancing site and has turned my life around because of it. The rates are EXCELLENT! You just need to work your way into getting good projects. Developing your own client base is never an issue because unlike a cubicle job, you can literally see projects after projects ushering in on sites like Upwork, Freelance, Fiverr, iWriter and so on. Plus, sites like Upwork have a filter option wherein you can look up work pr projects posted by Previous Clients. And, from common sense, why would a client like to leave an established relationship and start over with someone new? Think! My profile on Upwork is a living testament of what kind of projects I took when I started and the pay and the projects I have done over the years. Sure, you can go out and network but that time can also be spent judiciously scouring the freelancing sites at home And, if you\u2019re like me, who hates socializing and loves her me time, trust me, you\u2019re gonna like this better. *winks* \u201cGo out and network - I\u2019ve met clients simply by doing the things I normally do every day (sports, going out with friends to a restaurant or for coffee) and talking to new people about what they do and what I do, and offering to help with their business. There is a huge demand for content, which means the same clients who are outsourcing their work to the freelancing sites can also be found by you directly, with a little effort.\u201d I guess this works when you are a little experienced. When people can see the flare in your way of talking about what you do and the confidence which oozes out when you talk to them. Until you have it, I would say, work on doing the stuff that will help you reach that level. \u201cAnother thing to keep in mind is working on a project basis rather than an hourly or per words basis. A lawyer doesn\u2019t charge on how many words there are in a contract, and a software engineer doesn\u2019t charge based on how many lines of code are in the site or program.\u201d This is really a matter of personal choice. Taking in terms of human psychology, you would love to work for an hour if you know that this hour right now will earn you $10 dollars. It will get you pumped up, automatically. You might be able to make $20 for an article that takes you 2 hours to complete. However, 2 hours for an article on fixed price and you\u2019ll only make $10. See the difference? Don\u2019t get me wrong, fixed price projects are great. They give you great feedback and there is always opportunity for long term work. Plus, they usually pay themselves off since there is bulk content. \u201cIf anything, coming up with content that is shorter and punchier and more effective takes more work than writing a long piece, as you have to do multiple drafts and edit things down, since you have a shorter attention span from the consumer to make an impact. So why would you charge by the word and charge less for a key piece of short content?\u201d Again, I disagree. This all depends on the kind of content that you are going to create. Your customers are not looking for something \u201cpunchy\u201d or \u201cshort\u201d when they are reading documentation on the latest APIs or how a particular appliance works or a tutorial on HVAC or product reviews. There is a difference between copywriting, content creation and all other types of content. \u201cI think it's very possible to make 1-1.5lakhs/month as a consultant for content, rather than branding yourself as a content writer and going with the rates freelancing sites and many clients offer you.\u201d YOU CAN EARN THE SAME AMOUNT BY SIMPLY BEING A GREAT WRITER TOO! BEEN THERE, DONE THAT! :) ",

Now you have some leverage to negotiate a higher rate for your work, rather than simply accepting the rate they offer to every single content writer they talk to. Yes, being able to negotiate is itself dependent on your actual writing skill level, where you are (if you are in a small town with low demand for content, you can\u2019t charge high rates\u2026but that\u2019s where the internet changes your reach), etc. But you can start with figuring out how much you can charge and what you should charge, rather than what you can get paid and what companies will pay you, and then negotiate.  Notice how you are flipping the script on who decides what the rate is. Whether it\u2019s with freelance sites or with individual clients, or with people in your network, you always have the option to negotiate. Sure, you might have to sign up with sites that offer freelancing opportunities for content writers, when you start. But don\u2019t depend on these for survival and get addicted - they won\u2019t pay very good rates, and you also can\u2019t develop your own client base since you get no contact with the clients.

There is a huge demand for content, which means the same clients who are outsourcing their work to the freelancing sites can also be found by you directly, with a little effort. You have opportunities everyday to connect with new clients, whether offline (ideally) or online. Talk to people, pitch your services, and when it comes to prices, don\u2019t accept the first offer. Negotiate\u2026worst case, they can say no and you can choose whether to accept the original offer or walk away, but you always have the choice. Another thing to keep in mind is working on a project basis rather than an hourly or per words basis.

So why would you charge by the word and charge less for a key piece of short content? Just something to think about - your pricing should be based on a combination of factors like difficulty of the material, how much time you\u2019re spending on it, if you have to do further research, type of client (corporate vs. individual vs. nonprofit) and there\u2019s no fixed answer. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept whatever is being offered. Change the game. I've never worked full time as a \"content writer\", rather I've worked in marketing producing content for an investment firm, done tech recruiting, and now consult on content and business strategy. I think it's very possible to make 1-1.5lakhs/month as a consultant for content, rather than branding yourself as a content writer and going with the rates freelancing sites and many clients offer you.
