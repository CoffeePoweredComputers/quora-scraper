            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Most people will tell you to just start writing, and keep writing, but I don't agree. It's not enough to just write every day if you don't know what you're doing or how to improve something. That just means days and weeks and months of useless writing. It's like not knowing how to knit so you just keep making loops with the yarn. You can't get better, you can't turn that into a scarf ... you have the desire, but you don't know how. The man on top of the mountain didn\u2019t just fall there. Things take time. If you wanted to fly a plane, what would you do? You'd find a ground school and take lessons. If you wanted to play the piano, what would you do? You'd find a piano teacher and take classes. What makes writing any different? Writing is an art, but it\u2019s a learned art. To ask someone how to write a story is like asking \u201cHow do I climb a mountain?\u201d You don\u2019t unless you\u2019ve had the training. And no, it\u2019s not rocket science, but writing is something that needs to be studied and practiced. Anybody can sit down and write crap. You see it all the time in self-pubbed books. Some people will tell you to throw out all the rules and just write what you want. But I\u2019m here to tell you that that won\u2019t sell books. Sure, if you\u2019re established, like Stephen King, then you can start to mess with the rules because you have a built-in readership. Your fans will buy whatever you put out. But at first you have to get by the editors and the agents and you need to produce something that gives them confidence that you actually can write. So stick to the rules when you start out, then bend them when you get a bit better. I'm going to give you my stock answer that I give everyone who asks me the question of how to write a book. I'm going to give you some good advice on how to learn the craft, and give you a place to send in some of your work when you're ready. In order to write stories that people want to read you will need to understand how to put one together. There is a definite pattern and rhythm to it. And there are certain expectations from the editors and publishing houses as to how your story is laid out. You will need a good imagination, one that can look at a situation and picture all sorts of different scenarios. You need to be able to ask 'what if' and come up with twists and lines that are new and fresh. You will need to be able to research things. For example, I wrote a story set in Iran where there was a wedding. I had to research how the wedding would take place, the food, the customs, common Iranian names, clothing, etc. in order to write an interesting yet correct story. Take classes in writing; grammar and punctuation (very important... lots of self published books are swimming in glaring errors and typos), character building, dialogue, plotting, pacing, point of view (POV), inner and outer conflicts, subplots, scenes and sequels, genres, story boards, twists, chapter hooks, suspense, killer opening lines, and satisfying endings. If you're going to write sci-fi you will need to take classes in world building. Each genre of book has its own set of expectations from the reader that you will need to fulfill. For example, a murder mystery must have clues for the reader to try and solve. A romance needs a happily ever after ending, known to writers as an HEA. A thriller needs fast pacing and danger. There are classes in short story writing. Where to find these classes? Local community colleges often offer writing classes. My local library has classes seasonally. Best of all there are hundreds of classes you can take on-line. They run about $25-$35 each and range from 2 to 4 weeks. Google on-line writing classes and you will get lots of sites. Try (no title) or Home - SavvyAuthors. They have classes year round. You don\u2019t have to join either one but if you do you get a discount on their classes. Just because a class might be about writing romances, writing is writing; many of the same principles apply to other genres. So don\u2019t hesitate to take a course on character building or writing scenes just because the site caters to romance. There are sites that offer expensive classes, so be careful. I\u2019d recommend starting with a few less expensive ones to see if you really like writing and want to continue. IMO it is not necessary to have a degree or to take an expensive course to write well. Read a lot. Get a feel for how a story is told; how it starts, how it progresses through the story to a satisfying end. See how your favorite author keeps you interested. I don't know your age, but when you are able join some writing groups, even online groups are helpful. Oftentimes these groups offer lectures and classes in writing. They share their work and critique each other. Once you start taking classes and get a good feel for how to put a story together, write some short stories (800 - 1500 words). The more you write, the better you will become. You will make new writer mistakes, we all did. But that's how you learn. I say start with short stories because they are, well short, and don't take years to complete like a novel does. You can share your stories with others and get feedback. Take the feedback and use what you feel is constructive for you and ignore the others. Some people don't give good feedback, or there is a motive behind their negative comments. You have to learn which ones to take and learn from and which ones to disregard. And when you are reading and critiquing other's stories, be kind, give good feedback, and find something positive to say to them. It's hard to hear harsh things about your writing. It's tough love. But it works when you get it and understand why the comment was made and you go and make your piece better because of it. Submitting to contests is another way to get good feedback because the judges are usually editors and agents who have their finger on the pulse of good writing that sells. Once you feel you have written a great short story, be brave and submit it to a magazine that publishes fiction in the genre you wrote. Don't worry about rejections. They will come. Oftentimes it's not because your story is not good, it's because the story doesn't fit their needs. They are running a business after all, and they pick the stories that they feel will best entertain their readers. All authors get rejections. It's part of the 'hunt'. Here\u2019s a place to start submitting. Check out their guidelines carefully. FLASH FICTION ONLINE http://flashfictiononline.com/main/submission-guidelines/ We publish stories from 500 to 1,000 words in length. They\u2019re very short, but they are still stories. That means the best ones have strong, interesting characters, plots, and (to some extent, at least) settings. We\u2019re not that concerned about genre. Many of us have a fondness for science fiction and fantasy, but we also like literary fiction; and in any case, great flash stories aren\u2019t always easily classified. If you wrote it, and you love it, then submit it. No erotica, porn, graphic sex, or violence. Pays $60 per story. Buys reprints at two cents/word. (I checked this site on 03/24/19 and it\u2019s still operating and the details are correct.) Once you are good enough to sell a few short stories, then you will have the skills to think about plotting out a whole book.

            "answer_text": "Experience play a huge part in writing. It is very helpful to be able to write about some of the things that you have experienced in life. Of course a good writer can simply imagine those things regardless if he/she does not have the experience as a more mature writer. As we live life, we grow daily, and we learn. You can write a lot based on experience, I have held positions, worked with different types of people, traveled the world, have met, the god, the bad, the ugly. All of these things I draw upon when I am writing. I have found and observed that younger writers, not all, write about crimes, drugs, prison and things that they have witnessed in everyday life. I write those type of books as well, I do it mainly to appeal to various audiences. You must be relatable to your target audiences, thus I write different genre\u2019s to showcase my writing ability. Maybe something I write will appeal to a seasoned woman seeking affection, thus my book: Mind Of A Cougar. My book on interracial dating would benefit someone, thus my book:Chocolate Drop Domestic violence and abuse, thus my book: Anne Marie Crime and drugs: Blame It On The Game and so on and so forth\u2026. Yes Experience, does help a lot when creating a story\u2026 But, it is certainly not a deciding factor. Author Dia Stone ",

(Let\u2019s be real: Your goldfish going belly-up is a trauma for a child.) Instead of focusing on gaining experience, I would say that you ought to write first and then focus on the details that you\u2019re iffy on through research. Then when you research, make it laser focused and talk to the right people. There\u2019s nothing quite so productive as 5 minutes of research and then 55 minutes of scrolling through a feed of cat videos. Many people suggest that you ought to travel and become broad-minded so that you have something to write about, but unless your aim is to write about travel, then it might not necessarily be the best advice. After all, to travel when you don't have the money for it is spectacularly unwise. You\u2019ve probably got all the experience you need already, so stop putting it off and just write already! ",
