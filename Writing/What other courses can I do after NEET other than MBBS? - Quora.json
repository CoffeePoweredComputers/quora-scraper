So, basically your preparations and aspirations either win or lose simply on these 3 hours , because only about 1 percent will succeed. But   Option 1:if you really love BIOLOGY   Option 2: if you are free upon subjects You can do a BA, BSC ,BBA etc and become BankerManagerBusinessmanCivil servantPolice officerYour own bossThe whole world is out there to be conquered.  EDIT 1:Thanks for so fast response and upvotes; always ready to learn and help :) EDIT 2: Hey friends, after the unexpected results of neet , there is a lot of hassle among the students who were fully assured of admission. I too am shocked.But please calm down and don't take any drastic step.better opportunities might be waiting for you. ",

            "answer_text": "This Year, around 13 Lakh students appeared in NEET and out of them around 55000 students would be selected (Govt. and Private Medical colleges). So, you really need to prepare well and do a lot of hard work to get seat in you desired medical college. Along with Preparation, your LUCK also does matter. If you are not dedicated enough to pursue medicine as your career, there are many other options that you can opt for. If you really Love Biology then you can opt for: BSc (in Zoology or Botany or Biotechnology)B.Pharm3. B.TECH (in Biotechnology or Genetic Engineering) Other than this, you can opt for engineering i.e B.Tech in a field that interests you the most. And if you decide to go out of Science stream then you can pursue your higher studies in B.A (English, Any Vernacular Language, Sociology, History, Geography etc) or BBA. ",
