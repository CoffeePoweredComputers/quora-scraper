            "answer_text": "The best way to learn Urdu is to live in Pakistan. Not just any part of Pakistan, but in a big metropolis where Urdu is dominant as a language of choice, like Islamabad, Karachi or posh areas of Lahore. 1 or 2 years in Pakistan with some optional Urdu classes should be enough. There are, however, some very important things to remember. We in Pakistan have this love-hate relationship with English. Most people would insist on using Urdu as an official language and they would make this argument, get this, in English. We have an inferiority complex against English language and it\u2019s a legacy left behind by the British. In Pakistan, being educated means being able to speak English. Many people in Pakistan, after finding out that you\u2019ve come from the USA, will try to polish their own English language skills on you. Either actively discourage them from doing so and tell them that you want to be spoken to only in Urdu or avoid them at all. Many people in Pakistan, who do not have enough knowledge or courage to put the entire sentences together in the foreign language, sprinkle an abundance of English words in their daily Urdu conversation, basically bastardizing both languages. Avoid such people. They, in my opinion, are hopeless. Urdu language uses many loan words from English just like English uses loan words from Arabic, French and German. Some examples are TV, radio, antenna, bus, button, bulb, sleeper (Urduization of slippers), pent (Urduization of pants) etc. Do not be discouraged from using these words in Urdu. Some extremist Urdu supporters have come up with their Urdu translations. Don\u2019t fall for them. I see no Englishmen trying to translate the word algebra (an Arabic origin word) into English. Here is a short anecdote. I knew a Pakistani guy who came from an English speaking country and learned Urdu to at least 70% fluency within 6 months. You have Urdu background and a bit of foundation too (your parents). Once you immerse yourself in Pakistani culture, you\u2019ll learn to speak Urdu in no time. Reading and writing is an entirely different matter, and a completely different level of complexity. ",

For a cost per hour. Very helpful and I am currently going over the readers in c naim with Ali who is the owner of zabaan.com. He is a very cool guy as well as being very knowledgeable about urdu/hindi. I also leverage a website called Learn Urdu Online with Podcasts - UrduPod101 (free, but with paid options that are very helpful). They have good lessons with audio which is helpful for listening comprehension. Also you can sign up to have a teacher work with you. Hamza is my current teacher there and he has been also helpful answering questions and will provide a learning path if you are interested. I\u2019m currently working through the provided modules there as well. I\u2019d recommend liking the urdupod101 facebook page as they provide a TON of free useful learning material. They also have an amazon alexa app Amazon.com: Daily Dose by Innovative Language: Alexa Skills which will do daily beginner lessons. Lastly, I practice all the time with my wife who is a native urdu speaker, but she was never formally trained in urdu. This makes it a bit hard for her to teach me beyond some casual vocab (conversational) and basic grammar. She is also like your parents.. not a good teacher. You just need to start talking to them all the time in urdu if you can. Overall it is a lot of work, but since you grew up with it\u2026 it should help a lot. ",
