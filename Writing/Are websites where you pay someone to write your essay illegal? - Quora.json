            "answer_text": "For the most part, they are not illegal, although there have been some cases of copyright infringement and plagiarism, which can be illegal. So the sites themselves, no, the content they product, perhaps. Since they do not publish the content online, and instead bill themselves as merely \u201cmarketplaces\u201d, they would likely not be illegal, per se.  I think the bigger question, however, is \u201cWho uses these sites, and for what purpose?\u201d The answers to these two questions are nearly invariably: Who \u2014 studentsFor what purpose \u2014 academic fraudNow academic fraud also may not be illegal in your jurisdiction\u2026 but it\u2019s usually career suicide if it is ever, ever found out. This is true, even if you don\u2019t land in academia, if you use your academic credential which was fraudulently earned in order to obtain employment. Even if not criminally charged, the degree may be revoked/rescinded: Revoking Degrees: How and Why Schools Do It - Plagiarism Today Even without plagiarism, someone else taking your tests, writing your essays, etc. \u2014 the degree was fraudulently obtained. If you then went on to obtain a position, within academia or without, a revoked degree means that your position was now fraudulently obtained. That can easily result in civil and criminal penalties, especially if you end up as a CEO of a company, and therefore failed in your fiduciary responsibility, and defrauded stockholders. The SEC does not take kindly to that sort of thing. It gets worse if it was an MD or JD or other organization where admission to practice is based not only on ability, but also upon the degree.  Personally, I\u2019d say just learn to write, and call it a day. Avoid these sites like you\u2019d avoid wearing a Pepe the Frog, Osama bin Laden, or Al Franken T-shirt. ",

What they\u2019ll invariably be, though, is dishonest, and this is true in a couple of ways: \u201cOriginal\u201d essays: The odds of anything produced on such a site actually being original are very poor. Judging by the turnaround times the various shill accounts here and elsewhere spruik, there\u2019s simply no time for someone to do the proper amount of research, planning, drafting, and editing required. The essays will almost certainly be recycled.\u201cNo plagiarism, guaranteed!\u201d: Most sites seem to claim this. It\u2019s not true. The essay may have been assembled from a collection of sources and each one cited correctly (unlikely, see above), but that\u2019s not all that plagiarism is. Unless your university or school operates in a very strange way, there\u2019ll be a declaration you\u2019re asked to sign saying \u201cThis is my own work\u201d. Doing that when it isn\u2019t your own work makes you guilty of plagiarism when it\u2019s detected. And it will be.",
