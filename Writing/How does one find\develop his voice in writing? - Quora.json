            "answer_text": "This is something I\u2019ve been working on lately. I\u2019m in interesting situation right now, financially, job-wise and future. and so I feel that I\u2019m at a point in my life where I either \u201cstart the 10,000 hours\u201d and write or continue down the same, known path and find another 9\u20135 job. I\u2019ve tried writing about topics in the past, such as mountain biking, sports (NFL, NBA, etc) food, marketing but I haven\u2019t really stuck with anything. I didn\u2019t feel the pull to delve deeper into those subjects and simply stopped. I\u2019ve even purchased from the App Store, writing prompts by Where the Writers Go to Write (Poetry, Stories, Contests and more!), and tried to develop writing there. Nothing. Personally, what I have found, from lots of introspection (I write out my fears, frustrations, and just vent), is I\u2019m afraid of sharing and speaking out. Even after researching a topic, I cringe at providing insights or counter-arguments because I don\u2019t believe I would provide useful information or win the argument. So how do I get past it? I continue to analyze my fears around it. I find others who write, follow them and analyze their styles and what makes them tick. I think this is key because you begin to see, writing is also how the writer talks and would likely have a conversation. I\u2019m not a good conversationalist so I\u2019ve become more comfortable with the idea that I\u2019m going to suck at writing 100% of the time. Once you\u2019re able to get past the initial fears, start a routine and set aside an hour or so each day. Practice with writing prompts, go outside to a park/coffee shop/bridgewalk/riverwalk/bar/some bench and observe. Develop a story around what you\u2019re observing. For example, if you\u2019re at a coffee shop, buy a coffee and think about what would happen if you let that coffee sit there? If you were to chug the coffee, write about the pain that would ensue or \u201cwhy the fuck/jackassry\u201d of the actionWrite about the slow death of the coffee\u2019s temperature as it becomes lukewarm if you let it sit there.Write about how you like your coffee, two sugars with skim milk (I prefer black, and possibly a psychopath Psychopaths Are More Likely To Order This Drink)If you believe people who drink their coffee black are likely to be psycho, re-affirm it. If not, counter it.Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a step-by-step program that will help you. You have to practice writing, because it won't happen over night. Babies are not born talking their native language, they listen, practice, develop their voice, converse, develop meaning and continue talking. UPDATE: I also want to add. Finding others that write or listening to others is good, but it can be a detriment. Listen long enough to develop your voice. Do not listen endlessly so you are their voice. ",

            "answer_text": "By writing. I am writing lots of answers on Quora for this purpose. I have been learning how to say precisely what I know and how to say what I mean authentically, from the heart not just the head. I have learned for example that in my own voice I like to be clear and lucid but also amusing, though not when it might frustrate or offend. I am also learning the difference between saying too much and saying too little. The main thing that has helped me develop my authentic voice is to focus on the person asking the question and to address what exactly they want to know, and also how they could benefit and how they might feel having that knowledge.
