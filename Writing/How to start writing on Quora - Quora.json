            "answer_text": "Hi, Great Question. I assume you have tried answering some questions but couldn\u2019t form your opinion well. I understand. Happens with me a a lot (not just on quora). I have been using quora since I was 17 but wrote my first answer when after I turned 26. Yes, it took me almost 10 years. No, I was not afraid of writing. I just didn\u2019t write. Although i wanted to. Yet, I did not. (Lazy Much!!!) Here are some few tips that will help you write better Explore Quora: Extensively. Before writing your first answer, you should know how Quora works. What people are asking. What they are expecting from answers which brings me to my next point.Interact with other People\u2019s Content: Read. As much as you can. You want the motivation to write your first answer? Read other people\u2019s answers. read how people are reacting to their answers. Form an opinion of your own about the question. See if you can provide any input to the already mentioned answer. If yes, appreciated what\u2019s said and add something more. Do not agree with someone\u2019s answer? very well, appreciate their point of view and politely provide yours. Get into conversation with people here. You will notice that eventually you will have made a community of your own with people you admire from topics you are passionate about. Nothing is more contagious than like minded people in a group.Write your first short Answer: Congrats, you have come a long way. Now let\u2019s write your first answer. Find a question from the topic you know about. Trying Writing your first answer. For me it was Mathematics, i started solving teenagers\u2019 math problems to acquaint myself about writing here on quora.Make a Habit of Writing One Answer Daily: Make it one a habit of writing one answer no matter how shitty, everyday. You will notice that eventually your writing skills will improve and you will be telling somebody else, how to write their first answer.PS Do not mind any errors, this is my first real answer ",

            "answer_text": "Edit your writing. A lot of smart people will read your script. Research every bit of your article or answer All you write about will be examined for validity and accuracy. Write sincerely and with passion. It will make your words more interesting and sincere. Answer whatever question you attempt as succinctly as possible and don\u2019t waste words. Finally, only answer questions within your own areas of expertise. For example, if you are only average at maths don\u2019t answer complex math questions. Again if someone wants to know about people with an IQ of 170 and you are at 125 let someone with that IQ answer the question. That is, unless you have known someone that high in intelligence very well. Even then only someone in that category \u201cknows\u201d what it means to be a genius. If you pose questions, word them carefully and make sure they make sense in good grammatical English. If you are not sure of something have someone who has English \u201csmarts\u201d read your question (or answer). Some questions I\u2019ve read on Quora make no sense or are ambiguous. Don\u2019t make the reader \u201cguess\u201d at what you want to know. Make it crystal clear. What most of us like about Quora is the unexpected. If you have some unusual perception, insight, or story to give as an answer , even if it is shocking, say it and you will find a readership. You can also make your questions a bit eccentric, iconoclastic or unusual, because perhaps someone else wants to know the answer. ",

Answering in Quora require some mandatory rules to follow so that, it will not only make your answer better but also secure your answer from collapsing. Here they are- Use pointsUse the bulletins in a proper way. You ain\u2019t require to run down with garnishing sentences. Just to point lines in each bulletin.Reason:No one gives a shit to your garnishing in Quora. They want to gain knowledge in the shortest period they view your answer.PicturesI don\u2019t use pictures always but I suggest you to use as it gives an edge to your explanation.Sense of HumorFeel happy to write. Don\u2019t be in a hurry to gather views and upvotes. A pinch of sense of humor earns an upvote in Quora.Use bold, italicsHighlight the main words, sentences etc with bold fonts.Useless utilisationDon\u2019t try to be cool by playing with English. Well is well, not wellz. I hate, not only me, but all, those buzzing words.Don\u2019t use exclamation to show your expression. One \u201c?\u201d is enough to show your query. No meaning of, writing \u201c?????????\u201dHave a read over Quora Moderation onceIn my initial days many answers were collapsed. Then, I read those point.Now, I have written about 250\u2013300 answers and I think only 1\u20132 answers may be collapsed.Many of my answers get uncollapsed too.Regards, The Monotonous Panda ",

Suddenly One day a question struck me so deep that I had to answer it and trust me since then there has been no other activity I do in my leisure time except writing on Quora. Don't worry much about your answer, you learn as you write more and also there are good and kind Quorans who correct you on the way! Now that you have decided to Write some exceptional answers, I recommend you to use some of these tips to make your answer more appealing. Use Bullet points to write different points in anwers. (You can choose numbered one also).Use the Italics and BOLD fonts to write some important line or Words.Use Images in Your answers to make it more presentable. (Do write the source of images you are using).As I'm too a fresher in this feild, I can give just this much of advice, rest you will learn yourself as you go ahead. I hope it helps! Do Upvote if you like it. Peace. ",

Remember, do it with a pencil so that you could correct the erratas, because no one is perfect.Next, sit to type the answer. If it\u2019s difficult, you can use voice typing. Make sure you speak sound and clear.Or there\u2019s another way, despite of being more uncivilised and crude, this one is more natural. It\u2019s called go with the flow. Read a question, if you think you could answer that, start writing. Read your answer every once in a while before concluding. If you feel there\u2019s something that could be added later, because it needs more research, save the draft and finish it off later. I prefer the latter. ",

But this corona situation has taught me that we should just do what we really want to do instead of thinking what judgments we will get if we do certain things. Like you have asked this question because you want your answer to be formed perfectly so that no one will judge you that you haven\u2019t wrote correctly or whatever. I would say if you want to start writing so just write whatever comes in your mind, may be you\u2019re not perfect in starting but you can only learn things by doing it and making mistakes. And I believe, #Its not about writing good or bad, Its about letting your heart out and expressing things in words. How well you read your heart, the good the writer you become. :) ",
