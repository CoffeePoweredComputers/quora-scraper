            "answer_text": "I hate to say it because it\u2019ll sound so clich\u00e9, but the best way to become a good writer is to (1) read a lot of good writing and (2) write and write and write a lot. \u2018Good writing\u2019 is hard to find on the internet. I would suggest reading lots of books: for fiction read the most popular fiction novels from well-known writers; for nonfiction start by reading some of the best essays and letters written by famous authors. This advice holds true for beginning bloggers as well: learn from the best first (in books), then look to popular bloggers. ",
