            "answer_text": "I would dig deeper. \"Fast paced\" might be your gut response, and it probably hints at some real problem, but it's too broad to suggest solutions. If a doctor said, \"My prognosis is that you're sick with something,\" you'd want more information.  I direct plays more-often than I write fiction, but there's a similar hint that occurs in rehearsals: the play drags or rushes by too quickly. When this happens, it's a mistake to tell the actors to \"go faster\" or \"slow down.\" That would attack a symptom without treating the underlying cause, which would come back to bite me, later.  A too-slow pace usually means the stakes aren't high enough. I need to help the actors understand why each moment is so dire for their characters. A too-fast pace usually means they're not earning each moment: they're moving on to the next bit of behavior without really experiencing whatever prompts it.  Are you saying your story is confusing? That information is hitting the reader at a pace he can't manage, so he can't keep the characters and/or plot-points straight in his head? Specific details can help. \"And then there was Jimmy Two Times, who got that nickname because he said everything twice.\" (A line from the movie \"Goodfellas.\") Are you saying that you're \"telling rather than showing\"? Are you just explaining this happened, then that happened, the the next thing happened...? Are you forgetting to dunk the reader in the pool and let him feel the wetness of the water? Are you saying that characters are reacting in unrealistic ways, getting over shocking events more quickly than people normally would in real life? Are you saying that too-many dramatic events are occurring one after another, which makes your plot seem contrived? ",

            "answer_text": "Rhythm. When we write something, a few things dictate how we read it and therefore how it feels to read. I\u2019ve written from the perspective of a story rather than a screenplay, but a lot of this can be applied to dialogue and how things unfold. Tom ran to the shop. He opened the door. It was dark inside. The lights were always dim. How does this read? It\u2019s pretty fast and choppy, right? The sentence lengths are all short and unvaried. The word choice is also fairly simple, and most of the words are only one syllable. If the scene was likewise as short and lots of things were to happen, it\u2019d read ridiculously swiftly. Fragments, short paragraphs, short sentences, and choosing particular words all serve to speed up the pace. Likewise, the opposite helps to slow it down. Tom ran to the shop full-pelt, rounding the corner so swiftly he felt as if he\u2019d topple over. Pushing open the door he stepped inside the dimly lit store, a stark contrast from the bright sunlight outside, and let the door fall shut behind him. This reads slightly slower. By adding in detail, using longer sentences, and having less actually happen, we can slow down the pace of a scene. More of the words here have two syllables, and word choice is slightly less basic. By using sensory information, lingering over details, and allowing our character\u2019s to be introspective we can make the pace slower. Likewise, a longer scene will feel slower. We can go even further with the above example, although it might start to get silly, depending on what we\u2019ve already said. Tom ran down the street as quickly as he could, propelled forwards by fear. His mother wasn\u2019t known for her patience, and if he wasn\u2019t quick enough she\u2019d give him a beating. The money in his fist was already slick with sweat, and he held it ever tighter incase he dropped it. If it went rolling down the steep hill he might never find it again, and then he\u2019d be in real trouble, stuck in the spider-infested shed until his mother calmed down. There might come a point where you simply can\u2019t add in any more detail. You\u2019ve mentioned everything you need to mention. This is where sentence structure and word choice becomes more important. \u201cPunchy\u201d words, harsh sounds, these will make something read faster. The other thing to do is make sure your scene does everything a scene is meant to do. Make sure they aren\u2019t fragments of a scene, that it isn\u2019t just \u201cthis happens then this happens then this happens\u201d or it will feel too fast. I feel like the best thing to do would be to read some screenplays and compare them to movies - how does it translate to screen. Wish I had a more specific answer for you here. ",
