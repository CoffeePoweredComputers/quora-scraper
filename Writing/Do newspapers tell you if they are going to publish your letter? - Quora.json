            "answer_text": "Only once has this happened to me, when I asked the publisher not to use my name to protect the privacy of my daughter who\u2019d been sexually molested by a male teacher. My letter stated (correctly) that the teacher in question had been charged, convicted, and sentenced to perform \u201ccommunity service\u201d, which he\u2019d chosen to fulfill as the local District Commissioner for Boy Scouts. My letter asked the question: What kind of leader of men and boys would he, a convicted sex-offender, make? What attitudes would he impart if he felt it was acceptable for a teacher to molest a young girl? Of course, the newly appointed commissioner\u2019s name was widely known in the community, so there was no attempt to hide his identity. The publisher contacted me only to verify the truth of what I claimed and after investigating, he published my letter without my name. I\u2019ve had a fair number of letters published in local and national newspapers but that is the only time the paper contacted me prior to printing. ",
