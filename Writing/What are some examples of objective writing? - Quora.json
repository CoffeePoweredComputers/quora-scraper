            "answer_text": "You know when I worked for the Feds one of the requirements was write in an active instead of passive voice and be objective. Just the facts and the evidence had to support the facts. Objective writing for a lot of people is not easy to do because as human we want to side with somebody. We have the need or desire to side with the underdog or with the winner, for some reason we find it difficult to be non-biased, partial seems better because we want to please someone or something. In my job, I had to review the evidence, interview the parties involved in the case, and be objective. Side note being objective: For me, this past election was over with in November 2016 and President Trump is our president, that\u2019s a fact. But the Trump and Hillary crowd cannot let it go, everyone wants to be on someone\u2019s side. I find it extremely disheartening to have to read and/or hear \u201cMy Fellow Americans\u201d shout and scream daily at each other. We can\u2019t change the election. I often wonder who do most of my fellow-Americans support, the constitution or the political parties? The evidence show they support the political parties, which is a shame when they should be supporting the Constitution. I do not trust the parties because they created this divisiveness its makes money for them and to keep it going means more money in the party\u2019s pocket. Voters allow radio and TV personalities to fill their minds with BS. These personalities make more money than you and I could make in a life time. These guys need Americans to be mad and aggressive towards each other, it is a never-ending circle. Can you feel yourself in the Loop? Politicians talk about manufacturing jobs, the funny thing is if those jobs come back most will be robotics not a whole lot of folks would be able to qualify for these jobs, and there will be fewer employees, but there you are falling for a hopeless dream. Trying to be objective. You may interview someone who you feel (get you in trouble) is very nice and there is no way she was involved. Your mind start to see how nice she is offering you coffee, being at your bet and call with all the right answers, and her daughter is stunning, no way they are guilty of anything. So, you are at the office going over the evidence and your notes, reread regularion and the law, confiding in your coworkers, and now you start to write the report. In your mind, you may want to give them the benefit of the doubt by thinking there is no way they could have forgot to log in the tooth paste. They are too nice. Focus. Forget about the nice stuff, refuse the coffee, stop salivating and focus. Focus on the evidence the facts and nothing more. I may have not answered your question, but stick to the facts and stay away from partiality. ",
