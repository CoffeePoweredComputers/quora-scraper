It is better to aim at 2000 or more per day so that you have some time to allow the odd day when life gets in the way or you need to stop and think. I\u2019ve done it three times and I found there would be days when i wrote four or five thousand words and some days when I wrote none. I always seemed to encounter a point, around day 13 - 15 when I\u2019d realise that the time line was screwed up and I\u2019d have to go back and re-plot the structure. I always aimed to get done by November 28 to allow a read through and brief edit. All the books I wrote ened up being nearer to 60,000 words in the time. ",
