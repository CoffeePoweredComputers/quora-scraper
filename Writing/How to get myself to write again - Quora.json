            "answer_text": "I originally wrote a very long answer to this question, but I\u2019ve since trimmed it down. The rest of it is here, if you\u2019d like to read it. Some people say there\u2019s no such thing as writer\u2019s block, that it\u2019s resistance or laziness, or some other name. But giving it another name doesn\u2019t make it any less crippling if you have it. Personally, I think there are several different forms of writer\u2019s block, each with a different solution. If you feel stuck, ask yourself if one of these is going on with you: You\u2019re grieving. A friend who recently lost her mother told me, \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I just can\u2019t seem to write lately.\u201d This is normal. If you need to take some time away from the page and have the luxury of doing so, by all means do. Then come back to your story. Don\u2019t be surprised if you have a hard time getting back into the swing of writing. Be patient with yourself. If you have to spend a few days or weeks writing about how hard writing is, that\u2019s fine. Just write. You\u2019re depressed. Clinical depression make you feel drained and make it hard to force yourself to do much of anything, let alone write. If you have the symptoms of depression, the first thing you might need to do is get help. Here are some of them: you have trouble concentrating or remembering things; you have a hard time making decisions; you feel tired all the time; you feel hopeless or worthless; you can\u2019t sleep, or conversely, you want to sleep all the time; you feel constantly cranky or restless; you have no appetite, or conversely, you find yourself eating all the time; you\u2019re not interested in the things you used to be; your sex drive has plummeted; you feel empty inside; you feel achy and sick, but there seems to be no physical reason; you can\u2019t stop feeling sad or anxious; you\u2019re having suicidal thoughts. If any of that sounds familiar, get help. Then write. And above all, be kind to yourself. You\u2019re exhausted. If you\u2019re struggling with illness or overwhelming responsibilities, chances are good you\u2019re exhausted, both physically and mentally. If writing is important to you but you\u2019re constantly too worn out to do it, the first step is to be kind to yourself. Take care of your physical needs, like rest, good nutrition, and a good supplement. (I like the ones made by Shaklee.) Then figure out when you can squeeze in time to write. One of the most debilitating things we do to ourselves as writers is tell ourselves we must have a large block of time to write. But sometimes that block of time just doesn\u2019t exist. Consider taking a pen and a spiral notebook everywhere you go. When you have a few moments between appointments or in your dentist\u2019s waiting room, write down a few paragraphs or pages. You\u2019re afraid. Afraid it won\u2019t be good. Afraid people will laugh at you. Afraid you\u2019ll never be published. Or that you will. I get it. There\u2019s nothing like that beautiful, pristine novel you have in your mind. The one you put down on the page is never going to live up to that dream. Never. But it can be a darn good book nonetheless. The fear of not being good enough can be paralyzing, but the blank page isn\u2019t really as scary as you think. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect! Try interviewing your main character. Ask, \u201cWhat happened next? What did that feel like? What was she wearing? Then write down what you come up with. Remember, there\u2019s nothing you can do at this stage that can\u2019t be fixed. As for the rest of it, take it one step at a time. It\u2019s hard to write a book, but it\u2019s not hard to write a sentence, and then one more. Then a page. Then a chapter. When your first draft is done, you can worry about the rest if you want to. You made a wrong turn earlier in the manuscript. Sometimes you\u2019re struggling because you\u2019ve boxed yourself into a corner or made a wrong decision earlier in the book. Try picking a point in your story where you made a plotting decision. Ask yourself what would have happened had you made a different decision. Then just free write whatever comes to mind. Does it improve the story or untangle your knot? Pick a different point in the story and try again until you find your way through the block. Your writing muscles are rusty. There\u2019s nothing to do with this one except sit down and write. If you can write something every day, so much the better, even if it\u2019s just a paragraph. If your life is too uncertain even for that, set yourself a weekly goal and go for that instead. Pick a goal that will be easy for you to achieve. It may be a word count goal or a time-in-front-of-the computer goal. Either way, if you stick it out, your brain will throw up its metaphorical hands and give you the words you want. Gradually increase your goal until you\u2019re satisfied with your daily word count. You aren\u2019t really committed. A lot of people like the idea of writing, but they don\u2019t actually want to sit down and put words on a page. They don\u2019t actually want to write. They want to have written. And that\u2019s okay. Nobody is making you do this. You can write snippets for fun, chatty emails to family and friends, or nothing at all. Only you can decide if writing is something you\u2019d like to do or something you want to do. What\u2019s the difference, you ask? We dream about the things we\u2019d like. We work for the things we want. What next? So there you have it. I\u2019m sure there are other reasons for not writing, but I think most of them fall under one of these categories. Once in a book on writing, I came across this quote: Resistance always has meaning. If you can figure out where your resistance is coming from, you can get past it. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, the solution is just to sit down and put some words on the page. Once your brain knows you\u2019re going to write no matter how much it tries to squirm away, it will eventually give in. Then the words will flow. And some of them will even be good ones. ",

            "answer_text": "Please can we stop it with the mythical concept of writer\u2019s block. Unless you can accurately describe the symptoms, process, and the characteristics of \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d I am cynical of it\u2019s existence. You took pains to actually write this question, so I can assume that not all writing is \u201cblocked.\u201d I did a Google search and got this answer. The condition of being unable to think of what to write or how to proceed with writing. Does this sound like what you have? Yet you had the piece of mind to actually think to write this question. The good thing about writing is that you don\u2019t have to brute force anything except sitting in front of the blank page. No one is going to arrest you, or tackle you if you just start writing words. The pressure is off. Do you really miss it so much? There are times I go through dry spells, so to speak, but it\u2019s more a question of motivation than action. I have plenty of ideas on how to proceed, or sometimes no idea, but I choose to do other things. I\u2019ve also written terrible passages, bad passages, created horrible characters. I\u2019ve second guessed and criticized myself harshly. I\u2019m also lazy and just would rather do other things. One thing is clear about humanity, we do what we want to do. You can sugarcoat it, call it a dysfunction or a syndrome, but that is the central truth. We do what we want to do. This is similar to the adage, we like what we like. I think part of it is that we like the idea of being creative, of creating a novel, a work of art, but we don\u2019t want to go through the trouble of doing the work. I get a lot of great ideas when I am away from my keyboard, driving around, running errands. I get excited and motivated until that moment I sit in front of the keyboard. Then I do other things, get my distraction on, watch something on Netflix. How much am I really loving the idea of writing? Finally, don\u2019t beat yourself up so much about not writing, I know it sounds a little counter intuitive to what I said above, but it\u2019s true. There is more to the process of writing than writing. The logjam you speak of might be the culmination of \u201ctrying too hard.\u201d You should do other things. Maybe clean your room, go for a walk, listen to some music, read a book. Do something to occupy yourself. ",
