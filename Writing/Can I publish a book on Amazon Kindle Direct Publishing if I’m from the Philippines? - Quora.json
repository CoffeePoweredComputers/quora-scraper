            "answer_text": "Amazon Kindle enables people from the Philippines to create accounts. You can upload books regardless of where you are for the most part. Whether you\u2019re in the Philippines or any other country, except for some banned countries, you can publish your books to the Amazon Kindle platform. In fact, a lot of Filipinos have made quite a bit of money from Kindle Direct Publishing. As you probably already know, there are a huge number of Filipinos who speak English as a second language. This is a strategic advantage that a lot of Filipinos are using to earn dollars through the Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing platform. Your main challenge is not on the platform. Your main challenge is to produce a book that people would actually want to read. This is where promotions come in. You can\u2019t just publish it and hope and wish that somehow, someway, someone will buy your book. It doesn\u2019t work that way. If you want to be successful in the Amazon Kindle Direct publishing, you have to be proactive. You have to create social media accounts to promote your author brand and your books. You also have to create a mailing list. There are a lot of things that you need to do to make a good living from the passive income generated by your Kindle books. You can also try blogging. ",
