            "answer_text": "Biden has run a pretty by-the-book and competent campaign. He hasn\u2019t made any glaring errors. He is still leading the polls and his lead has been stable and steady for a long time. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s run a bad campaign at all. So, no, I don\u2019t think Sanders would have been a stronger choice. Sanders had a lot of negatives against him: health issues (people bring up Biden\u2019s mental health \u201cissues\u201d, but conveniently forget that Sanders had a heart attack during the campaign), appearance of being too extreme, lack of Black voter support that he never tried to fix, unenthusiastic Democratic Party support, a voter base that doesn\u2019t vote (college kids, Latinx, etc.), past comments about communism, aggressive personality, sloppy campaigning, lack of enthusiasm among female voters, to name a few. Sanders wouldn\u2019t have been able to build a coalition of voters to counter Trump\u2019s enthusiastic and motivated base. A lot of on the fence moderates would be turned off by some of Sanders\u2019 policies and wouldn\u2019t stomach voting for him. They might have either stayed home or hold their nose and vote for Trump. Biden is at least a tolerable alternative to moderates and even some Republicans. Never Trump Republicans might vote for Biden and they could be the difference in this election for a Trump defeat. Could you see them vote for Sanders who stands for pretty much everything they are against? I doubt it. ",

            "answer_text": "Bernie doesn't have dementia. So that would be something positive. What most people don\u2019t know is that Bernie did not want to be President. He ran in the primary at the request of the Democrat leadership. They asked for this, so they could make it appear that Hilary \u201cwon\u201d the primary. Bernie then did it again for the Democrats, so that Biden could appear to have \u201cwon\u201d the primary. Bernie campaigns a bit, then, on-que, endorses the \u201cwinner\u201d. He brings on board his followers (the Democrat leadership needs them). Why did Bernie do this? He did it to make money. The Democrats helped Bernie to set up a media company, in his wife\u2019s name. Bernie then laundered his campaign \u201ccontributions\u201d (Some of these from Democrats) through his wife\u2019s media company. The media company keeps 15% off the top. This is above the costs and expenses. This scam is allowed by law (politicians wrote this law). The media company and the campaign can use the rest of the money to cover all other expenses, for both the media company and the campaign. It is estimated that Bernie netted up to $15 million personally, in his families pocket, for each of these runs. That is a lot of money. Bernie, who has never had a real job, \u201cneeded\u201d the money for his retirement. So Bernie is like Biden in that he is very corrupt. No use asking your question because Bernie in no way wanted to be President. The Dems wouldn\u2019t let him anyway. Bernie, like Biden, was after money. ",

            "answer_text": "Of all the dozen or so candidates who vied for the presidential chair, the two most honest ones were Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard. While most of us don\u2019t agree with Bernie Sanders\u2019 socialistic position, there is no question that he tells the truth as he knows it. You can\u2019t say that for other wishful candidates, including Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. To repeat, the two most honest were Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard. To revisit your question: \u201cAfter witnessing Biden's campaign, do you think Bernie Sanders would have been a stronger choice?\u201d Yes, I do, but he didn\u2019t resonate with moderate Democrats. However, with Biden/Harris, I believe the moderate Democrats are in for a real surprise when they finally realize just how far left the Democrat Party and Biden/Harris have become. At least, as I said, the moderate ones will, of which there aren\u2019t many moderates left in Washington, D.C. The radical left has taken over the party. ",

The evidence of that is reflected in the public opinion polls that show him beating Donald Trump handily throughout the country and in the key battleground states. Bernie Sanders ran a very poor campaign in the primaries. The evidence of that is he lost to Biden by a wide margin. That means Joe Biden is a much stronger choice than Bernie Sanders. Just count the votes. They tell the whole story. ",

Conversely, Biden has no energy, as evidenced that he needed Obama\u2019s help to drag him over the finish line just to get the nomination.

Today, he\u2019s a nothing on the stump\u2026 when he\u2019s actually out of his basement.

His subordinates was also problematic he can\u2019t control them. I think how Bernie behaved with his loss in 2016 is what also turned off voters. ",
