            "answer_text": "You can send your query letter to as many agents as you want to. Most will only ask for the first n chapters or a certain number of words. If anyone asks for the full manuscript, it generally means they want to read it, so it\u2019s courteous to ensure that two or more agents are not reading it at the same time. Courteous. Not compulsory. I generally advise authors to explicitly give an agent a maximum of 3 months in which to read the manuscript. Most don\u2019t dare to do it explicitly. But even if you don\u2019t tell them that\u2019s your rule, make it your rule. And even if an agent has accepted the full manuscript, keep querying if you find other agents who might be interested.

If either of them knows you are sending it elsewhere, they may not be happy with your business practices, but if they want your work, they\u2019ll have to deal. When agencies and publishers make authors wait, sometimes for months, even a year or two before making a decision, they really shouldn\u2019t claim a right to individual treatment. One way to hint at what you are doing instead of saying \u201cthis is a multiple submission\u201d which most agencies abhor, is to say in your cover letter something along the lines of, \u201cI\u2019d be happy to send you a copy of my full manuscript if you\u2019re interested.\u201d (But don\u2019t use the italics the way I just did.)
