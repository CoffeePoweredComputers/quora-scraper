            "answer_text": "Ironically as my production of writing goes up, the amount of reading I do for enjoyment goes down. It is simply a matter of finite time. However, I\u2019ve spent much of my life as a \u201cbook worm\u201d before I started writing with the intent to publish my own writing (outside of the training that I write for companies). When I hear people discussing classical literature that they would like to read sometime in the future, I\u2019ve usually read those books already. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I strongly believe that to be an author one has to be a reader first. Only if one knows the joy that can be experienced in reading, can he be able to bring the same to others. Yes, authors do read books. Sometimes for reference and sometimes for pleasure. In fact, I've found subtle references to other books while reading some authors. ",
