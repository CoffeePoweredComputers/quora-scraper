            "answer_text": "Step one - who is your target audience?  If you think it will be graduating seniors, then advertising on sites frequented by college seniors is the place to start. Step two - identify (and thus advertise) the value that your service brings.  Have people been successful in using your service?  (do you keep stats?  If not, perhaps start);  are you willing to start from scratch (for one price) but able to tweak an existing resume for fewer dollars; how will your resume fare if companies are using software to screen?  etc. Step three.  Can you get former clients to comment favorably on your service?   Step four - can you get a speaking engagement (free) at a university or college (through student services perhaps) on how to prepare a resume?  Many students will pay for you to do it rather than do the work themselves if you can present helpful information.  (not all advertising has to be on-line). Step five - create a great web site, complete with helpful hints and articles so that people can find information - plus your service -whether they are job hunting or college seniors. Step six - do a weekly blog on items of general interest to job hunters - not just resume writing but also things such as interviewing skills, job seeking strategies etc. ",
