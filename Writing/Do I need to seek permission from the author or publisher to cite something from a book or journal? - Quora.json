            "answer_text": "For citation - eg \u201cShah (2012) reports\u2026..\u201d no permission is required (though of course you will make sure that the full reference in included in the ref list or as a footnote). For verbatim quotes - that is using the exact phrases or sentences that are in the original paper - also no permission is necessary. Though for lengthier quotations - such as several paragraphs or sub-sections - it would be a good idea to seek permissions. Photographs, diagrams, charts and table normally require a permission from the copyright holder. Overall if in doubt best to seek permission from the copyright holder. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It is a good practice to seek formal permission to cite passages from someone else\u2019s books. Normally, writers don\u2019t mind this, if the passages are small. If you are just using such passages for your reference and writing something else based on that, then just mention the name(s) of the book(s) at the end, in reference section. ",
