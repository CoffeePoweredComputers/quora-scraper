            "answer_text": "The best way I can think of would be to pick someone whom you actually admire. If they must be living, someone that comes to mind for me is Barack Obama. If you can pick anyone in history or deceased people I think of are - Stephen Hawking and Martin Luther King Jr. Somethings depend on what type of Essay you are writing. But I\u2019m general I would say after you pick someone do a little research about their lives including gathering information on their religion, family, movements they were a parts of , honors they received, etc. Another great essay tip to remember would be to start with an introduction that will hook your audience in like maybe a quote that was said by that person. I hope these tips help! XX ",
