Thanks to my bud, Bassel C! His words with what I was searching for at the time when I needed the right words to describe what I was going through? (Boom) Bassel! For some odd reason when I was looking up the word superiority on Google? I came across the word \u201cNarcissism\u201d and didn\u2019t think much of it at first but what I saw was right in front of my face. The answers to what I needed to know, were right there for me to see. \u201cWhich hurts because I knew what I was dealing with will never work\u201d \u201cA Covert Narcissist\u201d As far as healing from Quora? No, this site has given me new light and more information on Narcissism/Narcy/Narcissist/Narc/Narcopath any of these names has helped me move on. What I do seek is a psychiatrist/therapist and talk about this shitty abuse to my new helper. She\u2019s giving me insight on how to grow from this crappy relationship. What Quora does do for me. I share my stories through certain questions and I also try and help others get a better understanding of Narcissistic abuse. If there\u2019s anyone out there struggling with their relationships? I try and help them get out of Hell and into a better place of understanding. Help them heal. I\u2019m full of great energy and I want to help others escape Hell. Hell sucks! Quora is a great place to write your pain and get it out of you no matter how it sounds. People need to hear this stuff. It\u2019s not fun seeing your soul rot away over some jerk who never loved you. They\u2019re only in it to use and abuse you. So, has Quora help me heal from narcissistic abuse? No, it has not! It\u2019s therapeutic for me to write. That\u2019s about it! Oh, I get to meet some of the best people on the planet! That\u2019s the best part about this site! So many awesome amazing souls are right here. Much love to all of you! Your fellow Quoran, Dane Staton! ",

            "answer_text": "Has anyone healed from narcissistic abuse just by reading Quora answers? Thanks for the A2A. I can't really answer for everyone else, but I can tell you how Quora has helped me. I literally stumbled upon Quora about a year ago. I had some pretty bad relationships\u2026 all mental, psychological, emotional crap. For years I thought I was the problem. My first experience with a narcissist was in 2006, I married him. We were together for about 3 years, we have a child together, I had a son from a previous relationship, but I had never had a relationship like that one. And because of my low self-esteem and low self confidence I just thought I wasn't trying hard enough. I had a couple of really bad relationships after that that were somewhat similar to that marriage. I did not know anything about narcissism other than hearing the word on crime shows on TV every now and then. The first time I heard of Quora was through an email from Quora. I had no idea what it was so I skipped over the email and went about my day, but I kept kind of wandering what this Quora thing was. A couple weeks later, I got another email from Quora, and this one had a question-and-answer on it. I don't remember which question it was but I remember reading it and going, \u201dHuh, maybe I should check this Quora thing out.\u201d When I got home from work that day, I opened Quora and I started reading\u2026and I started to realize that the confusing, chaotic relationships that I had were not one of a kind. After reading many, many answers that correlated so closely with what happened to me, I was pretty intrigued. It wasn't until that time that I realized that it didn't matter how hard I tried, it never would have been enough. And let's be honest, I'm not going to say that I never started any fights, I'm not going to say that I never argued back, I'm not going to say that I was perfect by any means, but what I can say is that I was confused, I was frustrated, I was lost. All the while I was trying to heal from a bad relationship, I finally, through Quora, discovered that the hurt I have been trying to heal went much deeper than what I had ever realized. Being on Quora has taught me so much. I finally learned about what I was trying to heal from. Being able to read stories from other people who completely understood what I had been through was literally a Godsend. I'm not completely healed, but i don\u2019t think that we ever completely heal. I never went to counseling, which I probably should have, but in learning that I wasn't alone, it gave me a greater understanding of what I had gone through. Reading advice and stories and revelations from other narcissistic abuse victims, gave me the confidence to start sharing parts of my own story. In doing so I began helping other people\u2026which is something I've always wanted to do anyway. So can one be healed from narcissistic abuse simply through Quora? I don't know if you can ever be 100% healed, but being able to read and share stories, and learning that other people have lived through this too... that other people completely understand your chaos makes it a lot easier to deal with. The last 13 years of my life have been chaos, but in the last year I've been able to answer more of my own questions about what happened, and I've been able to make a lot more sense of parts of my life.

Quora fulfill mainly the first few OH SO IMPORTANT STEPS on the road for recovery. 1- VALIDATION Yes it really happened. You are not crazy, what you think you saw or partially remembered wad really there. You where betrayed my dear, more then you can even imagine at the moment. (the whole picture will appear over time, when you are ready) 2- He/she will never change (this one need many many many repetitions :) 3- It\u2019s not only you. It happened to me, Martin, Sophie, Paul, Claudia, Veronica, Maude, Stewart, Rain, Sara, Stephen, Bev, Anjela, Mark, Christine, Bassel, Pathy \u2026\u2026etc\u2026.. etc\u2026\u2026. 4- Being free to express anger, disgust, frustration, and puzzlement. No no no, don\u2019t try to explain yourself with the narcissist. Anyway we all know you tried already. Tell me, did it work? Usually, it takes hundreds, or thousands of repetitions so the brain slowly start to \u201cget it\u201d and disconnect from \u201cnarcland\u201d. Quora play\u2019s the very important role of repeating the same things over and over again with different words and in different forms, different peoples, different styles, over and over again until you start trusting your own judgment, your own impressions, emotions and feelings. And from that solid base, you can choose to start healing. When you feel validated enough, then you can decide to begin the road for recovery\u2026.. either alone, or with a good friend, or with a therapist (don\u2019t talk about narcissism, just describe the abuse) or my second favorite approach; with a coach (tons of them on youtube, choose a style you like, and contact them) or \u2026. my personal favorite, with workbooks like \u201cYou Can Thrive After Abuse from\u201d Melanie Tonia Evans\u201d or \u201cCodependent Now What?\u201d from Lisa A Romano or \u201cI Miss Me...and I Want Me Back!! \u201d from Michelle Nieve. So\u2026\u2026 many possible roads for healing, but none of this could possible without the Oh! So important phase of validation and confirmation of the abuse. After a while, you will see most people go forward and start living again\u2026\u2026 UPTDATE 10 september 2019: After reading about 80 books on the topic, the best by far is The Betrayal Bond by Patrick J Carnes. So my recommended healing kit would be: (for serious, motivated healers only) 1- The Betrayal Bond: Braking Free of Exploitative Relationships from Patrick J Carnes Free preview here The Betrayal Bond 2- Boundaries after a pathological relationship Adelyne Birch 3- Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker Good luck kind souls and me God bless you along the road. \u2665\u2665\u2665 ",

And that is what Quora does. It simply lets us be in touch with others who have been through the same experiences. My ex like many others, smeared me hard. She accused me of just about anything one can imagine short of physical abuse. To be able to talk with others, to learn that I am believed and to know that I am not alone, is nothing short of amazing when one is trying to heal. As we know a narcissist wants to isolate us, and control us. I\u2019m a big guy, ex was a diminutive blonde. Who was ever going to believe me over all her accusations? I had so many flying monkey\u2019s swarming around, I needed a 10 foot swatter to keep them at bay. But experts don\u2019t tell you about \u2018love bombing\u2019 and flying monkey\u2019s and smears and gaslighting and Grey Rock and discarded. That information comes from people who have been down in the trenches. From those people who helped me understand what bus flattened me. Just from Quora\u2026. no. But I am healing because of Quora! I am proud to be a Narcissistic Survivor from Quora! ",

But on here, I have found all the answers that I need to explain why I feel the way I do. On here, has taken away some of that guilty I'm to blame feelings that I had. from this site, I now understand why mutual people look at me as if I'm crazy based off of what the narc has told them. I could never figure out why people that I don't even know, had such negative vibes towards me. It also has allowed me to know what's coming from the narc. And believe me, it's the same repetitive crap all the time. This site has allowed me to say what I feel instead of keeping it all bottled up for fear of retaliation from the narc. The best thing about this site, is that I'm not alone. My narc made me feel like I was the only person in the world that thought he was a piece of s***. That my morals were somehow screwed up. That everyone knew I was crazy but me, and that they were all laughing at me because they weren't my friends. It makes you become very attached to the narc when you feel that the world's against you. And that's exactly what they go for. Complete and total dominating control. ",

I kept a journal to reread to make sure I wasn\u2019t losing my mind. I kept trying to detach from the quickest way I knew how and his lack of control made him furious! The more you keep taking away, the more you can gain your self esteem and not have to deal with power plays. I am no contact with him. I was somewhat guarded but was motivated to keep running from him. I am in a new relationship with a man who cares for me, enjoys doing things with me\u2026. No games, no power struggle, no guilt\u2026and have the groundwork supportive of a great new beginning. I was blind to the control in my marriage. But I feel so light and free now. So I guess I can say I am healed.. ",
