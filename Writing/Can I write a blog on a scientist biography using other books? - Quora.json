            "answer_text": "Yes, you can write Blog on scientist biography provided you enjoy writing about scientist without expecting many people to read at early. In your initial days of blogging it's very hard to get traffic. It takes between 3\u20136 months to for Google to know that your blog or site is online, only after that it refers people to your place. But this doesn't mean you don't have work to do. You can write through books and get Knowledge through other sources like podcasts, documentaries, interviews etc. To conclude - Have patience for atleast 6 months and keep making yourself more familiar with your niche and blogging best practices. You can blog about pretty much anything provided you have interest in it and please make sure that when you write blog, you write as one on one perspective. Read about your niche and get Knowledge on it. I suggest if you want to blog. Don't have second thoughts. Just buy domain and hosting and make your WordPress website. Important tip - There is market for everything. You make your content interactive and educating and have patience. If you do good work, you will be appreciated. Thanks ",
