            "answer_text": "Handguns are restricted in Canada but are not banned, nor are they likely to be so. They simply aren\u2019t a problem. Many of us Canadians own several handguns, all of which are legally purchased and registered. We belong to fish and game clubs and are allowed to transport them from our home to the range as long as they are safely stored and secured while en-route. It\u2019s this little thing called responsible gun ownership. We\u2019re not interested in openly carrying shoulder-slung rifles or holstered handguns into Starbucks either since we don\u2019t need to do so. People who do that in the US are usually just showing off or posturing to make a point. Or using the size and power of the gun to compensate for something smaller. For personal defense I carry a couple of rolls of pennies that fit easily into my fists and won\u2019t raise questions should I be questioned by police after an incident. Unless they happen to notice a little bit of blood on them. It\u2019s easier to wipe the blood off a plastic library card so that\u2019s my preferred weapon should I be in the position of needing to defend myself. ",
