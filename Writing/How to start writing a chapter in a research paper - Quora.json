Why is it important? What is the state of affairs today? What is the part that is not known yet (where I\u2019ll contribute)? What are my methods (or point of view)? What are my results? What do they mean? Conclusion. ",

If you visit Tom March\u2019s Thesis Builder you can answer a few simple questions and generate an outline that will get you started on writing your research paper. You can also check out my Practical Research (from idea to outline) that will walk you through creating an outline for your Introduction, Literature Review, and Methodology chapters. Hope that helps.
