            "answer_text": "Meeting minutes are a summary of the actions taken and the discussions that are had in the meeting. Smart meeting minutes software generally makes minutes management easier & simpler but some organizations don't employ them due to several reasons. Here\u2019re some of the tips that you can use for meeting management. -\tBe prepared for the meeting: Make sure that you are ready for the meeting. Make sure you arrive early, so that you can set up your writing station before the meeting starts. -\tKeep it simple: Remember that your notes do not have to consist of a word-for-word record of what everyone says in the meeting. You don\u2019t have to jot down every idea \u2013 just focus on the ones that are agreed upon, and make a note of who suggested it. -\tListen before writing Listen to each point first before trying to write everything down. This way, you will be able to figure out what needs to be recorded, and to summarize what was said. -\tUse bullet points and keywords: Instead of using full sentences, make use of bullet points to write down lists of suggestions and comments. Using keywords is a lot quicker and easier than writing out full sentences. If you use a meeting minutes recording software that allows electronic record of minutes, you can revisit meetings as they take down complete record. -\tUse a comfortable method: If you are comfortable using your laptop to record your minutes, then do that. Do not make things complicated for yourself by writing everything down on a notepad if you are comfortable using a different recording method. -\tWrite meeting minutes while you still remember: Don\u2019t leave writing up your minutes until the meeting is a distant memory. Use the meeting agenda to remind yourself what topics were discussed. -\tUse Tables: A tabular format works well for minutes. Use three columns- item number, discussion summary and action owner. -\tStart with an action review Whether or not you reviewed the actions from last time at the beginning of the meeting put them at the start of the minutes. Write down all the actions from the last meeting and a summary of progress against them. So, these are 8 tips that you can use for meeting management. However if you are using a smart online meeting minutes software, meeting management can be made easier and more efficient, at the same time. ",

            "answer_text": "The only way to get good at something is through practice.  Since minutes are a really high-stakes type of practice, you should create your own system which will make you comfortable, you should not even look at what others are doing. So, let's say that you are an action-oriented person (well, I am), so my drive will be actions, if you will: a sort of a checklist with columns, so anyone who looks at it can know what has been done, what is pending, what has been closed, and what is projected for the future. My thinking is that there would be columns for \"Item\" - could be anything at all, then \"Status\" - this could be \"Pending\" or \"Open\" or \"Not started yet\" or \"Projected to be started on\" or \"Closed\" or \"In revision\" or anything else you want it to be, but for the sake of simplicity, items can either be open or closed. Closed items would have closure date (month and year), and open items would have a responsible party attached to them. Almost like project management: if the item is open, it needs to be reviewed and if someone has questions, they need to know whom to ask. This will further prompt a better revision of the minutes by participants - if they are tagged in error to something, they will be the first ones to let you know about it. And this is what the minutes are for - to make sure that everyone has heard and agreed to the same thing, so there are no miscommunications or lapses in established tasks. ",
