During the colonial era, Malappuram was the headquarters of European and British troops and later it became the head quarters of the Malabar Special Police (M.S.P). It was home to the Khilafath movements and the Mappila revolts, contributing immensely to India's freedom struggle and they never ever demanded the name \"Mappilastan\" in fact they demanded the district which is called \u2018Malappuram\u2019.

It had 9 districts - Trivandrum, Quilon, Alleppey, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Trichur, Palghat, Calicut, and Cannanore. Four districts were extra-larger - Cannanore, Calicut, Kottayam, and Quilon. Malappuram district was formed to reduce the size of Calicut. Later Kasaragod was formed to reduce the size of Cannanore. One more district namely Wayanad was formed by taking parts of Cannanore and Calicut. Through the formation of Idukki district, the size of Kottayam district was reduced. Through the creation of Pathanamthitta district, the size of Kollam district was reduced. And now the shapes of districts are scientific enough to administration.  Thank you. ",
