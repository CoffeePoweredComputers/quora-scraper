            "answer_text": "I really don't know why this question exists. I've been here for centuries and there is no way you can grow up without at least knowing what I am. You cannot count without me! You should've learned about me by now.  It's ok . I think I can understand. You may not be human after all. I'm guessing you are from another world, here to know specially about me. In that case, let me introduce myself...and that's going to be the sole reason I'm going to answer this question on Quora. I've been here longer than the humans have, yet they only know about me recently. I mean, is it so hard to get noticed around here?!  I've observed humans since their genesis. I've seen them struggle with even the simplest of things like counting. Their usual number system was flawed, and they didn't notice this for years. You see, I would've introduced myself to them long back, but I had no way of talking to them directly. All I could do was sulk at them trying to figure out counting to higher numbers. And without me, that was difficult.   Around 300 BC, the Babylonians did what I thought would never happen: They noticed me...but only as a concept. They needed something that would act as a placeholder, and they used a symbol for that. I was never acknowledged as a number. Forward 600 years, the Mayans had a concrete use for me, yet they didn't use me for their calculations. I must admit, the Indians are to be credited too, for they have even acknowledged me as a number. They knew I was \"nothing\". That's something! A human named Brahmagupta showed that I was unique and had special properties. And for the first time in years, I felt important. As my use grew, so did my reputation. A lot of people came to know about me. This included Arabs, who were the ones that spread my importance to the western world.   But alas! I was never welcomed by the Europeans. I was banned from being used, but some traders used me secretly. It took another 300 years until I was widely accepted. It was people like Fibonacci that helped me be trusted by everyone. The journey was long. I have taken up different forms along the way, but it was all worth it. I finally have citizenship in the country of numbers. I must admit, I've seen a huge population boost in the country since I started living here. ;) At first, the other digits disliked me, because they saw me as an intruder. Not saying they are wrong, but it had to be done. I had no other choice.   I had to gain their trust somehow. And I did everything I could. I know for sure I'm an extrovert, and that when alone, I feel like nothing. When I'm with the other digits, there is a huge increase in positive aura. The other digits noticed this too. When they feel alone, I join them, and instantly, they feel more valuable. However, I'm not a good leader...I am better off as a follower, and I'm a really good one too.   Slowly, the other digits started to acknowledge that I am a great addition to the team. We realized that our friendship has no bounds, when I'm with them.   So that's it about my introduction. How am I useful to you, you ask?I'm a unique number. I'neither positive nor negative. I always have a neutral opinion about everything. On the number line, I come at the exact center of two infinities. Well, that's actually important, as I behave as a boundary to many things, which makes me a natural starting point for many scales.   None of the understanding of the world humans have could've been properly understood if I wasn't used. Although humans have found me fairly recently, I've been integrated into their lives so much, that they cannot do without me. The computer the human I'm controlling to write this answer with, only understands a language which I am a part of. All the information in this world would mean nothing if I wasn't present. And I represent nothing. See the irony there? Apart from the fact that I make things infinitely large, I can also make them infinitely small. Am I God? I could be. And you shall worship me. People have feared me in the past. I can bring down any large number if I wanted to. I can bring up any small number, if I wanted to. Be careful while trying to divide with me. It is taboo. Time and space may collide, volcanos might erupt violently, black-holes may die out, even the earth can get destroyed, all because someone somewhere thought it was a good idea to divide other numbers with me. That's what I am. An omnipotent God in the land of numbers, perhaps even  the universe. And here you are, questioning my existence. I could  destroy you if I could. I choose not to, because I want your people in  your planet to know me very early, so that they can praise me early. And  you can help spread the word. I'll visit your planet soon. Be sure to  give me a better symbol.   All this narcissism, and I haven't told you my name yet. I'm nothing. I can make anything something. I'm the creator of values, and a destroyer too. I'm the legend that changed the numeric system for humans. I am...ZERO.  Part of the information (especially the history) is taken from here.  The origin of Zero in India is debatable, because there aren't many evidence that clearly signify this. I believe Indians did have a play in the modern value of Zero. Perhaps, copyright laws should've been created in those times :D ",

            "answer_text": "Despite what many (all?) top mathematicians say, zero is a number, not just a concept. Obviously, every number is a concept. As with all concepts it is impossible to define zero perfectly. For example, human beings cannot distinguish the difference between standing still and moving at a constant speed. Is the difference between not traveling at all and traveling at 10,000 mph zero? A scientist may ay \u201cYes\u201d but really we all know that there is a huge difference between moving and not moving. Similarly, in Maths, if you add 6 cubes of sugar to a glass of water and then take away those 6 cubes of sugar then, mathematically, you have zero spoons of sugar in the glass of water. Again, in reality, we know that even after removing all 6 cubes of sugar from the glass of water it is still going to taste a little sugary when you drink it. You have zero apples left when one boy eats one apple. You have zero apples when 100 boys eat 100 apples. But there\u2019s a huge difference in ensuring that one boy gets one apple and 100 boys each get one apple. Even putting aside the money, giving food to 100 poor children is very different from giving food to 1 poor child. So, yes, zero is, indeed, a concept, not just a number. But you can\u2019t understand the concept without a symbol to represent it. Infinity is represented by a symbol that (to me) looks like two circles laid next to each other while a zero is just one circle. Either way, you need a symbol. Everything needs a symbol and every symbol needs a name and a function and so on. We are unable to discuss anything that has no name. We invent names for things that have no names if we want to discuss those things. Zero is a name for an idea. The idea is basically that of nothingness. Maths uses a circle as a way to symbolise that idea visually and use it in calculations. However, there are ways around the use of zero in Maths. This is obvious because the invention of a circle to represent zero is a relatively recent invention in Maths (less than 1,500 years old). ",
