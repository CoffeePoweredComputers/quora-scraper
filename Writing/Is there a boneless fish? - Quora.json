            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a tiny fish, probably a baby smelt that\u2019s called \u201cWhite Rice Fish\u201d (translation of it\u2019s Cantonese name) that\u2019s consumed all over South East Asia and probably China. It can be purchased in most Asian food markets in frozen packages. These fish do have bones but the fish and it\u2019s bones are so soft and tiny that the entire fish can be eaten whole, it\u2019s the closest to being truly boneless fish that I know of. It\u2019s usually made into an omelette with eggs or it\u2019s deep fried with salt and pepper. ",
