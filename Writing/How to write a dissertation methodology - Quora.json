And possibly you have also elaborated on the means by which these scholars have derived their conclusions or the theories on which they focused, and the methods they\u2019ve adopted to collect, compile and present the information. Once you\u2019re done making your specific observations and have had conversations with your mentor about it, to organize how you\u2019re going to deal with your research question. This could be determining how you\u2019ll collect the details, or what techniques you\u2019ll apply to analyze the information.

Hence, no matter which topic you\u2019re focusing on, the methodology part must contain the following- Reminding the main points of questionsThe fundamental factor to validate your dissertation methodology lies in highlighting that it is capable of addressing the research problem or questions you mentioned at the beginning. You should rehash the major questions you wish to address when structuring your methodology, but this doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a word-to-word recap, you can rephrase the problem in a manner that connects your dissertation methodology and literature review. A discussion on your research design or methodYou can consider this part to be the heart of the methodology, but not the methodology itself. The research design may be quantitative or qualitative or a blend of two ( mixed) to achieve more credible results. The research designs that you set should be in sync with the research question, hypothesis and the direction of the research. You can draw out three, four or more goals for your research design Goal A: Validating pre-existent hypothesis Goal B: Finding the relationship between the variables in research Goal C: Testing the difference of the outcome in control conditions and in general Goal D: Finding out application groups for your research Goal E: Testing for difference under various control conditions Goal F: Testing for variables affecting change in different control conditions Goal H: Ratifying the experiment protocol measurements Note: There are many other goals that needs to be considered before drawing out the research design, specific to the objectives and sub-objectives of the research and the research question.

Similarly if you are conducting a research on new software launch, you would have to focus on quantitative and qualitative aspects of the use of functionalities of the software and more. An analysis of the research methods adopted, and insight on their limitationsNo research method is flawless, and it\u2019s possible that the one you\u2019ve selected comes with certain drawbacks. You might, for example, have decided to carry out small-scale interviews as the individual perspectives on the particular issue you\u2019re analyzing, is more significant to you.
