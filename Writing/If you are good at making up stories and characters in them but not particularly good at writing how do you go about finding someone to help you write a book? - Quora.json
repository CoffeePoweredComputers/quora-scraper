            "answer_text": "Ok, here\u2019s the thing, are you good at writing stories, but aren\u2019t great with conjugation or sentence structure? Or are you good at telling stories, but have difficulties actually putting them on paper? If you can write an engaging story, then an editor can help you with the proof-reading. I\u2019ve seen some early manuscripts which were just dreadful in the technical aspects of English; but were quite good and captivating from a story perspective. (Full disclosure here, I helped edit short story collections by-and-for college students, I am not now; or have I ever been a professional). If your story is good, then just put it down on paper. And see if someone will take a flyer on it\u2026heck self-publish to Amazon and see if people will suggest edits for you. If you\u2019d rather not publish a rough work, take a writing class; and try to enlist members of your class and/or your teacher/professor to proof-read your work. If you\u2019re good at telling stories, but struggle to make it compelling on the page\u2026well, that\u2019s a far more common problem; and not one with a lot of solutions for. Writing a compelling and internally consistent story is truly where most just fail. It\u2019s hard\u2026not everyone can do it\u2026and in my experience the hill that most people can\u2019t get over. As an aspiring writer, I\u2019ve come up with dozens of \u201cgreat ideas\u201d which puttered out two chapters in\u2026others that I just couldn\u2019t get over the \u201chump\u201d, and create a compelling arch for. Writing is tough, if you can write a good story\u2026then you\u2019re better off putting it down on the paper yourself, and looking for someone to edit things with you. If you\u2019re not able to write\u2026then work on the craft, and who knows in a few years, you may just write a complete work\u2026at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping (being an aspiring writer with a dozen or so unfinished novels in my cloud graveyard) will happen with me if I keep at it. I know the odds that I\u2019ll get published are infinitesimal\u2026but I write because I\u2019m compelled to\u2026and I couldn\u2019t imagine someone doing it for me. I\u2019m primarily a hobbyist, and I know that if I ever write a novel, and it gets published; it\u2019ll probably my one and only work. ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t. You write the book, then get it professionally edited and proofread. You get it out on Amazon, and take the heat of nasty reviews complaining about your lack of editing, too many commas, not enough commas, commas in the wrong place, typos, spelling, words missing, words duplicated, wrong words, badly formed sentences, bad flow, bad yada yada yada. You write the next book, with all the crap thrown at you for the first book in mind. Rince and repeat. Somewhere around a million words published, you\u2019ll wonder why you asked this question. You don\u2019t get help to write a book. You write it, and then get help to polish it. But learning to polish takes a lot of books, so each book should get better. There are author forums around, and author Facebook groups, where other authors will give you advise. Some of it will be useful, a lot of it will be out of date, and plenty will be total crap. But there are authors willing to guide you. You must be open to trying things, and not spit the dummy when you get told something quite brutal. The first book is always crap. But authors will help you do a better cover, craft a good blurb, and point out where your sample needs work. (Sample is first 10%, and most issues show up there.) The more you can fix before publishing, the less bad reviews you get. But you are going to get bad reviews, and they will help you both fix the first book, which you can update whenever you want as an Indie, and help you not make the same mistakes in the next one. Ultimately, you have to enjoy the writing process, and want to learn how to make it better, which includes learning the skills you lack now. Characters are a good place to start. A lot of people get bogged down in plots, but a pantser with good characters can write a great story, without knowing where it\u2019s going. Don\u2019t be afraid of doing that. ",
