            "answer_text": "This reminds me of those moments when I think, \u201cI wish I could un-see that!\u201d The first thing we need to do is figure out how memories are formed so we can figure out how to undo them. Memories are formed by nerves in our brains making connections. When your brain processes something, the right series of nerves make a weak connection in order to figure out what you just experienced. The more the experience effects you, the stronger that connection is because your brain knows it might need that information again in the future. There's another thing that makes those connections stronger. We can convince our brains that something is important by repeating it over and over. Our brains are efficient. Why process something repeatedly when we can just remember what we processed the first time? Once a strong memory is formed our brains try to use that information as often as possible rather than trying to process new information for every situation. It's like that defiant kid who's proud of successfully pounding the oval block through a round hole. The more often that block goes through that hole the rounder it looks and that kid decides that that's the right way to do it. So how do you keep that defiant little kid in your head from trying to pound the oval block through the round hole? How do you get your brain to stop using those well-formed pathways? First you have to prove to the kid that pounding the oval bock through the round hole isn\u2019t right and that doing it the right way would be better.You already know that these aren\u2019t good memories so you have a head start on this step.Now you need to decide that you don\u2019t need to keep remembering this.You can decide that (regardless of your feelings) constantly thinking about it is going to hurt you more than help you.Even better you can realize that it\u2019s in the past and you\u2019re at peace with it and ready to put it behind you and work toward a positive future.The next thing you have to do is teach the kid to recognize an oval block before he tries to do anything with it. So you have to practice recognizing that the memories are coming up before they do.What triggers the memories? When the memories come up, stop yourself and think about what just happened that might have brought it up. What were you thinking about before it came up?Start keeping track of what things are triggering the memories.When you notice the triggers coming up, think of something else. (If you couldn\u2019t come up with any triggers then try to get good at catching the memories just as they\u2019re starting.)Think of your plans for the future.Think of a hobby.Think about what you\u2019re going to make for dinner.Think about anything that you think is positive. Replace negative memories with positive thoughts of the future.Keep doing this. At first you\u2019ll have to catch the memories coming up and forcefully change your thoughts. Eventually that will become a well-formed habit in your brain and it\u2019ll happen automatically.In other words, try to remind that little kid in your head every time you see the oval block picked up. If you don\u2019t see it being picked up then give the kid a timeout when the oval block goes toward the round hole. Eventually your little head-kid will learn its lesson and start doing what you tell it. ",
