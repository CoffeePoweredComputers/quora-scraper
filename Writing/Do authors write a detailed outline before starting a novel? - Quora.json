            "answer_text": "I am sure that the great writers are meticulous when composing their masterpieces. They think about each tiny detail to make a new book fascinating.  \u201cHobbit\u201d is a favourite book for at least four generations of readers all over the world. This book has been translated into 40+ languages and filmed several times. Multiple computer and table games, operas, and children plays are based on the Tolkien\u2019s story.  Tolkien always wrote books as if he was not sure what it was to come up next. He finds the right path step by step, mixing things up, turning into the wrong direction at first, but always getting back to the right one in the end.  Tolkien was writing \u201cHobbit\u201d gradually as any other of his novels. However, most of the time he spent editing, not writing the book! The names are of the utmost importance to the writer. In a time of writing \u201cHobbit\u201d the dragon was called not by Smaug, but Priftan, the wizard bore a name Bladortin, and the leader of gnomes (subsequently \u2013 Torin) was Gandalf.  Tolkien was just fastidious; we can see it from the map that was found in a book of the artist, who illustrated it together with the writer. His writings prove it that Tolkien was obsessed with little details, every part of his world was very important to him, including flora and fauna.  The Shire is located at the same latitude with the Oxford University, and the sights of Italian Ravenna inspired the creation of Minas Tirith. Tolkien was constantly fixing the geographical names, crossing out the unnecessary ones. He used Belgrade, Jerusalem, and other geographical entities as a take-off to create his own ones.  That is, perhaps, one of the reasons, why the kids all over the world still read \u201cHobbit\u201d and enjoy it not less than their grandparents did once. So, as you can see, John Tolkien wrote the detailed outline and he was one of the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Asking \u201cdo authors write detailed outlines?\u201d is about like asking \u201cdo authors like mustard on their grilled ham sandwiches?\u201d Some do, some don\u2019t, some don\u2019t eat ham at all. I write detailed outlines for non-fiction. I don\u2019t write detailed outlines for fiction. At least, not before I start. For me, a novel starts with a scene. A man in formal party attire falls out of the sky and lands on a roof. A woman poisons her lover on a penthouse balcony and walks off with his laptop. These ideas come into my head out of nowhere. The rest of the writing process is, what happened? Why did this scene take place? Who are the people, and why do they do what they do? Now, by the time the novel is finished, there\u2019s an outline. But the outline grows organically alongside the novel. For example, my crush and I are currently about 88,000 words into the novel we\u2019re writing together, which I expect to be somewhere around 105,000 words when it\u2019s done. The outline for the novel is, as of the time of writing this, a bit shy of 10,000 words, and we last added to it yesterday. We started the novel with a scene: a large number of people gathering together just before dawn outside a ziggurat. In fact, I literally wrote the first paragraph on her back with fountain pens (though that opening paragraph has been reworked several times since, meaning it no longer matches that first paragraph\u2014we\u2019re considering re-creating this photograph with the final version of the opening chapter for the novel\u2019s back cover).  The outline came after the scene, and it has grown and developed as we\u2019ve worked on the story. ",
