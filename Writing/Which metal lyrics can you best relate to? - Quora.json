But before, before you slam the doorTell me when, tell me whyTell me what this fucking life is forWe fly through this godless endeavorWe try to explain the black forever I feel helpless and aloneTrapped on the third stone I feel permanently stonedThis godless endeavorThe only cage I've known Organic equation has shown it's flawCan we agree to disagree on the concept of God?As I lifted up my brother, he said to me: \"Abandon naive realism,Surrender thought in cold precision\" I feel empty and derangedDenied one last epiphanyAnd ushered from the stage Thou shalt not questionThe role of science is notTo eliminate GodAs alternative Gods multiplyScience stands accused of theocide Consume, conformConsume, conform The children sitting in the treesThey turn to laugh at meThey tell me that I'm insaneBut in my mind I know I'm to blameAlone within my lunacyDementia fills the void within meNo testament, prayer or diseased lamentCan heal my wounds, they are so discontent All the faithful fall onto their kneesAnd praise the priests of industrial disease We contemplate oblivion as we resonate our dissonanceIn godless random interpretationThe universe still expands, mankind still can't understand How to define youSo hide your face and watch us exterminateOurselves over youWelcome to the end my friendThe sky has opened It captures the flawed and heavily corrupted essence of life on Earth, in my opinion.
