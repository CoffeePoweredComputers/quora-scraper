            "answer_text": "Here are a few of my favorite books that changed the way I live. They have changed the way I look at the world and the way I react to the world. I revisit them frequently because I get more out of them every time I go through them. However, books cannot change your life \u2013 only you can do that. Simply reading the book alone, then moving on to the next one is useless. The books can guide you down the right path, but you must take massive action and dedicate yourself to doing the work.  Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance by Angela Duckworth Achievement isn\u2019t reserved for only talented individuals, but for those with passion and perseverance. Grit is about what creates outstanding achievement in people. Through her own story of success, research, science, and interviews with high achievers from various fields, Angela Duckworth reveals what it takes to persevere in any situation. Key Takeaways: Grit = perseverance + passion + purposeWe obsess over talent because it protects our ego \u2013 if we believe we either have it or we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t have to feel bad about not measuring up.Effort has a much greater impact on achievement than talent.Combine small, low-level, daily goals with a larger vision to stay consistently motivated.Grit is changeable with:Interest: enjoy what you\u2019re doingPractice: deliberate practice to improve on your weaknesses to constantly improvePurpose: know that your work mattersHope: believe in yourself. Have a growth mindset Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool If you\u2019ve heard of the \u201c10,000 Hour Rule,\u201d then you\u2019ve heard of Anders Ericsson\u2019s work, but you may not know the entire story. His work has been both lauded and debated, but it\u2019s finally time to properly examine the truth. Key Takeaways: The path professionals take is called \u201cpurposeful practice\u201d and it consists of four parts.Have a clear, specific goalRemain focused during practice with no distractionsAlways push yourself just beyond your limits to achieve moreGet specific and immediate feedbackWhen you practice in a mature field of expertise and have someone to guide or mentor you, purposeful practice becomes deliberate.True genius isn\u2019t an innate talent \u2013 but the mere result of years of deliberate practice. Mindset: The New Psychology of Success by Carol S. Dweck What\u2019s the difference between people with a fixed and a growth mindset. Turns out A LOT! Success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our skills, talents and abilities. Key Takeaways: People with a fixed mindset \u2013 those who believe that their abilities are fixed \u2013 are less likely to flourish. These people think \"This was the way I was born. Therefore, this is how I'll always be.\"People with a growth mindset \u2013 those who believe that abilities can be developed \u2013 have the capacity to reach outstanding accomplishments. These people tell themselves \"I can achieve whatever I set my mind to.\"Change your mindset to one of growthBe curious and constantly ask questionsTry to learn something new every dayPick something that you're not good at and try to improve by finding a coach, taking a training course, watching instructional videos, and PRACTICING!Whenever you find something you wish you were good at, always tell yourself you CAN if you put your mind to itTurn challenges and failure into motivation and creative problem-solvingDon't ever give up. If you reach a plateau, keep your true north star goal in mindSurround yourself with people with positivity, grit, determination, and passion (they have a growth mindset)Dream big The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg Habits are at the core of everything you do. When you learn to change them, it will have a major impact on you, your life, your business and society. Key Takeaways: The habit loop starts with a cue, which is followed by a routine, which is reinforced by a reward. The repetition of the loop builds up an anticipation or craving for the reward.Cue \u2013 A trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode, and which routine to use.Routine \u2013 Physical, mental, or emotional behavior that follows the cue.Reward \u2013 A positive stimulus that tells your brain that the routine works well, and is worth remembering.You can change your habits once you recognize the cues and rewards, substituting just one part of the loop, the routine. Remove the cues that trigger the routine or by replacing the bad routine with a good one.Willpower is the most important habit, and you can strengthen it over time:Do something that requires disciplinePlan ahead for worst-case scenariosPreserve your autonomyKeystone habits prepare the ground for major habit change through small wins and by creating structures that help other habits to flourish. By focusing on changing a single keystone habit major change can happen. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change by Stephen R. Covey This classic is still a must read. As much as I love books like Think and Grow Rich, How to Win Friends and Influence People, and all of the other classics, I think this has the most practical applications today. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 those other most definitely do as well, but I\u2019d start here. In this book, you\u2019ll discover 7 habits of personal and professional effectiveness. It will change your view of how the world works, and lead you to more success. Key Takeaways: Be Proactive. Work from the center of your influence and constantly expand it. Never sit and wait \u2013 waiting for problems to happen before taking action is a losing game.Begin with the End in Mind. Envision what you want in the future so you can plan and work towards it. To be effective, you need to act based on principles and constantly mind your mission. Understand how people make decisions.Put First Things First. Leadership in the outside world begins with a personal vision and personal leadership. Priority should be given to the Important and Urgent activities. Important and Non-Urgent too often get neglected. Unimportant but Urgent problems waite too much time.Think Win-Win. Value and respect people by understanding a \"win\" for all is ultimately the best long-term outcome. Thinking Win-Win is a character-based code for collaboration.Seek First to Understand, Then to be Understood. Use empathic listening to genuinely understand a person, which compels them to reciprocate and have an open mind.Synergize. Combine the strengths of different people through positive teamwork, so as to achieve goals that no one could have reached alone.Sharpen the Saw. Balance and renew your resources, energy, and health to create a sustainable and effective lifestyle. Exercise for physical renewal, pray often (meditation, yoga, etc.) and read as much as you can for mental renewal. The Four-Hour Chef The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life by Tim Ferriss More than half of this book is about cooking techniques and recipes, but that\u2019s not why it\u2019s on my list. The first 102 pages (out of 672) sets the foundation for self-improvement and accelerated learning. The remainder of the book is the practical application of those lessons through the lens of cooking. Learning how to learn is one of the biggest advantages in life. Key Takeaways: The DiSSS Method for Accelerating LearningDeconstruction: What is the minimal units that are required to become competent at a chosen skill?View the subject from a variety of perspectivesLook at what successful outliers are doingExplore the minds of experts via interviewsFind simple commonalities in a domain that can serve as a key to accelerate learning.Selection: What 20% of those minimum units will lead to 80% of your desired outcomes? Distill and simplify everything to the fewest moving pieces.You\u2019re looking for the Minimal Effective Dose (MED) \u2013 the lowest volume/frequency/changes that gets you the desired resultSequencing: What\u2019s the most effective order for learning these units?Stakes: What mechanisms can you build for setting the consequences and enforce sticking with the program?The CaFE Method for making it stickCompression: How can you compress the most important 20% into a one-page study aid or cheat sheet?The Prescriptive One-Pager lists rules or principles that help you generate real-world examples.The Practice One-Pager lists real-world examples to practice, which helps you learn the principles indirectly.Frequency: What is the best study/practice schedule that provides the frequency needed to gain competency?Encoding: How do I create mental anchors and tricks to anchor knowledge and ensure it sticks? (examples are DiSSS and CaFE) The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It by Kelly McGonigal Insights from psychology, economics, neuroscience, and medicine explain exactly what willpower is, how it works, and why it matters. Willpower is a mind-body response, not a virtue. It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, and sleep. There are 3 kinds of willpower.\u201cI won\u2019t power\u201d: The willpower you use to resist things, like dessert.\u201cI will power\u201d: The willpower that helps you delay gratifications and do what\u2019s often uncomfortable, but important to reach your goal.\u201cI want power\u201d: The willpower that allows you to remember your long-term goals when you most need to.Instead of heightening your senses and releasing adrenaline, like in the fight-or-flight state, this response allows you to pause and reflect, by shifting your attention to your inner conflict.Past good behavior is not an excuse for present bad behavior.Always be self-aware and conscious of your attitude. When you are doing well, you tend to get lazy.Guilt and shame over your setbacks lead to giving in again, but self-forgiveness and self-compassion boost self-control. Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength by Roy F. Baumeister and John Tierney This book goes hand-in-hand with the The Power of Habit in my opinion. It shares lessons on how to focus our strength, resist temptation, and redirect our energy. The bottom line is that we can\u2019t reach our goals without first learning to harness self-control. Key Takeaways: Willpower is like a muscle \u2013 you need to learn to build it. The more you develop, the stronger it will get.Willpower is like a muscle \u2013 if you use it too much at once, it gets worn out.Set clear goals (and make sure they don\u2019t compete with your other goals), but leave flexibility for your willpower.4 steps for building willpower and delaying gratification a little bit every dayStep 1: Pick a habit you already do dailyStep 2: Make it harder to execute by making it more difficult, taking longer or shorter to complete it, or completing it in a better way, which requires you to be more thorough.Step 3: Do it for 7 days in a rowStep 4: Rinse and repeat",

            "answer_text": "20 Best Personal Development Books to Skyrocket Your Success 20 Best Personal Development Books to Skyrocket Your Success Personal development is such a nebulous topic. In reality every single book on this (now 200+ title) list is a great self-development book. For the sake of this list, my choices for this section all revolve around books that are more about igniting passion and giving ideas rather than a step-by-step action plan. This list includes, the grandfathers of all self help books, and it also has some of the modern masters of inspiration, education and self-empowerment. These books all DO have actionable steps to take, you will learn things, but I feel that their true purpose is as inspiration and motivation. 1. The Success Principles by Jack Canfield Any avid reader of self-help books will recognize Jack Canfield. Creator of the popular motivational \u201cChicken Soup for the Soul\u201d series, Jack has been inspiring people for years. In \u201cSuccess Principles\u201d, Jack gives 65 methods for transforming your life. If you are looking for a single self-help book that gives you a ton of great ideas on how to improve your life and your success, this would be the one. However, die-hard personal development fans may find some of these ideas to be rehashed versions of ideas they have heard before, not fresh new ideas. The principles are repeated here due to the simple fact that they work! Even if you know all 65 principles before buying the book, I believe it can be an excellent refresher on things you need to do to achieve the success you desire. 2. Think and Grow Rich: (Revised and Updated for the 21st Century) by Napoleon Hill It could be very easy to think that a book about achieving success written 80 years ago and based on the success principles of men like Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison and Henry Ford would be stale and out of date, like a dry history lesson. This simply is not true. While there are admittedly parts where you have to substitute modern methods of execution for old fashioned counterparts, the basic principles themselves are based on human nature and just as true today as they were 80 years ago. This book is a classic and for good reason. Over the past 80 years many successful people have read this book and gained from it knowledge and insight that have helped them to achieve their own success. When a self-improvement book sticks around for as long as this one has, there has to be a reason for its longevity and success. 3. The Power of Positive Thinking by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale Most people who achieve any degree of success will tell you that attitude is a big part of the success equation. Positive thinking will not magically make success happen, as this books \u201csuccessor\u201d The Secret, would have you believe, but positive thinking can put you into position to make the most of it when it happens. So skip the \u201cSecret\u201d and go write to the first (and best) book on getting your mind right for success. One slight negative is that many people complain because of some of the religious overtones of the book. While Dr. Peale is clearly a faithful Christian, I believe this book has merit for you regardless of personal faith. Just listen to the good advice. Note: some of you may like The Secret. I mean no offense to you in this review. The positivity aspect of the book is fine, I simply have a problem with the idea that the \u201cuniverse will deliver\u201d success. I believe the only way you get success is to go out and work for it. Let\u2019s agree to disagree. 4. Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell Outliers takes a scientific look at what it actually takes to achieve success. Unlike some of the other books on this list, it does not give a specific list of the things you need to do to achieve success. It looks at very interesting anecdotes that support the main point of the book, that success is not achieved by luck, attitude or even skill, but that the only real measurement is the time we put into our skills. People who achieve higher degrees of success almost always have more time building the skills they use for their success. This book is quite interesting with some really good stories and anecdotes. It is an enjoyable read. 5. Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress Free Productivity by David Allen I am not by nature an organized person. Due to this fact I would say that reading GTD for the first time was a life changing experience. Allen gives solid advice on how to plan all the aspects of a hectic life (both business and personal). This book comes with a solution to all the chaos life throws your way. It can help you stay organized and on top of everything. I do not currently follow all the tenants of GTD. I have incorporated a more web based approach as I discuss in my book on Evernote. But I still feel Getting Things Done is a must read, even if you discard his specific approaches, the core ideas will still shed light on many ways to be more productive. 6. The Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal by Jim Leohr and Tony Schwartz Everyone thinks time is the enemy. I can\u2019t count how many times I have heard, \u201cI don\u2019t have time for that\u201d or \u201cI wish I had the time\u201d. The central idea of this book is that people have it backwards. Loehr and Schwartz state that energy is the key, not time. Success is about creating a series of \u201clife-sprints\u201d not a marathon. By laser focusing on tasks, then completely resting, you actually can get a lot more done in less time and live a happier and more fulfilling life at the same time. This book makes some excellent points. The next time you hear yourself saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have time\u201d to do something important, you should reach for a copy of this book. Unless you don\u2019t have time for that\u2026 then I can\u2019t help you. 7. How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnegie Just like the previous entry, \u201cThink and Grow Rich\u201d Carnegies book is another classic from the 1930s that still packs a ton of truth bombs in it\u2019s nearly 90 year old pages. While T&GR was about the principles of success, Carnegie discusses the personal habits that lead to success. Included are: the twelve ways to convert people to your way of thinking, six ways to make people like you, and the nine ways to change people\u2019s opinions without arousing resentment. Regardless of what you intend to do with your life, other people will always be there. Carnegie gives you the tools to effectively recruit others to your cause, rather than have them potentially be obstacles. A must read classic on dealing with other people. 8. The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich by Timothy Ferris I have to admit, I have a few mixed feeling on Tim Ferris in general. On one hand, let\u2019s face it, the guy is a bit of jerk. Additionally while there is some great information, it might not pertain much to people who just want more from their 9-5 lifestyle, and are not really into the idea of a \u201cdigital lifestyle\u201d. On the other hand, however, this book does an excellent job of challenging people to rethink the status quo and evaluate how to make the most of their time. Time does an great job of explaining how to make the most of the digital lifestyle, how to get started with this business and does it all with a fierce energy that will get you motivated. If the idea of making a living online appeals, this book should be a must read, and is likely already on your bookshelf. If you are just looking for tidbits to develop your personal productivity, attitude or health, this might be a book you can miss. 9. Crush It! Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion- by Gary Vaynerchuk Crush It! has a few problems these days. Mainly is that the core idea of the book, fresh and new when it was first released, has become a bit dated. Most people have come to understand the revolutionary power of Social Media and the effect this can have on any and every single business. However, a good portion of this book is also about following your dreams and turning your passion in a career. While this book no longer imparts what I would call \u201cnew\u201d information, it is still extremely motivational. Gary Vaynerchuk has an incredible amount of energy and reading what he has to say is sure to get you motivated to get out and conquer the world. 10. Let Go! by Pat Flynn \u201cLet Go!\u201d is Pat Flynn\u2019s inspiring story. If you do not know Pat, he is a normal guy, trained as an architect who began to work as an online entrepreneur when the architect business got rough. In this inspiring story Pat shares the challenges he faced and the keys to his success. Much like \u201cCrush It\u201d the value of the specific lessons are of less value than the inspiration it can give you to achieve success. If you want specific\u2019s for achieving success through Pat\u2019s methodology his podcasts and website are chocked full of actionable information. 11. Habit Stacking: 97 Small Life Changes That Take Five Minutes or Less by Steve Scott Yes, that\u2019s me. I would like to include my own book in this list because I think it has a lot of value. Habit stacking is based on a method to incorporate small habits into daily life. These small habits are easy individually, but are often the sort of things that \u201cfall through the cracks\u201d in a hectic life. While it is very hard to add dozens of new habits to a daily routine, habit stacking helps you do just that, by doing these small tasks in a block you can plan for the time to act on these tasks in your daily schedule and stick firm to implementing these habits on a daily basis. 12. Choose Yourself! Be Happy, Make Millions, Live the Dream by James Altucher The climate of business and personal success is changing. The times when going to college, working a job for 40 years and retiring a success are evaporating before our eyes. Altucher shows a path to creating art, make money and achieve success through non-traditional methods. Altucher\u2019s sense of humor and brutal honesty make this book a great read. He doesn\u2019t pull any punches even sharing many of his personal failures as well as successes. 13. Awaken the Giant Within: How to Take Immediate Control of Your Mental, Emotional, Physical and Financial by Tony Robbins This is another book I struggled with the decision of whether to place on this list. On one hand Robbins has always seemed to me to be as much of a salesman of change as he is someone with fresh ideas. However, there is no denying that this book covers some important ground while still being inspirational. Robbin\u2019s point with this book is to take charge of your life in all the important ways: emotional, physical, mental and financial. All of these important parts dovetail together and work with each other for you to achieve greater success. Only when you are at the peak of performance in all categories can you truly be your best self. 14. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihaly Have you ever felt on the top of your game? Answers and ideas flow freely. You feel energized and alert. You feel happy and content. You are in control. This is a state Dr. Csikszentmihaly refers to as \u201cflow\u201d The flow state happens to everyone from time to time, but it can be engineered to happen more frequently and when it does the happiness, content and satisfaction it brings can have a lasting halo effect on our lives. Part science and part philosophy this book does an exceptional job of relating to us not only how to get more done, but how to live happier and fuller lives due to having an understanding of the \u201cFlow.\u201d 15. 177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class by Steve Siebold This book is great at what it is, a summary of all the current thinking in the realm of peak performance. While not groundbreaking, it digests hundreds of self-help and personal development books and relays the important pieces succinctly and clearly. A wonderful book that will save you time and money giving you the highlights of the best modern thinking on the subject of improving your personal performance in all aspects of life. 16. Why We Do What We Do: Understanding Self-Motivation by Edward L. Deci One of the keys to success in life is self-motivation. Most people will perform when they have to at work or at home. Self-motivation means going that extra mile and not needing the external commitments to get things done. When you can become self-motivated, achievement will follow as surely as the sun rises in the east. But self-motivation is not something that is always as easy as it might sound. Deci showcases all the current science on the subject of motivation and explains the hows and whys in simple to understand terms. You likely have ideas of what motivates you already, but reading this book will give you a clean and clear understanding of your motivation. 17. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can\u2019t Stop Talking by Susan Cain Being an introvert I kept saying. \u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d and \u201cSo True\u201d constantly while reading this book. Another book on this list, \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People\u201d does a great job of showcasing the importance of being a \u201cpeople person\u201d and how this can lead to success. However, this advice introverts (myself included) have a hard time following. Being the loudest and driving your ideas home to others does not necessarily make your ideas the best. Susan Cain has a book that can make any introvert proud of their nature. She shows ways many introverts have achieved high levels of success, even in \u201cpeople person\u201d positions of authority. This is an important read for introverts to understand why we act the way we do and an important book for extroverts to help them understand the remaining 1/3 of the population. 18. Virtual Freedom: How to Work with Virtual Staff to Buy More Time, Become More Productive, and Build Your Dream Business by Chris Ducker This is a personal development book for a fairly narrow niche. These days many tasks can be outsourced and delegated, specifically if you have your own business or side hustle. Trying to do everything yourself is not a growth mindset. This book lays out clear paths to outsourcing significant amount of work in a methodical manner. If you have no need for outsourcing this book is not for you. However if you have ever thought about the possibilities of outsourcing mundane tasks, then this book should be a must read. 19. Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, Revised Edition by Dr. Robert Cialdini Why do people say yes? Why do they buy things? Dr. Cialdini\u2019s classic book shows the science behind why people are persuaded. This book will help you understand the importance of social proof, scarcity, authority, reciprocation and more on others and how it can help you to get the important \u201cyes\u201d or purchase in your business or at work. People\u2019s decisions are often not made by a rational argument and well laid out plans. It is important to truly understand why people really choose the way they do. 20. The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play Procrastination is a problem that plagues many people. I might even be bold enough to say that MOST people suffer from procrastination from time to time. It is human nature. However, there are good scientific reasons why people procrastinate and just as many good science backed methods to overcome procrastination. Dr. Neil Fiore gives an exhaustive overview of why we procrastinate and what we can do about overcoming procrastination. ",
