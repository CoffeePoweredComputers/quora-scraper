            "answer_text": "In Sanskrit,while ending time we add vaadanam Here in 1:20 we can clearly see that it is 20 minutes more than one o\u2019clock. In sanskrit 20 is vimshatihi,One is eka. As it is 20 minutes more than 1 it is vimsha+adhika+eka and as mentioned above +Vaadanam=vimshadhikaekavadanam So in English we tell 20 after one but in sanskrit we tell 20minutes more than one. Hope this helps:-) ",
