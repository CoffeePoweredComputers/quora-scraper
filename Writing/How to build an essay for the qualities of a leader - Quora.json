            "answer_text": "A leader is an individual who can influence, motivate, and exhort people to achieve goals. So, an essay on leadership could be written about any of the following subtopics: You can define leadership and what personality traits exemplify a leader You can write about leadership styles and how each one of them works You can write about people who you look upon as leaders in your life You can write about the life of an important public leader who moved an entire nation with him or her You can write about your own leadership skills and how you plan to build on them or leverage them to achieve success How to Write a Leadership Essay First, understand the concept of leadership \u2013 While I have given the basic definition of a leader in the first sentence of this essay writing, there are deeper levels and layers that identify a great leader. To understand leadership qualities, look up for resources from the internet or good books and collate information which will help you understand and appreciate the core values of a good leader. Define the concept of leadership as you understand it \u2013 After you have gathered, read, and understood the meaning and core principles of leadership, try and carve out a definition which reflects your interpretation. You could work on any of the following lines: Do the extraordinary ambitious and risk-taking abilities of leaders inspire you? Do you believe the oratory and communication skills of great leaders are the primary causes for their success? Do you think rising from the ranks gives a leader far more opportunities to gain knowledge and expertise in his or her field which make him a better leader? Do you think leaders can be successful in any field and that they really do not need expertise in the day-to-day operations of an organization? Based on the above points you can arrive at the meaning of leadership as per you understanding and interpretation. Write about your leadership qualities with illustrative examples \u2013 Many leadership essays require you to write about those times in your life when your leadership qualities came to the fore. Even if you haven't worked in any organization, you can write about experiences in the family or as part of a team sport or as part of a voluntary work group that reflected your leadership qualities well. Let your experiences be specific with some amount of detail about when, where, and how the event happened. This adds a lot of credibility to your essay. Always remember that leaders are innovative and see things in different perspectives \u2013 When you think like this, you will be able to include many more instances than just those wherein you or someone was at the helm of some command center. The options are myriad; remember to think differently and you will find plenty of instances where leadership qualities of yourself and people around you come forth. Introduction of the essay \u2013 Write your introduction such that it grabs the attention of the reader. This is the best tip you can get on how to start a leadership essay. Using personal experiences would be a great start. For example, \"I discovered my leadership qualities when I found myself alone at home with my three little siblings and Hurricane Katrina came knocking on our doors.\" Thesis statement \u2013 One sentence that sums up leadership should be your thesis statement. The body of the leadership essay \u2013 This should ideally have 3-4 paragraphs with information, data, examples, etc supporting your thesis statement. Make sure each paragraph handles only one idea. This keeps your essay uncluttered and easy to read and understand. Also, make sure your transition sentences in each paragraph seamlessly connect the ideas together. The information collected during your research will come of great help in filling up the body of the essay. Conclusion \u2013 Tie up your whole essay in your conclusion; make a succinct summary of the main points, and conclude by reinforcing your thesis statement. Ensure you do not introduce any new ideas or data in your concluding paragraph. A final thought, however, might pack a punch in your essay. ",

            "answer_text": "You go back and forth a bit. Allow me to explain: There are only a few universal qualities of a leader that would merrit an essay being written about it. Leadership is not a universal science. The culture, geograpy or simply the organisation have different ideals, so the qualities that could be universal are so self-evident they\u2019re not interesting to build an essay around. So first question you need to ask: What is relevant to you in your position as a leader? It might be statistical, logistical, it might be strategic implementation, it might be dealing with one specific employee that\u2019s causing conflict or WHATEVER. Here\u2019s no wrong answer. Find out what\u2019s troubling your position as leader. When you find this, narrow it down to a problem worth solving for you and the organisation. Ok, so far so good. Now back up! In terms of composition of the essay, before juming to the problem, you need explain the context of your problem and the symptoms through which you have observed it, and then define the problem. Next up, choose which analytic tools you want to use and believe or not, which not to use! An understanding of which tools are relevant but not optimal to use is very helpful. Then the classic: analyse and intepret until you\u2019re numb. I find this model very useful, but it requires a sincerely curious approach, which can be difficult, because you need to dive into your own shortcomings. Good luck! ",
