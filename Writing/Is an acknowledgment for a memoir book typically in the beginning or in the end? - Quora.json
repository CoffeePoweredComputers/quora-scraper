            "answer_text": "Are acknowledgments for memoirs typically in the beginning or end? I\u2019ve seen them done both ways. Memoirists might include acknowledgements in their book\u2019s introduction or preface, or under such rubrics as \u201cnotes.\u201d Some memoirists write acknowledgments with no formal heading. T.E. Lawrence does that in Seven Pillars of Wisdom, thanking Mr and Mrs Bernard Shaw \u201cfor countless suggestions of great value and diversity: and for all the present semi-colons.\u201d Robert Graves ended the first edition of Goodbye to All That (1929) with a paean to his muse titled, \u201cDedicatory Epilogue to Laura Riding.\u201d It\u2019s missing from the second (and now standard) edition of Graves\u2019s autobiography, published in 1957. Confessions of An Advertising Man, David Ogilvy\u2019s sly new business pitch masquerading as a memoir, has acknowledgments under the heading \u201cBackground,\u201d in the front of the book. Ulysses S. Grant included his acknowledgments in the preface of his classic autobiography. Grant wrote that preface to Personal Memoirs on July 1, 1883, three weeks before he died. Fighting for the Confederacy: The Personal Recollections of General Edward Porter Alexander has two pages of acknowledgments, but they are those of Gary W. Gallagher, who edited Alexander\u2019s papers. Military Memoirs of a Confederate, General Alexander\u2019s earlier book, has an acknowledgment of sorts under the heading \u201cThe Point of View\u201d in the front. It was in this section that the Georgia-born Alexander, known for his courage and candor, made the following admission: One thing remains to be said. The world has not stood still in the years since we took up arms for what we deemed our most valuable right\u2014that of self-government. We now enjoy the rare privilege of seeing what we fought for in the retrospect. It no longer seems so desirable. \u2014 Edward Porter Alexander, Military Memoirs of a Confederate: A Critical Narrative (New York: Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, 1907), p. viii General Alexander\u2019s apostasy caused much tearing of hair and gnashing of teeth below the Mason-Dixon Line. His presence at soir\u00e9es was no longer as ardently desired. ",
