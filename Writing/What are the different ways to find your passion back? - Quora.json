            "answer_text": "You\u2019re probably the kind of person who works hard, with commitment and persistence. When you know what you\u2019re doing, nothing will stop you. But before you can become unstoppable, you need to know what you\u2019re starting. Before you can follow your passion, you have to find it. If you\u2019re feeling stuck, here are five fresh ways to discover what you really want to do with your life. Take time to work through the process and know that, no matter what, you\u2019ll be getting closer to where you want to be. 1. Start With the Right Perspective If you went into a restaurant with the strong opinion\u2014\u201cI\u2019m not hungry. There\u2019ll be nothing here I want to eat. I don\u2019t want to be here\u201d\u2014the menu isn\u2019t going to look appealing. You won\u2019t explore it with due time or attention, and it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll find food you\u2019ll enjoy eating. The same principle applies to passion-seeking. If you\u2019re convinced that finding your passion is hard, or that it\u2019s not going to happen for you, you\u2019ll remain closed to possibilities. You\u2019ll block the little nudges, pulls, and signals that guide us all. After all, how can you expect to find fulfilling work if you don\u2019t believe it exists? Choose to adopt the perspective that you can do what you love with your life. One of the best ways to strengthen this point of view is to surround yourself with people who are living examples. How many of your friends and family are following their passions? If it\u2019s not many, it might be time to expand your circle; associate with\u2014and be inspired by\u2014men and women who are inspired by their work. 2. Get Out Your Metal Detector Once you\u2019ve decided that your passion is findable, it\u2019s time to look for evidence of what you already love to do. If you scan the landscape of your life, you\u2019ll notice certain experiences peak up. It\u2019s so valuable to delve into these \u201cpeak moments\u201d and extract the key ingredients. Consider yourself a beach-trawler, discerning between the gold and the cheap metal. For example, one of my favorite summer jobs involved teaching English to teenagers. I might assume the key ingredient was the English language, or young people. But when I paid attention to my metaphorical metal detector, it become clear that the bleep went off when I was being a leader within a community, and teaching that community something of great value to them. That\u2019s exactly what I do now in my work\u2014but without the teenagers, present perfect tense, or vocabulary tests! Make a list of the ingredients that truly mattered in your peak moments; don\u2019t be distracted by the counterfeits. 3. Look for the Umbrella When you look at all the ingredients that matter to you, they might at first seem entirely disconnected. Let\u2019s say you love French, drinking coffee, playing with words, analyzing and categorizing, and being a leader within a community. How could you construct a career from these? It'd be like peering into your cupboard and seeing cocoa powder, tofu, and carrots and wondering: How could I possibly make something delicious that includes all of these? This is the time to look beyond the ingredients and seek an umbrella; something that all of these ingredients can fit beneath. For example, my colleague Abby\u2014whose diverse passions are described above\u2014helps business owners to find the right words to fit their brand. She analyzes and categorizes copy into what she calls \u201cvoice values.\u201d She draws wisdom from previously running a funky French lifestyle boutique, and French words pepper her own copy, giving her brand that special je ne sais quoi. She\u2019s become known as a leader for those who want to communicate effectively with their potential clients. Oh\u2014and she\u2019s built a recognizable Pinterest profile showcasing her favorite coffee houses. All of these passions fit under the overarching umbrella of her business; they\u2019ve all found a home there, and the variety actually helps her to stand out and attract her perfect clients. What might be your umbrella? 4. Discern Between a Hobby and a Profitable Passion It might be that, through this exploration, you fall head over heels in love with an activity that engrosses you\u2014something that lights you up and makes your heart sing. But now you have to ask yourself the next question: Who would benefit from (and pay for) this? Well, if you want to contribute your passion to society and make an income from it, you need to get realistic about whether this could actually turn into a career\u2014and what you would need to do to make that happen. Moreover, think about if you would even enjoy doing those things; for some people a passion is just fun, and turning it into work changes it from a \u201clove to do\u201d to a \u201chave to do.\u201d For example, my client Lisa loves to draw. She makes art for the sheer joy of it. When she attempted to turn this passion into a profitable business, she realized that the market who were hungry for her talents were business owners who needed illustrations for their blogs, websites, and products. This felt like play to Lisa, but in order to make her services marketable, she also needed to add tech skills to her toolkit, so that her design work could be useable online by her ideal clients. Be alert to who might need your newly emerging passion, and aim to have conversations with them to get you clearer on how, where, and when you can serve them.  5. Expect the Mutiny When you seek your passion, there\u2019ll be parts of you that go into rebellion. I\u2019d guess that this article itself might be provoking some of those resistant parts! We all have a huge number of fears\u2014around failure, success, visibility, and vulnerability\u2014that speak in sensible voices, instructing us that we mustn\u2019t do what we love. If you let these voices win, your passion will remain out of your grasp. Instead, look for the fear beneath each supposedly reasonable voice. Uncover the years of conditioning\u2014from parents, school, partners, and colleagues\u2014and reassure the mutinying parts that your ship is sailing in the right direction. 6. Find the Limits of Your Bravery On my own journey, I\u2019ve mostly lived by the motto: \u201cLeap and the net will appear.\u201d I\u2019ve noticed I couldn\u2019t find the new until I\u2019d said farewell to the old. With each step into the unknown\u2014for example, handing in notice on my part-time salaried job to go fully self-employed\u2014my announcement to the universe has been: I\u2019m available. I\u2019m serious about this. I\u2019ve been called brave, but I don\u2019t see it that way; I\u2019ve simply been more committed to my happiness and freedom than to staying cozy with the status quo. Find your own version of brave. Discover what risks work for you. The path of passion is where you do things that scare you enough, without leaving you in a constant state of fear. Expand your comfort zone, rather than leaving it. The world needs your passion, so decide right now that it\u2019s possible to find it, and use this guidance to gain clarity. When you find your passion, be assured: It will always guide you right. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe trying desperately to get back the thing which you\u2019ve lost is not the right answer. Maybe letting it go would be a better idea. Most people believe that people can have only one passion in their lives. That having a passion and losing it is the worst. That after something like that happened to you your life will never be as good as it was before. That it is a reason to become depressed or even end your life. But that\u2019s the consequence of this common (erroneous in my opinion) belief that we can have only one passion. That\u2019s not true. Why should it be true? Who said that we can have only one passion in life and based on what? I think it is bullshit that we can have only one passion in life. I believe we can have multiple passions. If we\u2019re capable of developing passion for one thing we are capable of doing it again with a different thing. Only in order to develop that second, third or fifth passion we need to dump the idea that we can have only one passion in life. Based on what do I think that we can have multiple passions in our lives? I don\u2019t know exactly. That\u2019s just my belief. The idea that we can have only one passion in life is also just a belief. It\u2019s based on nothing. Or at least those who have that belief don\u2019t know exactly what it is based on. They believe it\u2019s true because that\u2019s the most common belief. Period. Of these two beliefs my is better. At least I won\u2019t cry or want to kill myself when I will lose my passion. ",
