            "answer_text": "Absolutely yes, I was a professor for 25 years at large research institutions and I always encourage students to get involved in research as soon as possible. Faculty are almost always interested in meeting students who want to do research and one good indicator that a student may be a good fit is a demonstration of your willingness to take the initiative in contacting them. Use the email message to quickly indicate: (1) up-front that you have done some homework on the research that they do, (2) that their research interests you (be specific about it), and (3) that you are seeking an opportunity to get involved in it. (4) Then share a little about any experience (it could be coursework or reading if you don\u2019t have much experience yet) that you may have that may make you a good candidate to work with them. Ask if there is a time when you can meet with them, in person, to discuss any opportunities that they may have. It would also be wise to attach a resume that you created especially for research opportunities. Do not go into the situation expecting to get paid, unless, you are replying to an advertisement that indicates that financial compensation is involved. As a young student, the experience that you obtain from the opportunity along with connections and potentially opportunities to earn credit for research, co-authorship on publications and possibly chances to travel and make presentations at conferences are your compensation. Perhaps most important is the opportunity to develop a relationship, beyond the classroom, with a faculty mentor. This is a relationship with a person who can guide you to bigger and better opportunities, help you to expand your professional network and write you a meaningful letter of recommendation. All of that can be almost priceless. Whatever you do, do not mess that up with unprofessional behavior like being late or missing meetings, failing to meet deadlines etc. One of the most valuable assets faculty have are their reputations and credibility. They also want to be able to rely on recommendations they receive from colleagues about potential graduate students, so faculty will not be super forgiving of unprofessional behavior and they will not be willing to dismiss your mid-steps in recommendations. You really do only get one chance to make a first impression. So always be at your best. As an aside, I got my start in research in a similar way to sending out an email to faculty. Long ago, when dinosaurs roamed the earth and nobody had heard of email, text messages, the internet or cell phones, I dug out my copy of the university course catalog (a book if you can imagine that!) and looked up the brief descriptions of the faculty in the department in which I had interests and I read as much as I could about each of them and their courses. Then I went to the library and I looked up the most recent journal papers published by those who appeared most interesting and I photocopied their papers. I then went back to my dorm room, read their papers and made notes about what I thought they were about, what I liked about them and what I did not understand in the papers. This gave me ammunition for relatively intelligent conversation when I spoke with them and it showed that I was willing to take the initiative required to do my homework about them. When I finished with my reading and note taking, I called each of the faculty that I thought was doing work I would like to do and explained that I had done my homework on them, briefly describing what I thought they did, asked them some of my questions and finally asked if I could meet with them to discuss any opportunities for students participate in their research. Some said they did not have any opportunities and some did have opportunities. If they said that they did not have anything, I asked whether that might change in the future, whether they knew of anybody else who might be looking for research help and I asked them to keep me in mind for anything that might arise in the future. Some of them gave me referrals to faculty I had not thought about and I followed up on those. I then met with the others and I ended up with opportunities in multiple labs that kept me busy for the rest of my time in school. I managed to make a good enough impression on people that faculty to whom I had not spoken, contacted me later during in my time at school to ask me if I wanted to work in their labs. This occurred because I made a good impression on those I initially contacted, so that when other faculty asked their colleagues for leads on student help, my name popped up, because few students took the steps that I did at that time. So reaching out pays off! Finally, I should point out, that I was not a great student during my first year in school. However, I did end up going to one of the better graduate schools in the country and worked with the best person in the world on my graduate research. I feel that occurred for a few reasons, first I turned my grades around and earned nothing less than a 3.6 the rest of the time that I was in school. I pointed out in the upward trend in my grades in my applications to Graduate Schools, and perhaps most importantly, as far as grades were concerned, I pointed out that I had gotten \u201cA\u2019s\u201d in courses in which concepts and math from courses that I did not do as well as I would have liked, were applied. So I showed that I had mastered to subjects. However, I am certain that what opened the doors for me to great graduate programs were my letters of recommendation and a resume that included publications along with citations for research and technical writing awards that I earned as a byproduct of my undergraduate research experiences. It also did not hurt that I was able to do these things while playing for a Division 1 national Championship college team and had one of my letters of recommendation written for me by a national icon and well-known advocate for the concept of the scholar-athlete. So if you are doing things outside and beyond school (it could be working part-time), at the same time as research and your school work, do the best job that you can so that you can get a recommendation there as well. It\u2019s important because it shows that you are versatile, can handle pressure and manage your time and that you take pride in doing your best, in ALL that you do. I hope that this helps and I wish you the best. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s certainly appropriate, but likely a waste of time unless you do it properly. Some faculty (like me) have explicit instructions for people contacting us, and if you don\u2019t follow those instructions, your message will be ignored or worse. Even if they don\u2019t provide instructions, it\u2019s safe to assume their views are similar to those of other faculty, and read a few of these instructions before writing. ",
