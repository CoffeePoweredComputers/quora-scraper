            "answer_text": "For freelance writing the question is not, \"how do I determine my rate,\" but \"how much do I want my rate to be?\" Determine how much you want to make an hour and work your way there. If you're brand new I would start at $20\u201340/ hr and pound or some hours while gaining good experience and learning. When you notice that all your clients love what you do. Bump your price ABOVE what you want it to be. It might take some time to get that first client to pay your new rate, but even if they \"negotiate\" you down a little, they are negotiating you down to where you wanted to land all along anyway. They'll feel good about getting a deal from you and you'll feel good about landing where you want to be. It's a win win. So remember, where do you want your rates to be? Get confident in your craft and then GO FOR IT.  ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the a2a. Personally, I just went by a straight hourly rate for everything from creating newsletters to doing a family genealogy to penning a company history. You have to figure a third of your writing income will go for taxes, and you have overhead in your writing space. (I worked at home, and figured the percentage of my house my writing consumed. If my space was a seventh of the house, I figured 1/7th of my overall expenses, e.g., utilities, phone, etc., were for writing.) I charged over $30 an hour in the 70s and 80s. Today I\u2019d probably ask for $50. I always told the client the number of hours it would take for the project, and would sometimes request a third in advance. If it was going to take longer because of my error, I didn\u2019t charge for that extra time. If it was because they were unreasonable, I\u2019d warn them early on. Good luck. We\u2019re all in this together. ",
