            "answer_text": "There is no definitive answer to this because no one knows what criteria to apply to judge, in an impartial and even-handed way, very different writers who had very different intentions. I can give a short list of truly great writers, writers who produced multiple novels of distinction, as well as great shorter fiction in many cases. But it is not the same as giving someone the crown as \u201cgreatest American writer of fiction.\u201d I do not think it\u2019s even sensible to try. But here is a list for the reader to ponder, and also to ask himself whether he has read and understood the writers listed: Nathaniel HawthorneHerman MelvilleMark TwainAmbrose BierceHenry JamesEdith WhartonStephen CraneWilla CatherTheodore DreiserRaymond ChandlerKatherine Anne PorterDashiell HammettDawn PowellF. Scott FitzgeraldWilliam FaulknerErnest HemingwayVladimir Nabokov (purely on the basis of his work in English)Henry RothPaul BowlesSaul BellowFlannery O\u2019ConnorI don\u2019t think we have enough perspective on a lot of the writers born much later. We know plenty of good writers born after about 1910. I\u2019m not ready to call any of them all time greats, even if I like several quite a lot. ",

I will give you a short list of the giants, though. This is not all of them and it\u2019s in random order. Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Faulkner, John Steinbeck, Twain, Chandler, Hammett, Cain, Vonnegut, Tim O\u2019Brien, Shirley Jackson, Richard Brautigan, John Updike, J.D. Salinger, Melville, Richard Henry Dana, Poe, Philip K. Dick, Truman Capote practically invented a genre, Ross MacDonald, Henry Miller\u2026 you could keep me here all day. I didn\u2019t include one hit wonders, like Harper Lee or Robert Pirsig because while they wrote important books they were one hit wonders. And the list of bad writers is much, much longer. ",
