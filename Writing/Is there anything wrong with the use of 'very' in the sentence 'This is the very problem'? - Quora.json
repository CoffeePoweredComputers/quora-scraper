There is nothing wrong at all with the use of \u2018very\u2019 in: \u201cThis is the very problem.\u201d To those for whom English is a second language it might sound strange, though. To make understanding a little clearer, try mentally adding another word - for instance: \u201cThis is the very real problem.\u201d \u201cThis is the very obvious problem.\u201d Such an expression would usually follow an observation about a problem encountered- someone might say: \u201cIt must have been the way the microphone was positioned, but we couldn\u2019t hear the candidate\u2019s speech at all.\u201d The reply might be: \u201cYes, this is the very problem.\u201d \u2018Veritable\u2019 (actual, true, genuine) is an older version of \u2018very\u2019 used in this sense, but it wouldn\u2019t be usual to say or write, in 2018, \u201cThis is the/a veritable problem.\u201d ",
