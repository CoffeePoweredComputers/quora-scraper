            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not easy to write on ourself. Partly because you\u2019ll run out of skin fairly soon. There are parts of yourself you simply can\u2019t reach. I would recommend hiring someone to do it, especially if your writing isn\u2019t very clear. You need to consider what kind of ink or instrument you want to use. Tattooing direct is never advisable, because of revisions or typos. You need to consider the quality of ink, whether you want it to be permanent or not. Beware, ink is never permanent. I\u2019d suggest you use a PC, or paper, and write on that instead. You need to decide which aspects of yourself you want to concentrate on, and organise your thoughts and preparation carefully, being aware at all times of your expected audience. Be honest, avoid trumping yourself up, and there\u2019s no need for false modesty. You are what you are, you have triumphs and defeats. You can demonstrate that you can deal with both, and that you can learn from both. The person who\u2019s reading needs to feel that they know something about you when they finish, otherwise they\u2019ll be disappointed with your writing, and shocked to find that you aren\u2019t the person you described.

            "answer_text": "A single paragraph? Goodness! That\u2019s not very challenging. If you\u2019re a really private person about your personality and the things you\u2019ve done in your life, you could devote the paragraph to your height, age, hair color, and other very superficial facts. As a homework assignment or part of a college/job application, what they\u2019re probably looking for is for you to identify one characteristic of yourself that you feel best represents you. Is it a love of a particular sport? Then write about why you love that sport and how long you\u2019ve loved it. Is it an accomplishment (such as getting an award for volunteer effort or for a project)? Describe what motivated you to undertake the activity, in what ways that relates to some characteristic of yourself and why you take pride in that accomplishment. ",
