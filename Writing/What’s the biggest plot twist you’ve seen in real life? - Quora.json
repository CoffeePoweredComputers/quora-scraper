            "answer_text": "I was a senior assistant manager for a national auto parts chain\u2014now more or less defunct\u2014back in the 80\u2019s. I worked under a manager whom I thought was a pretty cool guy. We communicated well, he was sympathetic to most of the employees, and the best part\u2014I thought\u2014was that he trusted me to get the jobs done around the store. He had his regular shifts but he also took a lot of time off which put me in charge more often than not. I was also assigned the twin tasks of hiring new help and store discipline, mostly because he wasn\u2019t around much. I was also fully responsible for the night deposits and all the store paperwork. Or so I thought. It was a tough job. I was on salary so I worked up to 65\u201370 hours a week at times, covering positions, and doing pretty much every task in the store. (\u201cBrown bottle flu\u201d on Mondays is endemic to lower level retail jobs staffed by young adults recently arrived at drinking age.) I started looking for another job in the same sector and scored a positive series of interviews with a larger, more successful competitor. They offered me a position and I took it, then filed my two weeks notice. My manager was cool with that too, although he seemed a little disappointed that his \u201cgo-to\u201d second in command was bailing out. Still, he wished me good luck, told me that he was pleased I\u2019d landed a job with a \u201cgood outfit,\u201d and we shook hands on my last day. About a year later, I was working at the warehouse main counter when I recognized one of my former employees, now working as a picker and packer in the DC. (distribution center) I greeted her cheerfully but she seemed a bit suspicious of me. I put it down to resentment that I\u2019d bailed out because she was head cashier at my previous job and worked directly with me in scheduling. A little later, we had the same lunch break, so I sat down across from her in the company cafeteria and chatted for a while. Once I got past her suspicions, I got an earful! It seems that my former boss, the good-natured, easy-going guy who had cut me so much slack, had been busted on major embezzlement charges. He\u2019d stolen close to fifty thousand dollars in deposits. He was caught red-handed with the deposit bags in his car, months of them, stretching back long before I\u2019d gone to work as his senior assistant. \u201cBut I was in charge of those deposits!\u201d I told her. \u201cAnd I made sure every single one of them went into the drop box. at the bank!\u201d (Let\u2019s call the manager \u2018Bruce\u2019) \u201cBruce and I were the only ones who had the keys!\u201d She looked me right in the eye and said, \u201cI know. That\u2019s why everybody, even the cops, thought you stole the money and were trying to set up Bruce.\u201d \u201cImpossible!\u201d I sputtered. \u201dHow could I get into his trunk? Didn\u2019t they have some record of excessive income for Bruce?\u201d Turns out that they did. It also turns out that this cashier\u2014let\u2019s call her \u2018Sheila\u2014was a major witness because she could testify as to the nights that Bruce was on duty and the fact that he had a powerful cocaine habit. (I totally missed that. Which is another reason I don\u2019t like being management. If I miss something that obvious, I shouldn\u2019t be bossing people, period.) Sheila also told me that one of the detectives told her that I was indeed under investigation\u2014but they couldn\u2019t find a shred of evidence that I stole the money or somehow conspired with Bruce. Well, if they\u2019d asked me, I coulda told them! I was kind of disappointed that the cops never even called me. But it still bothers me that Bruce somehow got his hands on deposits that I had dropped into the lockbox at the bank. I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that someone at the bank had to have been the co-conspirator because I knew that company policy indicated that the deposit amount called in had to match the deposit amount the bank recorded. And I\u2019ll betcha a dozen Krispy Kremes that it\u2019s how they caught them. Someone at the bank screwed up and didn\u2019t report the correct amount. The company investigated and I\u2019ll bet you a baker\u2019s dozen that the bank investigated too. So I missed being caught in a major scandal, a felonious embezzlement scheme that would have cost me considerably if some overzealous DA decided that I was a crook too. I quit less than a month before this pot of beans blew up all over the microwave. Gee, I missed all the drama. How\u2019s that for a plot twist? ",

            "answer_text": "I couldn\u2019t make this sh*t up if I tried. Biggest plot twist of my life happened only a few months ago. My daughter\u2019s father fell deathly ill. It was rapid and scary. I went to render help/care due to the fact that I am still legally married to him and had sympathy for his dire situation, plus his whole family live in another state so I was simply trying to help in any way that I could. He was in the hospital for a month and then he stayed another month at a nursing home/rehabilitation center. I set everything up for him because he could no longer walk, more than partially deaf and very limited use of his hands. I taught him how to use his phone without assistance so that he could contact and talk to friends and family whenever he pleased. I took him to appointments, checkups, and searched for caregivers which was a task in itself. Good help was scarce and I wanted someone around who cared about their job. I actually stopped working because it was very time consuming. Months went by and I had no type of life, dedicated all of my time to helping him to the restroom, blending his meals because he had trouble swallowing food, just to get some sort of normalcy back, only to find out (thanks to technology) that he was sending his ex money and saying how terrible I was and he couldn\u2019t wait to get better so that he could be rid of me. He was saying the most horrible things and it was almost hard to believe. It felt like I was nothing to him. None of the time, patience, frustration, tears or selflessness that I had given meant anything. It was like being thrown out of a tornado. I had to come to the realization that after all of this time, he was a narcissist and I had unknowingly suffered from mental abuse from him for years and always thought that I was crazy. The gaslighting, the loveboming, the flying monkeys, the lies, the deceit. I truly had to educate myself on the type of monster he was. But he has all of the traits. It was too much to take in. You truly feel as though you\u2019ve been mentally raped. I tried so hard to rationalize the situation, but that\u2019s hard to do when you\u2019re reading the truth right there in front of your face in black and white. I am the mother to his child so I never in a million years figured that nobody in their right mind would want to cause harm, grief, or turmoil to the only other parent capable of tending to our daughter because he\u2019s disabled. He\u2019s devious, the devil incarnate. I\u2019m still recovering while raising our child. He had a family member come to get him when he knew the heat was on him. Some days it\u2019s still hard to grasp. It\u2019s only been a few months so I am still coping. Trust is hard for me. I\u2019ve known this man for half of my life, had a kid and a life with him, only to find out that I didn\u2019t know him at all. ",
