            "answer_text": "There are many cliches about women, some of the more detrimental than others. Let\u2019s start with the ones that almost everyone knows, and then go to the more confusing ones. The Sexy Lamp - Is your female character simply there to be the attractive character who your protagonist falls in love with? Does her personality start and end with her looks, or maybe a few basic cliche personality traits that mean very little in the long run? If the answer to either of those is correct, you have a Sexy Lamp, which is a female character who could be replaced by those lamps that are basically a woman\u2019s leg wearing fishnet stockings without changing the effect she has in the story.Damsel in Distress - This one is self-explanatory. You can have a character be as fleshed out as possible, but if you only put them in danger so a male character can rescue them, all their other characterization is pointless compared to their forced helplessness. This one gets especially bad when a normally competent woman wanders into a trap she should clearly have noticed to set up this kind of scenario.The Nagging Hag - There are people who are impossible to please, and then there\u2019s this character type. She\u2019s typically an older woman whose husband is browbeaten over every single thing he\u2019s ever done \u201cwrong\u201d, and is painted in an exclusively negative light because of it. It seems like her only defining trait, and that\u2019s just one-dimensional writing, which is its own sin.The Gold DiggerWomen often had to rely on the very presence of a man to even open a bank account or purchase a house, much less do many other things on their own, and some of those strange limitations continued all the way up to the 1970s. In spite of this, a Gold Digger is boiled down to a woman who wants to rob a man blind by pretending to love him, and almost universally cares more about money than her partner. This usually creates the opinion that she\u2019s cheating the system and has no ambition or drive to succeed on her own, and given the history that I mentioned above, it\u2019s not entirely accurate and comes with unfortunate implications.The Strawman Feminist - This one has a long history, but if a character\u2019s main defining trait is that she hates men and blames every man she meets for her problems, you have this character cliche. There are some women like this, but they\u2019re few and far between. It also stems from a misunderstanding of intent: when some women talk about how men are responsible for putting women down, they\u2019re often referring to the historical precedent or a specific individual they know rather than everyone they know in their current situation.Sexual = Slut This one is tough, but if a male character can sleep around with multiple women with consent in his college days, then a female character should be able to do the same without being treated as a slut. Anyone who pushes this idea as undeniably correct immediately moves from \u2018acceptable\u2019 to \u2018questionable\u2019 or lower, whether the author or a character.I Hate Everything Feminine - This character is about as butch as they come. They do spit shakes to make deals, hang out in bars, cut their hair short to look more masculine, dress in men\u2019s clothing, and decry anything even remotely feminine. Along with being a stereotype of men, this character is often portrayed as a \u2018strong female character\u2019 by abandoning everything that would usually mark her as female. On top of this, it\u2019s also bordering on an imitation of trans men who go all out with their appearance, which comes with its own bag of worms. The whole thing is an unfortunate implication that makes it seem like women being feminine makes them weak in and of itself, and they must be masculine to be strong.Tragically Harmed/Killed for Character Motivation - This one is an extension of \u201cStuffed in the Fridge\u201d, in that the (typically attractive and innocent) female lead being seriously injured, sexually assaulted, or killed becomes the impetus for a male character\u2019s story. Much like \u2018Damsel in Distress\u2019, this one relegates the role of a woman to being a means to a more traditional character\u2019s story arc, but with the addition of making her the victim who can\u2019t seem to recover for maximum drama. It gets worse when the male love interest is the only one who can help her get back to being herself as well, but that\u2019s a whole different issue.\u201cHollywood\u201d Strong Female Character - Look at Ellen Ripley from Alien and see a character that\u2019s actually rounded and developed. She\u2019s still terrified by the Xenomorph, and she makes judgment calls that sometimes backfire just like anyone else would in her situation. Yet her confidence exudes leadership, and she uses her intelligence to outwit the \u201cperfect killing machine\u201d in a creative way at the end of the film.This is not Ellen Ripley. This is the \u201cfemale empowerment without any actual attempts to make a rounded character\u201d cliche. The capable, decisive, confident, insanely attractive, and never questioned or doubted woman who borders on being a Mary Sue, if not outright being one. The character doesn\u2019t have to do any work to achieve what they want because they have all the skills to get it for what seems like no reason. A recurring line from the men in the story will likely be, \u201cA woman?\u201d asked whenever she does anything impressive just to drive the moral home repeatedly until the audience/reader is tired of it.\u2026And those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head. Good luck.",

            "answer_text": "The pure little virgin girl who is saving herself for marriage and fortunately finds out that her boyfriend is the wrong one for her when he cheats on her. Then she finds Mr. Right and he waits for marriage. Frankly, I\u2019m sick of slut-shaming in fiction. I want to read about more women like me who had sex with her high school boyfriend and never regretted it because it was a good learning experience. Then she went on to have sex with twenty or thirty other guys and even a few women but decided that, while she respects and admires bisexual women, she\u2019s really heterosexual. Then, when her good friend with benefits expressed his insecurity about sex to her, she was patient with him and helped him work through his difficulties. Then, when she gets married, she has two other current sexual partners and two guys she gave blowjobs to as wedding guests. One of the guys she gave a blowjob to even sings a song at her wedding. In short, I want to read about women with a rich and fulfilling sex life. ",
