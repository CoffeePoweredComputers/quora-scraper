This is the go-to book for anyone who wants an accessible recount of the events and policies leading up to the housing crisis. It was said by Wall Street guru Peter Lynch that you should never invest in anything that you cannot draw with a crayon. Imagine, then, how difficult it must be to describe such arcane financial securities as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and the now-infamous credit default swaps (CDSs). Michael Lewis does an enviable job of depicting vivid characters inhabiting the world\u2019s most obscure field of financial endeavors, often with surprising humor that marks his trademark as a sage of Wall Street.
