            "answer_text": "Yes completely. I identify only with her and only realized it when different people actually said I seem like her. I understand her point of view completely and even the part where she had painted thsir portraits with a friendship ribbon in her room reminds me of autism. The depth of connection and feeling of friendship and love and caring without nevessarily being able to express it completely or at all towards other people. Caring about certain people to a degree they do not realize simply because of autistic traits being both a barrier and inclining one to withhold expressing too much as that would pull you into the unpredictable difficult and intense NT social world. I wish there were books written from her perspective. Great character and piece of observation work by Rowling. Reminds me of a more intellectually abled Mr Dick from David Copperfield who had ASD too in my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "She has PTSD. She appears to have no sensory issues and never melts down in public. She doesn't mask as neurotypical. When we meet her she is fourteen, an age at which you mask like your life depends on it. Let's face it, it probably does. She got angry once. Her actress interpreted it as making her soft voice slightly sharper. Autistic symptoms become clearer under stress. Seeing her mother die would have made her neurotic and anxious if she were autistic. Instead she is the calmest, most relaxed person ever. I don't know if this is \"symptomatic\" of neurotypicality, but I am pretty sure she's not autistic. ",
