            "answer_text": "It is called \"personal\" because no two statements should look the same. It might seem difficult to get going but you could start with a brainstorming and then gradually narrow it down.  What are your strengths? Why are you enthusiastic about the course and which positive experiences related to the topic did you make? Some general rules:   - show that you know what you get yourself into and what it implies to study the subject (do your research before) - be specific - how did your experiences (also outside the classroom - like working experience, volunteering, ..) arouse interest in the subject - what skills are needed and how have you acquired them(keep in mind: not just list them but think about which relate most to the course you\u2019re applying to, then demonstrate how you\u2019ve developed and improved these) - what are your long-term goals? If you have some specific path in mind you can mention it. Otherwise, you can write what you are looking forward at university and what you want to gain from the whole learning experience.(This website suggests some similar things: 10 things to put in your personal statement.) As I said it should be personal but you could get some inspiration. For example, I found that you can browse for Personal Statements per subject.However, NEVER EVER copy a single sentence - this is called plagiarism and I would reject you directly as an admission officer.  About the language: I'd keep it positive and enthusiastic. ",

All kidding aside, just write your personal statement. You can (cautiously!) go back and make use of a thesaurus if your diction is bland\u2014just don\u2019t fall in the trap of aiming for impressive words rather than clarity. Also, don\u2019t fall in the trap of using the thesaurus to introduce half-synonyms when you really don\u2019t know what the half-synonym means. That can create unintentionally comic results. Use a thesaurus to remind you of alternative words you actually know\u2014but didn\u2019t think of during the first draft\u2014not as license for sesquipedalianism! ",
