The question mark is opened to the left. It feels incomplete. Visibly, the reader is left hanging. The proposed answer mark completes the hook of the question mark, looping it around to partition off the space inside, as if exactly the requested information has been captured within. No more, no less.  It is evocative of the \"Q\" in \"Question\" and \"Quora,\" but straightened out and pinned in place by the dot beneath. It fairly reeks of knowledge and confidence. Reeks. Also, it brings to mind the magnifying glass, a tool of the archetypal detective, associated with the discovery of answers.  An exclamation point could be overlaid to create the \"Responnsobang,\" a punctuation mark that captures the true excitement that occurs with having found the answer to a tough problem. ",
