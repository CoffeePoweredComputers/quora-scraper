            "answer_text": "There have been some, but they were ALL the result of a \u2018optic illusion\u2019 similar to racism. To make an example: when a black guy rapes a woman, newspapers say \u2018a black guy raped a woman\u2019. But when a white dude does, they don\u2019t say \u2018a white guy raped a woman\u2019. They just say \u2018someone did this and that\u2019. I made this premise to explain that during the eighties and nineties (Vietnam vets are a little old, nowadays) when someone \u2018went postal\u2019, if he was a Vietnam veteran, magazines and public usually focused on that part of his past, thus forgetting that the large majority of people who goes on a killing spree are no war veterans of any war. That said, there were some, and with much sadder stories than the one told in the movie FIRST BLOOD. If you think that the cases I remember ended up all dead at the hands of the police, David Morrell\u2019s novel is more true to reality than the movie. Anyway\u2026 I remember a guy being killed by the police after a 24 hours siege, and another one who created his personal bullet-proof tank (I swear) by modifying his own tractor. He ended up killed by the police too. Too bad, I can\u2019t find any links at the moment so I can\u2019t check if I remember those two episodes correctly. I will update my answer in the future, if I do find some links for what I am saying (I hate to have wrong memories). ",

I am unaware of any similarities between the ones I have known and the movie and I have heard of none that bear any resemblance to the character portrayed. In Special Forces being called a Rambo is not a compliment. ",
