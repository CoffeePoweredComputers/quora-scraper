            "answer_text": "No, you got it wrong. You respectfully disagree with someone, by doing just that. Respectfully disagree. How to respectfully disagree: act respectful, and then disagree. While disagreeing, mantain honor and respect for the other person. Disagreeing is also not disrespecting their views. It is having your own views. When you disagree, you usually just think your view, your idea, is correct, whilst the other person has their own too. If the two ideas conflict, then it is a disagreement. So, if both of the arguers are disagreeing over their ideas, and they want to be respectful, they know their limits. What you do is state your ideas, and let them state theirs. You can point out flaws, and whatnot, but no personal insults. I hope this helps! ",
