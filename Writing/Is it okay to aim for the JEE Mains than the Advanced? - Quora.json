            "answer_text": "Aren't you going to put lot of efforts, time, and energy for scoring good in jee-mains? Well, if you are going to do so, then why not try for the best option. I would like to share a thought said by my teacher, Achhe Nit me un logo ka selection nahi hota jo nit ke liye prepare karte hai, jo log IIT ke liye seriously prepare karte hai magar unka nahi ho pata hai wo in NITs me jaate hai. TRANSLATION: Those people do not go to top NITs who prepare only for them, instead those who all seriously prepare for IIT-JEE but do not get selected there, go to some good NITs/IIITs. See, there may be at least 1,00,000 serious aspirants of IIT in India. Out of that 10k go to IIT, 3k in BITS, 1k each in Jadavpur University, Delhi Technical University, 1.5k in IIIT-Hyderabad, Delhi, Allahabad, Bhubaneshwar. The total of all these Tier-1 college's seats is 17.5k but let us consider this figure to be equal to 20k. Now what about other 80k aspirants? They too deserve admission in good colleges. So they opt for NITs, IIITs and CFTIs. Conclusion is: Virus said a true thing in 3 IDIOTS that, \u201c LIFE IS A RACE. Agar tum aage nahi badhoge to koi aur aage badh jaaega.\u201d TRANSLATION: \u201c life is a race. If you will not run, then some other wi\u013al go ahead of you.\u201d His truth was being presented wrongly in that movie. And, You will realise this truth on the day of allotment of seats, when other aspirants with greater scores than you, will acquire those colleges, which you dreamt off to get in. ",

            "answer_text": "It completely depends on what you want. Here are some cases you might wanna consider: Case1- you want to get into iit no matter what\u2026 in this case obviously you'll be focusing more on advanced, probably not your case but I'm writing this because many people focus solely on jee adv and ignore jee main then end up with nothing\u2026. So dont be \u201cthat guy\u201d, pay attention towards the jee main type questions also\u2026 C ase 2 - you want iit but you'll do with other good colleges as well if you don't get iit\u2026 this is a very confusing scenario as far as most of us are concerned, the best tip is if you're okay without the \u201ciit\u201d tag, don't pay much focus to jee adv. Put 90% of your effort towards jee main and do your best to get into one of the top nit's or iiit's. I'll put emphasis on the fact that if you get any of the colleges I'm mentioning below, just blindly take it. Also, rather than aiming particularly for jee main Or advanced or any competition, just be clear with your concepts, because with strong concepts, you won't even need to worry about which exam you're gonna focus on\u2026 and do give jee advanced irrespective of whether or not you get a top college from jee main because it's a great experience and the preparation is really gonna make a better person out of you. Jee main colleges you should aim for : 1 iiith- probably the toughest to get into, but totally worth it, iiith is better than MANY IIT'S. Yes you read it right, it's better than most of the nit's and is at par with many IIT'S including iit roorkee and guwahati, if not better. 2. Iiita and iiitd: both are among the top iiits and although not up to the level of iiith, they are well in the competition. 3. Some top nit's: these include trichy, warangal, surathkal, rourkela and a couple more (you can google the list of top nit's) 4. Top colleges of your domicile state: I'm from delhi so in Delhi we have dtu, nsut and iiitd. Of you're not a delhiite, You can always google the top colleges in your state\u2026 Finally I'd write it again, please don't pursue a particular college, pursue knowledge. Keep your concepts clear and you'll rock your exams, be it main, advanced or any other. Good luck:) ",

My Answer is YES.Look, I\u2019ve seen several of my seniors who actually prepared for both MAINS & ADV. and they were not able to get very good ranks. MARK MY WORDS: Even if you get about 200+ in JEE Mains you can go into one of the top colleges(but not the IIT\u2019s). Concentrate on Mains as of now. DO NOT Waste any of your time and start studying , if you haven\u2019t yet started. YOU JUST HAVE ABOUT 6 MONTHS LEFT?(Max Possible Case). Even a Score b/w 150\u2013200 is a good one.

If ur aim is getting a NIT or IIIT then it is not recommendable to focus only on mains because year by year mains difficultly level is increasing and some advance level questions are also there in mains paper , so focussing only on mains would not fetch u the result u want . I have seen many of my batchmates and seniors as well focussing only on JEE main and many of them ended screwing it up on the D-Day . There are certain topics which are in mains only . Everything which is in advance is also there in mains. ",
