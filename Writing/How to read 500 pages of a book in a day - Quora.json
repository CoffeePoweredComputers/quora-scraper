            "answer_text": "If it is a novel with text in what you might call normal size in a language you are very familiar with, it is possible you can finish a 500-page book in a day. If it is a non-fiction book with text in what you might call normal size in a language you are very familiar with, it is still possible you can finish a 500-page book in a day if the contents are easily understood. If the content is dense and requires breaks for thought or to consult a dictionary or other reference book, it is not going to be possible to finish a 500-page book in a day. Other factors that would have an effect\u201d illustrations, size of text, presence of footnotes and text boxes. etc. ",

No need to rush while reading something otherwise you won\u2019t understand the actual context of the book. Don\u2019t stress over it, If you\u2019re ardent enough your pace will increase overtime. But,If you want to read just for the sake of showing off to your friends, Then lock yourself down in a dorm,Switch off your phone,Hide your tissues(pun intended) and other stuff and start reading.
