            "answer_text": "Yes. The same way as anybody else writes a book\u2014apply arse to chair, and apply fingers to keyboard (or pen to paper, or whatever). At 13, you know enough to put a story together, because you\u2019ve been surrounded by stories all your life. Whether that\u2019s watching a movie, overhearing your parents gossip, or having your friend say \u201cGuess what I heard!?\u201d, it\u2019s all story. So you know it starts with a situation (magic ring given to hobbit), progresses through complications (Dark Lord is after ring; ring corrupts wearers), and ends with an answer to the implied story question (Will Frodo destroy the One Ring? Yes, but he will suffer so much doing it that he will go on to the afterlife.). As for what elements you put in a story at 13\u2026 There are two main problems I\u2019ve seen. First, you tend to put in what you think is Cool. That in itself isn\u2019t a problem\u2014writers still do this at 80, but then they tend to have a more individual idea of what they think Cool is. At 13, you often go for the current big craze, whatever that is. (If I see another \u2018shifter romance\u2019 I swear I\u2019ll upchuck.) And, secondly, the same problem writ large: at 13, you tend to be more derivative in what you write. It\u2019ll look a lot like your favorite book, or your favorite author, or anime, or game, or\u2026 you get the idea. It\u2019s not a rule from God that you\u2019ll be derivative, it\u2019s just more likely. You\u2019ve had less life experience. Though I have met some very old 13 year olds. Then again, these may not be problems\u2014if you like something that a lot of other people like, and you produce a good quality version of it, you may have a ready-made audience. The only thing I\u2019d say is, if you write a novel in a field that\u2019s fashionable now, a publisher will bring it out in two or three years time (assuming you get your novel accepted straight away). By that time the fashion may have moved on, and your novel may look past its shelf-date. As regards elements you can put in, at 13, I can only think of one difficulty you may have that older writers likely won\u2019t, and it\u2019s a touchy one. 13 is a liminal age. If you\u2019re late starting puberty, it\u2019s difficult to fake it. And if you haven\u2019t had sex yet, it\u2019s better not to try to fake that. It tends to show up as unconvincing. (I say \u2018tends\u2019. It may work fine.) Or then again, you could write SF, and invent an alien sex act that nobody has ever performed. At least no one can say you\u2019ve got it wrong. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. A 13 year old can write a book. If your desire is to pursue a career as a writer, write as much as you can. Write everyday. If your writing develops into a book, excellent!!! Through your writing, you will learn a lot about the art and craft of writing as a medium. I would also suggest you read a lot of books both fiction and non fiction especially related to the genre or subject matter in which you are interested in writing. Remember, writing a book at any age can be frustrating at times. Just stick with it. Your first draft most likely will not be your last draft. With each draft you write, your book will improve. Just be open to making changes to make it the best book it can be. Last of all, when I was 13 year old, I decided then I was going to be a writer. I was excited about it and wrote all the time. In fact, I wrote two books and a play within a short period of time along with dozens of poems and short stories. Even though I had material to back my career plans, I was met with a lot of opposition and criticism. When I talked about my plans to other people, I was met with a lot of adults who would say, \u201cAh, that\u2019s nice.\u201d Or I would hear, \u201cThat\u2019ll be the day.\u201d These comments were usually followed by a sarcastic snicker or laugh and an eye roll. Do not let these people discourage you! The only kind of criticism to listen to is constructive criticism about improving your writing skills. There are people who will want to see you succeed. These are the people with whom you should associate and seek their opinions about your writing. As far as the elements you want to put in your book, this really depends on you and your story. Do a little research on storytelling and on your subject/genre. Also, I would strongly suggest you do an outline of your book. This is a great way to organize your thoughts, map out your story from beginning to end, and find what elements you want in your book. Good luck, and I hope you have all the success in the world!!!

            "answer_text": "Anyone can write a book. All you need is some determination and patience. As a teenager of 13 there are many topics that you can choose to write about that interest you. I am personally an assistant writer for one of my friends who is writing a book about some superheroes. If you can find inspiration on a topic that you enjoy just start writing about it. My advice is to start by just writing any ideas that come to your head in a small notebook. When you get home start elaborating on that subject. Write what your head tells you to write, not what is grammatically correct. Once you learn to let your ideas flow it will be much easier to write any length of book. A good idea would to be to team up with your friends so you are not the only source of information. When you write with friends they can always help you overcome the awful writers block that comes when writing. Once you are done writing your book find a good publisher and editor. Make sure you have enough money to pay the publisher to print out you book. It sure would suck if you found out that you couldn't pay to have it edited and published right away. Best of luck in your future endeavors, Justin A By the way fell free to contact me if you need help. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s like asking whether a 32-year-old can swim. Only if you have the skills and technique needed. Writing a book is an incredibly dull and arduous process that can take several years. Usually, a thirteen-year-old doesn\u2019t have a lot of time to be writing a book. But let\u2019s say you do. A normal book can be around 40,000 words long. It takes me about an hour to write a thousand words, in depth and detail. I\u2019ve been practicing for about four years. Have a go at it. See how long you can concentrate. You\u2019re going to have to ask a guardian to hire you an agent, which normally takes a percentage from how many books you sell, like 5% of all your revenue goes to them. Then you have to wait\u2026 and wait\u2026 and wait. J.K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter series was turned down 23 times. And then, at the end, you don\u2019t make as much money as you might think. Look at a bookstore or a library and think about how many of these books aren\u2019t bestsellers. They probably made a few hundred quid for the writer. A few hundred quid. In as many as three years. Not exactly a great investment. But hey, if you enjoy writing, go ahead. ",
