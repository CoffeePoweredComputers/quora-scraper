            "answer_text": "Yes!  Always customize every cover letter.   An interesting thing I've learned is a T Cover Letter.  It goes like this: **Standard Beginning of a Letter**Name of person AddressDate, etc (whatever you put at the top of your cover letters) Then have a brief introduction, like, \"I ran across this open position and I'd like to offer the following comparisons between my qualifications and the requirements of the position\".  Of course you'd make yours a bit more warm and personable, but I'm trying to be brief to make a point.   Then have 2 columns.  The first column will be in bold font saying \"Job Requirements\" and the right-hand column will be in bold font saying \"My Qualifications\".  And under each bold heading, use bullet points.  The key to making this work is to take the exact verbage from the job description and use as them as bullet points under the \"Job Requirements\" heading.   Then write a closing to your cover letter.  Simple as that.  The beauty of this type of letter is, #1 It caters to folks that really don't want to read through a letter, and #2 You're making it incredibly simple for anyone who reads that letter to connect the fact your skills are a good match for the position.   Not sure why it's called a T Cover Letter.  I'd call it a 2-column Cover Letter.  Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, yes, you should tailor/customize your cover letter for each company you're applying to. However, tailoring does not mean recreating the entire cover letter, it just involves a little bit of tweaking here and there. This is accomplished for example by selecting which skills and past experiences to emphasize and by sprinkling the resume with industry keywords. Having a standard cover letter is fine, especially since you will generally be hunting in the same or similar industries. But if you decide to venture even into a similar/related field, you should do a sanity check and consider whether the hiring manager will understand or care about what your cover letter is highlighting. *Important note: Keep in mind that a cover letter is an extension of your resume where you expand on the knowledge and skills you developed over the course of your past experiences rather than just a summary of it.  Lastly, I would highly recommend checking out this website, http://member.collegejoboffer.com/info for more tips, advice and strategies on how to craft a winning cover letter as well as how to succeed in landing job offers as I was able to land multiple offers by incorporating and applying what I had learned to the interview/recruiting process.
