            "answer_text": "The only result of this experiment is your realization about the English verb being unable to negate itself. Thus help by an auxiliary verb is necessary. This is rather simple or primitive in comparison to other languages. ;-) Maybe you could start some evolution in English by saying: \u201d\u2026 I know not\u2026\u201d instead of \u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026.\u201d Same for the questions in English: Do you think that\u2019s possible? vs. Think you that\u2019s possible? English \u2192 German I don\u2019t know how you have come to this idea. There\u2019s no sense mixing languages with each other, especially if it\u2019s about syntax and grammar. English is English and German is German. Ich tue nicht wissen wie du bist gekommen zu dieser Idee. Da ist kein Sinn im Mischen von Sprachen miteinander, insbesondere wenn es ist \u00fcber Syntax und Grammatik. Englisch ist Englisch und Deutsch ist Deutsch. Deutsch \u2192 Englisch Ich wei\u00df nicht, wie du auf diese Idee gekommen bist. Es macht keinen Sinn, Sprachen miteinander zu mischen, insbesondere wenn es um die Syntax und Grammatik geht. Englisch ist Englisch und Deutsch ist Deutsch. I know not, how you to this idea come have. It makes no sense languages with each other to mix, especially if it to syntax and grammar comes. English is English and German is German. So if I want to translate German to English I feel like talking to a baby. Language is a tool for me. And the English language is so imprecise and blunt that I need a lot of complicated auxiliary constructions to express exactly what I want to say: Directly. Precisely. Concisely. And smart! Without any decoration at all! ;-) Like mathematics! Imagine you want to build a house on your own and only got the cheapest of the cheapest possible equipment from the hardware-store\u2026 ;-) You start working. After you have drilled two holes the drill bit breaks. You replace it. Then after 10 minutes the driller\u2019s battery is empty. As the store did not have a circular saw you had to buy a manual one. And that saw does not saw at all as the blade is blunt and keeps on bending. It takes ages to saw through a 100 mm beam! Would you freak out, too? :-D You wanted to spend more money for better drill bits. And you to wanted to buy a nice Makita driller. And a nice circular saw. Yet that professional equipment was not in stock at the store. That\u2019s my feeling when I use the English language! I have to use it\u2026 as I am forced to use it! Because in most cases I have no other choice. ",

For example, in English, I might say \u2018How much do the potatoes cost?\u2019, or simply \u2018How much are the potatoes?\u2019. If you said this with German syntax, it would be more like \u2018How much cost the potatoes?\u2019 (Wie viel kosten die kartoffeln?\u2019). You would be understood, but grammatically, it\u2019s incorrect. So, in answer, no! Edit: to reverse it, writing the German words with English syntax, we have \u2018Wie viel die kartoffeln kosten\u2019, which I believe is wrong! ",

The apparent similarity of the simplest declarative sentences in EN and DE hides a great deal of conceptual rebuilding work later on.

A question mark, full stop/period, comma, exclamation point: these have the same meanings in both languages. The other respondents are quite right that broader \u201cgrammatical\u201d issues such as word order and even appropriate placement of punctuation are different in the two languages, but the meaning of \u201cgrammar\u201d in a limited sense is the same. Of course the words and meanings of words are different in the two languages, so if you start from that premise, you can\u2019t get much beyond punctuation (which is a form of grammar) and expect similarity.
