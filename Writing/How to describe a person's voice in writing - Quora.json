            "answer_text": "This article addresses how to describe a a person\u2019s voice by providing examples from different genres. It was originally published on my blog - I AM My Best (dot) org Written by myself - Brenda Mahler Our voice can reassure, entertain, teach or simply scream to get attention. When a publisher told me to define my voice, I released a piercing scream. Everyone within a block radius heard my frustration. The voice emerging from my lips was not impaired. Voice!? What does she mean? Words on the paper do not make a sound. Sometime later, I acknowledge the inaccuracy of this belief. According to Donald Murray, my inspiration to share my ideas on paper, \u201cVoice is the single most important element in writing. . . . Voice separates writing that is not read from writing that is read.\u201d Relenting, I thought maybe this publisher knew something I needed to learn. So, I started researching about voice until the clouds opened, lightning struck, and a gestalt moment occurred. Voice shares the personality of the text. It is the style of the writing that conveys emotions, pulls the reader through words exposing feelings. A writer\u2019s voice makes the heart pound with terror, break from sorrow, skip a beat in anticipation, or rest peacefully by transporting a reader through time. Consider four elements when developing voice in writing: audience, purpose, organization, and tone. Below a well-known nursery rhyme demonstrates how voice can be developed based on the focus. Historical background of a nursery rhyme Many nursery rhymes stem from horrific historical incidents. For instance some assert a correlation between Ring Around the Rosie and the Black Plague. However, most nursery rhymes have multiple interpretations as to their origin. In the Press Reader, August 8, 2018, Dene Bebbington shares possible explanations for the origin of the rhyme, Jack and Jill but explains that one of the most commonly shared interpretation is \u201cthe rhyme may refer to King Louis XVI of France who lost his crown \u2014 and his head \u2014 by the guillotine, as did Marie Antoinette who came tumbling after. Because the typical purpose of nursery rhymes was to deliver a message through the country, often containing dreadful content, the simplicity of the words allowed it to be shared with many. Jack and Jill went up the hill To fetch a pail of water; Jack fell down and broke his crown, And Jill came tumbling after. Up Jack got, and home did trot, As fast as he could caper, To old Dame Dob, who patched his nob With vinegar and brown paper. Identify the purpose Modern day journalists typically follow a standard formula by identifying who, what, where, when, and why in the opening lines of an article. With the purpose to report Jack\u2019s accident in today\u2019s new, it might read like this. Teens Suffer Injury After Tragic Fall \u2014 News Report IDAHO \u2014 \u2014 Two Boise teens are under careful watch at Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital after a tragic accident last Friday. The two teens, Jack Smitz and Jill Meyer, were traveling up Northpoint Road in West Boise in an attempt to bring back water for Meyer\u2019s mother when an unexpected storm arose. The teens tried to escape the weather by climbing to a nearby covered cave. Jack lost his footing on the rocks and suffered severe injuries to his head. Jill thus struggled to catch him, but also ended up falling down the steep incline. \u201cFrom what we have gathered through their injuries, they fell for no less than 20 feet,\u201d says Officer Tyler Cole. \u201cThe scene was serious enough to call in emergency health services. When paramedics arrived at the scene, they immediately took the children away.\u201d The teens are expected to be released from Saint Luke\u2019s next week. Notice how the article is crisp and to the point, meeting the goal by presenting facts without opinions. This approach focuses on the specifics of the incident. Usually, if the reporter shares witness accounts or reactions to an incident, it comes later in the article. A professional style answers questions and delivers relevant information at a comfortable reading level so it is accessible to the mass population. Address the audience Many of today\u2019s rhymes for children sprouted from horrific events in history leaving us with short ditties shared with small children. These resulting poems are accepted as cute because they rhyme, create a fun rhythm and the length appeals to kids. The first stanza appears below as it resides in numerous Mother Goose books. Usually, future verses are not included. Few people contemplate the meaning of the verse as it is presented in a sing song style with the intent to entertain. The Original Jack and Jill went up the hill To fetch a pail of water Jack fell down and broke his crown And Jill came tumbling after. Consider organization The following example presents an extremely different organization. It relays a casual conversation between neighbors with authentic dialogue by introducing the characters and the setting. The story unfolds through conversation and personal reactions are shared. The Kids \u2014 Country Neighbors Pete Jones meandered up the land toward Deacon Patrick\u2019s yard. As he neared the picket fence Pete could see the Deacon weeding his garden, so he shouted a friendly greeting. Deacon Patrick arose and went to chat with Pete. Nearing the fence, Pete sensed the Deacon was troubled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter,\u201d he asked. \u201cOh, I have just returned from Doc Smith\u2019s house. There was an accident over at Potter\u2019s Hill. It seems the Jackson\u2019s twins, Jack and Jill, had a bad experience fetching water at Stony Creek. Apparently, Jack fell and Jill tried to help but tripped over the same log. I just returned from visiting their ma.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. Maybe I\u2019ll call on Mrs. Jackson after I take these peas to market.\u201d Construct an appropriate tone Tone also influences the voice of a piece. Edgar Allen Poe, a master of establishing mood at the beginning of his stories captures the audience\u2019s attention using the first sentence. In these examples his audience consists of readers who enjoy spine tinkling, suspenseful adventures, and he begins with a riveting first line to entice readers. \u201cTHE \u201cRed Death\u201d had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal \u2014 the redness and the horror of blood.\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe Masque of the Red Death\u201d \u201cI WAS sick \u2014 sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses were leaving me.\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum \u201cDURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country ; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher.\u201d \u2014 The Fall of the House of Usher\u201d \u201cTHE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could ; but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge.\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado If Poe penned the story of Jack\u2019s tumble, it might sound like this. The Accident On a dark and dreary night, two unforeseen teens traveled up a warn pathway desperately seeking the water that lay at the top. Shaking bodies and aching muscles lead them further and further up the way. Thirst tears at their bodies longing for fulfillment. Jack\u2019s throbbing leg stepped once more onto the unseen pathway, merely to lose his footing on a mossy rock and plummet down the rock-strewn embankment. Jill struggled to help him, only to heed his icy shriek as it pierced through the darkness. She plunged down the edge only to find herself giving up hope of survival and water. Publishers\u2019 responses seldom prompt me to revise the voice in my writing \u2014 anymore \u2014 because during revision, I consciously focus on audience, purpose, organization and tone, knowing that the voice must consistently unite all four to bring cohesion to the final. When a reader continues from the first sentence to the last, the voice of the piece successfully captured their attention. An effective voice hooks the reader and retains their attention until the end leaving them satisfied and informed. Read more articles about writing on my blog ",
