            "answer_text": "I would have written: \u201cI go home.\u201d The \u201cto\u201d leans me in the direction of using \u201ctowards.\u201d On the other hand, \u201cI go quickly home\u201d vs. \u201cI go quickly to home\u201d sound the same to my ears. Don\u2019t know why the adverb makes it seem more correct? \u201cI go to run\u201d works, but the \u201cto\u201d is part of the verb \u201cto run.\u201d If an article (such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d) is used, the \u201cto\u201d works well. For example, \u201cI go to the home of my friend.\u201d Or how about: \u201cI go to my home.\u201d \u201cI am going home\u201d works well, while \u201cI am going to home\u201d doesn\u2019t work as well. The \u201cto home\u201d suggests a verb construction. But it is a prepositional-phrase construction. ",

            "answer_text": "Many verbs can be followed by a prepositional phrase. With other verbs, the use of a preposition after the verb is redundant. To be certain, consult a dictionary. If the definition of the word ends with a preposition, then do not add another preposition after the verb. Consider the meaning of the verb to determine whether a preposition is redundant or not. In this case, the preposition \u201cto\u201d seems unnecessary after the verb \u201cgo\u201d. You should take it out of the phrase. ",
