            "answer_text": "Whitman quietly, cleverly conveys the idea that the theme in \u201cSong of Myself\u201d is a self which is \u201cnot contained between my hat and boots.\u201d He is hymning the Cosmic Self, the total life force or life process (an evolutionary one - he pictures his soon-to-be-born animal ancestor carried around as an egg in a dinosaur\u2019s mouth). And since the cosmic self is worthy of reverence, he writes the \u201cSong\u201d in 52 parts. This will suggest that you can devote each Sunday morning (or Thursday or Friday evening - whenever you might prefer to say weekly prayers) to reciting or \u201csinging\u201d a section from his year-long scripture-like book of weekly hymns. It\u2019s as good as going to church or mosque or temple, if not maybe a whole lot better! Leaves of Grass grew to be Whitman\u2019s new Bible. His bravery, I think, should not be underestimated. ",

            "answer_text": "I won\u2019t do your homework for you. If you want more information on the poem, search for some of the many analyses online. If you are looking for a way to dig into the question, consider (1) What is the theme of the poem? (2) What is the form? (3) What was your reaction to the poem, and can you tease out why your reacted this way. If you can\u2019t figure out how to tie theme and form together, consider asking your teacher. You will learn far more by laying out what you find confusing that you would by reaching for someone else\u2019s answer. Poetry is very personal, and your interpretation and your feelings about the poem are JUST as valid as anyone else\u2019s. ",
