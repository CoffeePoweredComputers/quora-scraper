            "answer_text": "How do you get your English essays checked? You ask for someone to volunteer to read them and offer their suggestions. Or you pay someone for their opinion. The best thing you could do is to either join a writers\u2019 group where your work can be evaluated or you found such a group and accept the criticism. I\u2019ve written a number of essays. I would be happy to offer my insights. This is as good as anyplace to find help. It may not be the exact purpose of Quora, but we are writers, and we can stand together. I\u2019ll tell you the truth. If that ends up being supportive, great. If it is a painful slap in the face, then take it and do what you need to improve. Respond and ask for my contact information. ",
