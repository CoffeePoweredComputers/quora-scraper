            "answer_text": "Thanks for the specific ask, but it\u2019s a rather odd question to put to someone who makes a living editing. :-) You have to ask yourself, why would anyone offer a free proofreading service? If a stranger off the internet asked you to spend 15\u201320 hours of your life doing something for them, without any compensation for your time, what would your response be?There are plenty of proofreading services on the internet who say they will perform proofreading for next to nothing, certainly not even close to a minimum wage here in the West. You might get lucky, but generally, as with everything in life, you get what you pay for. Alternatively, there are some software packages that claim to pick up the most common errors with a varying degree of sophistication. Most of these also cost money, but many offer a free trial period. You could abuse the software developers\u2019 generosity, sign up for a trial of software you never intend to purchase, proofread your text and then immediately cancel your subscription. I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t be the first. This is what you pay people like me for. Yesterday I was proofreading a manuscript that contained the lines: \u201cThat anti-aircraft gun has been placed there by Artillery Command and it\u2019s theirs to own, operate, and maintain. It can be as deadly for the gunners as it is for whoever is on the receiving end of the ordinance it fires.\u201d If your proofreader is any good, or if the software is up to snuff, they might catch what\u2019s wrong. If they don\u2019t, they won\u2019t, but you can bet some of your readers will, and leave you a scathing review on Amazon. ",

            "answer_text": "Richard makes a good point - professional editors do wonders, and they should always be rewarded for their time! I am trying to create a system that sort of a sharing economy type platform for proofreading/editing: r3ciprocity.com. I was inspired to create this system because there are so many people in need of help and there was not a clear place to find it. Actually, it goes back to the 2008 financial crisis, when some many of us had a hard time finding a job, and others needed help that could not afford it. I also wanted to create a system that could be based on reciprocity if you could not afford such services. Each time you edit someone else\u2019s work, you get reciprocity credits that allows you to get your own work edited, with no system fees. Only if you want to eventually convert those credits to cash, does the system charge a fee. Of course, this is to ensure that I can pay for operations and future development. I was a graduate student for a very long-time, and I know how that feels. I really wanted some help with my own writing but could not afford it. Yes, you may not get a professional editor on the system - for those who are really in need, I would encourage you to find one elsewhere. However, from what I can tell, there are some really amazing people on the system that have edited some work for me. I am always impressed by the level of diligence and care of ordinary people - many sharing economy platforms have demonstrated this idea. At the moment, I figure this system is quite handy for those that need an \u2018extra pair of eyes\u2019 on your own writing. You can check out some very \u2018authentic\u2019 videos which I created here: What Is r3ciprocity.com All About? - YouTube Take care! :-) ",

I am going to list some of those here. 1) http://Grammarly.com:- 2)Proofreading Tool:- 3) After the Deadline:- 4)Slick Write:- 5)Grammar Check, Plagiarism Detection, and more:- I have used these tools several times and were very helpful for me. But adding on to this I would suggest you is that proofreading is a very responsible task and you can't take lightly and you need a lot of accuracy so that you can get good content. So, based on my personal experience I would suggest you to go with a Professional Proofreading Services in Australia - Aussie Translations if you have to do it in a better way, Hiring a professional service will increase the accuracy in your work and will make it more readable. So, Choosing professionals is always a better option over going with a free tool. ",

Or, you know, you could pay a professional to do it for you and rest assured that they know what they\u2019re doing. Just a thought! But seriously, the more you invest in editing and proofreading, the better the results you get out of it. If you want free, then do it yourself. If you want good, then pay. ",
