            "answer_text": "I would avoid it. Admissions officers are looking for \"diversity of thought\" as they are building their class of students, but you do not want to negatively affect your chances by getting an admissions officer who vehemently disagrees with you.  You would likely need to be one hell of a writer to pull off a good objective essay that sees both sides of the story and does not come across as being too opinionated. If you want to write your essay on this topic, I would recommend getting feedback on a draft from a professional editor who has college admissions expertise. My site, EditRevise, is a good option because we are inexpensive (about $20 per paper edit) and can provide you feedback on content and essay structure in under 6 hours. ",

            "answer_text": "It's about an unfair treatment I received from people when they know I view the government different from them. This doesn\u2019t sound political, really, it sounds more like painting yourself as being picked on and frankly, it sounds like whining. This approach won\u2019t put you in a good light. You should find another topic that shows what you do. It can be about political activity you engage in and why. But it should not be talking about political issues as much as it is talking about you and what motivates you and what you do about it. Complaining about unfair treatment of any kind doesn\u2019t make for a good essay\u2014it will always bring into question how valid your claims and it doesn\u2019t accomplish the goal of an essay, which is to show how you are a good candidate and will enhance the academic profile and campus culture of the school.
