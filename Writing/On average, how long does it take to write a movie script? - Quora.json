            "answer_text": "The answers offered here by Dan, James, and Sean are excellent as far as experienced screenwriters go. My answer is aimed at those who: are beginning or intermediate screenwritershave never had a script purchased or optionedare most likely just starting outmay have attended a writing course or two (or three)strongly desire to write a screenplay.There's a Hollywood legend that Sylvester Stallone, who is credited for authoring the screenplay for Rocky, locked himself in a room for three days and churned out the script. Supposedly Callie Khouri also wrote Thelma and Louise in a very short period. Other well-known screenwriters report the duration from beginning to end as months, years even.  For relatively inexperienced writers, the short answer to this question is that it depends what you are writing, who you are, what your writing style and practice is, and how much research you tend to conduct. Some writers really do seem to have the ability to envision something fairly thought out in their mind well beforehand, and get it all down very quickly. Other writers dwell on a story, or many stories, for a very long time before even putting pen on paper (or digital letters on a screen). Most probably fall somewhere in between. I think another interesting question related to this one is this: how long are you willing to spend on an idea you have for a screenplay? Your idea must be compelling enough to you that you will spend a large amount of time on it, up to a year. Maybe even longer. Maybe you\u2019ll be one of the lucky ones who can slam out a script in a few weeks. Probably not, though, especially if you\u2019re a beginning writer. Stories usually need time to develop in an author\u2019s head. If you\u2019re writing about something that demands research or background development -- say, a military espionage story set during the Cold War, or even a sci-fi fantasy that requires that you invent and populate a new universe -- you need time to develop and think through these ideas so they don\u2019t fall flat on the page. A screenplay is typically 120 pages long. With a LOT of white space. But there\u2019s a saying that a screenplay is the tip of the iceberg. That means that even though there\u2019s only 120 pages of double-spaced text, you\u2019re not seeing everything that went into that story on the surface. That under-surface stuff takes time to develop. ",

            "answer_text": "(Revised 5/13/19 - follow Ask a Screenwriter on Quora for more) I've written about twenty-two screenplays \"on assignment\" from different production companies and studios. The contracts I sign for each project stipulate how long I have to complete three \"steps.\" For the \"first draft,\" I'm given 10-12 weeks. Then I get a round of notes from executives and producers.For the \"revision\" of that draft I'm given 6 weeks, and receive another round of notes.Lastly, I do a \"polish\" which is supposed to take 3 weeks.*So \"how long it takes\" is often completely determined by the deadline. I could write a screenplay in a week if my deadline were next Sunday (but not a very good one.) When I write \u201cspec\u201d screenplays, which are completely original scripts that I hope to sell or finance myself, I take a bit longer. Often the best way to work on original material is to spend a lot of time getting feedback, doing table readings and putting the project aside for a period of time so that I can come back to it with fresh eyes. This process of \u201cworkshopping\u201d a script can take between six months and a year The important thing to remember is that screenplays are never really \"finished.\" Drafts are finished, but they are subject to revision. You may finish your \"writer's draft\" of a spec script in three weeks, but that's not the draft you show anyone. After a month of revisions, you may have your \"first draft,\" but when your friends, fellow screenwriters, and your agent read it, they will have all sorts of feedback, and you will want to make changes. It\u2019s exhausting, but successful writers are dogged about continually improving. Then, if the screenplay is sold, you will get feedback from development executives. Then, when a director is attached, he or she will have a \"take\" that may change things. Production difficulties may require changes as it is shot. Just last year I was called upon to write new scenes for \"reshoots\" on a project that had finished principal photography four months earlier. This process of feedback, revision. and recreation could last years. I sold my first spec script, eleven years ago, and after over 20 rewrites over a decade, I just recently was paid to do yet another rewrite of a very early draft, so that (I hope, I hope, finally) the humble little movie will go into production next year. (Edit: As it turned out that film spent another two years in development and was finally shot 12 years after the original spec script was finished.) So, I'd argue that screenplays are really protean documents, subject to continual revision, and aren't \"finished\" until the movie actually premiers. Follow Ask A Screenwriter on Quora. Edit: Contracts these days tend to be \u201cone-step deals\u201d instead of \u201cthree-step deals\u201d meaning that most producers expect writers to do multiple rewrites and polishes for free. However, the time one is given to complete the screenplay remains the same.",

            "answer_text": "The existing answers are all the best on this, so my answer is merely to highlight a few points already made, just in more detail, and to add some personal perspective about key elements that affect the pace of writing a screenplay. On average, for most of the scripts I write, it takes me between six to  eight weeks to complete a first draft if I'm working to try and get it  done at a regular, consistent pace. That can change by a week or so  either way, depending on my energy level and enthusiasm, but two months  is probably a good estimate. Every writer is different and has different habits, works either more loosely or with a more strict schedule, etc.  But by and large, it's typically -- not always, for those who prefer to just plunge right into the deep end, but for most people usually -- true that every day you spend in preparation on the front end can save you weeks on the back end.  Outlining, sequencing, Act breakdowns, and building that wonderful life-saving board of index cards might take two to three weeks of frustration, but it'll save you a huge amount of time in the long run. Personal example, and I swear to you this is true -- I have on three occasions written screenplays (two feature-length film scripts and a one-hour TV pilot) in twelve days or less.  One of them took three days to write a first draft of the screenplay: but I did a rough story outline first, then bios for my characters about their pasts etc (although almost none of it went into the script), a sequence and a board (index cards of each scene, stuck to my corkboard in order for easy removal and editing and rearranging etc), all of which took me probably two weeks. So the actual scripting stage went very quickly, and I stayed up late every night working on it until it was finished. When I got notes from the director for a rewrite, I was able to yank those index cards off, rewrite them and restructure the story in less than one week and hand in a completed new draft.  This was only possible because I worked seven days per week doing the front-end lifting that lightened the load later. As Sean said in his answer, a deadline makes all the difference. When writing my own spec scripts, I'll spend lots of time on the front-end business and work through it until I'm comfortable with the characters and sequencing, since I'm on my own schedule. But when I'm paid to complete a project by a given date, it might be two months or two weeks, and I have to write in the time allowed. During the 2011 Japanese quake and tsunami, for example, I'd been hired to do a rewrite on a screenplay in just a couple of weeks time.When I got it, it turned out to be a page-one rewrite because the production had literally been halted because the script was in no condition to proceed. I could've returned the money and backed out, but I decided to do it anyway, so that meant recreating the story from scratch and doing my own new version of the story (I used the main concept but then redid most of the story and events) and script (I used less than a 20% of the content from the original version of the script) in just 14 days. I stayed up about five straight days without any sleep whatsoever, but got it finished in about twelve days. If I'd had four weeks to do it, then I'd have gotten sleep and taken my time on more front-end setup, and probably turned it in in about three weeks or a bit more. The deadline determined how long it took, in other words. I applaud anyone who can write screenplays without notes and outlines  and bios and sequencing, I tried it a few times and merely wasted weeks,  because I had to start all over eventually -- with outlines and bios  and sequencing and index cards first, which I should've done in the  first place.  How rigidly you follow this structure depends on you, of  course, but having prepared is always a bonus for the vast majority of  writers. Also, practice typing. Take classes, learn the shortcuts of your  screenwriting software (you have to have some software, if you try to  use space-space-space-space-space-space on a manual typewriter or Word  document to add margins etc by hand, you'll go insane, so get the  software).  I can type about 100 words per minute with about 90%  accuracy now, just from tons of practice and taking classes.  Get  proficient at it, get good and organized at the front-end preparations,  and you'll be writing your screenplay in half the time or less than it  would otherwise take you. ",

            "answer_text": "Hollywood scripts follows a system. But you shouldn\u2019t pay heed to that especially if you start\u2026 Mainly because to pen a script takes lots of research and therefore lots of writing aspects to iron out before splashing in the biz\u2026 Because every script is about life and to write about it, you can only write what you know. And guess what? If you want to stick out of the competition, you need to know more about life than your competition\u2026 This is in order to find different paths and come up with original materials that the studios will be interested in. A bit like developing your own business bait\u2026 Those who answer here, have, for most, done such research, while others might just be luckier or had contact(s) in the biz prior to starting writing. But normally when you are attracted to writing, its because you feel that you have something to say and share with the world. But how to say it is a very important craft to learn. And this will take much more than just few months to iron out. You\u2019ll need to make your writing read by others, in order to understand how they see the world and this to better articulate yours and make sure peoples get what you want to say\u2026 So once you fill that cognitive tank of yours (sociology, psychology and so forth), you will be able to deliver contents within months\u2026 But to get there, you\u2019ll need years. Also, you must know that certain types of movies must come with a bible. This is the case for fantasy and sci-fi projects. Mainly because it involves world building and therefore a structural backbone different than our current reality. Doing this alone can take months and some studios require a first draft and a world bible\u2026Personally, I believe that EVERY movie types should come with a bible, at least for every character descriptions and background story. Because this makes your story hold together tighter and will be appreciated by any production team. It\u2019s also where your research in psychology and sociology can shine\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Easy Answer- AS LONG AS IT TAKES YOU TO WRITE IT! unless you have a deadline, as mentioned by others, the time it takes is a personal matter depending upon your critical skills. To quote Bob Seger-\u201d Deadlines and commitments, what to leave in, what to leave out.\u201d HARD Answer- In any profession, there\u2019s always a timeline to be committed to. Whether that\u2019s a few days, a few weeks, a few months or a year or more. A film script can go through dozens of re-writes, complete upheavals based upon the time constraints of the directors, changing directors, new input from the client/writer(s). YOU can have it DONE as far as YOU are concerned only to have the film-makers come back and say, \u201cWE can\u2019t do that, it\u2019s not in the budget, you\u2019ll have to come up with something we\u2019ve already got in the can. (Film lingo for already shot footage) NOW this can be very frustrating as you\u2019re sure that you can\u2019t think of one more thing that would fit into the film and still be cohesive, but you do it anyways. THIS is what script writing is all about, making the changes needed to allow the director to bring out the best in his actors and make it believable to his audience. IF no one can believe that your characters are capable of doing some action or words you\u2019ve penned, then you have a problem with their basic traits and that will come off as poor acting, not scripting. IF you have a problem with poor acting and good scripting, then that lies with the Director, not the script. Look at every B-Grade movie you\u2019ve ever seen, not the most money to spend on special effects, not the greatest actors to work with, SO unless it has a GREAT script, it will remain mediocre at best and become a cult classic for the worst ever made at the worst. Sooo in answer to your question, IT TAKES AS LONG AS IT TAKES. ",

            "answer_text": "It can take anywhere from about 5 days to 5 years. There's really three stages, outlining/planning, writing, and editing. If you mean the actual writing portion, this will depend a lot on how well you've outlined already. If you wrote a 300 page treatment for your story, it'd be reasonable to write the screenplay in just a few days. If you've got something more like a 1-2 page bullet point list of plot points, maybe 1-2 months, depends on how much you write every day. I've had times where I've put down 10 pages in an hour, and hours that resulted in less than 10 words. But, when I sit down and commit at least 3 continuous hours, I do no worse than 1 page per hour, and typically closer to 3 per hour. And then there's editing. A screenplay isn't written until it's rewritten. Some people power through a first draft as fast as they can and then get to work editing. Other people edit as they go. One writer (can't remember who) on the Dialogue interview series said the first thing he does when he sits down to write is start at page one and read through everything he has so far, editing as he goes. So, he could easily spend 2 hours \"writing\" and not be a single line further (probably less!), which seems like it takes forever to write, but after all that editing you get into the story and can write new material quicker, and you've left yourself with little editing to do after. So, the tl;dr of all this is: You're writing your first screenplay, stop worrying about how long other people take. Just write every day until you reach the end. However long it took is how long it takes you. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on many factors how long it will take. If the film script has 3 or 4 main characters then it is easy to weave a screenplay. It can be written perhaps in three months. That is the first draft i mean. The process still continues.If the film has more than 3 main characters then it takes me much longer. Maybe six months or more for the first draft.It depends if the story is realistic or is it larger than life ? Like a super hero film for example. If it is larger than life the possibilities increase manifolds. So it takes longer. Realistic films take lesser time.I find it is much easier to write for eatablished stars. Because you know your target audience and the expectations that they will have from your movie. With new faces you have to carve out new characters. Ofcourse with established stars also i try and bring some new traits in the characterisation. But have to reatain their image more often than not.The longer i take to write a script, i feel it becomes better. I am able to distance myself after a draft and then attack it with a completely objective mind. In which case you can see large loopholes in your own script.So you see it is very difficult to say how much time a script takes. Frankly speaking it also depends on the deadlines. If you have only six months then you are bound by it. Then you do your best.But ultimately if left to me, the longer i take, the better it becomes. Its like cooking. On a low flame a dish may take longer to cook. But its surely going to taste better. Similarly there is no end to improving a script.",

            "answer_text": "I once wrote three scripts in one day, all of which were produced for a TV series which won an Academy Award. I once wrote a movie script on the back of a sickbag while on a plane. It was also an award winning script. I once was asked to do an idea for a TV commercial. I suggested the first thing that came to mind, and it was accepted. It took less than five minutes. I have to admit that I worked in Animation where most movies are quite short, and are typically based on ideas rather than stories. But though animated movie scripts can be created quickly, it can take a very long time to actually make the movie. I believe that it took Disney six years to produce Snow White. Even with computers an animated movie takes far longer than a live-action movie to make. The question of How long does it take to write a movie script? is not very meaningful as it may mean writing one from scratch or transcribing a book into a movie. Most screenwriters actually work on transcriptions rather than original work. Screen writing requires visualising the screen shots.  These are presented in a Storyboard that show the camera shot and instructions (zoom into close-up of face. Cut to window. Pan across to door. etc.)Instructions of dialogue, sound effects, and music may be added. etc. The storyboard may be developed into a Previs (pre-visualisation) of the scene more accurately portrayed. Or amy be done as an Animatic (a sort of slide show matched to the soundtrack to get an idea of timing). Screenwriters are required at all of these stages, though it may not be the same screenwriter for all of them. These are called Pre-production stages, and required by the Director who will work with the screenwriter. For feature movies the 'Script' might well take two or three years in preparation.

            "answer_text": "I wonder if any writer can realistically arrive at any sort of average. When we write spec scripts, we probably wouldn't call it a completed draft for months, or years.  There's no pressure except what we exert upon ourselves, and if there is intense fire burning, I'd say three to four weeks would be a good estimate for a first draft - something we'd dare let someone else read and react to. The first time I was hired to write, which was by the way the first full length screenplay I wrote outside of film school, I got to a first draft in forty days, after all the research material was handed to me on a platter.  It was a period piece and there was pressure, but I could have taken longer.  It was, however 360 pages long, and the producer kept telling me not to bother! Another time I was asked to write, with the promise of an option looming large, I adapted a real life story, with the narrator sitting next to me, in six days.  It was intense writing, but it felt more like typing work.  The narrator himself was the subject, and he had one journey to relive.  He did exactly that, and I just hammered away at the keys, putting things in format.  Sure enough, on the 7th day it went to the producer and she optioned it for a decent amount of money! As a thumb rule, I'd say from my personal experience, six weeks, when I have a decent idea what the travel of the story is.  Three pages a day seems about right.  Re-writes can take any length of time.  The rest of the process, once it's getting slated for production, one can never tell how long. Some writers will also be writing more than one or two at any given time. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on who you are, who you are writing for and what your contract says. Let me explain: If you are a spec writer, looking to break into the industry, you may take as long as you like. But if you are a screenwriter, writing under contract, it\u2019s a different thing. Most standard WGA contracts will allow you 12 weeks to finish your first draft. Then a lot less for the second and third draft and so on. This, of course, assumes that there\u2019s already a treatment or at the very least; an outline. Treatments and outlines are necessary preliminary steps in writing any screenplay. No professional writer would begin to write the first draft without these vital first steps. Most screenplays, therefore, begin, not with the screenplay but with a logline or a pitch. This pitch can take a long time to develop, even though it's only a few sentences long. That\u2019s because a Logline is the foundation of a story and if you don\u2019t have a good foundation, to begin with, the actual writing of the story will be marred by major irreparable problems. I have worked with writers who spend as much as months, just to make sure that their story concept worked before they even began writing anything. Then comes the one-page outline, then the beat sheet, then the treatment. That is usually how professional screenplays are developed - before the screenplay is even begun. As for myself? - Every project is different. I recently finished Treatment for a Studio project that took me almost 6 months to finish. It\u2019s a biopic and so there was a lot of research involved. _ and that is just the Treatment. Soon, we will begin writing the actual screenplay but that won\u2019t take long because so much work was already put into the Treatment. But as I said; every project is different. & month for a treatment is a very long time but I once wrote an entire screenplay in 4 weeks. It was not my idea to do it this way. I was hired by a Production company to re-write a screenplay for a movie that was less than two months away from principal photography. The movie had been cast, the costumes designed and the sets build and so our deadline was, as the name implies; forced upon us. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s not a great answer to this question. It takes as long as it takes to honestly work through to the truth of the story. For me, the actual script writing is about 10 sessions of about 5 to 10 hours, where I write anywhere from 5\u201315 pages each session. That part doesn\u2019t change. But before and in-between those sessions is lots of talking and thinking and watching movies. I\u2019ve jumped in and wrote a script with very minimal time before script-writing. Then other times there was a full year of just talking about the script before a page was written. The more you know your subject and characters and genre, the easier it comes. When I wrote my slasher movie, a genre I love and know well, it was the fastest I wrote anything. The story took place all in one night, so there\u2019s only so many places the story can go. Then again, when I write comedy, it takes months and months of dicking around with friends to find the jokes and sequences that really work. As long as it takes, is the short answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Big-time professional screenwriters typically get 12 weeks to write a first draft, as John August notes in his excellent blog. Shorter deadlines may be compelled by production requirements. For example, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber wrote The Fault in Our Stars in six days. John August wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in three weeks. On the other hand, Dan Gilroy noted in this interview, \u201cIf I had a year, I\u2019d spent 11 months thinking about the idea and then four weeks writing.\u201d When I\u2019m paid by the hour to write scripts, I need to keep track of my time. For example, it took me 67 hours (spread over several weeks) to go from a client\u2019s basic idea (mail order brides + neo-Nazis in Ukraine) to a detailed treatment and then to a first draft of the script Odessa. As with many things related to screenwriting, there\u2019s no one right answer to the question, \u201chow long does it take to write a script?\u201d More on my blog: About Time (STPS #6) - Lauri Donahue ",

I had a presold miniseries assignment and they wanted to shoot in two months.  Problem was the existing script wasn't up to par so I had to do a page one rewrite (starting from scratch while keeping certain concept and character elements)... and I had 2.5 weeks to write 250 pages.  Then another month for rewrites.  Then it was delayed.  Then they had their writers touch it up for production and casting availability.  Instead of a summer 2010 shoot, it was a November 2010 to April of this year shoot.   But if you're talking writing something on spec, should take no more than 6 months.  If it takes longer, you're not working your personal discipline enough.  That's the hardest part to master. ",

When a studio hires you to write a movie, the contract generally gives you a 12-week writing period. Often, those deadlines are not strictly enforced, but you'll start getting \"just checking in\" phone calls from producers and executives when that time is nearly up. ",

My last feature length script (100 pages) took 10 weeks for first draft, and a month for each subsequent draft - 6 months in all until I had an industry-ready 'first draft'. I aimed to write 10 pages a week, although sometimes I was doing that much per day, sometimes more. The 10 page per week limit was for revised pages, which had been proofed, and sense checked. I had each 10 page section blocked out in advance, so I knew where the plot had to be at the end of the tenth page, but how I got there I left in the writing, not the planning. This is very much my own way of working, and may not be best for everyone, but it gets a completed feature script in 3-6 months, depending on revisions. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of this answer depends on who you're writing for.  If you know what you're doing, have an outline in place and understand what most of the principals want from you, then I think three to four months is about right.   That's not where you're going to be spending a lot of time and it's not the stressful part of the writing stage either.  It's the re-writes that take forever and require the most skill and those can't really be narrowed down to an \"average\" time because it depends on how many people are involved and how sophisticated the shooting structure is.   If you're an experienced screenwriter, you should be able to churn out a spec script in a matter of days.  The more complex the project, the longer it takes to do story arcs and outlines and various other selling points.  It also depends on the genre and what your level of comfort is with what you're doing. ",

If you mean conceive of, structure, characterize, dramatize, put flesh on and polish to a professional standard first draft anything less than 3 months is fast (but there are plenty of second rate first drafts that were doubtless done faster.)  Billy Wilder and Hitchcock typically took a year.   But if you mean 'type' it can be much faster.  In other words, if you have been mulling over the story for years, pondering the best way through it, cogitating on the ideal characters to dramatise it... even if you have not made any notes at all, if it chrystallizes and you sit down to write it can be very fast.

Also, a movie script could be based on a book which means the script could be created a lot faster, especially if the book features a movie-like story. A better question might be, How long does it take to write a decent first draft of an original screenplay? It takes a professional screenwriter about 2-3 months, hence the union/industry standard of 12 weeks. The novice might take longer. A lot longer... LOL. ",

Let's say Dan is lucky enough to option his script, he will be required to give the producers a couple of rewrites. Then, if a director is attached, or a star, he (or very likely someone else) will do a couple more rewrites. This development process can go on for years and he's still not guaranteed to ever see it in theaters. ",

If you already have written down the story then there is a good chance of being able to write the script/screenplay faster. In case you have visualized your story then quickly write it down and then start visualizing the scenes. Any screenplay must have a beginning, middle and and end. In my humble opinion it may take 5 to 10 drafts before completing one movie script. Duration in terms of time depends on how freely your mind is able to imagine and create the scenes. Hope this helps. ",
