            "answer_text": "No. That saying is actually mostly a compliment and a positive affirmation about the high grade and quality of Black skin. \"Black don't crack\" means that Black skin is highly durable and tends not to get wrinkly as we get older. We can stay out in the sun and not have to worry as much about damaging our skin. This doesn't mean that we don't get heat rash, sun tan or skin cancer.  It also has a somewhat I am better than you implication. In my family, the women would sometimes say it to authoritatively declare that their skin and skin tone was of a higher grade than white women. The argument was that white women get wrinkled up like a prune or raisin as they age. And Black women keep their smooth and supple skin for their entire lives. I also know plenty of older Black people that look much younger than their age. Like 80-year-old people still looking 50. It's a pretty common thing in the Black community, but not the absolute rule. For example, I am 38 and people think I am still in my mid-20's. It is not cool having a baby face and being treated like a perpetual university student when I am almost 40. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Black don't crack\" is a colloquial way of saying a scientifically accurate statement. Higher natural levels of melanin in the skin helps to prevent sun damage which is one of the main causes of apparent aging. There's nothing racist about making true remarks about physiological features. A corollary would be a Norwegian man saying \"pale don't get rickets\" which unfortunately doesn't rhyme or sound as cool but is also a true fact about white skin and its greater capacity to create vitamin D. Some of the other answers have focused on the fact that it's a compliment but compliments can still be racist. For example if you were to say \"Asians are great at math\" you might feel like you are complimenting someone but it's not actually true that someone is going to be automatically great at mathematics just because of their race. I used to compete in national mathematics competitions when I was in school and I did pretty well but I never won. The winners were almost always Chinese. Their success was entirely a result of the fact that they worked much harder at it than I did which is cultural not racial. If I were  say to the winner \"You won because you're Asian and Asians are great at mathematics\" I would have been writing off all the hard work that he or she did. Not cool. ",

Now had I made a statement referring to his skin colour that was not true, eg\u2026.white people are better than black people, then that would be racist. I then proceeded to ask other black people I know how they felt about a white person saying it and not one of them thought it was racist. So I would say no, but then I live in the UK where we don\u2019t see every little thing as racist, an American may well say the opposite, and they will usually be white and middle class. ",

Hmmmm I don\u2019t think it\u2019s generally racist because of the meaning behind it and most people who use this phrase don\u2019t mean it like crac_ _ r. Hmmm interesting question though. Of course I am sure a select few probably do mean it in a racist way but 99% of them don\u2019t. What they mean is black skin doesn\u2019t break, get old, saggy, wrinkled or stays young looking longer yes it is true unless you smoke and drink a lot and have plenty of stress then they would probably age a few. To be honest my mom is almost 60 and doesn\u2019t have a single line on her face. I have smile lines around my mouth but she is fresh faced, young looking like a baby. ",

Any thing relating to race is by definition racist. Just claiming race as part of your identity is racist. Races are categories made up by people to separate us based on appearance as well as behavior. The reality is that we are all members of the same race, human, and people of different appearances can have the same behavioral patterns, and people with the same appearance can have different behavioral patterns. The idea of a different race is that they have somewhat similar appearance but very different behavior. This would be humanoid aliens, which as far as we know don\u2019t exist ",

            "answer_text": "Really its just that SOME paler people associate their own greater skin appearance changes with ageing, so they think that because they dont see it in dark skin, it doesnt age the same. The issue is that sometimes paler people are falsely obsessed with their youth - they ought to really focus on what they will look like from 30\u201370 years age, thats where they will spend nearly all their adult life\u2026not focus on looking 18. Thats not your normal adult features, its a phase that will be gone fast so dont focus on it. There used to be a real pride in looking older and rugged and scarred, but its been replaced recently with obsession with looking young, associating young with being immortal - youth is anything but immortal, its fleeting! Instead take pride in your appearance of your older self. There is a rugged handsomeness in skin with marks and wrinkles, its what you\u2019ll be soon, so learn to love it early, dont reject what you are going to be in a short time that makes no sense thats self hate. Sellers of skin lotions latched onto your obsession with youth decades ago and have made a packet from it ever since - dont waste your money chasing youth looks that are gone in a moment, take pride in middle aged looks, and dont waste your money on skin products!
