Psychologists who study how attention works call this \u201cnegativity bias.\u201d The tendency to devote the lion\u2019s share of our attention to looking for trouble is probably hardwired into our brains. The very survival of early humans, after all, required hypervigilance to possible danger. The fact that we all tend toward negativity bias means that both writers and the people providing writing feedback are pulled subconsciously to focus on problems. Though negativity bias may be hardwired into the way we think, it is possible to overcome that bias. Simply becoming aware of this tendency is the first step to expanding your ability to see your writing more fully and accurately\u2014to recognize your strengths as well as your challenges. Begin to more accurately understand your own writing\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, it\u2019s helpful to lighten up about the whole process. Try to replace judgment with curiosity. In that spirit, the next blog offers quizzes you can take to help you more accurately evaluate both your writing and your writing process.
