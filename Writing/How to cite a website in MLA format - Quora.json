            "answer_text": "MLA 8 is built around the information you have. For an in-text citation, use the last name of the author and the paragraph you are citing\u2014 so if you are citing an article by Julie Sceflo in the New York Times (that you found on a web site), your citation might be \u201c(Sceflo par. 4).\u201d For the Works Cited, the website will be the \u201cfirst container\u201d or \u201csecond container\u201d depending on the source. MLA 7 was very much built around citing based on the medium. A book is cited like this, a DVD like this, etc. MLA 8 assumes that you may find the same text in many places. If you find an article in the print version of the New York Times, there\u2019s only one \u201ccontainer.\u201d If you find the same article online, the website counts as a second \u201ccontainer.\u201d So asking how to cite a website is a question that makes sense in MLA 7; in MLA 8, not so much. If the website has no author, then be wary of it. If you use a research database, like JStor or Ebsco, those databases typically provide the Works Cited entry for you. Whenever possible, use your school\u2019s library resources\u2014 it will save you time and money\u2014 and the information will usually be more reliable. ",

            "answer_text": "MLA Works Cited: Electronic Sources // Purdue Writing Lab Basically, you give as much info as the website provides. Author. If no author, begin with \u201cTitle of Specific Page\u201d For your in-text citation, author\u2019s last name, or if none is given, the first few words of the title of the page in quotation marks. So, for example, you are citing information from the CDC on vaping:Outbreak of Lung Injury Associated with the Use of E-Cigarette, or Vaping, Products Like most government websites, there is no author listed. But the page does have a title: \u201cOutbreak of Lung Injury Associated with the Use of E-Cigarette, or Vaping, Products.\u201d Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 20 Dec. 2019. www. etc .gov And in-text: (\u201cOutbreak of Lung Injury\u201d) Despite the lack of a listed author, this is a very credible and authoritative site. Other cases where a website has no author listed, it might lack some credibility. Look around at the bottom of the page to see if an author is listed elsewhere on the page. ",
