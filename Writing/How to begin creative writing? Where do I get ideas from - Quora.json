            "answer_text": "By creative writing I assume you mean writing fiction. You can begin anywhere. You have an idea for a character, or scene, or incident or perhaps an observation. Write it down. Rinse and repeat. In the meantime, read \u201cTechniques of the Selling Writer\u201d by Dwight Swain, it contains all the techniques you\u2019ll need. As you read it, you\u2019ll see how to improve what you\u2019re working on or have already done. A key thing you\u2019re trying to figure out is why readers read fiction, what do they get out of it, what do they want? As a writer, this is something you want to develop and feeling for. I\u2019ve found \u201cOn Film-Making\u201d by Alexander Mackendrick very helpful, especially the first chapter, \u201cWhat is a story?\u201d You might think you're not writing for a reader, but only writing for yourself. But you're really writing for your own imagination as a reader \u2014 you can't help it. No one can. A large part of learning to write more effective fiction is educating your imagination as a reader, refining it, honing it, getting better at choices, selections, and alternatives. It seems to me that the only way a person gets this sort of education is via experience, hence the expression, \"You can learn to write, but no one can teach you to write.\" ",

            "answer_text": "One doesn't begin creative writing, he/she can only start writing when the soul in them can no longer resist the creative energy that is flowing. You first write, then paint and at some point, bleed. That's when you've mastered the craft. Remember, when you bleed! Don't search for ideas on the internet, ask friends, family for help etc., dig your soul. Never focus on being the best. Find your voice. It's unique for each and every one. Tell world something they've not heard before or make them feel something which they've not felt before. That's what artists do. Don't just stick around to writing. When you are artistic, you can be artistic simply with the way you lead your life and remember, this is true vice-versa too. When you are not artistic, nothing you do is artistic, even if you consider painting the next monalisa! To be artistic, all you've got to do is, be little receptive and pay more attention. Feel things deeper. If you still don't, don't! You have something hidden inside for long and breaking it's chains, you yearn for freedom, that's when you know that the creative dimension of your soul had come to life. Don't do anything because you have to, do because there is something that was never known like it or never been felt that way. Don't consider any of this as something to mock/let you down. Just trying to help you find your voice and awaken the artist that you are. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "You can take courses, but you may not have the money to do that. The first thing you should do is read. Read the sorts of books you want to write. Read them slowly and pay attention to what the writer is doing in terms of structure, language, tone. Does the writer you enjoy reading use long or short sentences? Do they tell their stories in a linear fashion, or is it all chopped up with flashbacks or leaps from character to character? Does the work include a lot of detailed description, or is it sparse allowing the reader to fill in the gaps? You may need to read that favorite book over and over to catch all the nuances. Buy a cheap copy and write in the margins of the book. At some point, after you\u2019ve really taken the time to dissect your favorite books, you\u2019re going to find the stories you want to tell trying to mold themselves into something you are ready to write. Maybe you\u2019ve started keeping a journal. That\u2019s a great practice to develop a daily writing habit. That\u2019s the next step. By this point, you are probably hooked. ",

Write down thoughts. Observe people and write similar conversations. Write on any of the topics above. At some point you need to switch from regularly writing about anything to deciding what it is you want to write about. Then do all of the above from the context of writing about something specific. Then turn all your notebook data into research, and change it into poetry, memoir, essays, articles or into story. You might start by taking a creative writing class or by a class on the specific genre. Books can be good starting teachers. Read in addition to writing--seek 3 to 5 sources per genre. ",

First, though, put pen to paper and DO NOT TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU ARE WRITING. Once you tell someone \u201cI\u2019m writing this story about\u2026\u201d then you will probably never finish whatever you started. Stay quiet, get started, maybe write an outline so you don\u2019t get sidetracked (For novels and longer works, jot down your characters) For an actual novel, the characters might write their own plot. For action, adventure, swords and sorcery, future dramas, westerns, you might want to sketch your plot line ahead of time. Anyway, good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "The only way to start writing is to write, every day. It doesn\u2019t hurt to take some classes on different types of writing, but writing is like any other skill. Unless you practice diligently, you will not learn how to do it well. At first, it will feel like every thing you do is crap. It doesn\u2019t matter. Keep going. You will get better. When you start a piece don\u2019t worry about style or correctness, just get your idea on paper. Try not to edit as you go. It will just slow you down and you can get so caught up in details you lose the meat of your idea. You will always have plenty of time when the first draft is done to go back and re-write and polish and re-write again. Someone once gave me some good advice. If you have a thought but just can\u2019t seem to figure out how to write it, \u201cJust say it.\u201d Explain to yourself what you are trying to say and then write that down. Finally, another person who answered your question gave some very good advice. Unless you are pitching an idea to an editor, don\u2019t talk about what you are writing. Many a story has been talked to death and never written. Hope this helps. ",
