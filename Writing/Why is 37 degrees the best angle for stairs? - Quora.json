            "answer_text": "It is considered that a 10 inch tread and a 7.5 inch rise is a good stair. which is 36.86\u00b0 There is a rule of thumb for a good stair as follows. In inches with r = rise and t = tread then r + t = 17 to 18 r \u00d7 t = 70 to 75 2r + t = 24 to 25 According to Gilbert Townsend\u2019s book which is pictured below.  There is another reason why this angle is used, certainly amongst the connoisseur of the beautifull staircase, appart from the fact that they just look right, It\u2019s to do with arrangement of risers around a circular wellhole between landings, its considered that the dimension between handrail centres on wellholes should be about 10 inch ( the reason being that carving wreaths by hand is difficult when the radius is less than 5 inches and modern machinery is no better ) which results in the risers being 5 inches back from the end of the circular wellhole ( half the tread ) so they spring from the diameter of the circular wellhole, the wreath of a continuous hand rail will pass between the planes perfectly considering that the intersection of the two planes ( which contain the straight parts) will be directly above the apex of the circular whellhole. Townsend offers us a diagram of a good stair with a wellhole radius larger than half the width of a tread and we see our risers don\u2019t look right at all.  Notice where they have ended up, the wreath will look ok, but the risers won\u2019t look good. With carefull planning you can get it so the wreath never breaks in inclination and the risers look right, as the following figure shows  Notice how the straight part goes into the wreath seamlessly, you simply can\u2019t get better.

            "answer_text": "The design of stairs has to balance between the ease of climb/descent for infirm persons (favoring low slope stairs), and building space demands (favoring high slope stairs). According to US building codes, the optimal ratio between stair height (rise) and stair depth (tread) is considered to be \u02dc 0.59 , which corresponds to a slope of about 30 degrees. ",
