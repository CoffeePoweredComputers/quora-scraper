            "answer_text": "For pistols and semi-automatic rifles in calibres above .22LR in England, Scotland or Wales, you would need to have what\u2019s called in the legislation \u201cSection 5 authority\u201d as those weapons fall in the Prohibited Weapons category. This is already a very rare thing to be issued - maritime security companies can get them, as international shipping with armed guards may pass through British ports, but this requires specific authorisation from the Home Secretary (rather than your local police force) and needs to be supported by ample evidence of the business need for those weapons, and details of how the weapons will be acquired, stored and used. Additionally, since 1968 self-defence has not generally been accepted as the \u201cgood reason\u201d on a firearms certificate application. There are a vanishingly small number of private individuals in the UK who could get special dispensation to carry for protection (current and former police officers in Northern Ireland, for instance, can carry on and off duty if they are at risk of reprisals from paramilitary groups), and this would generally require a specific threat which could not be effectively countered by any other means than a personal firearm. The generalised risk that someone might rob the store/bank/warehouse where the security guard works does not qualify for this, especially when you consider the relatively low numbers of firearms in criminal circulation in this country (the reasons for which I have gone into detail on in answers to other questions). As for private close protection officers (bodyguards) - the same laws apply, and special dispensation must be sought from the Home Office to carry a pistol for this purpose (and for a private individual\u2019s CPO, is very unlikely to be granted). Protection of senior government officials, the Royal Household, foreign diplomats and visiting foreign dignitaries is provided by the Met Police\u2019s Protection Command, which employs specialist armed police officers in this role. Arrangements may be made with the Home Office under the above-described laws for visiting heads of state who have their own armed protection detail e.g. when POTUS visits the UK I would be astonished if his Secret Service bodyguards aren\u2019t armed. The short answer to your question is generally no, and for the special cases where it might be allowed there are a LOT of hoops to jump through to get there. ",

            "answer_text": "Are private security guards allowed to carry guns in the UK? No. Simply owning a firearm in the UK requires a licence; to be able to acquire a licence you must satisfy the licensing authority (the local police) that you not a threat to the public safety, and have a valid reason for wanting one. Wanting a firearm for protection, of yourself or others, isn't considered a valid reason for wanting to own a firearm in the UK. Section 13.80, on page 121 of the Guide on Firearms Licensing Law states the following: Applications for the grant of a firearm certificate for the applicant\u2019s, or another\u2019s, protection, or that of premises, should be refused on the grounds that firearms are not an acceptable means of protection in Great Britain. It has been the view of successive Governments for many years that the private possession and carriage of firearms for personal protection is likely to lead to an increase in levels of violence. This principle should be maintained in the case of applications from representatives of banks and firms protecting valuables or large quantities of money, or from private security guards and bodyguards. The exception to this would be armed guards on UK flagged ships, the justification being the unique threat posed by piracy to cargo and passenger ships in specific high risk geographical areas. As you can see, the single exception to this is for what are called Private Maritime Security Companies (PMSCs) who are being used to guard UK flagged vessels; and even then, this only applies in very specific circumstances, as set out on page 222 of the Guide on Firearms Licensing Law: The policy to allow the use of armed guards applies only in exceptional circumstances: - to ships transiting the area at risk of attack by pirates within the High Risk Area (HRA) which is bounded: in the Red Sea: northern limit: Latitude 15\u00b0N; in the Gulf of Oman: Northern limit: Latitude 22\u00b0N; Eastern limit: Longitude 065\u00b0E; Southern limit: Latitude 5\u00b0S; - when \u2018Best Management Practices\u2019 to deter piracy is being followed fully but, on its own, is not deemed by the shipping company and the ship\u2019s master as sufficient to protect against acts of piracy; AND - the use of armed guards is assessed to reduce the risk to the lives and wellbeing of those on board the ship.

            "answer_text": "Unless you consider the US President\u2019s Secret Service detail \u2018private security\u2019 then no. The Secret Service (and other visiting dignitaries security teams) are allowed a degree of diplomatic freedom in a multi-way, multi-national contra-deal. This means when the British royals go on state visits, their security detail is British, if Putin came to London, his security detail would be Russian, and so on. They all work with the local security detail too, so the Secret Service worked with CTSFO officers on Trump\u2019s UK visit. As a wealthy private individual, any security guards you hire cannot legally carry any form of defensive or offensive weapon\u2026 just like any other private citizen in the UK. You and your team can legally wear body armour and drive round in an armoured car, but your close protection team is best made up of heavies who can tear a human in two with their bare hands, rather than good shots.
