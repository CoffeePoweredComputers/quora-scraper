            "answer_text": "Because you are unique. Whether better or worse, it doesn\u2019t matter. The reason is simple. You want to write. I can simply relate this to myself. I\u2019m a Chess player. An absolute mediocre player. Whenever I play, I used to get a feeling that greats like Magnus Carlsen or Vishy Anand or any Chess player would easily win over me and they would find my games silly and I\u2019m nothing before them. All these silly thoughts would come to my mind. You know what, my performance hampered. There was nothing I can do to play and there was no reason to play at all. It was ultimately forcing me to abandon the game which i wanted to play. I would be the sole loser if I did so. Just because everybody is better than us, doesn\u2019t mean we have to stop doing the things which we want to do. The problem here is, we are more concerned with being the best than with expressing our ability. When you write, it\u2019s your soul that tells the narrative. It\u2019s our mind that compares with others and it destroys us. In other words, we don\u2019t need to be the best to express ourselves. But if you express the best, you will be the best. Believe me, there\u2019s beauty in every form of expression. You are free to write. Why not harness your freedom? There\u2019s no way can we compare artworks. It\u2019s all about how well your writing inspired the reader, how well the reader perceived. If there were no readers to Jane Eyre, even that beautiful masterpiece would have gone waste in terms of readability and popularity. But it wouldn\u2019t make it unworthy and crap. It wouldn\u2019t snatch away Charlotte\u2019s emotions while she was writing the book, which are much valuable than having the comparative degrees of artwork.Enjoy your writing and everything will fall into their place. Later on I came to understand that playing the game my way whether win or loss gave me more happiness than thinking about my inferiority. Instead, I focused on the ways to improve my game. Nobody would know what\u2019s in store for us. Express your uniqueness.. Sorry for my bad English. Hope you got my point. Thanks for reading!! ",

            "answer_text": "You should never do anything if you feel it is pointless in comparison to someone else having performed it better than you ever can. By that logic, you will never be able to do anything because on a planet with a population of over 7 billion, someone has already done a better job of it than you will. A lot of people have bouts where they feel inadequate compared to other people. It took me a long time to write on Quora, because there are such gifted people here and it's always intimidating. I still feel twinges of jealousy and awe when I read some of the things here because they are written so beautifully. But you have an individual voice. Even Fifty Shades of Grey (condemned though it is) has a fan following because it has touched people. Write because you like to write. Write because you want to improve, because you are in competition with yourself. Write because though you might not write beautifully, maybe you are bringing about a change in someone, because right now they need to read exactly what you want to say. It is never meaningless to try. It is only meaningless when you have the ability to do something but you do not exercise it. ",
