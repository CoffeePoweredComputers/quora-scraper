            "answer_text": "No. It depends on your genre, really. If you are writing horror, that probably is a perfect length. Scripts don\u2019t appear to be longer than 110 pages now. However, the page count depends on the story itself. If you believe you told your story and it happens to be only 90 pages then that\u2019s all she wrote. ",
