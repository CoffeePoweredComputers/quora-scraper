            "answer_text": "This is definitely one of those questions where it is going to very much vary with the situation. I think many professors (and I assume you are talking about an undergrad research position here) are more interested in seeing that you are excited, genuine in your interest and the sort of person that won't get bored and leave after the second week of scrubbing out rat cages (or whatever), than in you having a deep understanding of their field/work (this is very different for approaching a graduate adviser however). Keep in mind that your ability to even learn about their work is going to be hampered by a lot of things. For instance the papers they have published will be for work that they did at least a year ago, if not more. It is very possible that whatever project(s) they have going now are totally different from those they were doing in the past. Another thing is that, chances are good you are going to be doing totally menial stuff, like mixing up reagents, washing dishes, restocking, et c. What is going to set you apart (and what I think the profs are going to look for) are 1. 'can you stick around through the boring stuff to get to the cool stuff?' and 2. 'Can you pick up enough information about the work and projects by being immersed in the environment that you can move up?'.  TL;DR: If you are genuinely excited about their work then read a recent paper or two and maybe mention it casually if it comes up in conversation, but don't worry about (or expect to become) an expert. Otherwise just project that you are the sort of person that can show up to the lab on time and ask decent questions and you should be okay. ",

            "answer_text": "There is an unwritten rule I have experienced -- everyone gets an hour, free. That is, if you visit the laboratory, they will spend an hour showing you around, answering questions, etc. Obviously, you should read as much as possible ahead of any visit, or check web pages for laboratory facilities, etc., but if you get confused, don't sweat it.  THat's when it's time to pay a visit. ",
