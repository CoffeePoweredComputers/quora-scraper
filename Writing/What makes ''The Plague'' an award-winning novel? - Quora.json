The Plague may be the best novel of the century because it shows how to live a life of quiet heroism in circumstances of despair, loss, & death. it is a manual for how to live in a world without God\u2014just us people helping (or not helping) each other. The perfect novel to read in this pandemic. look this up on YouTube- there are several good lectures about this novel. And, remember: this is a book you have to read at least two or three times. ",
