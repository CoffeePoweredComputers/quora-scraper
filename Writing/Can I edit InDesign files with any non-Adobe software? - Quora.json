            "answer_text": "For what reason ?If you hope to be able to edit the layout, let text wrap to new lines and (re)flow along columns, add new images and texts in a same manner like InDesign: NO. Adobe InCopy lets you at least edit text in multiple ways, which is a boon for editors and translators. But it's also from Adobe, and it works closely with InDesign by letting you issue \"assignments\" from there. You could try creating EPS files (of separate pages), or preferably a PDF to enclose everything (on multiple pages) in a more trustworthy manner, and try to dissect these files and apply your changes in drawing applications. You could try converting InDesign files by using ID2Q (InDesign to QuarkXPress) from Markzware and continue working in QuarkXPress, but there will be some text flow differences, because of Adobe's proprietary and probably patented text spacing engine (don't \"booo\" this strategy \u2013 going from QuarkXPress to InDesign posed exactly the same problem). But these approaches will either cost you a lot of time or a lot of money (or both) and the latter does not guarantee any 1-to-1 similarity of the page content. If you're just trying to find an alternative to be able to ditch Adobe CC for some free or cheap other application, well, in that case, you're out of luck... BTW: Since Adobe InDesign version CC (and subscription related CS6) creating a package can automatically include an \"idml\" version of the file (written in XML), and these idml resources will also be available within the file itself. So InDesign files are not that \"proprietary\" or \"closed\" at all. It's just a very complex file structure, with a myriad of properties and settings. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been looking for an answer to this question as well, so here's what I've found. The short answer is 'no' - it's a consequence of Adobe's unfortunate decision to stand behind proprietary file types.  If your need is a short-term one, your best bet is to download the bloated (1.1GB) 30-day trial of InDesign and try to get your work done in that timeframe. Unfortunately this isn't always possible, and one competing (and open source, hurrah!) layout program I've found is called Scribus (http://www.scribus.net/). You can't open .indd files directly from Scribus, but you can quite closely re-create the same end results. This is similar to Gimp:Photoshop and Inkscape:Illustrator. Good luck! ",

Conversion is a bit woolly as well so you will spend time tidying up text overflows and layout anomalies. Otherwise, you can use Markzwares InDesign to Quark Express converter which will allow you to open Indesign files into the popular DTP software Quark Express: ID2Q (InDesign to QuarkXPress) Personally, having used InDesign since it\u2019s creation, I would consider investing in a copy.

If you subscribe annually it is also fairly cheap for ID only.If your reasons are not financial then the answer may be different as well. Short answer though is NO, you can't.
