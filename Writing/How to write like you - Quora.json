            "answer_text": "How can I write like you? What a silly human you are. You don\u2019t want to write like me, and you know it. You want to write like your favorite author, columnist, blogger, Quoran. I never put my best into Quora's writing and never expect high ratings. So flit off my computer screen; I\u2019m trying to hash out answers at an incredible pace so I can move on to \u201cprojects\u201d - you understand. Does this seem whacked out to you? It may be because you haven\u2019t lived my life, your culture is drastically different from what I was raised in, your personality and mine are either opposite or at least mildly confrontational, etc. - and all that contributes to the fact that we\u2019d never write alike, no matter what. If you want to write like an experienced author, study his or her style. But never try to imitate. That\u2019ll only bring heartache and frustration. Write something to suit yourself, then sign up on websites that offer advice and feedback. Look on YouTube and find the regulars who you connect with, ask them questions, be faithful. I like Jenna Moreci, but there are so many others. So much more I could say, Fuad, but if you\u2019re a smart cookie (hey, I\u2019m not a dumb cookie myself) you\u2019ll reach out to all the grandeur of the Web and find the help you can use. Much good luck with this. If you want it to happen, it will. Promise. ",
