            "answer_text": "Not completely sure about this, and the historical record isn\u2019t complete anyway, but here is my attempt at an answer. First we must understand the Zoroaster was probably not located in modern Iran. Our best guess at where he was is based on a ring of settlements named in the scriptures, and some archaeologists have surmised it was in Afghanistan. Iranian languages were divided into two main branches in ancient times, eastern and western. They are actually quite different because they split off a very long time ago. Avestan is one of the many eastern Iranian languages which existed in Central Asia during that time. Around the Sassanid period howerver, all of those Eastern languages switched to Western Iranian. There are a few holdouts, such as the Pamiris who speak Shugni which an Eastern Iranian language, but for the most part the Western Iranian branch displaced the Eastern Iranian languages in Central Asia. It\u2019s not entirely clear how this happened. It appears to preceed outright conquest by the Sassanid empire, but some have speculated that they were turned into client governments. Others believe that as Western Persian language and civilization became more powerful, the elites of these societies began adopting their language and culture. Hard to say with any certainty without more archeological records. ",

            "answer_text": "Very short, but precise answer: Because Zoroaster was not Persian and did not live in the area where Old Persian was spoken, but far remote in the northeast (probably Afghan mountains), in an area where the language called \u201cAvestan\u201d was spoken. He naturally used his native language to compose his verses in. ",
