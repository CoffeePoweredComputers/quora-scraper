            "answer_text": "A story that ends in the same place it began is commonly called a circular or cyclical narrative. While literature during and after the Modernist period experimented heavily with nonlinear narrative, circular narrative appears in nearly every genre and in the mythologies of many cultures. Although the narrative\u2019s beginnings and ends mirror each other, as do the introduction and conclusion of an essay, the narrative almost never leaves characters or events unchanged. Circular narratives cycle through the story one event at a time to end back where the story originated. Rather than provide a clear conclusion tying together the remaining pieces of the story, a circular narrative will provide closure through a return to the opening material. For example, repeating lines found at the beginning of the piece, concluding in the same setting, and ending in the same moment that opened the tale are potential conclusions. Circular narratives often utilize flashback and dream sequences to create a sense of departure from and a return to the original structure. Circular narratives can also conclude with the same theme or subject matter that opened the piece. Poetry: Many poems have a similar first and last stanza. John Keats\u2019 ballad \u201cLa Belle Dame Sans Merci\u201d begins and ends with a question and answer that use nearly the same language. The circular structure here is temporal, beginning in the narrative present with a speaker asking a knight what happened to him, moving into the past with the knight\u2019s recollection, and returning to the present when the knight concludes his story. In a more complex example, the 14th-century poem \u201cSir Gawain and the Green Knight\u201d exemplifies the circular narrative\u2019s popularity in Arthurian mythology. At Christmas time, Sir Gawain embarks on a quest, and he journeys for a year before fulfilling his obligation and returning to the court at Christmas time. Prose: Novels are particularly fond of circular narratives. Lewis Carroll\u2019s \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d opens with Alice playing outside on a riverbank. When she falls down a rabbit hole, she embarks on a fantastic journey through Wonderland before her sister awakens her, recalling her to the riverbank. Books in C. S. Lewis\u2019 \u201cChronicles of Narnia\u201d series employ a similar journey into an alternate realm and back to the \u201creal world,\u201d as does much science fiction and fantasy. ",

The senior, who was seated at the table looked at him and said, \u201cYes.\u201d When the fresher student was entering the class, all of a sudden many pictures went through the eyes of senior which were like, how he and his other friends made the junior shirtless.how he pranked & leg-slipped that junior.how they asked him to approach a girl who was one of them and she slapped the junior publicly.how they harass the same junior in so many ways that he thought to dial the number 100, talk to his parents, but failed because he was beaten physically by a group of seniors when he tried to complain principal.Finally, he visualized a note falling from the building which read, \u201cRagging killed me.\u201d And just within a few minutes, the same junior guy jumped from the building after the note. There was blood all over the floor. The red color on the ground shocked the senior guy. He opened his eyes and found himself on the bed of the hostel. He was sweating. The dream was dark for him. He got up from the bed and his roomie asked him to get ready by saying, \u201cJuniors are going to join college from today. As usual, they have to select one junior to whom they can target for fun.\u201d The senior guy hesitated, but later he ignored the dream and his hesitation because he himself was ragged badly by his seniors and wanted his revenge to be equally evil. His roomie asked him to lead by going in classroom number 13 where they will send the selected victim. According to the plan, the senior guy walked in the room and got seated on the chair. He intentionally avoided seating on the table. No one entered the class for 20 minutes. He stood up and called his roomie. But, he cut his call. When he looked down, he found his shoestrings were not tied. Thus, he put his mobile and one leg on the bench and adjusted half seat on the table. The very next moment he heard a faint knocking on the door so he sat fully on the table and then he heard this voice, \u201cMay I come in sir?\u201d He looked towards the door and found the face of the same fresher student from the dream.Tiny beads of sweat appearing on his brow,he could only manage to answer, \u201cNo. NO.\u201d ",
