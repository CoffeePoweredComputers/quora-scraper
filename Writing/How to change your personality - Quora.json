            "answer_text": "What a sad question.  Unfortunately, science and empirical data shows us that most people cannot change their basic character past the bulk of of childhood.  Your basic sense of self (am I good or bad?  Lovable or unlovable?  Scared or safe?) is formed by age 2.  The basic set of behaviors you exhibit as a reflection of your core sense of self is set by the age of 9 or 10 (am I introverted or extroverted?  Am I a leader or follower?  Do I cry when I get hurt or bounce back quickly?).  And your full social personality is formed by 25 - this is why finding friends after college and graduate school is so difficult (and dating and marrying is so much ore difficult).  It's not just proximity - it's that you really are significantly more picky about who you will and won't tolerate in your environment, what behaviors are acceptable, how much you will bend to accommodate another's wishes and needs. I have no idea how old you are, or what your reasons are for wanting to change your personality.  I'm just letting you know how much of your life you've spent forming your personality to date.  It's a lot - that personality was hard-earned.  Please just take a minute and appreciate the personality you have.  You formed it for a reason - it was an appropriate set of responses to your environment and your ability to handle whatever chaos, threats, emotional stimulation, and physical and mental challenges you faced.  It got you through a lot.  And it is giving you SOMETHING in return.  You wouldn't do whatever it is you do, or have whatever aspect of your personality aspect you have (good or bad), if it didn't serve you or help you in some way.  Even if it doesn't help you any longer, it did at one time.  Or it is giving you something you don't realize. We can figure this out by figuring out looking at what personality makeup and changing personalities.  (Yes, I'm getting to your question...) At its heart, a personality is made up of a series of emotional reactions and behaviors.  When people seek to change personalities, they generally want to change the behaviors - they no longer want the outcome the behaviors generate.  But the behaviors are generally one of two things: an appropriate response to an emotional or physical stimulus, or a habit. So, after giving proper respect to the great thing that is your personality (because you're probably not doing that - you're letting other people define what things are acceptable or unacceptable, without having any understanding of you or what you've been through, and why those pieces of you formed), look carefully at the parts of your personality that are presenting outcomes that you find undesirable.  That's probably the issue, isn't it?  Not that your personality is wrong, but that you are getting some outcome that you don't want - you aren't finding the friends you want, or the relationship you want, or the career success, etc., and you've determined that the cause is your own behavior.  That's pretty brave and insightful - make certain it's true. Once you know exactly what's causing the outcome (say, for example, you're late all the time - and it's negatively impacting you at work), you need to find out what the cause is.  Is it a habit or a behavior caused by an emotional reaction?  A habit would be just that you are a habitual procrastinator, or you pack too many things into the last minute, or you don't have a \"timely mindset.\"  These things you need to change by changing your habit - inserting patterns of behavior that are more beneficial.  You make lists of things to do with timelines, and ruthlessly stick to them until it becomes a new habit.  Set timers everywhere to keep you on schedule, fool yourself by putting your clocks ahead so you forget that it's actually earlier than it is.  You train yourself into correct behavior - enlist a coach or outside help if necessary. An emotional reaction would be lateness due to your dislike of coming to work.  Are you actually bored, or you hate your job, or you fear success, or you are passive-aggressively trying to tank a group deal or a project for your boss?  You need to address the underlying emotional issue in order to fix the behavior - address your unpleasant emotions head on, and figure out a plan of action to get into a more pleasant line of work or with a more suitable boss. How can you tell if it's a habit or emotional reaction?  Generally, habits happen all the time, while emotional reactions happen selectively.  So if the behavior happens selectively, you know it's probably some underlying emotion.  (There are times when this isn't strictly true - you may have a selective habit.  But start with this idea.) Probe deeply, don't let anyone but people who truly have your best interests at heart have any say or interest in this (and that may or may not include family), and be kind to yourself.  Make sure you're only changing for yourself, and not for anyone else.  You're a better person than you think you are, and forgiving yourself for your flaws will help you forgive them in others.  This will bring more love and happiness in your life - which is the best medicine for everyone. Kind regards, Alexandra ",

            "answer_text": "You don't and you don't have to. Imagine if you went to the gym and saw someone saying, \"How do I upload my whole mind to a cyborg that's better than me?\" How would you react? My reaction would be, \"How lazy, self-loathing, and unnecessary. What a terrible, terrible attitude\". Virtually anyone, even people with serious disabilities, can go to the gym and get better. They can build strength or stamina in at least some of their muscle groups. They can be healthier and happier. Virtually anyone, even people with serious mental disabilities, can go to therapy or through self-improvement or through effective guidance by a good mentor or spiritual authority and get better. You can build your compassion. You can build your empathy. You can find your talents. You can develop your skills. You can figure out how you, the way you are right now, can contribute to a team. You can discover, and develop, your values. But just like when you go to the gym, you have to want it. You have to be willing to do the work. Some people responding here will insist that your personality is fixed. It is not. If our personalities were fixed, we would not have survived. Your personality, your values, and who you are will change massively over the course of your life, in response to developmental challenges. Who you are is heavily socially influenced. And what you learn can change what you believed were your biggest weaknesses, where your talents were the least, if you learn correctly: Scientists Find Learning Is Not 'Hard-Wired'. But your genes, your accumulated experiences, all the people who influenced you and loved you... even if you could toss that all in the dustbin, why would you? How colossally ungrateful and utterly self-destructive would that be? You have years of experience that made you who you are and informed what you believe.  So take advantage of it. Don't fight it. Work with it. Build on what you've got instead of destroying it. Don't have a preconception about how you should contribute based on your idle preferences: figure out how you can contribute, then develop those skills. You are like a person who inherited an old, beautiful house and who thinks she should demolish it. Cherish it. Rebuild it. Maintain it. Cherish you. Because if you can't do that, it won't matter if anyone else will. ",
