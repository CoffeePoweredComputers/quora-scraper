            "answer_text": "I would suggest: let\u2019s first focus on are you even inspired to write in the first place? I\u2019m guessing you are since you are saying how do I stop losing it, that means you have some inspiration there. So if you do, then focus on why you are inspired to write in the first place. Do you like writing? Do you enjoy it? Do you see any benefit in writing? If you don\u2019t write will you be wasting good writing skills or good writing experience? Will the world be missing out on what you write? Is writing a therapy for you? Does it make you feel at ease? If it doesn\u2019t maybe you don\u2019t have to force yourself. You can also focus on what exactly is making you lose inspiration for writing. Are you comparing your writing to others\u2019 writings? Is there a certain way of writing that makes you lose inspiration? For example maybe you try to write a story and it doesn\u2019t work for you, so you lose inspiration because it isn\u2019t working out, or you think that it isn\u2019t. What ever style of writing is not working out for you, stop that style for some time and focus on a different writing style. For example if short stories don\u2019t work then try to write 1 paragraphs that have good messages, or something else. ",
