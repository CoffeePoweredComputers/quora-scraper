            "answer_text": "Teachers vary in how much weight they assign to a particular attribute of an essay, so always check your notes, ask teachers to clarify assignments when necessary, and proofread each others' work. To get a passing grade, a student had to be able to write with few errors of spelling, grammar, and punctuation, write an essay appropriate to the assignment, and fulfill the basics of argumentation: make a claim, provide subclaims with evidence for each, and make a coherent conclusion. It goes without saying that anyone who plagiarized other people's writing would either be required to rewrite or would flunk the class, and the theft went on their academic record (sometimes they were allowed to stay after the first entry, sometimes they simply were told to leave the school). If I was teaching an introductory course, we always covered plagiarism first, since there are cultural differences in what counts as plagiarizing. But everyone should know that just buying a work from someone else (or stealing it) and passing it off as your own is completely unacceptable, before they ever come to the university. Sorry. Was just reading two requests for basically cheating in writing. At any rate, those are the bottom lines. To get a good or excellent grade in my class, the student had to go a bit above and beyond the basics: research more than the minimum, from respected sources, give good examples and illustrations to anything confusing, and so forth. Sometimes a paper was turned in several times for different grades, because I was teaching the writing process; then improvements and attention to comments were important for the evaluation. I hope this is clear. Basically, students had to do their own work, especially their own thinking, go more deeply than the surface when it was a popular debate topic. The smoothness of the writing, quality of the evidence, and the defensibility of the claim determined how high their evaluation. ",

            "answer_text": "The essay should have good grammar and show the right level of vocabulary. It should be organized, and the content should be appropriate and effective. Teachers also look at the overall effectiveness of the piece. When evaluating specific writing samples, you may also want to include other criteria for the essay based on material you have covered in class. You may choose to grade on the type of essay they have written and whether your students have followed the specific direction you gave. The most straightforward evaluation uses a four-point scale for each of the criteria. Taking the criteria one at a time, articulate what your expectations are for an A paper, a B paper and so on. Taking grammar as an example, an A paper would be free of most grammatical errors appropriate for the student\u2019s language learning level. A B paper would have some mistakes but use generally good grammar.  When grading a student essay with a rubric, it is best to read through the essay once before evaluating for grades. Then reading through the piece a second time, determine where on the scale the writing sample falls for each of the criteria. If the student shows excellent grammar, good organization and a good overall effect, he would score a total of ten points. ",
