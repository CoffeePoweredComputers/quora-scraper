            "answer_text": "Who cares what the hardball dialog/ue visual cues are? I appreciate it probably helps to keep action instruction brief. But depending on the professional or personal rapport a director and actor have ultimately the director has the last say in the performance of the scene. Depending on how closely the movie follows the novel ( if the screenplay was drafted on the back of one) then perhaps to accurately portray the scene as was intended or scribed, perhaps the best individual to navigate the scene would be the author of the original work. if the original author has signed away the book rights I guess house can do whatever they wish with it. But any studio worth their salt would at least keep the author in the loop\u2026 I think it also will depend on how loosely or tightly the directors vision is during the process. A director may wish to re-shoot a scene several times, and that may jar with box office draw types due to time and budgeting constraints. Chances are though box office draws won\u2019t be involved in those projects. But as a director, it is their instruction and vision that will see the production materialise. An actor is nothing more than a hired hand. There are very few jobs that provide the luxury and lucre that the movie industry does. Of course the producers and agents will want to thrash it out too. But if you were on my set, and I\u2019m directing, follow the script. That\u2019s why it\u2019s there! But actors, being actors will probably want to brand stamp their own interpretation. On stage productions that may fly to alleviate the repeat boredom of repeat performances, but in front of the camera you are employed to perform as instructed. You would anticipate that the director and actor(s) would have discussed the scene at length, what the directors expectation is, and of what is realistically achievable from the dialog/ue provided and how prompts and timing may make or break a specific scene to emphasise tension, humour or grounding, again, this would be ( or at least should be) worked out well in advance. I\u2019m sure most honest directors are not as militant and would be willing to listen to suggestion and recommendation - but ultimately it\u2019s their vision. If the actor is an investor and has financial influence over the production that may also steer the take in the actors favour. More so if the actor is also the screenplays director. That goes without saying. Maybe some actors believe they are above instruction in an advisory capacity as they are exempt from constructive criticism. You may call it artistic differences, but like any other hired hand, if you are not performing to requirements there are several other hopefuls waiting to take up the slack and at one tenth of the fee you expect. Let me refer you to my under study. Or a CGI algorithm and digitised voice over. \u2026and the beat goes on.  ",

            "answer_text": "There are several ways. You can write \u201cpause\u201d parenthetically in a dialogue block. Or you can write \u201cbeat\u201d parenthetically. Both of those terms are perfectly legitimate. However, for a spec writer, the \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cbeat\u201d is really an opportunity to characterize a character or a moment or both. I\u2019ll explain. Let\u2019s imagine someone talking on the phone. Periodically she stops talking to listen. You could write \u201cpauses\u201d or \u201cbeat\u201d parenthetically, or you can characterize her with something like this: \u201cnervously\u201d or \u201cstrokes her gun\u201d or \u201cpicks her nose\u201d or whatever. If you do that, you not only provide some characterization and create more interest for the reader of your script, but you imply the beat you want. Another way to show a pause in dialogue is with the ellipsis: \u201cWell\u2026 ah\u2026 I\u2019d like to come.\u201d Keep writing! ",
