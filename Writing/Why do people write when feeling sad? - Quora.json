            "answer_text": "On sunday 15th September 1833, a young man named Arthur Hallam, aged 22, died in his sleep. Autopsy revealed the cause of his death to be a stroke. In the first week of october the same year, a letter from the young man's Uncle was delivered to a close friend of his, Alfred which among other things stated \"At the desire of a most afflicted family, I write to you because they are unequal from the grief into which they have fallen to it themselves. Your friend, Sir, and my much-loved Nephew, Arthur Hallam, is no more \u2014 it has pleased God to remove him from this his first scene of Existence, to that better world for which he was Created.\" The news had a devastating effect on Alfred and his sister Emily (To whom Arthur had been engaged). It created a void in Alfred's heart, which he subsequently expressed in a literary work. This work titled \"In Memoriam\" is one of the longest and greatest poems in English History. Alfred Tennyson subsequently wrote other poems in memory of his friend Arthur Hallam. To answer your question, we humans express ourselves and our feelings in various forms. To some it is through the performing arts (dancing, singing, acting), to others it is through public speaking, others engage in sporting and other forms of body exercises, and we also have the most common form - Writing. Writing is primarily a mental exercise; a carthasis. We generally write to express our feelings, thoughts and ideas. And when we are sad, writing serves as a form of therapy. During sad and tragic moments, we feel the need to express our bottled feelings. Hence we do things like visiting therapists and shrinks, travelling, engaging in activities that take up our time and energies. The aim of doing all these, is to purge our negative emotions. Some persons have discovered that keeping diaries can be helpful. Writing also helps us in articulating our distorted thoughts. And as technology today increases the barriers in genuine human communication, keeping diaries, writing poems, articles and stories, give us a sense of connection with our world. Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "The more problems a person has, the more potential they have to write. The more misery there is, the more words can come onto the paper or screen. The deeper the person is in negativity and sorrow, the higher the quality of the writing becomes. Sadness is a resource that can be used for creation, and in turn, the creation can liberate the writer from their sadness, and boost their wellbeing therefore. The sadness is a damsel in distress; the pen or keyboard are the knight in shining armor, and the creation is the decisive battle against the armies of evil which keep the damsel locked. When the armies flee from the Fortress of Mentality, and the damsel is to be exposed to the Light of Wellbeing, she is to be converted from a distressed damsel into a beautiful and joyful princess. This is the importance and motivation for writing. When you wish to write but find less motivation, less inspiration and less content, know that you are not sad enough for writing, and wellbeing is the cause. It is good not to write a lot, you see, because it means that there is less burden sitting unwelcomely on your mind. The writing is the Expeller of Demons, the Destroyer of Darkness, the Guardian of the Flame of Life. The writer is merely a peon in the hands of their Inner Mojo. The less Demonism there is, the purer is the Mojo. The purer is the Mojo, the greater satisfaction is to follow. It is a good indication thus, that much satisfaction is to come from less writing. ",
