            "answer_text": "Yes. Bad idea. No matter what, you want to be likable in your personal statement for college applications. While the application process can be stressful, colleges want you to be excited about getting ready for the next phase of your life. This topic is negative and cynical, which are not the best attributes to highlight in your personal statement. Your essay topic needs to be a flattering one, and should shed light on your assets. The application process is certainly not a unique experience. Every single other applicant has experienced the same thing! Articulating the obvious will not help you stand out. Admissions officers work hard to ensure that this difficult process is as friendly and fair as possible. Telling them you hate it is vaguely insulting, even if they hate the same things. Colleges use the personal statement to get a sense of your character. It should capture how you see the world, not just how you see the narrow application process. The most important thing is that your personal statement is actually personal and filled with passion. Tell admissions officers a story that shows who you are. It can be hard to know where to start with the personal statement. With endless potential topics, what do you pick? There are some questions you should ask yourself before writing your personal statement. Getting a head start, brainstorming, and outlining your personal statement is key! And before you submit, be sure to read 30 of the worst personal statement topics. ",
