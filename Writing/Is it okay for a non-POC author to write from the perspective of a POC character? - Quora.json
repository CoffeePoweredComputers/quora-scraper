            "answer_text": "In the 1930s Pearl Buck wrote The Good Earth, and it has had a degree of popularity ever since. So far as I can remember, nobody questioned how a white occidental could write about a Chinese family. Paul Scott wrote The Jewel in the Crown trilogy and\u2014again\u2014no one that I know questioned whether this Englishman could write authentically about Indians. Less importantly generally and more important to me personally is The Sing, my novel in which a central character is a middle-aged Black woman. I have never been black or female. I was once middle-aged, but I got over it. At a book signing, I was challenged by an African-American college professor about my credentials for writing in a Black person\u2019s voice. I gave her the following passage to read and asked her to tell me if it was\u2014to her\u2014authentic. This is Sister Bessie talking to her employer, Stumpy Williams: \u201cI wish I could help you understand, Mr. Stumpy, but I don\u2019t think you could ever know what it\u2019s like to be colored. You\u2019re a good man, and you\u2019ve always treated me nice, but I don\u2019t think you can have any idea about how different where you live is from where we live. We know pretty good what it means to be white; we see that every day up close. In fact, we know what\u2019s going on in a lot of the white folk\u2019s houses because we wash your clothes and cook your meals and clean your houses. But when we leave in the evening, you don\u2019t know anything about what we go home to. It\u2019s real different.\u201d Stumpy made a weak gesture to the living room. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look all that different from our house, Bessie. It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s clean. It looks like a good home.\u201d She nodded. \u201cAll that\u2019s true, I suppose, and thank you for noticing I try to keep it clean. But you\u2019re looking at the wrong things. Like, did you ever wonder why, since I\u2019m fifteen years older than you are, I call you Mr. Stumpy and you call me Bessie?\u201d Stumpy shook his head. He had never wondered, and he didn\u2019t know what she was driving at. \u201cIt\u2019s a little thing, but it\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cMister and Misses are important words. Too important to give to colored people. If one of ours goes off to college and gets a degree or gets two or three degrees, he\u2019s still not a mister to the white folks. He can be professor. If a girl goes to school and becomes a nurse, she\u2019s not a Miss or Misses, but she\u2019s \u2018Nurse Somebody.\u2019\u201d She nodded her head toward Horace. My husband is a good man. He goes to work every day, and he pays his bills. He\u2019s a deacon in our church, and he\u2019s helped out a lot of people, colored and white, when they needed it. But he\u2019s still not Mister Williams to you or to any other white man. He\u2019s Horace, or if it\u2019s somebody like that Claymore Thomas, he\u2019s \u2018boy.\u2019 You see, words like \u2018mister\u2019 or \u2018misses\u2019 mean respect, and we\u2019ve learned that white people are real stingy with that.\u201d She agreed that, at least to her, it was authentic. Obviously I believe that, as you put it, non-POC writers can write about characters who are POC. ",
