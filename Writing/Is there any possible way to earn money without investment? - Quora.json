            "answer_text": "Put a small group of investors together. Your equal share contribution is running the group. I've been telling everyone that for about a year on Quora.Three days ago, on Friday, I decided I was going to do the same thing: start an investment group just so I could tell about my experiences and successes with an investment group. I haven't even had time to start the LLC, when I got a phone call from a friend that I had helped in the past. They were calling me looking for a place to invest. I just told them I was starting an investment group and going to be investing in more real estate. My first investor put in $700K as an initial investment. The investors get their money back on every deal, then the profits are split. Rather than make this just a two party deal and keep half of the profit for myself, I decided that I wanted to help someone else get wealthy too. I invited him to participate as an equal partner witha three way split. His contribution is finding deals to invest in with me. He doesn't put any money into the deals either and will receive 1/3 of the profits from the LLC. The investor will make a huge return over what a bank would have offered them, and each deal is 100% backed by real estate at below market values.That's one way that you can make money without an investment. You will have to put in time and talent as your contribution. Make sure you are completely honest and upfront about everything if you try this. If you're not an honest person, you will very likely go to prison if you attempt this. I have a friend that will be in prison for seventeen years, because he tried this and got greedy. He stole from his friends/investors. He destroyed several families, made it so that a number of people would literally never be able to retire, and financially devastated dozens of people. My goal is for everyone to make a very nice additional income without using much of the investor's money. I think we can safely add at least $250K a year to each of our incomes and have some great fun doing it. Before long, we should have a number of additional paid off income producing properties and have an LLC worth low eight-figures. I'm not a rocket scientist. If I can do this, you can too! I'm doing it to show you that it can be done and what the results can become. I don't care what your daddy told you\u2026 It doesn't take money to make money! ",

            "answer_text": "The key is a high Return on Investment (ROI). For example, imagine that there are two investments, Investment A and Investment B. Investment A has an ROI of 2%.Investment B has an ROI of 5%.I mean, big deal, right? Just 3%, not a big difference\u2026 Let\u2019s do a simulation, though. If we invest $100 into Investment A and $100 into Investment B and wait ten years, what will happen? After one year: Investment A: $102 Investment B: $105 Big deal, right? Just put it in the 2% investment (e.g. a money market account at a bank). It\u2019s not worth it to go to the trouble to invest in something high-yield for just $3! Oh, wait\u2026 After three years: Investment A: $106.12 Investment B: $115.76 Okay, now we\u2019re starting to see a bigger difference\u2026 What about 10 years? Investment A: $121.89 Investment B: $162.88 Whoa! Big difference! Investment B outperformed Investment A by $40.99! What about 30 years? Someone thinking about retirement, at the beginning or towards the middle of his career, might think about a time horizon like this. Investment A: $181.13 Investment B: $432.19 The difference is between twofold and threefold! The key is a high ROI. Which things give high ROI? Stocks: They have very high ROI, but also have very high volatility. That means that on average, their ROI is some of the best, but in any given year (or even several years), they can go *WAY DOWN*!Real estate: This is much safer. The ROI is also quite high, probably not as high as with stocks, but unlike stocks, a sudden drop in value one year (or two years, three years, etc.) is very rare.Japanese real estate has a high average ROI if you buy it in major urban areas (Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, etc.). Average ROI in the 23 Special Wards of Tokyo is 5.5%. In the outlying areas, it\u2019s 6.5%. In specialty properties such as Niseko ski resort, it\u2019s 7%. With Japanese real estate (which not only Japanese people, but also foreigners, including overseas investors, can buy), you can make ROI like the one above in Investment B, maybe even better.  \u2191An Urban Area in Japan Imagine that there are two people, Person A and Person B. Person A has $100,000 to start. He puts his money in a money market account in the US with 2% interest. Person B has only $50,0000 to start ( :- ( ). He invests in Japanese real estate, making a 5% net ROI (ROI after property manager fees, taxes, maintenance and repairs, etc.). After 30 years, how will they have done? Person A will have $181,136.15. Not bad! Person B will have $216,097.11. WOW!!! And that\u2019s how you can earn money with less investment and more profit. Person B did it. So can you! There you go.

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t need money to make money. What you need is something that can create capital. Example: hunters in the midwestern, and eastern United States, love to go hunting for pheasant (a type of wild bird, and considered a delicacy by some.) they load up their dogs and get their permits then head out to the open fields and hunt. So one enterprising you man that I knew. Lived on a rural farm in Kansas would set up a place in his barn where he raised pheasants and he would let, (with the permission of his father) hunters come to the farm and hunt for pheasants. They always got lots of pheasants. That is because he would turn loose some birds in the fields the same day the hunters came for the weekend to hunt. His land always has pheasants, and developed a good reputation. He began to provide lodging and a great steak meal for the hunters. Hunters would book a year in advance to stay at his place and he collected a little non refundable deposit. So a teenager on a remote farm in the middle of nowhere Kansas where there were no jobs anyway, started a home business that paid totally for his college education before he ever even graduated from high school. He went on to be an auctioneer and made a small fortune. So take inventory of everything that is around, because anything could be a potential resource for a business. Use your imagination and become a capital creator not a worker. Pheasants are capital. By creating a positive environment for pheasants to thrive he could stand back and let them do their thing, (grow and make more pheasants.) Now his job was to just convert the capital into cash. He could sell the eggs the birds laid. He could let hunters hunt them for a fee. He could sell the feathers. He could sell the live birds to other growers, or restaurants. Capital can be anything. The principal is to start a business, not find a job. Create an environment where capital can be produced, with little to no work on your part. Like in the case of the birds. While he was in school or sleeping those birds were growing and making more birds. (they want to live, and really don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help to do it, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you couldn\u2019t make it easy for them. So the more you help them by creating a great environment the better for everyone.) You could raise earth worms. You could do yard work in your neighborhood. Raking up tree leaves and hauling them away. You get paid to do the work and then charge a little fee to haul away the debris, by adding that this will be eco friendly and won\u2019t fill up the home owners trash cans when your done. Turn it into a by-weekly service till fall is over. The leaves you take home and pile into worm beds, or plastic bags. The worms get great foods a safe environment from birds and they double in population every 30 to 45 days. The worms make excellent soil to grow plants and they make an incredible natural plant fertilizer. The next spring you grow tomatoes in the soil that you made from the leaves you got to rake. The waste product from one business becomes an input for a new business. You can sell earth worms. Earth worm tea, and now organic tomatoes to all your neighbors. Doesn\u2019t matter how old you are. Putting money in your pocket is putting money in your pocket. No having to wear a polyester shirt and pants and work at Macdonald\u2019s to get a few dollars. You have the potential to will make more money working for yourself than you ever will working for someone else. The world is full of opportunities. The whole point of an education is to learn to recognize them when you see one. Cheers young one, I wish you success. ",

            "answer_text": " Would not it be great if you can make money without working?The surefire way to make a fortune in this way remains to be invented. However,by applying certain techniques, you can improve your income by providing virtually no effort. It is also possible to make investments or work to get rich. However, be aware that you'll have better luck if you choose a job outside the box. Earn Money without Working 1) Inherit. If you have an old and rich relative, you are likely to inherit. Just wait for the opening day of his will. Of course, if your parent loves you, he will be inclined to leave you something. So, try to stay on good terms with your elderly parents. Of course, it is extremely suspicious and painful to treat older people with respect and love only to get their money later. 2) Win the Lottery.Generally, a lottery ticket costs only a few euros. These tickets are available in most grocery stores and convenience stores. This is an economical and easy way to earn money. However, your chances of winning the jackpot will be trivial compared to losing your bet. Always expect to lose money buying a lottery ticket. It is true that to win the lottery, you must first buy at least one ticket. However,be realistic because you cannot rely on this method to meet your needs. In other words, you have one chance in 13,983,816 of winning the \"Lottery\"if you are in the United States, the ratio is 1/200 000 000 to win the\"Power ball Jackpot.\"  Enter a Competition.As the lottery, contest or a contest can totally change your life in the space of an evening. You do not have many chances to win, but it can happen. Indeed,if you participate often, you will have more favorable opportunities to earn money and other prices.  Compared to the lottery, contest offers participants the advantage of being free. Make an online search, including social media to discover lotteries and competitions in which you can participate for free. You can also find assistance by paying attention to advertising in stores.Moreover, for most of the contest, you will not need to purchase to register. If you take it seriously, try to subscribe to a specialized periodical publication. Thus, you save time by being regularly informed about the contests scheduled at the local or national level.However, beware of false competition and be careful to avoid scams. To receive earnings obtained in an honest contest, you will never be obliged to pay a fee or provide a credit card number. Listen carefully to the personal information you provide in registering for these competitions.",

            "answer_text": "How Can I Earn Money Without Investing Money?  It\u2019s possible, but difficult. Anyone who is selling you anything else is simply trying to take your money without earning it. I\u2019ve outlined five principles that you\u2019ll need to know to succeed. If you walk away with a deep understanding of the first one, you\u2019ll already be years ahead of the \u201chow to make money online\u201d scammers you\u2019ll find everywhere else. 1. You can only earn money from your TIME or your ASSETS If you work a job, you are earning money from the time you contribute, the time it took for you to learn the job skills, and the assets (knowledge) inside of your head. If you rent out a house, you are earning money from your assets. If you freelance, you are earning money from your time. If you drive for Uber or Lyft, you are using your time and assets. See the trend? You need to provide value to someone else with your time or assets if you want to earn money. Read that again. Let it sink in. Then read it again. That\u2019s how you earn money. 2. If you can\u2019t invest money, you will need to invest time Every month, I pay freelancers to do web scraping and data entry. They offer their time. They don\u2019t invest any money, and they get paid. I\u2019m doing this because it saves me time. Time that I can leverage to earn more than I\u2019m paying them because of my knowledge and skills. You need to choose if you\u2019d like to trade your time for money, or if you have any assets that you can rent out for money. 3. Figure out what your talents and skills Are you a great writer? You can earn a six-figure salary freelance writing. You can do it as a side-hustle. You can do it full-time. You can do it from anywhere in the world. You can start freelance writing without any monetary investment, and it\u2019s one of the best freelance careers available. Are you a great designer? Perhaps you can freelance graphic design. Even better, you can use software like Webflow, Wordpress, or Wix to build websites. Companies need logos and brand kits. But they pay immensely for web design and development. Do you have a spare bedroom? An underused car? Can you rent out either? Can you drive for Uber or Lyft? Have you offered tutoring or coaching services for sports, academics, or music? Do you have unique experiences that others would pay to learn from as a consultant? Make a list of your talents and skills, and put a star next to the ones that other people would pay to have. 4. Sell your extra things Most of us have unused clothes, old electronics, or random luxuries we rarely use. Sell them. The monetary investment has already been made \u2013 just make the listings on eBay or Craigslist and sell them. This is probably the fastest, most reliable, and easiest way to make money from your assets. 5. Iterate and Improve You\u2019ve sold your items that you don\u2019t care for. You\u2019ve placed ads and rented out any assets possible for cash flow. You\u2019re starting to look into services you can offer that people are willing to pay for. What\u2019s next? Iterate and improve. Maybe you haven\u2019t found the service you\u2019d like to offer. Maybe you have, but you haven\u2019t been able to successfully market your services. Maybe you can bake the best muffins in the world, but you simply need to reach out to more local coffee shops. Figure out what you need to do to succeed. Find people who have succeed before you and follow their footsteps. Reach out to them for help. P.S. Upvote if you liked this answer and you\u2019d like to see more like it! If this receives enough Upvotes, I\u2019ll continue to update it with more information and new ideas over time! ",

            "answer_text": "NO MONEY DOES NOT STOP YOU\u2026 Most of the time when I ask people what their challenges are, they come back and tell me it is a lack of money, a lack of finance, a lack of the green stuff that makes the world go round\u2026 And I listen to them and depending on what stage we are in our relationship because some people just do not want to hear the truth, I tell them that money has absolutely nothing to do with whether they succeed in business or not. After all, which successful entrepreneur started any business with a lot of their own money?! HARDLY ANYONE! In fact, one of the big reasons they started out in business was to create wealth for themselves and their family\u2026 Yes, I know you are not in it just for the money, but you do want money, right? So, own that now and stop beating around the bush about it\u2026 So, you are now telling me that money is the result you want and money is also the path to the result? Well, you are kinda screwed then\u2026 Because if according to you, it is money that is preventing you from getting money, then you are stuck. And you will remain stuck until you realise that money has nothing to do with whether you make your business a success or not\u2026 The truth is, you could go apply for a credit card (unless you are in some third world country somewhere or maybe your credit is bad but I have to say, I went bankrupt and still I was able to get access to this type of money) and get some money that way\u2026 Yes, I know that makes you uncomfortable and why? Because deep inside, you are scared of racking up debt when you do not know if your business idea is going to work\u2026 And that is definitely a sensible way of thinking about it but it is also the crux of your problem\u2026 If you do not believe your business idea is going to work, you will not give it all the energy of THOUGHT and ACTION that you need to give it, in order for it to work. So, your problem as you can hopefully begin to see is more than a lack of finance, it is a lack of belief in yourself and your ability to succeed and so because you, deep down, don\u2019t believe in you or your ideas, you will not use the vast and powerful resourcefulness, that GOD himself has gifted you with, to create wealth in your business. And instead of you admitting the truth of that to yourself\u2026 You will blame a lack of money as the reason that you fail or never even began\u2026 PLEASE, honey, tell someone else that particular story because I am not buying it! If you want something, you always find a way to get it. You do, honey, you really do! You are a lot more powerful than you give yourself credit for\u2026 And you are just blocking your own brain up and setting yourself up for failure when you tell me or anyone and worst of all, yourself, that it is a lack of money that stops you. It gives you permission not to think of another way forward\u2026 It gives you permission to remain stuck in place\u2026 It gives you permission not to try\u2026 And so, honey, you get what you want\u2026 You fail! And then you can go back to your old, comfortable life and tell yourself that you tried. WHAT UTTER NONSENSE! Lots of people have built business without any of their own money, they just had a huge amount of belief and if they really did need money (A lot of businesses really do not need any huge amounts of capital)\u2026 IF they did need money, then their huge amounts of belief would enable them to find a sponsor who sees the validity and potential of their ideas and who then bankrolls them. But it all starts with you believing in yourself and your idea enough to make it work. Money is NO obstacle. If anything, too much money at the start, stifles creativity. And it is your creativity that will make your business succeed. Go on\u2026 Write out TEN ways you can use today to get your message out without spending any money whatsoever. And then go do it. Yes, I know it will be hard for you to think like this because you have forgotten how to think hard for what you want\u2026 And yet, understand that the more you do this kind of thinking, the easier it becomes, the more creative you become, the more innovative your ideas become and the quicker you succeed in making money. As long as you then go implement the ideas\u2026 And this works wherever you live, third world country or not. You need to get into the habit of thinking there is always a way and you also need to realise the only challenge you actually have, is YOU! And getting over your reasons and excuses for not doing what it takes to win. THE SHORT ANSWER: GET CREATIVE! ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s the $ 1,000,000 question, no? I DON\u2019T KNOW and I DO KNOW. I\u2019ve been a banker for some 10 yrs (I still am, but not the kind of banker people often get to see - a phantom banker: I work on a special department for large loans, meaning that I can go to work in jeans, wearing sneakers, black metal t-shirts as I only see 1 or 2 customers per week ; for those cases I have a suit that\u2019s hidden in the infirmary room. What I think is that we\u2019re heading for a serious number of people who\u2019ll soon be the victims of all the new methods you see occurring online. It\u2019s not a regulated market yet and there\u2019s a lot of cowboys out there, who are not interested in your finances, but in their own. Always when new ways of paying appear, as they do now, clever thieves will find a way to detect the holes, the backdoors, tricks and the traps to funnel your gains to their accounts in St. Kitts And Nevis. I saw you got some 7 answers: read them and ask yourself what the only motivation of people OFFERING you ways of getting rich can be. Identically the same as the banks\u2019 motives. I know banks inside out and the last worry on their minds is offering you the best investment plans. Moreover, I\u2019m sure you need a couple of skills I suppose you don\u2019t have (I definitely haven\u2019t got them). You should know about hacking, avoid several security levels, know the nitty-gritty about hardware; you should have a system in place that automatically in nanoseconds sends the money that comes in five times around Planet Earth. I used to know how to do that (as before the loans, I was the kind of guy to go to when you had too much black money and you wanted to launder it. However, the software, our special intranet (I work in one of the most profitable and prestigious banks of the world - they sponsor Formula One races) the opportunities, the regulations have changed completely the last few years. I hated that job, as my clients, being VERY wealthy people, getting wealthier all the time, NEVER were satisfied and complained about it in front of ME, who got a mediocre paycheck, never had had serious amounts on my account and at the end of the year got a bonus of - fasten seatbelts - \u20ac 200,00 = TWO HUNDRED. And even if I had worked out a very profitable investment plan (with a net gain of 70%/year, untaxed), NEVER I got a tip, NEVER a \u2018thank you\u2019 or a pat on the back. On the contrary, they took their profit and brought it to a small specialized investment bank, of which their friends had told them they had a 77% gain. And who was to blame for that? Me! It got so far that I got inside information on a textile manufacturer (a real money machine) who would go to the stock market. The reason was to give the founding brothers the chance to \u2018cash in\u2019 on their OWN stocks (85% of the available stocks). What happens in such cases: the day the stocks are for sale: people see that the price rises like a rocket in the morning. They buy, even if the price is already waaaaaaay too high, they stubbornly believe trees will keep growing into heaven. Then, the 3 bros sell, fill their pockets and the price crashes. All this in 50 minutes. The other buyers have paid \u20ac 40 for stocks that suddenly have a value of \u20ac 2,50 and never recover. Of course not: the difference of 40 and 2,50 (37,50) is and will stay in the pockets of the brothers. If I steal a jeans that costs \u20ac 37,50, I\u2019m in serious trouble. Those guys get interviewed on TV and introduced as smart businessmen. I\u2019ll tell you something: if you don\u2019t know enough of the hidden dangers of e.g. e-commerce or plastic money systems, don\u2019t do it. You\u2019ll burn your ass. It\u2019s a good thing to know your weaknesses and your strengths. Don\u2019t waste your time on getting rid of your weaknesses, invest it in your strengths. I know it\u2019s frustrating to see rich guys getting richer, becoming Partners etc. But, why don\u2019t you keep it simple. A Harvard Master\u2019s degree or pH D is great, but your life will be stressfull, you\u2019ll have to fight with colleagues, stealing their ideas, taking care they don\u2019t steal yours. At 50 they can fire you; no: every day they can give you the sack. Harvard or not. It takes 6 months to become a skilled plumber. Work hard the first few years, save what you can and as soon as you can start a business on your own. You\u2019ll need tools (the big ones can be rented, the smaller ones don\u2019t cost a fortune) , you\u2019ll need a humble \u2018office\u2019, a phone, pc, printer and a van (second-hand). BE SMART and paint the van yellow or fluo-green. Put your ads between the small ads in local papers, also in green or yellow. Print on the van: \u201cCALL WAYNE 123-xxxxyyyy AND AWAY GO TROUBLES DOWN THE DRAIN\u201d. Make sure you don\u2019t have to do the work yourself too long, hire others to do it. Your job is marketing, making offers, finances. The nice thing about plumbing is that you don\u2019t just sell your working hours, but also bathrooms, furniture, heating devices, boilers, toilets, accessories (on which you make a hell of a profit). I have a cousin who worked with his dad until he was 38. He was poorly paid. When he was 42, he drove 2 BMWs X5, 2 large mercedes vans, he had bought land and a few horses for his daughter, he had his own shop AND he had the advantage to live in Belgium\u2019s Beverly Hills, where people have appartments (yes, no mansions) costing up to \u20ac 1000,000,000, mansions with survival basements in case of nuclear attacks, where maybe 50% of the residents have a decent source of income (the others are drug lords, weapon traders with dangerous customers, pimps, people who never have had the necessity to work, gangsters who have served their time - in Belgium you can get out in 2 years for 10 years of producing methamphetamine or illegal hormones, given to livestock). I\u2019m sure if you choose a job that ALWAYS will be necessary, you can get rich. You won\u2019t be interviewed, but you\u2019ll lead a good, comfortable life. My answer can be the opposite of what you had hoped (it\u2019s not a prestigious job, no suit and tie required), but it\u2019s worth thinking about. I have an PH.D in Economics. I was the first of my final year at university: \u2018laureate\u2019 even. But, I had no money. What could I do with my fancy grades? I\u2019ll tell you: write 100 letters for jobs, mainly as salesman (I had opted for \u2018Marketing\u2019). If only I could turn back time\u2026 SUCCESS Curious what you think. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Money will almost never be earned without some form of investment, however.  You can invest your time and energy.This is what Benjamin Franklin meant when he said that time is money. In order to earn money via an investment of our time, we have to trade a finite piece of our lives in exchange for it. While some people prefer product-oriented companies and startups, you yourself can trade your labor in order to provide a service\u2014applying for a retail job, mowing lawns for people who already have yard equipment, or using whatever device you\u2019re reading this on to edit pictures, develop apps, or build websites. You can invest resources that you already have.My first $100 was earned from a Minecraft server I made in middle school. I used my parents\u2019 horribly slow, lagging computer in their utility room to run it for free. This did require a \u201cresource,\u201d and likely added on to the utility bill, obviously, but I didn\u2019t need anything more than most people who are reading this already have access to. If you\u2019re absolutely hell-bent on starting out without investing a penny, you may need to harness your inner resourcefulness. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes ofcourse as long as you are committed. I will show few ways on how to make money and also if you are interested I can show you a method that I found has free training to make $700 to $2000 daily. Just email me at affiliatemarketingh20 @gmail.com But other ways you can make money without investment include: Answer surveysSurveys are one of the earning opportunities on the Internet that I only recommend to a limited extent. There is now the possibility of earning a few euros per survey answer, but of course that is not really lucrative or permanent. Nevertheless, you can find a lot of platforms online that offer exactly that. For example, on swagbucks.com there are many survey offers where you earn Swagbucks, which you can then exchange for vouchers. Often, however, there are also bonuses that you get in return, but these are also worth money, for example at meinungsstudie.de . If you really only want to earn a few euros every now and then, paid surveys are worth a look. Affiliate MarketingProper affiliate marketing can of course also be done on the side. You don't even need your own website for that. You can now use almost all partner programs on third-party platforms such as Facebook or YouTube . If you are already very active there and publish content, then you can earn something with additional affiliate links. Of course, one should also be careful not to overdo it and only use thematically appropriate affiliate links. Current offers have proven their worth in the past, because who is not happy when they can save something. Depending on the reach of your own profile, you can even earn a lot of money in this way, but mostly it is still a small side income. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some options: Get a jobIts been stated on previous answer, as simple as that. If you have some degree of education or valuable skill, try to offer them to people/companies. If you dont, then try some job that require no specific skill/knowledge, like office boys, janitors, cashier, or temporary job at constuctions. There are many of them. Free lancer is also an option. 2. Create a blog Assuming that you can reach quora, you have enough resources to use the internet. You can make money from that without the need of additional capital (other than internet access). Just do some research on things that you are interested, invest some time learning how to write interesting articles, then post it in your blogs. Put some ads on it (you need to learn it too) and voila, some money come to your bank account. 3. Make interesting videos Quite similar to 2, but now you need to record instead of just read and write. Maybe you need some capital for this if you dont have the appropriate equipment. This one needs some courages too I think. 4. Endorse a product This one is related to 2 and 3. After you get some popularity doing articles or videos, pick a product and speak about it. The point is to sell the product without actually being the salesman. More like a kind of ads, except you are the one doing it instead the company. 5. Sell your articles Instead of posting articles to your own blogs, you can make money by selling article to popular sites. There are many who are willingly pay your writings, but usually they come with reqs and specs. Choose the one you find feasible. 6. Clicking ads Maybe you have already know this, but if you haven\u2019t then yes, merely clicking ads got you paid some cents. I think this one is kind of not worth it compared to previous options, but its better than nothing. You dont need to think at all, just clicking, wait some seconds, and proceed to next ads. There surely are many more choices, the world is so big after all. Have a nice day. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you new to private label rights, Internet Marketing or are you unsure of what to do, or where and how to begin with any of wide options available? You've probably heard of Internet Marketers making lots of money online, but you don't have the talent to write and create information products or make crafts. You're not a programmer so you don't know how to develop killer application software. You can't get into wholesale and reselling designer shoes, handbags and other fashion items because you don't have a whole lot of money to invest. Believe it or not, you're perfect for affiliate marketing!  You can make money of off other people's products or services by becoming an affiliate marketer. You may not have your own product or service, but there are others out there who do exceptionally well and they're willing to give you commissions in exchange for promoting their materials. Many companies and small business owners use affiliate marketing to sell their products for them. They provide graphics and text advertisements that affiliates can use for promoting their products or services. You can also get private label rights and PLR content. These are the simplest and fastest way to stamp your name and market information without being an actual writer or a published author! The services are all over the Internet, but caution with the high fees. Going back to the affiliate option, as an affiliate, you will have your own unique code or link that serves to identify you as the affiliate who made the sale of a specific affiliate marketing product. Most affiliates today are called \"publishers\" because many of them have their own sites or blogs where they are promoting other people's products. As a publisher, you can choose from the thousands of affiliate programs available and you can even devote an entire site or blog towards \"pre-selling\" specific products. When someone who visits your site or blog clicks on your affiliate link and buys from the merchant you're an affiliate with a new commission. You get paid your commissions based on the terms set by the merchant. How much money you'll make as an affiliate depends on the commissions offered by the different merchants. For instance, someone selling a $50 e-book may offer 75% commission for every sale. Diamond merchants generally offer between 8% and 12% commission on the sale price, so you can make a handsome amount on a $5,000 diamond ring or a $10,000 bracelet. Then there are merchants such as mortgage brokers and credit card companies that will pay you a fixed sum for referring qualified contacts or leads. There are also companies that offer continuing commissions if customers purchase membership with recurring billing (and remain a member) from your affiliate link. Some affiliate programs have unusual terms and conditions. For instance, there are merchants who are willing to pay commissions of up to 200% of the sale price of the product. There are others that offer tiered commission structures wherein you also make a commission from sales brought in by a person who signs up as an affiliate via your affiliate link. Some companies offer tiers that are four or five levels deep. In resume, start as an affiliate marketer advertising other people products or go the simplest and easy way with your own pen name by using private label rights and PLR content if you don't have that mile budget, upload the site to the Internet and your kiss your competition goodbye by being persistent and constantly searching for more traffic opportunities! Bonus: Click here to register your free account here to get PLR products that you can resell and keep 100% of all the profits. I wish you good luck and much success! ",

            "answer_text": "There are 100s of way to make money without investment. I am assuming that investment means you are referring to financial investment. Let\u2019s put it on other way round, you don\u2019t want to make financial investment but you want to make money. Well, whether you do the job or business you are exchanging your time with money. So, I will consider spending time also as an investment. Let\u2019s get straight into the ways of making money without investment, then you will come up with many ideas but I will try to restrict it in 5 ways. Surveys: You don\u2019t spend money to participate on surveys. Such as 20Cogs, Swagbucks, Vivatic and YouGov etc. If you are passionate about answering the questions then it would be easy earnings for you. I will highly recommend to start from surveys so that you can definitely make your first dollar Online. I have personally tried all of these surveys I have mentioned above and I highly recommend 20Cogs. Dropshipping: This could be your game changer for your life. You are not going to make huge investment to start your very own online business. You can start from less than \u00a350 if you know how to drive traffic from social media to your online store. I will explain this free traffic generation method in future post. You can sell any products without having any physical inventory or staffs. I got full details on this article about DropShipping. Freelancing: You can signup in freelancing sites and offer your service. These programs are free to join. I would highly recommend to join Fiverr or Upwork. They are the leading freelancing site and you can make your living by offering your services. Some people are making 5 figure income from just doing freelancing. There is an article about six best methods to earn money online, you can read it here ",

            "answer_text": "Talking in the world of finance, it\u2019s not possible. TL;DR : No-Arbitrage Principle  Let\u2019s say that dealer A in New York offers to buy British pounds at the rate of $1.60 per pound. And let\u2019s say dealer B in London offers to sell them at the rate of $1.58 per pound. That\u2019s a golden opportunity, isn\u2019t it? You can cash out $0.02 on each transaction. This is called as an Arbitrage opportunity.  A lot of time arbitrage opportunities are not directly in sight. Now, let\u2019s say that dealer A in New York offers to buy British pounds at the rate of $1.58 (previously it was $1.60); and dealer B in London would sell it as $1.60 (which was $1.58 in previous example). So, there is definitely no profit for you in this right? But, let\u2019s say that dollars can be borrowed at the annual rate of 4% and British Pounds can be invested in bank at 7%. Voila! There\u2019s an arbitrage opportunity! You can make some money out of this!  Here\u2019s a thing about arbitrages though. Amount of transactions required are too large, (which makes it out of reach from smaller investors) and profits are low. Besides that, transaction and operating fees decreases the profit further. Also, when somebody sees that Mr.X is making a lot of money out of arbitrage, they\u2019ll start playing the same game. And eventually, the opportunity disappears when dealers in New York and London resettles the prices.  No-Arbitrage Principle: There is no admissible portfolio with initial value of zero such that final value being more than one with a non-zero probability. In simple words, no investor can lock in profits without risk and with no initial endowment. ",

            "answer_text": "Well there are many ways to earn money without much investment, say students. Let me try to cover a few of them for you: Part-Time Job: You can look to do a part-time job if you are comfortable doing that. You do not need to make any investment and end up with some pocket-money.Tuitions: If you are good at studies, what better than to share your knowledge with people and earn for it? Tuitions may not only be restricted to studies, they can be for any thing that you excel in. Like becoming a coach of a sport, teaching how to play musical instrument etc. Just ensure you are an expert or really good at what you are teaching.Internship: If you are into a professional course like CA or other management courses like MBA, turn your vacations into an internship. Learn & earn at the same time.Summer Sale: Looks like a funky idea but there are a lot of items that you end up never using. So start a summer sale, sell it off for a price that you set and earn your vacation funds.Blogging: If you are good at writing and expressing yourself, start immediately. You may soon end up with a significant earning through your writings.Affiliate MarketingSocial Media: If you are good at youtubing or other social media mediums, you can earn a lot from various ads. You will need to make an effort to make you content popular and then there is no looking back.Clicks or Data entry earnings: There are websites that you pay you for clicks, data entry etc.While there are many options to make money without investment, it will take time to scale them. Also, the best option is the one that coincides with what you love doing, because that is the only one that will be long-lasting. Hope you enjoy your work and earn loads of money from your passion :-) Regards, Rahul Jain Follow me on Quora for more feeds on Investments. ",

            "answer_text": "To make money, you essentially need to invest time and money. If you don\u2019t have time, you need to spend money to buy services from others. If you don\u2019t have money, you need to commit time and effort to learning new things, trying out new ideas, and ruthlessly implementing your chosen strategy and plan. Time and money are two trade-offs that you must balance and manage in order to earn money. I have complied a comprehensive list of money making ideas to get your creative juices flowing.  Without any money or investment to start off with when trying to earn money, there are a number of limitations that you must know. Lets take a making money online example to illustrate the point that you really need to make an investment to earn money. Given that you don\u2019t own or control any platform or website, you must use existing FREE platforms and systems like WordPress.com: Create a free website or blog, eBay, Amazon, Fiverr, etc. The good thing about these established platforms is that you have lots of willing buyers already searching for products and services to buy within the platform itself. You don\u2019t need to drive Internet traffic to the website. The downside is that information about and pricing of your products and services will be transparent for everyone to see and challenge. Price and product comparisons are made so easy with their comparison functions. This will attract copycats who will be your competitors, thus reducing your profit margins. Some may even sabotage your sales by buying up your entire inventory during a holiday sales season and returning them after. With the Internet, the entry barriers are so low that anyone without money can try to make money online. With that, comes increased competition. The marketplace has become so crowded and competitive that you need to create your own unique voice in order to make decent amounts of money, Another downside is that all these existing platforms use some kind of customer voting systems. You are subjected to the games people play with satisfaction ranking scores. You may even be adversely impacted if there are non-genuine negative feedbacks. Customers these days are so difficult to please that you must manage customer expectations. . Be aware that while these platforms are \u2018free\u2019, you are limited and controlled by their terms of use and operational fancies. You are also subjected to their indiscriminate policy changes. The bottom line is that you are at their mercy! I had my free account terminated by an established platform provider because I violated their \u201cpolicy\u201d as determined by their automated screening process! They generally use keywords to track your activities. If you unintentionally use one or more of these prohibited keywords on their platform, their system algorithms will immediately assume that you intentionally violated their terms of use. Your account will be immediately terminated or suspended. The beauty part is that you are presumed guilty without any likelihood of an appeal. . Here\u2019s the key problem. If your entire business model and income source are totally reliant or dependent on this one FREE platform, then your income will immediately disappear or be wiped out overnight if you unintentionally violated their policies. That\u2019s why it is advisable for you to spend a bit of money to get your own website or platform up and running as quickly as possible when you have made some profits so that you have total control over it without the need to look at over your shoulders. . From a paid advertising perspective, you may need to set aside some initial advertising dollars to promote and sell your products on platforms like Facebook. Depending on what you do online, you may require some paid advertisements to get you started. Once you have generated sufficient online income from your products or services, you can reinvest some of your initial profits back into your business.  While you can start making money online without spending any money, once you have generated some income for yourself, you must immediately spend money to build your own platform so that you can have total control over your business and income streams. . Here are a couple of potential strategies you can adopt when starting out making money online without any money. If you like selling things online, then you could find some hot-selling products to sell from direct wholesale sites like AliExpress, advertise these products on eBay or Amazon at a higher price, collect money from your customer when a product is purchased, place your order on AliExpress for the product to be shipped directly to your customer without any physical handling by you, pay AliExpress for the product you bought on behalf of your customer, and keep the profit for yourself. This is an arbitraged or drop-ship strategy. You could also sell other people\u2019s products or services as an affiliate. You can email your unique affiliate ID to your friends or advertise this unique affiliate ID on your own webpage created on free blogging sites like WordPress.com: Create a free website or blog, on your Facebook timeline, or on your Pinterest board. You could also do guest postings or write on Quora to promote thus unique ID. This is the affiliate marketing strategy. If you have your own services that people are willing and able to pay for, then you could use established platforms like Fiverr or UpWork to sell your services. You may have skills and experience that sells. To be successful in the long run for making money online, you need to establish a list of your own customers to up-sell products and services to them at a later date. Having free platforms may not allow you to capture your own customer\u2019s email addresses for further upsells. As you do not have control over these free popular online platforms to make money from, you are totally subjected to the unpredictable application of their constantly changing terms of use. This could totally wipe out your only source of income instantly. . There are so many no-money or no-investment strategies that you can employ to earn money. In reality, you really need to make some commitment by investing money into your business, whether you like it or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks to the wonders of the internet, it\u2019s completely possible to bring in a steady side income from the comfort of your own home. If you want to know how to make money online, consider these possibilities: Open an Etsy store. If you have a creative talent or skill \u2013 whether it\u2019s creating art, sewing clothes, or making keepsakes \u2013 you can open an online store on Etsy and sell your wares for some quick cash. With your own Etsy store, you\u2019re left in charge of pricing and, ultimately, how much you make. Complete surveys online. Sites like Swagbucks and MyPoints pay people to share their opinions on products or services, test mobile apps, or participate in market research. While the payday for these sites is modest, participating frequently can help you earn extra money in a short amount of time. Get paid to search the Web. Zoombucks will pay you to use their online interface to search the web. To qualify, you need to be willing to download their search bar and use it for everyday Internet use. The only caveat that comes with this \u201cgig\u201d is that you might be paid in gift cards instead of cash. If you can parlay those gift cards into items you need to buy anyway \u2013 like groceries or gas \u2013 searching online can be a lucrative way to spend your free time. Evaluate search engines. Search engine evaluators use commonly-accessed search engines in order to seek out bugs or errors. You may not earn a lot, but you can do this job in your spare time and from the comfort of your own home. To find gigs, check sites like Leapforce, Lionbridge, and Appen Butler Hill. Start a blog. If you love writing and are passionate about a specific topic, starting a blog is a great way to launch a low-cost side business with little money out-of-pocket. All you need to get started is a domain name, some basic online support, and a head full of ideas to share. Write and publish an eBook. You don\u2019t need a traditional publisher and financial backing to publish your own book anymore. In fact, Amazon makes it possible for you to publish your own eBook and sell it independently \u2013 with no financial investment on your part. And with Kindle eBook publishing, your book will appear on Kindle stores worldwide within 24-48 hours. Just be prepared to market it yourself on social media, your blog, or elsewhere if you expect to generate sales. Become a freelance writer or editor. If you have a passion for storytelling or a background in writing or editing, it\u2019s possible to find freelance writing or editing work online. To search available job openings, check out sites like UpWork and Problogger. You can also check traditional job sites such as Indeed and enter \u201ctelecommute\u201d or \u201canywhere\u201d in the location field. Check out more about Passive Income. ",

See Get Paid For Advertising Online Without A Website It\u2019s hard to gain traction without paying for marketing and you\u2019ll need to create a lot of content. Over time, if you do so regularly and promote it successfully, you can earn small amounts from selling affiliate products or using advertising on your content. Once you hit a winning strategy though, think about how to promote it and build a larger audience more quickly. If you re-invest profits back into your business when you start making sales, you can grow an online business model quickly. ",

I suggest you also answer surveys and Earn money very quickly from that. Maybe you do shopping online, these sites pay you for shopping. You search google everyday, these sites pay you to search, you play online games and these sites pay you, you visit some kind of sites and these sites pay also\u2026 Everything you think about is existing! Sites that pay for reading articles, listening to music, watching videos, suggesting logos and names for new companies or startups\u2026 Translating\u2026 You can offer the world these Great Services via Fiverr and Upwork and get paid to do so\u2026 Other great methods, you would make extra income by just lifting people to work or to their houses, you just need a clean driving record and then you can work for Uber or Lyft The Easiest way to make money quickly without money is to sell the stuffs you dont want anymore or the old stuffs you have in Craigslist or Ebay\u2026 You can start your own business (Website / YouTube / Facebook Page\u2026), Free traffic starts from your own friends, those people know you well and wouldnt mind joining your group or your page or subscribing to your channel, this way you get some audience that Youtube or Facebook will think, this guy has audience and he gets interactions from his audience so he is doing well and thus they will start showing your works and efforts to other people and thus you get more followers!! But you really need to start from your existing friends, family and neighborhood, that\u2019s the secret to start your own business for free otherwise you gotta use paid methods which obviously you dont want, and plus trust me, if you promote your work from zero (I mean no followers, no interactions) People seeing the ads won\u2019t trust you and won\u2019t follow you. So in both cases you need to start by the people you know well and then everything will be great. Hope this helps, if you need more info and ideas feel Free to check my Profile on Quora, and Follow me, I got a list there with the sites that pay well for surveys, the affiliate network I work for currently, and by the way, I also rely on Free Methods and Free Traffic.

This could be hard skills (say a skill like engineering) or soft skills (communication, sales, marketing, negation).They could also be money management skills (investing, budgeting and so on)Wealth is net income - expenditure x compounded returns.

Investing skills helps you compound. However, skills and mentality are linked. Many people know how to budget, spend sensibly, learn mew skills to make more money and the basics of investing. However, knowing something and implementation are two different things. Most of us know how to get a 6 pack., but few people achieve it. So mentality is also key.

            "answer_text": "Hey hi, First, there is no way to earn without investment. Anything and everything requires investment. Even when you have to go for a salaried job you invest your time.Your expenses are your travel, the lunch box you carry. Minor expenses but those are expenses, or rather say investment. So you investment let\u2019s say 500 on travel a month, 50\u2013100 on your lunchbox at the end of the month you get your salary. So essentially you are investing some amount for a higher amount later at the end of the month.Now as far as people no Investment is required. I disagree. A simple blog, internet marketing or even writing articles would require a certain investment on your part. A blog might require you to invest in a computer/laptop, internet connection, hours and hours of research, Investments in books related to the topic of your blog. Writing articles might require you to invest in your travel considering you are using pen and paper. A pen would be required, a business card for the publishers to contact you. A book. Investment is needed anywhere and everywhere if you want to earn, be it in small amounts, but its needed. Hope this helps. ",

However, if you are looking at a work from home options, then there are opportunities galore. If you have a few hours to spare every day, many companies are on the lookout for data entry specialists. The pay would be on an hourly basis and based on the volume of data entered. Apart from this, a lot of cosmetic companies hire homemakers for their direct marketing initiatives and that would involve a lot of socializing and organizing events to promote the brand. A few options that are more specialized are jobs like medical transcription, website testing or social media specialist. Each would have their own share of pros and cons. Another excellent line could be tutoring jobs, both online and offline. This opens up a whole lot of opportunities for you. At the onset, let me introduce you to Cuemath, an innovative educational company that's revolutionizing Math education in India. It has both offline and online presence. The offline course is the foundation course for classes KG to 6th and the online programs include the advanced course for the higher grades (7th to 10th) and also the international Cuemath program spread across different countries delivered through live 1 on 1 sessions. The investment would be minimal and the intensive training and materials are provided by the company itself. I have been a part of the offline foundation program for the past 3 years and I can assure you of the credibility and quality of the program. So, if you think you have it in you, just take the plunge. For more details regarding Cuemath and for exploring teaching options, kindly go through my bio section for the relevant links. All the very best!! ",

So you have 1. You swap your time for cash. What your time is worth depends on the local demands and your skills. If you happen to be a good doctor, your time is worth more than a bad gardener - unless there is a real shortage of gardeners and a surplus of doctors. Note this does not have to mean you have to be employed - but just willing to do a service for money. Employment is one way to do it, but you can also be freelance, or set up your own company for pretty much nothing. So find something that needs doing that people are willing to pay for. This can often be broken down into two areas: Things they can\u2019t do for themselves, that need specialist skills, such as programming, surgery, law, driving, etc.Things they can do, but don\u2019t want to. These jobs can be either tedious or unpleasant (or both) but can also pay quite well in the right circumstances. I know one person who runs a business emptying toilet tanks - unpleasant work, but short hours and his staff are well paid for it.",

Usually it's a lack of trust in what you are investing in. Which plays into the biggest factor of ones success, mindset. This one factor can determine your entire level of success. Now don't get me wrong, a scam is a scam and they do exist. So the first thing you need to do is have the attitude of \u201cI will\" rather than \u201cI hope\". This has shown itself proven over and over to be the top factor in entrepreneurial success. Once you have your mindset right, it's off to finding your spot in the marketplace. Will it be MLM (yes there are legit ones out there)? Will you do affiliate marketing? Or are you more into ecommerce or consulting? The world is really your oyster. Now to tackle your question. The short answer is yes. Yes it is possible to start without monetary investment, however you will trade a lot of your time. You will be doing endless hours of research online digging through forums, videos, etc. So ask yourself how much is your tine worth, as you can never get that back. Now I started my online career with an investment because I wanted to cut the line. Which is the preferable way. I can always recoup money, I can never recoup time. With that said, check out this free webinar <British Guy Making $3246.57 a Day in His > run by my really good friend out of the UK who is a 7 figure online marketer. The free webinar is a great resource that will show you everything there is to know about starting your own online business. Full disclosure you will be made an offer at the end but it will teach you all the ins and outs of marketing online. I hope that helps. ",

As soon as you step into that field, you will know what to do. But if you don\u2019t know what you are good at, then start the process of elimination. You will eliminate the work you hate or dislike, and will end up with a few career choices that you won\u2019t mind. Then select the one that is in highest in demand and lowest in competition. You can find out by just doing a google search for \u201chigh paying careers\u201d. There would be about 20 careers that would pay the most. Hopefully you will select one of them. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question lies in understanding that money is a medium of exchange, not only for goods, but also for services - from manual labour to intellectual property.  So you can exchange your time, energy even ideas for money.  Opportunities range from the very simple helping on a farm or someone else house,  to commission sales to education coaching (maybe you are good at high school mathematics or a language coaching) to part time consulting and on to commission sales. I'd include certain online business models, usually affiliate related, where you can sell other peoples products for a commission (e.g.: Click Bank).  The caveat here is you said \"make money with absolutely no money\", so you will at least initially have to \"borrow\" the resources to run an online business.  Perhaps you have a family member or fried who would allow you the use of their technology - perhaps during hours they are not using it, or in exchange for some other type of help.   The business I'm involved with has a program where a few products can be sold with the proceeds going to the purchase of a business package.  This is not the easiest way, but it might get you started without any money.   Once you have gotten started and you do earn some money, then make sure that (apart from the basics, food and shelter) you reinvest it back into your business so you can grow.  You may start with no money, but things will become much easier once you have some. Good luck. ",

Money is traditionally defined as a currency that is divisible, portable, desirable, a unit of account and a store of value. But let\u2019s define it loosely as \u201cvalue\u201d that is desirable, liquid and replicable. DESIRABLE: People want it. LIQUID: It\u2019s easily converted into dollars (currency). REPLICABLE: You can easily make copies of it. If we redefine money that way, then we can get creative and create products like ebooks, audios, videos, etc. that can easily be converted into money. In short, we can create money without having money. Sure, you need a laptop or at least a smartphone, but most people in developed countries already have them.

That\u2019s where it\u2019s located! I\u2019ve seen many people waiting by large home improvement stores, offering customers to help do physical labor for them at their houses. For example, maybe a customer is building a shed, or laying down sod in their yard, or putting new shingles on their roof. They may need to hire laborers for the day. In other words, use your skills, your physical abilities, and your time in order to make money, rather than thinking you need to start with money. ",

But the first thing I will tell you is you dont pay to earn. Earning has ups and downs, starting your own business or sole prop can end up costing more than you profit for periods. Growth into LLC or Private entity is another shift with similiar ups and downs. I have found side jobs give me the freedom to go through the birthing pangs of the shift into a private entity so far. Do not buy intonpyramjd schemes asking for a list of 200 people on your first day to take your friends and family information for 3rd party distribution. That is not the \u201cmoney you need to have\u201d to earn. Job training, professional certification even for manual labor that is the \u201cmoney you need to earn\", not alot of companies front this anymore. Some states and counties, even cities have resources for training but that is foot work you have to do unless you hire someone like me to do it for you. ",

Look at my answer to J Bireus's answer to How can I bring traffic to affiliate links? You can go viral at anytime with a link that could generate you an income. But before doing that, first think, what do you like to do? This works, Make a list of 10 things you like to do. Leave a space under each item From there write why you like to do those things.

Once you actually write the book and put your expertise to paper, then get it published, you're pretty much done. From then on, whenever people buy your book, you get paid in royalties. The precise amount of royalties are contingent on your contract with the book publisher. Create an online course and get paid for it. Let's say you're an expert in a subject, but don't think that a book is the right way to communicate the knowledge you want to share. You can do it with an online course. You can make and upload one to Udemy, for example, and set your own price points. Whenever someone buys the course, you'll get paid. ",

You cannot earn money without doing any investment. Look, if you are in a job you are still investing the most precious thing i.e. your time and after a week or a month you are earning money. Here also you have invested something that is giving you something in return. After earning that money if you deposit that money in bank you can a specified rate of return. That also is investing . Now coming to what i earlier said about compounding. If you deposit your money in bank and do not withdraw it for years then you money will grow by itself(interest). Lets take an example. If you invest 100 rs and rate of interest is 10% then after one yeat you will have 110 rs. After second year you will get 10% on 110 and yoir amount will grow to 121. So after two years you will get 21 rs as interest. This is power of compounding by investing your money. I hope you got my point and will change your perspective on investing . Thank you for reading.

Fundamentally, you need resources, of some type, to get what you want. (What you want may be money, or it may be something else which likely requires money to obtain, but I digress.) The resources you have, with a little ingenuity, could provide the right money-making brew of resources for you. Shawn Field mentioned affiliated marketing links, which he said would take a lot of time to \u201cget the word out.\u201d Obviously, that could be very worthwhile work. Non-money resources might include things like your car (via Uber or Lyft) or living spaces you may have (like AIRBNB). I\u2019m even aware of some ways to leverage the personal grocery budget to create necessary income funds as well. The point is, a little ingenuity can provide lot of different \u201cmonies\u201d to make money. ",

Relying upon technical analysis and chart pattern can get you a profit from 10\u201320% without risking much capital, But if you are willing to hold on to that options in some heavy bullish or bearish condition for more than 30 mints. Options can yield more than 200\u2013500% sometimes. I recommend you to learn stock trading using some online free classes or virtual platforms like STOCKEX or MoneyBhai. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes Offcourse, You can earn a handsome amount with less investment and help of margin trading. There are several strategies which would be helpful. If you are new in trading, my suggestion is to learn more and trade less in initial stage. Start following some trustworthy analysts. Follow their calls and stocks, test their success rate and then decide to invest.  My suggestion is to start trading on monthly calls of low risk low profit. Earn profit and experience in slow and steady manner. After earning 25% of your principle amount, shift to weekly calls. Weak calls are having comparatively more risk and profit too. And in the same manner you would be able to do BTST(Buy today Sell tomorrow) and intraday trading as well. But remember allways, Higher profit is connected with higher risk in all businesses. Let me share a safe strategy called 'Value buying' In which you have to follow some stocks (2 or 3) compare their low and highs of previous month, ensure their upwards trend (upwards if crossed previous month highs) and wait for its price correction near to its previous month average price. Then buy it for the target price of current month average price atleast. For a example, In current scenerio SBI is the best buy @295\u2013298 for the monthly target of 225 atleast. \u2018Buy in fear Sell in Greed' Follow me for more informations and calls Thanks You ",

Are you willing to do all the hardwork required to learn and implement few things? There is no such thing as something for nothing, this is applicable for anything you do in your life. If you are prepared to do anything to succeed in life, there are 1000s of ways to make money - thanks to Internet and social media platforms today. Youtube, blogging, affiliate marketing are few ways of making money without even investing anything. A phone (which everyone posseses) is required for youtube, a computer with internet connection (usually in every home) required for blogging and affiliate marketing - literally no investment required. How you learn depends on how you explore things in the internet and how badly you need it. Everything is available in the internet and no one is willing to implement them by following simple steps.

If you see a building in works, go in and ask if they need someone, even to clean afterwards. No job is too small when you have no money. The better your skills, the better the hourly rate so think about something you can do and monetize it.

You just need a platform to promote said products using a custom referral link. If you have a good social presence on Fb or Twitter, use it for the best results. If you have a blog or a website or even a YouTube channel, you can greatly use these platforms to your advantage. Although I would have directed you to my article but considering that this forum is considering it as spam, I would suggest you to research on the following ways: Affiliate Marketing - Amazon, GoDaddy, Fiverr, Upwork and so many other big names offer a chance to earn decent commission per sale.Transcription - Type what you hear. As good as $0.60 per audio minute. Do 2 hours of audio transcription every day and you walk away with $72 a day. Doing the maths, you get over $2000 a month. Places? As long as you have an active Paypal account, search for Rev, Transcribeme, Scribie, and quite a few more that you can search on Google.Blogging - This might be the slowest to get started but once you have good traffic flowing in, you can make some really decent earnings as long as your content is of quality and free from any plagiarism. You can start off with a google product named Blogger. It is free to use and has no hosting fee. You can get started right away and start working towards your first earning.I hope that this proves helpful to you. If it does, please do remember to upvote the answer. ",

You can also use your time (since it is technically free) to make a little bit of money at a regular job or helping someone else (mow a lawn, clean or repair a house, help move, etc.).

            "answer_text": "There are basically only three ways to make money - and they are all centered around business: Be an employee (work for a business)Start/own your own businessInvest in someone else\u2019s business (true definition of investing)Just about every source of income falls into one of these three categories - and again, the common denominator is \u201cbusiness.\u201d So you can even make the case that there\u2019s only one way to make money. How much money you\u2019ll make - or how passive that income is - will depend on your relationship to a certain business. It\u2019s easiest to start as an employee - but that also has the lowest ceiling for your own earning potential. There are very few wealthy employees. If you want wealth, you must in some capacity own, partially own, or perhaps manage a business. Investing comes later - after you\u2019ve already built up wealth and capital that you can then redeploy into separate opportunities that don\u2019t require a lot of direct effort on your part. No matter where you currently are on the food chain, the #1 piece of advice I would give to someone looking to improve their financial situation is to go through life looking for opportunities to create value for other people. That\u2019s the basis of all successful business - even if you\u2019re \u201conly\u201d an employee, if you can demonstrate value creation for your employer, that\u2019s how you rise within your profession and earn more responsibility and compensation in the future. Good luck! ",

If you know how to drive and has a valid driving licence start working in cab companies as a driver .though it would require immense physical stamina but it might help you get started . Try for freelancing . Create accounts on popular freelancing platform . There are tons of work available. Start with small projects which interest you . This way it will help you build good rating . Look for project with low commercial cost . It's easy to work on smaller project and build good reputation if successful .it will help you get bigger project . But for start you have to keep trying .first break is hard but not impossible. Good luck .and my best wishes for your new start . Thanks for reading . ",

If we note that the majority of global GDP is shifting to services. The principal investment in services is technology, skills, innovation & intellectual property - IPR. Even in manufacturing every product needs intangible inputs that create added value. So the most important resource to get any return on any investment is Time. So while you could get rich without investing any money, without investing time it is unlikely. Time must always be considered the greatest investment to maximise return. ",

You invest your time and energy and in the latter you also invest your money along with those. If you work a 9 to 5 job, you\u2019re giving your employer most of all, your time, but also your knowledge to accomplish something. In exchange for that you\u2019re awarded with money. When you invest in stocks for example, you can consider it a full time job as well, with the only difference being that you have to give money and there\u2019s no employer awarding you but it\u2019s the market itself. What\u2019s more, unknowingly, everything we do is based on investment, we invest in relationships, on products when we buy something and so on. It\u2019s the way of life, you give something to get something in return. ",

Other ways to make money online include drop shipping, youtube, Amazon FBA, and if you can make a little bit of capital with some of these methods, you could start an actual online store or brand buying wholesale.

Theres no capital involved, you just need to be the intermediary between two parties wanting to transact. You will be paid a certain percent of the cash involved. In some markets, your commision comes from sellers as well as buyers, in others it comes only from sellers. However, it still suffices your need of earning without investing or blocking money and trust me it can develop a lot! P.S- you also need quite a few contacts and a good amount of knowledge about market you are entering into.  Hope this helps :)  ",

A YouTuber comes up with an idea to make a video, things of a story line and starts recording it. Then edits it, add music to it if necessary and then uploads it. That\u2019s his investment.  A car salesman, asks you about what you\u2019re looking for. Then, shows you cars that meet your budget and price and style. You\u2019re his investment for that moment.  You goto work, you clock in to start working and then clock out to leave work and start again next day. That\u2019s your time investment to get hourly wages or salary.  A masseuse, gives massage and gets paid in return. They make anywhere from 50$-150$/hr but their job requires hand work which is equivalent to manual labor. So that\u2019s their investment.  So anything you do in short, is your investment. Whatever you offer others is your goods and services! I would like you to ask yourself that would you be interested in someone that has nothing to give but wants your money? ",

However, something like Amazon FBA will probably need at least $1,000 to start. Once you pick something to start, just keep going at it until you get where you want. Don\u2019t be indecisive and keep trying to change your strategy, that will only delay you. All of the methods I just listed are proven and tons of people have been successful with them so you don\u2019t have to be worried about doing the wrong this. Just keep going with it.

Be it wealth / health / relation or anything else.But here I think I should take the word \u201cinvestment\u201d in terms of money. So let\u2019s hit it: Know yourself : The first thing you need to do is to ask yourself your real worth. What is something that you do better than others? What is something that no one has but you? or what is something that irritates / bores people and excites you?Weigh it: After doing the first step, find the monetary importance or value of that thing or service or whatever you think you have it extraordinary in you. And if it has some value or potential, look into polishing it. Get it sharp and unbeatable. (This may take some bucks but if the value of your product is high, this investment wouldn't be huge).Design: Now it\u2019s time to design the platform / framework to deliver it. Keep in mind. The sooner / simpler, the better. Make it quick and smart.Present: Present your product and be ready to be updated as and when required. Don\u2019t hesitate to implement something which you believe to be true. Because our inner voice is the wisest adviser in the whole universe.",

I applied for 100 job offers and got one. I worked and earned money which I then used to pay debts and create my own brand.  Give it a shot, I wish you best luck!  ",

Sign up for Motif investing when you get $250 dollars investing in ETFs. 8. When you get $1000 dollars invest in Real Estate Investment Fund like Fundrise, Tusla Real Estate Fund, Todd Capital. 9. Have enough to buy a car, own apartment or whatever. I don\u2019t know what you are trying to invest in, but if you take the steps ( i have done them myself) then you will have money to invest after 30 days to 45 days.

This is a great way to make money and only requires very little initial capital. Here is a method that has worked for me. This strategy requires: No experience with running a website beforeLittle to no technical knowledgeLittle start-up capital ($100 should suffice)The steps are pretty simple: Picking an evergreen niche that is going to still be popular in 5 to 10 yearsCreate a blog reviewing that nicheUse Google search & Ubersuggest for prospectingPublish content that is more in-depth than your competitor's blogBuild long-term traffic sourcesReach out to advertising and affiliate partners in your niche for monetizationWhen you review blog starts to gain traction, you can start another on the side. the beauty of running a review blog is that once it is up and running it is a fairly passive revenue stream. The only maintenance would be, publishing and updating content. Once you have built your first website successfully, you can then build an empire of websites, all generating passive income. ",

You\u2019d still have to find a buyer which might not be easy. I did find a wheat back penny in circulation the other day, so don\u2019t give up. Always check your change to see if there\u2019s anything valuable, even though there very rarely is. My best advice is don\u2019t give up. Also you could collect cans and bottles. There are people who\u2019ve become rich by collecting cans and bottles but it\u2019s very very difficult work. It\u2019s not my cup of tea to go around searching through garbage dumpsters, but I see people doing it all the time. ",

Then with the money you get you can work out how to grow it, so either buy something to enable you to trade your skills better. And so on. A simple example would be a blog. You can start blogging on a free platform at ansolutely no cost. So you trade your time and maybe you manage to sell something or get affiliate income. You can then use that money to register a domain and get different hosting. Then you blog more and make more income. I think any idea can generate money without investing upfront. Just need to be clever about what can be traded or getting customers to pay upfront. ",

If you are working, then establish a budget that factors in some money for savings and eventually investing. For the vast majority of people, there are no shortcuts or easy ways to build wealth. It takes time, knowledge and perseverance. I hope you find success and a secure financial future. ",

Think dog walking, CCTV camera manning, or even reviewing websites and apps on websites like Userlytics. My favorite in this category, however, is creating YouTube channels around viral content niches (news, gaming, motivation, etc). Simply look for creative common videos on YouTube in your choice niche, download & edit them a bit or add some music background, then upload them to your channel. More views = more money from Adsense, or even monetize with T-shirts and Affiliate products. 2. Trade your expertise for cash Here is where you go to platforms like Upwork, Freelancer and Fiverr to offer your expertise for money. This can be graphic design, video creation, content writing, you name it. You need to be good in a certain skill to go this route. I hope this helps. ",

Maybe trading a physical commodity like something you already own for more valuable/ marketable physical commodity. Then do this over and over again. But again you are investing time. I guess it depends how you define investment and what you consider rich. Most of the rich people i know are just bullshit artists so if you master the art of speaking and manipulation you could find yourself getting rich just by stupid companies or customers giving you money. Pretty much anyone in senior level bank management is just a bullshit artist acting out a part yet they make shit loads of money and take no risk of their own. ",

You need to first decide, how much return you want from your investment. 10%, 50%, or 1000% There are investment vehicles that can earn you such high return but they come with something called high risk. In short, high risk will give you high return. So the question is, how much risk can you take. If you cannot afford to lose any money then you have zero risk tolerance. In that case, stay away from high return investments. Alternatively, if you can afford to lose all your money then you can consider things like stock options. ",
