            "answer_text": "Both the Common App and the Coalition Application allow students to submit essays on a topic of their choosing (which means you can write an essay about almost anything). However, the Common App and Coalition Application have different word limits. The Common App word limit is 650 words, while the Coalition Application suggests that students write an essay of between 500 and 550 words:  If both essays are in the 500 to 550 word range, you are good to go! If your Common App essay is closer to 650 words, I would suggest trying to trim it down a bit (oftentimes, shorter essays are even more effective). ",
