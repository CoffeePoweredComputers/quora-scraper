            "answer_text": "I believe that it boils down to the idea that we give out the love that we wish would be given to us. We go through life portraying that we're put together because our experience is that no one's going to stop to care anyway. On the inside though, we're distraught by this cold reality and crying. When you do something in the effort to brighten someone's day, it's because you long for someone to take notice of you and find you worthy to be shown an act of kindness too. You know how much this little gesture would mean to you, yet you push on still having never having happen you. The closest thing to it in the meantime is making it a reality for someone else. To see them light up, to think it could've warmed their heart at a time when they needed it- it heals us a little bit too, vicariously. Lastly, as persons having this loving nature, these wounds of the same nature, living life in this world that seems devoid of love- we're able to still believe that real and pure love does exist, because we make it exist all the time. Even if we're the only proof we have. If it exists in me then it exists in others as well, and they undoubtedly share these same thoughts and feelings. I'm sorry that I'm not the most eloquent writer, understand that I tried my best though. Ty. ",

            "answer_text": "There were times when I doubted whether I was always in a constant pursuit to make others happy that I forget to keep myself happy. There were times I have been emotionally distraught. So, I tried to make myself happy and less to bother about other\u2019s worries. But that didn't work out very well. Some have a release of natural \u2018feel good hormones' attached with helping, and sharing happiness (NOT MAKING OTHERS HAPPY) this was something that I realized. Now let me tell you the difference between SHARING HAPPINESS AND MAKING OTHERS HAPPY. Sharing happiness includes caring, helping others, spending time with people whom you care about, being kind, making decisions which are beneficial for everyone and not just yourself.As for \u2018making others happy', you need to draw a line. You should never keep on doing something that you are not comfortable or something that you do not agree to, every time just so others are happy. You have to stand up for yourself. Your opinion and wishes does and should matter. This is not about making others happy, its about your self esteem. This also includes completing your work and then give time for others.(well exceptions can be made when it's an emergency or something serious.) Believe me I have been there.SHARE HAPPINESS AND TREAD CAUTIOUSLY WHEN YOU ARE \u201cMAKING OTHERS HAPPY\u201d. ",
