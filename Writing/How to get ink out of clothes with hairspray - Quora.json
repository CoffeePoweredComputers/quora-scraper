            "answer_text": "With some luck. Hairspray only works if the ink isn\u2019t one of the modern versions that is actually a permanent dye and not like ball point pen ink used to be. But you aim the nozzle of the hairspray can at the stain, keeping it just off the cloth and soak the area with spray. Then blot the ink and hairspray up. If it works, the stain may spread but once you blot most of it up, the rest will likely come out in the wash. ",
