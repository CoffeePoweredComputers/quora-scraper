Unfortunately, when you work for a consulting firm, you have to think at least 3 steps ahead of the consequences of any email you send, any phone call you make, any document you submit. Note: I am woefully behind on culture, having only seen a few Tik-toks. I have seen protests though, and sometimes they can be a sort of theatre.

I am sure no matter which side you err on, your legacy will never leave you. In some ways, it chills free speech.
