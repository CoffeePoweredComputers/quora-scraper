            "answer_text": "It\u2019s exactly like playing \u201cdress-up\u201d when you were a kid. Did you ever watch a 3-year-old boy in a Superman costume? He\u2019s lost in his character. I do the same thing. I live in my characters\u2019 heads and write what comes up. I might take on the persona of several of the key characters in my book and go back and forth. I\u2019ve been Luke Raven in the Code Raven Prequel. He\u2019s a techy billionaire patriot and after writing 3 books in the series, I decided to tell the fans where he started. Before I\u2019d hinted at his past. This was great fun to write. I also take on new characters like in my most recent suspense/mystery book, The Istanbul Conspiracy, I loved going first-person on DJ Turk, a playboy/secret spy for the UN. In contemporary romance, I really get a kick out of Layla and Mia. These are the two main characters in two different contemporary romance series: Lie to Me and In the Sun.  ",

            "answer_text": "Really! Just go read a few novels written in the first person. Follow the link in my bio and look for Embers, that\u2019s written in the first and will give you a good place to start, it\u2019s only a quid on kindle. It\u2019s the same as writing in your diary, you know \u2018 I bumped into Tommy today, he was telling me he got off with this long legged chick last night. What he didn\u2019t know was jimmy had already told me it was the wee fat chick from Kennedy street. They sneaked away at half eleven.\u2019 You know that kind of stuff. Of course writing a whole novel like that is a lot more complicated but Embers will give you a good place to start from. ",
