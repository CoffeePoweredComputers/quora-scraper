            "answer_text": "No, not always. Sometimes giving up is a good thing. The following are a few examples from my own life where giving up proved to be the best choice for me. Careers. Sometimes you find yourself in a job or profession that is meaningless, souless, pointless or otherwise untenable in a major way. In my case, I worked for an intersectional race and gender advocacy NGO with a narcissistic and generally dysfunctional Executive Director. She was unable to effectively manage staff or sustain projects with long term impact. Every one of her former colleagues warned me about her toxicity and her staff turnover rate continues to be atrocious. There were so many red flags. I really should have left before blowing up but my \u2018never give up\u2019 attitude kept me in what ultimately was an untenable position. Lesson learned. A bad fit is a bad fit. If you know what you are doing is not for you and you can afford to do so, move on. Find something that is fulfilling and healthy. Relationships. I think plenty of Quorans have written about when to give up on romantic relationships, so I\u2019ll leave that bit alone. But what about friendships? I can think of two very recent circumstances, arguably two sides of the same coin, where giving up on a friendship was the best option. One was a friendship with a fellow parent whose son was friendly with my child. She and I were not super close, but were friendly enough that once she began her divorce I helped her navigate the family court system. After a while, this women began to impose her post-divorce needs (emotional and physical) on me. It got to the point where she would become somewhat offensive if I didn't respond to her texts/calls immediately or give up my previous commitments to be present for her. Finally, I just told her I couldn't give her what she needed and told her that I needed space. She kept asking me stuff, so I very bluntly asked her to leave me alone. That seems to have worked. In hindsight, she generally may not have been able to pick up on social cues and/or might have be on the autism spectrum but at the time I just needed her to to piss off. If I saw her today, I would be much kinder but I stand by my decision. The second was a person with whom I had a rebound romantic relationship, shortly after I left one of the most important relationships of my life. It took me a while but I eventually figured out that I liked the person as a person and he was not capable of being my partner. Because I liked him, I attempted to establish a friendship. I continued reaching out, despite the fact that he clearly was not bothered to reciprocate. After enough rebuffs, I gave up. I am happier for it. I don't care about him anymore, my feelings are no longer hurt. Giving up there made me realize a few things and subsequently makes me better at being genuinely present for the folks that I do love. In sum, a \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude can work some of the time, but not all of the time. Ask yourself what you gain and lose by giving up. Is it worth it? ",

            "answer_text": "There was a young man in his early twenties who had a dream. He wanted to be an entrepreneur. He decided to turn down a job so that he could pursue his dreams. He spent the next three years trying to get to market but was unsuccessful. Nobody wanted to invest in his product because they did not believe in it; there was no real demand for what he was selling. But he continued to persevere. He borrowed money against his family home. Another two years went by and he lost all the money. His family lost their home and were forced to live in a small rental shed. But he did not give up. He kept trying because he believed in his product. Over the next two years, it cost him his marriage, the custody of his child and he ended up an angry and depressed alcoholic. But he didn\u2019t give up. He got into bed with the loan sharks to push his product to market and yet again, he failed. One day, when the sharks came calling, he had no choice but to jump. Finally, life gave up on his dream.  There was beautiful girl, she was smart, funny, caring and would make heads turn every time she walked into a room. She was madly in love with a boy she knew. He however did not feel the same way. She didn\u2019t give up. She tried multiple times to tell him how she felt, she even destroyed his relationships with other girls. He moved towns to get away from her but she didn\u2019t give up. She followed him to the ends of the earth. She stalked him, harassed him and did everything she could to try and win a place in his heart and life. Eventually they both got married to different people but she still didn\u2019t give up. She tried to destroy his marriage and win him back. She caused him pain and suffering through it all and completely neglected her own marriage in the process, which eventually failed. She started heavily drinking, became an abusive mother and ruined her kid\u2019s childhood. But she didn\u2019t give up.  Today, we have been tuned to buy in to the \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude. We are repeatedly told the success stories that came off the hard work, dedication and perseverance of those individuals that made it. What we fail to realize is the heavy selection bias in these stories. What nobody tells us is about the tens of thousands of lives that were destroyed because people kept swimming towards an unreachable island. We need to realize and acknowledge that failure is not a sign of weakness. It is a learning process. Amazon and Microsoft tried to enter the smart phone business but gave up after only one iteration. It was a very wise business decision. They learned from their mistakes and moved on. Had they kept up the \u201cnever give up\u201d motto, they would suffer heavy losses along the way. I\u2019ve come to learn that any extreme is always detrimental. Only a Sith deals in absolutes. You need to find the right balance. Do not be afraid to give up. There are great lessons to be learned in that too. Be adaptable, be flexible, be willing to pivot. Bend with the wind and you\u2019ll never be broken. Some things in life are worth moving heaven and earth for. Similarly, some things in life are not worth pursuing down an endless rabbit hole, the depths of which you might never return from. Choose your battles wisely. Not every fight is worth fighting.  I\u2019d like to leave you with some lines from one of my most favorite songs: You've got to know when to hold 'emKnow when to fold 'emKnow when to walk awayAnd know when to run -Kenny Rogers (The Gambler)  In keeping up with my recent endeavors to try and make Quora a little more interactive and not just one-sided, do share your \u201cnever give up\u201d stories in the comments or via DM. What lessons did you learn by giving up or not giving up on something?  In case we haven\u2019t met before, I\u2019m Rohan Kamath.Thank you for reading. I hope I could help you ponder today. :) ",

            "answer_text": "If you want practical advice, then my answer is \u201cNO\u201d. The \u201cNever Give up\u201d attitude isn\u2019t helpful always. Of course, you need an explanation for my vague statement. I will try to keep this answer precise and as short as possible. Let\u2019s deduce the above statement with an example:- There is a wall which is built with Ambuja cement. Now, there is an \u201cAnt\u201d, which wants to go beyond this wall. It has two options:- Take a long route and cross it.Or, break this wall and then cross it.People around ant motivated it, and suddenly ant started believing that it can break that wall. What do you think, what will happen? Sometimes, you need to understand your limit. People around you will keep motivating you to achieve your goal, and in this process people forget what they are actually capable of. Like the ant, which was capable of crossing that wall after taking long route, but it forgot its capacity and started believing in something which wasn\u2019t possible at all. Your attitude matters, but it should be in the right direction. People remember successful persons where, Their struggles become motivation.Their Story becomes inspiration.But, at the same time you should also consider that behind every successful person, there are millions of failed people; if they would have tried in different field of their interest or capability, maybe there could have been a chance of them becoming successful. Remember, every person on this planet knows their capability. If you know you can do this, then go for it. Never live in a fairy tale. If you don\u2019t have acting skills then you can\u2019t become Tom Cruise, but if you can sing then you should try to become a singer. Don\u2019t waste your effort in becoming something, which you never were. It will only waste your time and energy. Because, every failure exhausts you and again you need to start from zero. Effort and courage are not enough without purpose and direction. \u2014 John F. Kennedy To become successful sometimes, You must either modify your dreams Or, Magnify your skills. \u2014 Jim Rohn PS: Those who misunderstood the message of this answer, I want you to explain that I am not defending that giving up is good. I want to convey that \u201cNever Give Up\u201d is not \u201calways\u201d helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a firm believer in the power of persistence. Persistence, if done correctly, could lead you to your desired end result. Most successful people will tell you that up front. Persistence will allow you to go through the challenges and failures and learning to achieve the success you desire. However, the \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude is incredibly misunderstood. The term does not mean to stay stubborn and stick to the same strategy that may not be working. That is called being arrogant and unaware. In life, it is all about trying, doing and pivoting. We make an attempt to see what sticks and what does not. If we progress, then we are on to something. If not, then this is when we forge another path, also known as pivoting. My favorite story is Justin\u2019s squeezable nut butter packets where the company was failing to sell in stores. He tried everything to get it to sell well, but nothing was working except for this last tweak. He convinced Whole Foods to move the squeeze packs from the energy bar section (originally thinking that people would want squeezable peanut butter as a form of energy while doing physical activity) to the peanut butter section, which instantly turned around the fortunes for the company. There are so many ways in doing something to get to the end result. Some strategies are better than others, but being aware in making a change is key. We do not like to talk about it, but luck does come in to play in many situations. This is not talked about much, because we want to believe that our hard work could lead to success. Not all products will sell well, not all business ideas are ideas that would be great for people and other businesses. We could be the greatest salesmen and saleswomen on earth, but who decides what is great and what is not? The market does. If people do not want the product at the end of the day, then nothing happens. What producers could do, is making an attempt to find, or develop a product/service that that they do want. The only way to find it is to try. Persistence is admirable. It is continuing to find something that does work. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether you are called \u201cdetermined\u201d or \u201cstubborn\u201d\u2026 whether you are encouraged to \u201ckeep going\u201d or \u201cgive up\u201d\u2026 depends entirely on whether the person agrees with you. GALLIPOLI (stubborn)  When Churchill was Secretary of the Navy during WW1 he advocated for attacking the Turkish city of Gallipoli (no relation to me, your humble writer Anthony Galli). His 2nd in command resigned in protest, \u201cYou are bent on forcing [Gallipoli] and nothing will turn you from it\u200a\u2014\u200anothing. I know you so well!\u201d Churchill indeed forced the issue and the English attacked. It was a disaster. One of the worst in military history. 120,000 young men died largely because of the decision of one man! Churchill\u2019s wife, Clemente would later say, \u201cI thought he would die from grief.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re going through hell, keep going.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aWinston Churchill NAZISM (determined)  Churchill\u2019s stubbornness came out again in the lead-up to WW2 where everyone virtually disagreed with him, but yet he stood firm. Churchill stubbornly believed that Hitler was bent on war and was not a man who could be reasoned with. Churchill ended up being right, and because he was one of the few men who had sounded the alarm, he was asked to become Prime Minister to lead the nation through uncertain times. \u201cWe shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.\u201d \u2014Winston Churchill  All great leaders are stubborn/determined. And this was never more true than for Winston Churchill\u2026 \u201cNever, never, never give up.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aWinston Churchill One of the things that makes a person \u201cgreat\u201d is their willful irrationality or delusional optimism. Churchill would fight through at any cost [watch my essay on Abraham Lincoln], while a rational person would have given up long ago. \u201cFor myself I am an optimist\u200a\u2014\u200ait does not seem to be much use being anything else.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aWinston Churchill Churchill would sacrifice his health, happiness, fortune, and reputation in the interest of seeing the Allies through WW2. This is the true mark of greatness. We grow in proportion to our cause. The hard part is choosing when to be stubborn and when to be flexible. This requires wisdom because it depends on the situation (there is no simple formula). But overall I would say if you want to be happy be flexible on the small things and if you want to be great be stubborn on the big things. But again it requires wisdom to know when something is \u201csmall\u201d and something is \u201cbig\u201d, which can be especially difficult to decipher when we are caught up in the whirlwind of emotion. In the movie \u201cThe Darkest Hour\u201d there is a historically accurate scene where Churchill shouted at his secretary over a mistake she made when she accidentally started typing in single-spaced lines instead of double-spaced lines.  Should Churchill have been more flexible with his secretary? I think we would all agree he should have been more compassionate, but his stubbornness might not have been misplaced because successful people are often regimented. This is one of the reasons why a lot of famous people get a reputation for being divas. They need things just right and any deviation can throw them off. But I think part of what makes these divas so successful is their attention to detail in their craft. As the piano was to Bach, and the canvass was to Picasso, the typewriter was to Churchill. The greats have a higher standard. \u201cI am easily satisfied with the very best.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aWinston Churchill This is the tradeoff of being great: they are more likely to be stubborn when they are right, but also when they\u2019re wrong, and they are more likely to be stubborn on big things, but also on small things. \u201cNever give in, never give in, never, never, never, never\u200a\u2014\u200ain nothing, great or small, large or petty\u200a\u2014\u200anever give in except to convictions of honor and good sense.\u201d \u2014Winston Churchill We would be wise to empathize with this when we read biographies and watch biopics because sometimes to demand the absence of weakness would mean cutting off the strength. And as much as we talk down \u201cstubbornness\u201d we are actually quite attracted to it. At first people say, \u201cStop, get real, quit dreaming, be practical\u201d, but the longer one sticks with it, eventually people start to come around and think, \u201cWow, he is still at this thing/cause/idea/business. If it is this important to him then maybe he\u2019ll succeed?\u201d They develop respect because they see how much it matters to you, and in a world that constantly feels like nothing matters, people gravitate toward people who live with a sense of \u201cmatter\u201d because they want that same feeling for themselves. Maybe not for the same thing, but for something. \u201cSuccess consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aWinston Churchill Stubbornness will at first make you unpopular, but as was the case with Churchill, he was willing to be disliked in the short-term so that he could be loved in the long-term. \u201cYou have enemies? Good. That means you\u2019ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aWinston Churchill He was willing to say what he thought was right, even when everyone thought he was wrong, because to be great means fighting on, against all odds, to ultimate victory.

            "answer_text": "Yes , of course , it is helpful. Never give up attitude is very helpful in becoming successful in life. But it is very hard to develop a such kind of attitude. You may think that from now you will never scare from failures or you will always face the problem with a determined mind. But my friend believe that it will be for only the time being. Most of the people will give their good practices after few days. It is in the human nature that people are more likely to develop a bad habit than a good habit. So the problem arises here how one can keep never give up attitude alive in themselves forever. We all that we always care for our future. But we hardly do things for making it brighter and brighter. It very easy to develop a thought of give up atitude. But as I have said earlier it is hard to develop a habit of that. But for developing a such kind of attitude in yourself, first of all you must start thinking that you can do anything from everything. And no one can stop you from being what you want. You will never lose the hope no matter what has happened . You will always face the problem with a bold and strong mind. You will never care of others. Whenever you will feel that now you can't do things just start asking from yourself why you can not do things. Trust me you will never get an appropriate answer and no one can be fool himself or herself. One can never tell lie from oneself. You will find that you can do it the things but at the cost of something that you are not willing to afford . I can afford that but the matter of the fact is that you are not willing to do it. And remember one thing you must always be motivated from yourself. Once you started thinking that trust my friend you will never fail in your life and success will at your feet. ",

            "answer_text": "The words Give\u0089\u009d and Up\u0089\u009d should never be together. Rather the word NO shouldn\u0089\u2019t even be in your dictionary. Being part of the human race you are the one of the most resilient and strongest beings to have ever walked on the earth. You are practically legendary. Comparing you to people who lived just 100 years ago you will notice that you know a lot more things than they did and you are 1000 times more connected and up to date then they could even imagine. There are a countless number of positives inside of you that you probably don\u0089\u2019t even realize. And every now and then when you lose motivation a quick reminder of what your potential is can really help. Just always keep in mind that to taste success you are always faced with temporary defeat. If you give up at these defeats you will fail, but if you keep going you will become successful. These strategies will inspire and motivate you to keep going. 17 Reasons To Never Give Up: 1. You Are Alive And You Can As long as you are alive you have no excuse to say you can\u0089\u2019t. If you put your mind to it, you can do anything. Anything is possible. So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable. \u2013 Christopher Reeve The only valid excuse to give up is that you are dead, and if you\u0089\u2019re reading this well\u0089_ 2. Believe In Your Dreams When you give up, you give up on yourself. Don\u0089\u2019t sell yourself short and don\u0089\u2019t let anybody bring you down. If you can dream it you can do it. There have been millions of dreamers before you and if they had given up the world wouldn\u0089\u2019t have been the same. Take the example of the Wright brothers who faced sever ridicule when they tried to make flight a reality. Everybody laughed at them and told them it was impossible. They proved the world wrong, and now flight now is considered a common means of travel and it has changed the world. Hold fast to your dreams, for without them life is a broken winged bird that cannot fly. -Langston Hughes 3. You Have Everything You Need Everything you need to reach your goal is already inside of you. Don\u0089\u2019t make excuses, if people can play sports at the Olympic level with disabilities; your short-comings begin to look irrelevant. Be thankful. And use your God given blessings.  4. You Don\u0089\u2019t Want To Regret This Regret is the worse feeling a person can feel. Don\u0089\u2019t put yourself in that position and do what you have to do, now. I do not regret the things I\u2019ve done, but those I did not do.- Rory Cochrane 5. You Need To Prove It To Yourself You want to prove it to yourself and the world that you can. Don\u0089\u2019t let anything stop you from your goal.True failure isn\u0089\u2019t when you miss the mark; but it\u0089\u2019s when you give up. You are more capable and quitting is for losers. 6. Success Feels Great There is no better feeling in this world other than knowing that you faced an obstacle and that only through grit and determination you overcame it and became successful. 7. It Could Change For The Better It might be really tough now, but it can all instantly change. If you keep going at it you never know when you\u0089\u2019ll hit a breakthrough. Don\u0089\u2019t be like the person who dug a well 50mand gave up justifying that he was digging a dry well. And the person who came after him dug 1 m and hit water. 8. This Is Meant To Happen You were destined to do this. Nothing can stop you but yourself so keep going at it and never give up. #BecomeLegendary  9. You Are Strong You have the strength to do whatever you want and no matter the amount of setbacks you face you have the strength to keep going. 10. Pride You have high standards for yourself and you must try to never fall short. Work as hard as you have to, for as long as you have to, to achieve your goal. 11. Learning You will learn a lot from not giving up. You will learn about your strengths and your weaknesses. How to do things better next time and most importantly you will learn how to tackle the problems that you face head-on. 12. It Could Be Worse The situation could be a lot worse and you should be thankful for being able to face what you are facing, because there are people out there who have much bigger problems. 13. You Deserve Happiness And Success Everyone deserves happiness and success, including you. Don\u0089\u2019t let these small bumps in the road take away your right. 14. Inspire Others Be an inspiration for others. Refuse to give up and try your hardest; you never know who is watching. Your hard work and dedication could be the spark that was needed to light the dreams of those around you. Maybe you have children or siblings that look up to you. You are a hero. 15. Failure Is Normal It\u0089\u2019s impossible to reach success without first facing failure, so don\u0089\u2019t let anything stop you. Failure is a normal process in life. It\u0089\u2019s not the end but just a stream changing directions before it finally reaches the ocean. I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can\u2019t accept not trying. -Michael Jordan 16. Things Can Only Get Better By sticking to your goal and being persistent things can only get better. If you\u0089\u2019ve hit rock bottom or feel you\u0089\u2019re on your way down. Remind yourself that with the right amount of hard work what comes down must go up. Hard work and determination can get you anything in life.  17. It\u0089\u2019s Always The Darkest Before Dawn Understand that the hardest trials are the ones that come right before the breakthrough. So stay persistent because at any given moment you are at the tipping point and success awaits you. Commitment leads to action. Action brings your dream closer. \u2013 Marcia Wieder Best of Luck! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes For me Never give up attitude is always helpful . There are 10 things that will happen when you adopt the never give up attitude. 1. Elimination of fear Defining moments like a graduation, job, marriage, house, relationships, failures, and pain are daunting moments. Our conscious mind dwells on living up to expectations that society pushes on us. A never give up attitude can be used to quash doubts that you once had and become more confrontational with your fears as opposed to backing off. The attitude itself helps you initiate the battle that you\u2019ve been wanting to win all your life. \u201cJust a tiny drop of doubt can poison an entire well of faith.\u201d 2. Doors of creativity and an unlimited feeling We live in a society that has deep-rooted in us with a timeline that things have to be done this way or must be achieved by this age. The problem with this way of thinking is that it creates a mindset of scarcity instead of abundance; \u201cwhy isn\u2019t anything happening.\u201d A never give up attitude pushes us beyond our limits to explore different methods thus opening the doors of creativity. Creativity is like when you open the windows and the fresh breeze of air hits you. This helps you see life in a fresh new perspective, therefore the mind becomes focused on the unlimited rather than the limited. Many great minds try things that are not of the norm, which gave them this endless feeling. 3. Burning desire stays lit \u201cDesire is the starting point of all achievement, not a hope, not a wish, but a keen pulsating desire, which transcends everything.\u201d famously said by Napoleon Hill. A highlight of the current generation is that there is a lack of motivation. However, with the right push and the right mentality the burning desire can stay lit constantly. The words I always hear are \u201cI don\u2019t feel motivated\u201d \u2013 the truth is if you want it bad enough you would stop at nothing. The message here is keep moving and stay busy, any little thing you do can amount to something big at the end of your journey. 4. Going where many don\u2019t dare to go A never give up attitude has taught me to work hard on all levels; physical health, well-being, work, sports and hobbies. This in turn gave me a greater output of results. Whenever I say \u201cI will never give up\u201d, I dare myself to take risks that nobody else dares to and within that process you can reap massive rewards. Whilst others are laid back and choose to do nothing, there you are with your spirited and hungry attitude to pounce on every opportunity. 5. You become the lion with a relentless work ethic Think about what sets apart the top dogs within their specialties from the rest. It is in fact a mere willingness to do anything for success. Are you that type, the one that will stand their ground, ready to fight for your dream or are you the sheep just like everyone else? Never giving up allows you to develop and think of new strategies because there is always a way. Whether you must stay up all night, stay late at work, or miss your friends party, this is what the serious ones will do. 6. Improve the world When you achieve whatever you set out to achieve, you can use your success to make a difference to the world or other people\u2019s lives. Slowly as you achieve your goals there is the feeling of wanting more. You transfer your mindset and life skills to people who are far worse than you. Inside, you feel complete and you want to pass the never give up mentality to those who are going through what you have already embarked on your journey. Purpose and your big \u201cwhy I am here\u201d are answered. 7. Believe that anything is possible When you refuse to give up you are more likely to source energy to jump that hurdle that you\u2019ve been meaning to overcome. The measure of success comes downs to winning the battle between the perception of that it is impossible to achieve and the willingness to get out of your comfort zone. The only way is to never give up. Ask yourself what if I kept going rather than just give up\u2026 can the outcome be different? 8. Emotional intelligence The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one\u2019s emotions is key to handling if things don\u2019t work out. Just because you never give up does not mean you will achieve 100% all the time. Right now, there are many people who are in a worse situation and environment than you are right now. It is ok to lose sometimes. You can\u2019t win all the time but at least you can control the damage and embrace that learning is all part of the process. 9. Not quitting becomes the only option My teacher always used to say to us as students \u201cprepare for failure\u201d. He said in life you must always be ready and be prepared for anything. If you remain in a state of always being alert to danger, chances are you will avoid making mistakes. The more you stay hungry or have this feeling that you have something to lose, the harder you fight for your dreams. On the contrary, if you give up at the first sign of struggle, then you are not ready to be successful. 10. You grow stronger I must do this for me and keep going to become better as a whole. In doing so, you learn so much about yourself by evoking personal reflection. When the physical state and mental state are pushed in positive ways they become synchronized like a harmonious melody. Following this, the gates of the soul open to true growth and freedom. Even when the body has suffered, the blood, sweat and tears have worn you down, the mind still lives and that never dies. Therein is the epitome of the human mind; a mind so great and mysterious that it is able to achieve anything. It can endure unknown situations which give you that drowning and suffocating feeling. Whether you\u2019re reading this at 2am in the morning or in the evening, the never give up mentality is being awakened, telling you to carry on. The complexity of life both the economic and social hardships in which we currently live in makes it easy to get carried away by the feeling of defeat. Like they say, you can get back up so never ever succumb to defeat because in this world you are not allowed to give up. Take a deep breath and don\u2019t you dare give up. ",

            "answer_text": "We, humans, are aggressive rather defensive beings, well most of us are aggressive. But we fail to show the same attitude when it comes to \u201cproving ourselves\u201d. We, sometimes let things go away easily. So, if one possesses a \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude, it's always helpful as it will help him achieve his/her goal. But wait, here\u2019s the catch, with the \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude comes stress, anxiety, depression and a lot of \u201cWhy am I not able to do this?\u201d questions. To make you understand, let me take a simple example, Let\u2019s assume you are given a task which you have to complete in 3 days, and the task is totally new to you, i.e. you have no idea of pre-requisites for the task. On day 0, you find out that the task requirements are too high and you don\u2019t possess the skills required for the completion of the task. Now you have two options; Quit and say the task a \u201cGoodbye\u201dTake up the challenge and complete it (never give up attitude)You chose the second option, now you have 2 days and you have a lot to learn to complete the task. You try to learn everything overnight and plan your schedule to complete the task by day 3. It\u2019s hectic and you\u2019re losing time. This leads you to mental exhaustion. You still try to continue with your task, the second day, until and unless you see a ray of hope you feel dejected and pessimism occupies your brain. This is when the person undergoes various different phases such as depression, a feeling of \u201cgood for nothing\u201d and what not. But, because of your \u201cNever give up\u201d attitude you never try to find an excuse to leave the task, you rather try to fight and continue the task and complete it. And on day 3 you see a beautiful result, you had an option to quit and fall asleep without any mental pressure, but you chose not to give up, you were spending sleepless nights just to achieve something. That is the taste of \u201cSuccess\u201d, when you earn things by mere hardwork!  Image Source: Pexels ",

            "answer_text": " An atrocious moment of 1985 at Apple Office. Steve jobs had been withdrawn from Macintosh team. Apples former CEO John Sculley convinced Apple Board of Directors to eliminate Steve\u2019s responsibilities as team leader of Macintosh product team and managerial power for the betterment of Apple corporation at long term. Earlier Jobs had lots of argument and clashes with John Sculley with different decisions. Steve tried to influence the Apple by his own leadership as he had visionary ideas. Steve wanted to reduce the price of Macintosh computer but Sculley did not agree with it while he thought that it will not increase profit. Steve founded apple at 1976 with his friend Steve Wozniak. Apple Board of directors thought that Steve is too young to perform as CEO. So, Steve favored John Sculley to perform as CEO who was the successful, youngest ever CEO and president Pepsi at that time. After forcefully withdrawing from Macintosh computer division, Steve had given new office and responsibilities in Apple. But Steve felt depressed and insulted. So, he took a break. He traveled Soviet Union and Europe. At December, 1985, Steve left Apple. Steve had \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude when fighting with John Sculley with several decisions because Steve founded Apple with long vision to change the technology world which was not matched with john Sculley\u2019s Principles and decision making. Certainly, the battle between Steve and John made the situation more weird and difficult. Literally \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude is not always helpful. Sometimes, people forget to consider the reality. Finally, Steve resigned Apple despite the co-founder of Apple. In fact, he gave up all the ambitions and dreams which was encircled with Apple. At 1986, Steve started his new company \u201cNext\u201d which is an amazing software and computer Company. He worked insanely with his personal projects. Basically at this phrase of time, he entered most creative stage of his life where he did not have any expectations and responsibilities like past, he was free to do any work. Steve purchased Pixar movies at 1986. Pixar made top class blockbuster animation movies under the visionary leadership of Steve Jobs. 1986\u20131995, Steve made amazing change in his lifestyle, personality and work style. Interestingly 1996, Next had been acquired by Apple computer. Steve had been offered to maintain as CEO by Board of Directors and he become CEO of Apple again. Steve made tremendous change in his mindset and team methods. He was completely a new person after coming back to his own company. His creativity continuously evolved at new innovations and creativity. Then, launching Apple touch phone broke all the business record in smart phone market at 2007. Now The i-phone is highly successful and prestigious brand in the whole world. There are lots of inherent learning from this incident. Winning life at long run, we have to give up attitude for our own benefit. Certainly, life is not smooth all the time, we have to compromise with the situation instead of adamant attitude. The situation demands that behavior. Sometimes leaving expectations and giving up everything help to rediscover our potentiality and enhance inner strength which completely change ourselves. Steve did the right thing to give up everything. That sacrifices changed him as a person and made him legend.

It may boost confidence for less than a minute and make you feel good for a short period of time, but really, did it help? Sometimes you need to ask yourself questions like that. Is this helping my attitude? Does this make the situation better or worse? Is encouragement always encouraging? I've always absolutely hated when people say things like\u2026 \u201cIt's all going to be okay.\u201d \u201dDon't give up!\u201d OR \u201cIt gets better.\u201d Because truthfully? Not everything will get better, giving up is so much easier than fighting for something that is worth nothing, and it will probably not be okay! At least for a little bit depending on the situation. This attitude can also backfire very easily. Believe me. If you are upset you probably don't want people saying: \u201cHey, don't give up.\u201d Because usually they have no idea what's happening or they haven't been through what you're going through. It might even make you feel worse. Imagine you are 11 years old or so. You are at school, eating lunch all by yourself, you are obviously sad. Someone comes and sits with you which makes you happy until those ugly, fake, words come out of their mouth.. \u201cDon't worry, whatever is wrong, it will be okay. Don't give up. It will get better.\u201d Then they leave you. How would that make you feel at your age now if something similar happened to you and how would it make you feel at a young age? So tell me, do you think that the \u201cDon't give up!\u201d attitude is always helpful anymore? I don't believe so. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me tell you an interesting story first before directly jumping into a conclusion. One fine day, I was reading a book with full of concentration and one mosquito perfectly managed to break the rhythm. He started hovering around my book and then sat on the pillow and I started observing him keenly. He started stinging on the pillow, as it was soft he managed to prick but did not get blood out of it. \u201cAttempt Failed.\u201d I got more curious and started watching him carefully. After that, He \u201cgave up on the pillow\u201d and sat on the floor. Started stinging again, but the surface was more hard than the previous one and could not even able to prick in it. \u201cSecond attempt Failed.\u201d Now it was a lottery time for him. He came and sat on my hand, bitten me and suck the blood out of it. \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d End of the story !!! Now, you might be thinking what\u2019s the relation between the answer and this story ? (You may have noticed the same story in your life many times, right?) But, The key point here is the \u201cGOAL\u201d. For a mosquito, His goal was to suck the blood and satisfy his hunger. He changed many paths, got failures but did not change his goal. Yes, \u201cNever give up\u201d attitude will always be helpful. But you gotta find out whether you are giving up on your goal or on the paths you are trying ? I read many answers of this thread, many agreed on it and some didn\u2019t but the essence was missing here which made me write this answer. Rana Ashish (who is also one of my favorite writer) also wrote a story about an ant. Rana Ashish's answer to Is the \"never give up\" attitude always helpful? He denied in his answer and said this attitude does not help every time (which many people misunderstood). But we need to remember that, the goal of an ant is to go beyond the wall. Ant may give up on her paths but must not give up on her Goal. If you will give up on the endeavors you are doing and try a different one that will be fine. But if you will give up on your goal then I am pretty sure, It won\u2019t make any sense ! If you can\u2019t fly, then run. If you can\u2019t run then walk. If you can\u2019t walk, then crawl. But whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward. -Martin Luther King Jr. ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah..! It's helpful but depends on what you are trying on. Many of quorans has given the answer on the +ve sides. Let me discuss some of its CONS. For instance- If you like someone and you are trying to make them to enter in your life. But the one to whom you like, she already like someone else. So there is not point of Never giving up. You will have to give up there because you can force someone to feel same as you feel for them.Never chase love and true friends. If they really belongs to you then no matter, whatever may be the situation they will stand by your side.If you are constantly trying to solve a question but you are not able to solve this and you are still trying to solve and in all this mess up you have wasted your nearly 40\u201345 mins then I recommend you to don't do this.If a question is not going to end after several attempts so move on to next question but if you have \u201cNever give up\u201d attitude it's going to ruin you time as well as temper.You may feel devastated after this as you have not only wasted your time but You would end up losing the enthusiasm with which you have start studying.So there are many points in life where you have satisfy yourself by focusing on what's important. I am not saying you to Give up easily on something but if all the limits get crossed just move on. No one knows what treasure you may find ahead. Time never stop and life always goes on. So along with the attitude you have to use little brain that is definitely going to bring +ve aspects in your life..!  Just believe in yourself and have faith In God. Regards Amandeep Sharma ",

            "answer_text": "Sure, it works. It just works in that one's stick-to-itiveness is hands down better than a pessimistic attitude. I have a past student who comes to mind. I was her high school math teacher. She is NOT a math talent, but she would just NOT give up. She sends me messages from time to time about her successes in college math. My mother used to say to me about my being a stubborn boy, \"Ray, you will see as you get older that your stubbornness is not just a problem: it will become one of your strengths.\" My mother was a wise woman.  Now, that being said, we still need to learn from our failed attempts. Trying EXACTLY the same thing is probably not a good idea. Never giving up does NOT mean not learning from our failed attempts. It means just the opposite.  When, also, you put an indomitable will to doing something, you will blow YOURSELF away with the results. My own life's best example of this is when I got disgusted with how dirty my high school of 2500 students was. I devised a plan, worked all Spring Break, including with other teachers and students, and - believe it or not - in three days our school went from the dirtiest high school campus you can imagine to the cleanest one you would ever see. It helps when you want something, it is right, and you don't even think of failing. That program (in which I once a weak dressed up as Mr. Clean with earring and clean-shaven head) lasted for a couple of months and changed the culture of the school. My point - hopefully not just to brag - is that our will and perseverance is not just a successful strategy, but, maybe, essential. Cheers,   ray ",

            "answer_text": "Giving up too soon is a problem and not knowing when to quit is a stressful and draining problem. Many moons ago, when I and my friends enrolled for graduation, a friend of ours enrolled for a popular Indian accountancy certification exam. This exam has three levels and with each level the difficulty level increases, and to maintain the supply and demand of such accountants the pass percentage is usually really low. So, many people at times give 2-3 attempts or even more to clear a single level. Usually, this qualification is associated with a high aspirational value, really smart people do, a high pay job and a lot of respect. And so it goes, my friend who enrolled for this certification, who was also a brilliant student, enrolled for this exam. While we graduated, she was still trying to clear the level I one of this exam. Even though she was a smart student, somehow, she couldn\u2019t clear the exams in a single attempt, it was really frustrating for her, more so because it was for her family. The more the frustration grew the less she scored, and the longer time it took her to pass. In many years, while most of us completed double degrees, took a job, changed jobs, got promotions, got married and some got kids too, she struggled to clear the exams, she went into depression, came out somehow, again attempted exams, and attempted\u2026 I even lost tracks how many times she attempted for the levels in totality, last I heard from her was, \"Yeah, I am a housewife now, with no purpose of life.\" She was once upon a time a brilliant student, but because she didn't know when to quit, she kept trying for something which was never meant for her. She kept judging and punishing herself for something which, I believe, was not even the best parameter to judge her smartness. Maybe that exam demanded some other kind of proficiency, something which she doesn\u2019t have, but she had many other wonderful skills using which she could have excelled in life. More often than not, most of us miss judge, never give up attitude with never quit anything else you will be labeled as a loser attitude- and this attitude has ruined many lives. We often fail to quit that relationship which is no longer going anywhere, that exam which has eaten our endless years, that business which was a dream once but is not working anymore, that job which is stopping our growth. Quitting or giving up is a temporary set back that can be overcome by putting energy and efforts at the right place, in the right direction, and that sort of never give up attitude is always helpful.

Many of us have been deceived by some succes quotes which to me has no originator \u201c what the mind can think, it can achieve \u201c Unarguable is the fact that society, race, gender, social strata and other factors have a greater impact on what we can achieve as a being, even though there are history of those who despite all frustruation proved themselves and come out with amazing succes. Each and everyone of us have our own definition of \u2018the never give up instances \u201c. I simply outlined my aims and objective, mapped out the possible routes to get there and check if this goal is actually realizable. I know what I'm capable of, I know what I can do, I simply source for energies and resources to carry them out. People will come and tell you trash, tell you the possible way of achieving a task which they themselves could never have achieved giving the same stances they are giving you. Their intent possibly is to give you false hope. Never mind them. Know thyself and know what thy can achieve . These are instances where people seems to have gotten it wrong Bill Gates doesn't even had a degree from any university, and he did so well.Thank you, but not everyone will become the next Bill Gates. It'll be foolish to think I can equally drop only to become like himXYZ wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he made it to a top company after graduation and today he's earning a 7 digit salary.Again, thank you. We've seen people who equally were from a wealthy family, and their dreams and aspirations got shattered because they never have the means and opportunity to implement them.There are indicators of hardwork which might get you what you want in life, and luck which offer you seat where people with the same personality like you has failed, but need is to factor in the \u2018know yourself and define your goals expression \u2018. In my own world, I give up on people when The love and gestures are not being reciprocatedHaving tried to set them aright ,they keep going more and more to the negative directionThey believe they are overly deserving and do not show appreciation for the little act of kindness.I don't give up on goals when I've measured both the odds and even, and the later outweighed the former. Even if the odds seems enormous ,I pursue such goal relentlessly. I give no concern to such oddsWhen I know I posses all that it takes to get it done, then not doing it will be the most painful regret.Succes is an unending phenomenon, it is your duty to give it your own definition. The most sweetest thing in life is feelings you have when you have succes. Thank you  ",

            "answer_text": "These 10 Stories Will Remind You To Never Give Up On Your Dreams  Every now and again, I go through times where I feel like it\u2019s all too hard; that it would be easier to just throw in the towel. Perhaps you feel the same at times, too. In these scenarios, I like to remind myself of just how far people have come to reach success. I get inspired by reading stories of entrepreneurs, inventors and leaders and how they overcame many failures and rejections, so I\u2019ve put together 10 famous personalities who truly inspire me and I\u2019m sure they will inspire you too\u200a\u2014\u200ano matter your journey. Mind you, these people weren\u2019t born with a silver spoon in their mouth (except for Franklin Roosevelt). Here are the 10 personalities who have overcome the odds: 1) Thomas Edison  First on the list is Thomas Edison. Have you ever felt discouraged just because you failed, maybe once or twice? Did your teacher called you stupid just because you can\u2019t answer a simple math problem? Got fired from your job? Well, you\u2019re not alone! Sir Thomas Edison isn\u2019t as intelligent as you thought he was. In fact, during his early days, even his teachers told him that he\u2019s \u201ctoo dumb to learn anything and there\u2019s no hope for him.\u201d He even stopped his formal education at the age of 12. Not only that, he also failed more or less a thousand times with his inventions. Likewise, he even got fired from his first two jobs\u200a\u2014\u200aafter leaking acid on to his boss\u2019 desk, but he didn\u2019t give up and he didn\u2019t let those failures drag him down. Instead, he ignored those criticisms and despite being almost penniless, he turned out to be the most successful inventor of his generation. Having a great influence from motion picture cameras to creating the light bulb. Come to think of it, if he did give up, you\u2019ll probably be using candles up to now. One of his famous quotes is, \u201cEvery wrong attempt discarded, is another step forward.\u201d 2) Harland David Sanders (Colonel Sanders )  If you\u2019re one of those people who uses the excuse, \u201cI\u2019m too old, there\u2019s no way I can be successful anymore.\u201d Think again. It\u2019s never too late for success. A great example of this would be, Colonel Sanders. If you\u2019re not familiar who this guy is, he\u2019s just the founder of the ever famous Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). One of the biggest fast food corporations worldwide. Though, it wasn\u2019t an instant success. Colonel Harland Sanders started his dream at 65 years old. For most, this would be the time to retire and enjoy the remaining years of their lives. However, Colonel Sanders turned this the other way around. After getting his retirement benefits, he used his first social security check, amounting to one hundred and five dollars, to start a business (once again)\u200a\u2014\u200athe start of his journey. Most people would complain after receiving this amount. Not him, though. He believed that restaurant owners would love his original fried chicken recipe and he\u2019d get a small percentage once the sales increase. It wasn\u2019t an easy job. He drove around Kentucky, knocking on every door, sleeping inside his car, and to look formal, he always wore his signature white suit. Even though KFC is very famous now, do you know how many times people ignored his offer and said, \u201cNO?\u201d Only 1,009 times, but that didn\u2019t stop him until he got a \u201cYes!\u201d 3) Steve Jobs  Say, are you a college dropout? Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple didn\u2019t get his college diploma either, but this didn\u2019t stop him from dreaming big. He even took his greatest failures and transformed them into his greatest success. At a young age of 19, Steve Jobs, together with his friend Dan Kottke decided to drop out of Reed College and moved to India instead. What\u2019s their reason? To find Philosophical Enlightenment. A stage of Jobs\u2019 life where he learned the power of intuition\u2013 something that greatly influenced his works. He was a visionary perfectionist that most people think highly of him during his early years. However, at the age of 30, his own company (Apple Inc.) decided to fire him. Can you imagine the company you\u2019ve built from scratch, turning his back against you, leaving you humiliated, depressed, and most importantly, unemployed? Well, Steve Jobs tried to overcome that and he succeeded. 11 years after Apple decided to fire him, the company was on the verge of bankruptcy. A time where Microsoft was soaring high. Being the brain behind Apple Inc., the company was desperate and crawled back to Steve Jobs\u200a\u2014\u200aasking if he could consider coming back. Basically, he took this offer and made Apple one of the most leading pioneers when it comes to new gadgets and technologies. 4) Albert Einstein  Laziness is not an indication that you\u2019re not a genius, or you\u2019ll never become successful. Just look at Einstein! Even though he\u2019s considered as an epitome of genius back then, he was the exact opposite. His communication skills didn\u2019t even develop until he was four. His parents even thought that something was awfully wrong with him. Likewise, from elementary to college, his teachers and professors labeled him as insubordinate, sloppy, and lazy. They believed that he\u2019ll never become successful. However, what appeared to be laziness in school, was just really boredom. He\u2019s not the type who\u2019d memorize the facts written in the book. Rather, he preferred to analyze things, such as: why is the sky blue? Why does the needle of a compass point in a single way? Unfortunately, these weren\u2019t taught in school. So, how did he become a genius? Well, he didn\u2019t let his failures, shortcomings, or flaws overshadow his potentials. At the age of 11, he became friends with Max Talmud. A 21 year old medical student who introduced Einstein to several books about science and philosophy. Einstein flourished in this learning environment, and before Max knew it, Einstein has already surpassed what he could teach the young Einstein. 5) Abraham Lincoln  Don\u2019t let your failures bring you down. Don\u2019t be a quitter, persistence is the key! And that\u2019s what Lincoln did. If you\u2019re not aware, this great man encountered a lot of failures. Failure after failure. In fact, it even seemed like it was endless! He could\u2019ve quit many times, but he chose not to. The result, he became one of the greatest presidents of all time. Though, before becoming a president, he encountered several failures. Some of these are: his mother died; his business failed; he tried to run for state legislature and he lost; he got fired from his job; he wanted to go to law school, but he couldn\u2019t even get in; he tried starting a business and borrowed some money from his friends but at the end of the year, he faced bankruptcy. Can you imagine how tough it was for him? Though, he never gave up. Around 1834, he tried running for state legislature again and he won this time. Likewise, a year after, he got engaged and was about to be married. Unfortunately, it seemed like lady luck fell asleep once again. His sweetheart died and Abe had a total nervous breakdown and was bedridden for six months. After that, he tried entering politics and faced defeat for a number of times. Still, it didn\u2019t make him lose hope, and in 1860 he was elected president of the US. Thus, his legacy lives on\u2013 a man who changed a nation despite many adversities and failures. 6) Oprah Winfrey  Your failures should be your stepping stone to greatness. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re poor, your parents are irresponsible, you\u2019ve been sexually abused, or people judged you because of your skin color. Don\u2019t let these things bring you down. Even the most powerful entrepreneurs faced the same dilemma, and Oprah Winfrey is a living example. The first African-American billionaire. Most of us had a wonderful childhood; but not Oprah. When she was 9, she\u2019d been sexually abused by her cousins and even the friends of her mom. At the age of 14, she got pregnant and her son died during infancy. However, she developed an oracle gift in church, and in 1971, she entered Tennessee State University. Landing her first job in radio and television broadcasting. She got her first position as an evening news anchor for Baltimore WJZ-TV, but got fired shortly. Not because she doesn\u2019t have the talent, but because she\u2019s \u201cunfit\u201d for TV. For her, this experience was humiliating and embarrassing. She even got sexually harassed. Although, she didn\u2019t allow these obstacles, trials, and challenges to defeat her. She converted these misfortunes into great success. Oprah became a talk show host for AM Chicago, and she managed to make the ratings sky rocket in just a month; and in 1986, The Oprah Winfrey Show came to life. Back then, most talk show hosts concentrate on trashy topics. On the other hand, Oprah focused on the middle class, and self-help topics. Her witty humor and warm welcome made her gain the sympathy of the crowd. Her talent as a talk show host, combined with her entrepreneurial skills brought her a net worth of more or less 2.9 billion dollars. 7) Henry Ford  Failure isn\u2019t that bad. In fact, you could even learn from it. Therefore, it is something that we should embrace. Even Henry Ford failed- he failed a lot, but he utilized what he learned from these failures and built a successful company that\u2019s still going strong even today. This man viewed failure as an opportunity to begin (and try) again, only more intelligently this time. He even managed to overcome significant setbacks before arriving at the winning formula that made him reign in the automobile industry today. He faced bankruptcy before launching Ford Motor Company. Likewise, he faced several failures before his first Model T was ever made. Despite failing as a business man, he was determined to become successful. With that, through persistence and determination, he became one of the richest entrepreneurs globally. 8) J.K. Rowling  Do you know anyone who\u2019s richer than the Queen of England? It\u2019s no other than J.K. Rowling, the famous author of the series, Harry Potter\u2013 having a net worth that\u2019s over $1 billion. No, she wasn\u2019t born with a silver spoon in her mouth. She\u2019s no better than you during her early years. In fact, there was a time that she lived in an Edinburgh apartment that was greatly infested with rats! She\u2019s a single mother who struggled just to make ends meet. Basically, you could say that her life was very miserable. Being unemployed, she even had to juggle between a baby and her typewriter when she was writing her first book. Moreover, she didn\u2019t even have the privilege to do this in the comforts of her home, but in a cafe. Even the series that we love today? The first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone faced twelve rejections before it managed to become a successful hit. However, her determination took her from rags to riches. She\u2019s a great example that anyone could attain great success even against all odds. 9) Franklin Roosevelt  Are you afraid of committing failures? Why? Just because you think it\u2019s impossible, it doesn\u2019t imply that it really is. In fact, you\u2019ll never know until you try. That\u2019s what Franklin Roosevelt believed in. Before becoming the 32nd president of the United States, Teddy Roosevelt faced many hardships in life. Despite the fact that he was born into a life of wealth and extreme privilege, that didn\u2019t make things easier for him. Yes, he managed to graduate in a prestigious school and entered a life of politics in 1910. However, during the fateful year of 1921, he was infected with polio. His body was nearly paralyzed and he lost his legs during the battle. With this, he went through a period of extreme depression, but he knew that he shouldn\u2019t give up. In 1928, even being confined in a wheelchair he still tried to re-enter politics and became the president of the United States for 4 terms. Franklin Roosevelt experienced a spiritual healing during the years of his illness. Before, he used to be arrogant and insensitive. However, after that incident, he became a warmhearted person with a deeper philosophy in life. Instead of letting his impairment make him appear weak, he emerged as a better person. 10) Walt Disney  You can\u2019t deny the fact that sometimes, it feels like things aren\u2019t working out the way you want it. That the whole universe is against you. That your life is a complete mess, and your only wish is to experience more success. Walt Disney felt the same. Life wasn\u2019t easy for him. As a matter of fact, Walt Disney experienced so many failures, but that didn\u2019t even tempt him to give up. You think that Walt Disney has a very wild imagination? Well, he was fired as a newspaper editor before; and according to his boss, he lacked imagination and his ideas are no good. Also, he tried to start a business but faced bankruptcy before it even gained success. He was literally and figuratively broke, all he had was his dreams and aspirations. Though, he never got tired and continued to try new ideas until he reached success; and once it did, it was overwhelming. He managed to win 22 Academy Awards and established the first Disneyland in California around 1955. Today, the Walt Disney Company rakes in billions of dollars annually from movies, theme parks, and merchandise around the world. Anything Is Possible I hope that these famous personalities inspired you to strive harder and aim higher. Despite several failures and circumstances, it doesn\u2019t mean that success would be out of reach. Hence, with deliberate determination, anything is possible. Tell me, what do you want in life? Perhaps, for now, it seems virtually impossible to attain that goal, but keep in mind that you\u2019re not alone. Most successful individuals faced the same struggles before they reached the peak of success. We all know that overcoming failures is not a piece of cake. Though these 10 personalities faced an impossible battle and they conquered. So think again!  This article originally appeared on Medium ",

            "answer_text": "This is a true story of a young woman who went through the most gruesome fire. When you read her story, you\u2019ll realize that your trials are absolutely nothing compared to what this young girl went through. It was September 25, 2000. Maricel Apatan was an 11-year old girl in Zamboanga. On that day, this little girl went with her uncle to draw water. Along the way, four men met them. They were carrying long knives. They told her uncle to face down on the ground, and they hacked him on the neck and killed him. Maricel was in total shock, especially that the men were their neighbors. She tried to escape, but the men ran after her. She cried, \u201cKuya, \u2018wag po, \u2018wag n\u2019yo akong tagain! Maawa po kayo sa akin!\u201d (\u201cDon\u2019t kill me! Have mercy on me!\u201d) But they weren\u2019t listening. With a long knife, a man slashed her on the neck too. Maricel fell to the ground and lost consciousness. When she woke up, she saw a lot of blood. She also saw the feet of the men around her, but she pretended to be dead. When they walked away, Maricel ran back home. But along the way, she saw that both her hands were falling off. Because the men hacked them too. She cried but she kept running. Sometimes, she would faint and fall to the ground. But she\u2019d regain consciousness and run again. When she was near her home, Maricel called her mother. Upon seeing her daughter, her mother screamed in terror. She wrapped her bloodied child in a blanket and carried her to the hospital. Here was the problem: From her house to the highway, it was a 12-kilometer walk. It took them 4 hours just to reach the highway. When they arrived in the hospital, the doctors thought Maricel was going to die. But for 5 hours, they operated on her. It took 25 stitches to stitch together the long knife wound in her neck and back. Maricel barely survived. And she lost both of her hands. Ironically, the next day was Maricel\u2019s birthday. She was 12 years old. But tragedy didn\u2019t end there. When they went home, they saw their home was gone. It was ransacked and burned down by the goons. Being very poor, Maricel\u2019s family also didn\u2019t have P50,000 for their hospital bills. But God sent many angels along the way to help them. Archbishop Antonio Ledesma, a distant relative, paid for hospital bills and helped them bring the criminals to court. They were sentenced to prison. Today, she\u2019s staying with the nuns at Regina Rosarii with Sr. Eppie Brasil, O.P. But this is the incredible miracle. Instead of staying down, Maricel kept running. Instead of cursing God why she had no hands, she now uses her wrists in incredible ways that will boggle your mind.  Maricel Apatan Maricel was cited as the most industrious, best in computer, and most courteous in the School for Crippled Children. In 2008, she graduated from a course in Hotel and Restaurant Management. She even received a Gold medal for Arts and Crafts. In 2011, she finished her education to be a chef. Yes, a Chef without hands. Nothing can stop this young lady from reaching her dreams. Real Winners Don\u2019t Give Up! ",

            "answer_text": "Great things take time Is this always true ? I am still thinking. I read the above quote whenever I stand in the line in the mess hall of my hostel waiting for hot food and said to myself \u201cYes! Great food takes time\u201d. Before reaching any conclusions, what qualifies to be called as \u2018Great thing\u2019 and what does \u2018time\u2019 imply here. In literal sense Great does mean- above average, important & beautiful.Great things vary according to the perception.What may appear great to you, may not appear to someone else. To my father , being school 4th seemed great. Now, I believe it doesn't anymore. What is great changes with time too. But let\u2019s consider \u2018Great as something synonymous with \u2018getting out of poverty\u2019, \u2018 flying to the moon\u2019, \u2018Being Famous\u2019, \u2018Richest cream\u2019, \u2018Becoming powerful\u2019, \u2018Staying powerful\u2019, \u2018being happy\u2019 or simply \u2018being employed in a stable and secure job\u2019. But remember, all success is not great. And time here is inevitably long-term. How long is \u2018long-term\u2019? For the above mentioned great things , I assume that it takes anything more than at least 5 years. Although being happy might seem to be an exception.Yet in most cases, society wont let you be happy until you seem great. It\u2019s for you to decide to be happy or be great or both. Time is to be viewed as multidimensional here and let us assume it is a function of space, circumstances and work done exclusively to that particular \u201cgreat thing\u201d. The GREAT wall of China took an incredible 2000 years.Did Thomas Alva Edison have to fail 10,000 times ?World Economic Forum finds that it takes 99.5 years to close the Gender gap to zero, but the image looks hazy even after that, if pandemics and other disasters continue to take place. What it takes to become the first Black President of the country ? For Nelson Mandela to spend a gratifyingly long 27 years in South African prisons. Elon musk, founder of SpaceX says that people need to work from around 80 to over 100 hours per week to change the world. How many hours do you work ? When I was discussing the same with my friend, he asked to think about the unsuccessful people. I pondered for a while and it occurred to me that , People who stop trying, are failures. Oprah Winfrey, a billionaire with her own TV channel was once a failure. She was fired from her stint as aTV anchor. And she reflected \u201cThere is no such thing as failure. Failure is just life trying to move us in another direction.\u201d Others who travelled the journey of consecutive failures before becoming GREAT are J K Rowling, Katy Perry, Steven Spielberg, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Dhirubhai Ambani ( he was not from an affluent background),Mallesham were once FAILURES. In my opinion, GREAT things take time. How much time depends on its function I stated above( space, circumstances and work done). Time is nothing but an investment. The more time one invests, the more one reaps out of it. The time one thinks of giving up is the time invested in Failure.One cannot invest time in X and earn benefits from Y. Even if one invests the entire time in X, one cannot entirely gain from X unless one meets the criteria of the skills needed to gain the fullest possible benefits. In order to be GREAT, one must outbound the set criteria. The reason you find very few GREAT women is because a notable amount of majority are obliged to the social conditioning of investing their time in the domestic chores or for making their husbands, brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters GREAT. It\u2019s high time to invest time in making yourselves and the WORLD a GREAT place. Is being great enough ?  Never ever give up !! ",

            "answer_text": "Case I: An almost 2\u00bd year relationship. Lots of incidents during its course that pointed towards things not working out in the long run. Lies, arguments, negativity, too much emotional attachment, etc. All in all, we weren't that compatible as we thought we'd be. But me being me, I kept on trying and trying to fix things up somehow. Well, he tried too. But boy, did it go downhill despite all the efforts put in. I guess that's what happens when a person doesn't really have the will to be with you, when they have some serious things of their own to sort out.  Where did it get me?To the lowest point I've ever been in 20 years of my life, emotionally, physically, as well as mentally. What did I learn?Among other things, learn to let go before it gets too late.You cannot help someone who doesn't want to be helped.   Case II: A friendship of 3 years and still going good. Started out real good, we clicked instantly. Great emotional connection, all the care and love two friends can have.Few things go wrong (afore mentioned relationship included), some pretty stupid but significant mistakes get committed, hurtful words are said. Communication reduces to almost none.Miscommunications and misunderstandings that we didn't even imagine could happen.And all this happened when we both needed real good focus in our lives, needed support. Somehow, we talk and discuss things. None of us are the 'give up easily' kind. Few things get cleared up. Others seem too much to forget, or at least have that kinda trust again. But we both hung on by the littlest of threads because we could clearly see that we both didn't want things to end.Owned up to our faults, worked on making things better. Things went bad again, what with all the vulnerability and fear of getting hurt. Again we talked and decided to give it another try.Short period of peace, something came up yet again. Knowing each other too well can go wrong at times. But before it became too much, we sorted it out.Took great effort, always will. That's what it takes to maintain a healthy relation. Where am I now?Friends with one of the most awesome guys in the world.Yea, we still got few issues to work on, but we're back on track. What did I learn?Unconditional relations are really worth never giving up on.   So, there you go. Is 'never giving up' always helpful?Nope. You'll have to fight your battles as they come along. You cannot fix your approach for every situation.You see danger, you back off.You see potential, you hold on real tight. Of course that's the trick.To know when to give up and when not to. Good luck!(: ",

            "answer_text": "I will say something controversial here, please hear me out. This attitude is not always helpful. Society always ask us to strive for the best and never give up, yes I agree with this to a certain extant. But, what if you have tried your best but you don\u2019t succeed?  Say for example you enter a competition, its your first time and you didn\u2019t win. It\u2019s okay, you are inexperienced and this is normal. Perhaps you can try harder to win the next time. Now it\u2019s your second year, you enter the same competition. You tried your very best again. Somehow for whatever reason, you lost again. It\u2019s alright, maybe someone else tried harder than you and you should be more well prepared. Finally, the third time arrives. You have prepared yourself sufficiently throughout the year, you tried to think of how you can win ethically from every angle, you are filled with confidence that finally you can have a breakthrough and nail it this year. You lost again. Your friends look down upon you, people berate you, others shake their heads in disappointment. Right now you feel dejected. Why can\u2019t I win? I have tried my very best, yet the outcome is not changing? Have I not done all that I could, why then am I still stuck here?  Consider the scenario above. You didn\u2019t give up previously, you prepared to the best that you can, but the outcome is not changing. Not giving up is good if you have not tried to the best of your abilities; but when you already have and still fail, perhaps it is better to give up instead. There maybe various reasons why you gave up, perhaps what you invest in becomes more of a burden than an enjoyment, perhaps it is harming you or those around you, perhaps it is just not your forte, or perhaps it is consuming too much of you but is still not producing any positive results. For example, I can force you to be a mathematician, but if your real strength lies in music, it will be a waste of talent. Likewise, if you are a methodical and are passionate for numbers, asking you to be something else which robs you of opportunities will not fare well for you. Hence, it is better to give up only when you have tried all that you can, yet can\u2019t progress any further.  I am not saying that when things are tough you should give up immediately. Rather when your heart of hearts knows that you can\u2019t move onward in that field, then you can consider stopping and being content. Giving up is not the first option, it is the last option. However at the same time, you should know and identify where your real passions and strengths lie, then progress in that direction. Knowing when to give up and when to not give up is important, but when you do find yourself in a situation where you need to give up, learn to be content with your decision. Do not feel bitter at yourself just because things aren\u2019t working out, just because you can\u2019t succeed now means it is definitely your fault. Maybe this area is not where you ought to be, but someday you will definitely find somewhere you will belong to. ",

            "answer_text": "A very dear friend was a hardcore Transport Pilot optee. While most of the Air Force cadets dreamt of flying the Migs and the Sukhoi, he was a laidback character who wanted to enjoy flying the Antonovs and the Dorniers. Fortunately, or unfortunately after passing out of the National Defene Academy, his instructor at the Air Force Academy was a hardcore fighter pilot. He had a very strong reputation in the cockpit and often his pupils came out with broken helmets, masks and visors. My friend was terrified of him and still hates him. He wanted to give up flying because he was afraid of sitting with his instructor in the cockpit. Many times, he decided that he will apply for a change of branch to administration or logistics but he didn\u2019t because being a pilot was what we all had dreamt of from the first day in National Defence Academy. With a bruised eye, and a bleeding nose, he cleared his solo. He was thankful he didn\u2019t give up then but what he didn\u2019t realise was that it was the fear of his instructor that made him prepare better and perform better than others. He passed out as one of the best flyers in merit. The nail in the coffin however was that he was alloted fighter stream despite being a transport optee. He felt really down that day, but he thought at least I\u2019ll be flying and went ahead. He wanted to go to the Mig 29 squadron but after training on the Hawks for a year, he was sent to a Mig 21 Squadron. He was really frustrated by now as fighter flying sucks up your mental and physical energy initially. He was a junior pilot in a Mig 21 Squadron and used to wait on the ORP for hours daily to scramble. He was doing all this despite still having a liking for transport stream. Last year, his aircraft was changed. He finally got the Mig 29. He was happy as hell. He got married as well, bought a dog and now leads a content life which he might not have if he had applied for change of branch because of his instructor or when he was allotted fighter stream or when he was given the Mig 21. Be logical even when you decide not to give up. Weigh the pros and cons and most importantly, don\u2019t let emotions get the better of you. Sometimes we don\u2019t realise what we have and run behind things which are out of reach for a reason. We all can fly, only if we think we can and if we dont give up. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it really depends on the people and their circumstances. This strategy really made sense in many instances. Abraham Lincoln became president of the United States because he never gave up.Thomas Alva Edison invented first light bulb after 10000 failures. And he said he found 10,000 different ways that did not work! Look at his attitude towards failure! There's lot to learn!Even the world famous rapper Eminem has the same attitude! That's the reason he is now the 'Rap God'.Michael Jordan, Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein and if we go on, the list will have no end. And remember that we only talked about famous people who failed and didn't choose failure as an option. If we just look around, we will get to know about many common people who thought success is the only option they have.And at the same time there are other situations where this won't work at all. For example if you are in an abusive relationship and waiting for your partner to change, that's foolish.And if you are wasting time on someone expecting them to realize your importance..this will never work! Finally, it's you who have to decide when to apply the strategy and when to not!",

            "answer_text": "I'm team Never Give Up ... But you have got to have adaptible and flexible strategy... You can't run in west hoping to look for Sun rise ...its never gonna happen... The point is... You should be flexible in approach without forgetting the real Outcome And knowing real* Outcome is tricky thing ...most often we're pissed for wrong reasons... We should always check what's working and what's not working and make changes in our approach accordingly... We don't need to blindly commit to a strategy that's what many people to do and wonder why all the hardwork didn't pan out in the end. Also Never Giving Up should be at foundation but you must be aware of what bridges are you burning and why are you burning because you never be able to go back in time look for those bridges... (While never giving up ...Don't burn so many bridges that you have nothing to fall back on in case you hit a dead end) Third.... Holding on to something is easy you just have to never give up no matter what  BUT knowing when to let go and when to hold on to is the real key!! Most*(not all) people have wrong blueprints for life and they are miserable forever.... at least their deadlines for themselves are wrong  (Have great relationships, be financially independent before 25, climb mount everest , make mom and dad proud by giving TED Talk, publish 4 bestseller novels before 30, get married to woman of my dreams who will be supportive of my passion, cure cancer and the list goes on) Like famous saying, most people overestimate what they can do in a year and underestimate what they can do in a decade!! I know when you have unrealistic expectations and you relentlessly strive for it , whether you achieve it or not...you will always grow little more...but you've got to have enough executable strategies ... I want to emphasize it that we always know or hear about the people who didn't give up against all odds and came out as winners... But there's other side too ... Like when you see incredibly talented people still struggling to make ends meet or bitter and less rewarding life... Life that they don't deserve at all...they appear to be stubburn, still not willing to adapt... (I'm quite sure there are so many people like that we don't know about, who are still chasing after their dream that hit end long time ago) Bottom line is ALWAYS* is tricky word ...Does Always* never giving up always works ... Probably not because we can't look at life as two dimensional board ... It's not ...its influenced by so many things ... It's like unstoppable flux ...   We should trust our gut...but we should always be willing adopt and flexible in our approach... You don't wanna be 80 years old miserable lonely person just because you're still digging for the treasure you once dreamt when you were 18... We should know when to move on... ",

            "answer_text": "I was recently having a conversation with an exam aspirant who wanted some guidance on how to improve his performance. He always found it difficult to complete the paper on time, and had to leave a lot of questions. On probing further, he mentioned that he had a \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude. Once he took up a challenge, he always ensured that he saw it through. As a result, he found it very difficult to leave a question and move on to the next question. He kept on solving the same question for long, thus losing out on the speed. While having a \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude is good, it is really important to also know where to apply that attitude. Sometimes, it is better to give up in order to achieve something better. Sometimes, it is better to prioritize your options and give up on the low priority options. One of the biggest errors we make in life is not accepting that we made a mistake. Economics calls it \u201csunk cost\u201d. When you are working on a project, and you realize your efforts are not leading you anywhere, then you need to improvise and change the direction of your efforts. Improvisation does not necessarily mean giving up, but unfortunately, sometimes people shy away from improvising because they think it implies giving up. Having a \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude is very useful when you are trying to achieve your goals, and you should definitely have that attitude. However, there are times when that attitude can lead to extremely negative results, and we need to be cognizant of those scenarios. We need to have a \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude, but we also need to prioritize, need to be flexible, and need to improvise where needed. Sometimes, just sometimes, giving up is so much better than not giving up. ",

            "answer_text": "Awesome Question. This shall directly address those two famous quotes \u201cnever give up\u201d and \u201cSometimes you should let things go\u201d. In order to answer that, let\u2019s create some parameters. What are the things for which the \u201cyou should never give up\u201d attitude is vital ? They are probably things which are essential for your survival, growth and success. So this means : Never give up until you can finally crack the solution for that math problem.Never give up till you finally top the charts in your exams.Never give up till you have finally nailed that entrance.Never give up till you have finally landed your dream job.Never give up till you finally made your parents proud of.Never give up till you find your love of life.Never give up, till you finally look back to your past and smile about the fact that you never gave up.Now coming back to the parameters, than what are the things that don\u2019t require this attitude : Give up for the friends that didn\u2019t understand your value.Give up on the relatives, who no matter what you do, shall not appreciate you.Give up on the crowd, that is more than happy to term you as \u201cGood for nothing\u201d.Give up on that so called love, that is less a person and more like an onion for you.Give up on that crush, who you are aware of has no future, and might hinder activities that might frame it.The conclusion here being, You gotta decide the priorities, hit the right switches to turn on the needed bulb and shut down the troubling flashes. Prioritize and Execute, shall be the holy grail here. Am i supposed to cry out loud and keep dragging a relationship in which the other part is not feeling it as much as i am, Hell NO. So i let it go, completely, with no traces. Then, Am i supposed to sit down and conclude that i can\u2019t do it, just because i am lacking on the financial grounds or may be am not as good as him, again, HELL NO. ! I keep striking back, until it hits the bulls eye. ! ",

            "answer_text": "IIT-JEE, an examination well-known for the quality and difficulty level of questions. Most of us know about it. I\u2019ll tell you the story related to it. He hailed from a small tribal village in Rajasthan called Jalore. He got his education in Hindi medium and hadn\u2019t got much exposure to the tough, cut-throat competition. In 2000, he wrote IIT-JEE for the first time. Result- Failed to qualify. After this failure, many would have run away from the competition. But he didn\u2019t. He came to Kota, the coaching capital of India and took admission in a coaching institute to prepare for IIT-JEE again. He was, as if lost amongst the brilliant English-speaking students of Kota. Come 2001 and he wrote IIT-JEE again. Result- Failed to qualify again. A second failure would have surely crushed the hopes and determination of many. But not this guy. He came back to Kota and began preparing again in a different coaching institute. He was an unknown name there. Now comes 2002 and he sat for IIT-JEE for the third time. After the results of IIT-JEE 2002 were out, the coaching institutes faced a strange problem. None of the heavy-weight coaching institutes of Kota, including the one in which he was studying could find the AIR-1 in their top rankers\u2019 lists. A lot of hulabaloo followed. Finally, someone from a mediocre batch of a coaching institute in Kota announced that he was the AIR 1. The coaching institutes had never even considered his name due to not belonging to a top batch. He was a surprise package. But what about our protagonist\u2019s result. Yes, you guessed it right. Result- All India Rank \u201c1\u201d He was that unknown, underestimated Dark Horse!!! Inspiring right? The \u201cHe\u201d here is none other than Mr. Dungara Ram Choudhary, a popular name in the coaching circles of Kota.  If someone wants an example of a person with a never-give-up attitude, his is the first name that comes to my mind.He had great determination and self-belief to qualify the IIT-JEE. He kept trying again and again, once, twice, thrice and finally qualified it. Not just qualified it. But nailed the AIR 1, a mere dream for thousands. So, what I think is a never-give-up attitude really helps in the long run of life. In short term, it may sound foolish and you may be joked about. But if you succeed, you\u2019ll be remembered and become an example for many. But what if fail? You\u2019ll not be able to achieve your ultimate goal through that road. But the lessons you learn and qualities you acquire will still surely come handy in taking you to your final destination. So, DON\u2019T STOP TRYING. -PK ",

Some less told stories here:  This boy here  Sachin Tendulkar visited MRF Pace Foundation Chennai in 1987 because he wanted to become a fast bowler. As abackup plan his brother carried his batting kit along. By watching his batting skills on the net Australian bowler Dennis Lille insisted him to stick to that. But boy was quite firm on what he wanted to become. 2 years later this teenager made his test debut, and rest is as they say history. If he never gave up we would still be searching for GOD.   Everyone knows the story of this man  A scene from the movie M.S Dhoni an untold story. Cricket coach of his schools notices his goal keeping skills one day and sends a boy to M.S to ask whether he is interested in cricket. Boy rerurns to the coach with the answer, Arre pagal hai kya,Chote ball se kaun khelta hai..! ( are you mad? Who'll play with that tiny ball?) And you know what happened further. If he hadn't given up his goal keeping we wouldn't have witnessed a great wicket keeper in cricket history and a Captain cool.   So here is the bottom line. No! Never give up is not always right . Sometimes letting go does less damage than holding on.  Cheers!! ",

            "answer_text": "You have a plethora of different answers to this question Sanjana, and so after divulging everybody's input you have to make up your own mind which answers you truly value and feel most comfortable with. From my perspective I have been fortunate to have lived 69 years on this earth, and I must tell you I am not from the 'never give up' stable in life.  No.  It does not always work.  Honestly.  I have come across stories of people who have lost everything because they did not have the intuition or sensibility to quit when the time showed itself to be right for quitting.  With some people it is a case that their pride gets in the way.  With others it may be them trying to prove a point.  Others still, greed takes charge and throws logic out of the window.  One has to take these points seriously in life because they happen! What I would tell you personally, is to banish the 'never give up' phrase or may be add in a word to make it 'never give up easily'.  That puts a different perspective on it. 'Never give up' is just a catch phrase.  Never give up your motivation, may be.  Never give up your commitment to make your life meaningful.  But acquire the capacity to know when you should not give up and when you definitely should.  Now that would make sense to me.   ",

            "answer_text": "As a part of our college curriculum, we were all assigned group projects. My group was assigned a specific topic and in order to start with it, we designed our own method, let's call it the method 'X'. For about two months we worked very hard, tried to modify it, but it did not give the desired results. Our guide suggested that we give up on this method 'X' and start afresh. It was so difficult to give up on it because we worked so hard, for two months! How could we just discard it? But discarding it was (unfortunately :P ) the wise choice. Giving up on that method and starting all over again was important, because the main goal was to complete the project! Finally, we came up with an approach 'Y', and this did work. What I wish to convey here is that it is important to work hard, very hard, to achieve your goal. And obviously, there will be a lot of obstacles on the way. Not giving up on your goal is one part of your journey. The other part is the methodology that you undertake in order to deal with the obstacles. Not giving up on the goal should be your main aim\u2026 But giving up on traditional beliefs and certain approaches that might have worked for you in the past, can actually be beneficial for you to achieve your desired results!

If I talk about my CS statistics, I have cleared all the levels till now in the very first attempt and not being able to crack it in Finals was a shock. The results were to be announced at 11:00 am. And as soon as it flashed upon the screen, it took me a while to realise the word \u2018FAIL\u2019 on marksheet. Naturally, I cried, got anxious, negative thoughts made their own good space. Everyone consoled but couldn\u2019t help it out. In the evening, met my Faculty where I did my coaching for the same. Somewhere between his words and my hopeless mind, he just told me one line- \u2018You know its a step back for a long jump. You have two choices, either continue crying and affect the next attempt or accept the fact and fight back as a warrior with double power.\u2019 It was in few moments that I finally understood his words, and realised that I was wasting my time by crying on something that isn\u2019t in my hand anymore. \u201cNo more crying. Get back to work, Drishti!\u201d, I spoke to myself. And here I am writing this answer, the \u201cnever give up\u201d attitude is on. Is it helpful? I don\u2019t know. All I know is the world doesn\u2019t stop by a failure, rather its the beginning of a success journey. May be something great is waiting for me. May be this was not meant to be. May be I needed to learn the value of a failure in life which I never did. With all the positive attitude, I continue my journey with double the power and courage. I can and I will! ",

            "answer_text": "Purush Raj aka Rakesh basically from Rae Bareli, UP, 48 years old man. He is renting second hand books in Andheri(East), Mumbai, 300 meter from Seven hills hospital. He had a major accident when he was 15 years old and he lost his left hand. 15th august 1985, he has gone for pluck mango with his younger brother who was demanding for mango. Rakesh climbed tree, he was not aware that high voltage wires crossing above his head. Unluckily he stood between two wires, his left hand and left side of head touched that wire. He was unconscious about that fact, he didn\u2019t even realize what\u2019s happening. he said his younger brother recalled this incident to him. After 3 days his consciousness back at Zila hospital, UP. Doctor said his hand had to cut us so that poison couldn\u2019t spread in whole body. He was married that time but \u201cgauna\u201d didn\u2019t happen (child Marriage), he said to his wife,\u201dMarry with someone else who could take care of you because I couldn\u2019t.\u201d Her reply take you to romantic movie of bollywood. She said,\u201d ladki ki shaadi ekbaar hoti hai. Main aapki hi ban ke rahungi.\u201d His motivation to fight with circumstances and problem occur against him was his wife. He has 3 Kids now. One is married and settled with his wife. He hadn\u2019t regret for that. He did lots of agriculture works in delhi and then came to Mumbai. One more tragedy happened his mind gone unbalanced, then he went back home, after 4-5 months when he recovered . He had gone Delhi and done same agricultural work but his destiny took him to Mumbai again and started book renting stall. 15-16 years completed renting books. I asked him,\u201d Do you face loss, if someone keep your book instead of returning?\u201dPositivity in height, He said,\u201d I took 100 to 300 in advance from readers depending on which book he or she renting and book had already circulated 2-3 times at least. So i recovered money. Now he is Wikipedia of books, he remembered all books name with writer name and he will customize your wishlist means after one or two books he will know your inclination towards genre of books and he can start suggesting books on that genre. I can\u2019t tell about others but I am learning art of living because of his suggested books. Dr. Abdul Kalam once said,\u201d One best book is equal to hundred good friends but one good friend is equal to a library.\u201d I didn\u2019t find library yet but I have books to shape my life. I am adding one sentence on that quote is, \u201d That good friend must have read 100 books.\u201d  ",

            "answer_text": "Oh boy it certainly works! Disclaimer - NOT Claiming always part of the question Here\u2019s my story illustrated below and you judge on whether never giving up is the right strategy forward in any situation. My background first - This is 2014, I have had troubles in my personal life with family related health problems which used to keep me occupied with thoughts as I was away from my family pursuing B.Tech in ECE at NITK Surathkal in India. I might discuss my life before this period on another day. There was a program which our college was hosting known as NITK CMU Winterschool which was going to be held in December 2014. As I continued learning more about the program and getting exited at the thought of meeting one of world\u2019s best faculty and applied to the program in the hopes of getting into the program. Fortunately, I did get selected in the program and it was an amazing experience [more on this in a separate post] and met wonderful people in the span of 15 days to turn in quality research projects in the period. And this marks the beginning of the kick [I have never taken drugs in my life but I am sure it was a similar feeling that one would get], I got with research. Considering the financial situation, I decided to wait for a period of a year-two and decided to work at ARM [a brilliant experience there by the way]. So right now you must be thinking heck everything is working out in your life. I did continue working on the research while working at ARM and did my best to contribute in the best possible way staying in collaboration and touch with researchers at CMU. GRE and TOEFL Attempt 1 So, in the first year itself, as a goal to get into one of the best Computer Science schools, I decided to give the standardized tests which almost every applicant has to give to get into a good schools. I got a low GRE score and an even worse TOEFL score [lets not talk about it]. This came as a jolt to me as I really wanted to apply that year itself and didn't want to miss out. However, it was clear to me thinking rationally that I will get rejected in most schools which I really wanted to be a part of. Thus, I didn't apply to any schools that year - more like accepting defeat - and this was a decision which I took given the financial amount one has to shell out for applications. Now, I know that the dream destination is at least one year away and this time I wanted to be better prepared and you know like stay ahead of the usual timelines and thus, started studying for GRE in month of February when I was targetting of giving the exam in July so that I get enough time to write TOEFL and get a good score on the exam - a reasonable decision to take at that time. Starting early did give me motivation to stay on track with GRE prep and always remember the goal in mind. I stayed focused throughout the period and prepared diligently for the exam alongside staying on top of work at ARM as well as pursuing research. It was one of those moments when you see your friends going out to parties and enjoying their lives and you are sitting in the same room working stuff out in the hope of getting a good score in tests. The TEST Day - I tried hard to not bring back any memories of the previous times and went into the exam hall in confidence. I came out of the exam knowing that I had screwed up and will have to give the third attempt. I had atleast hoped that my score will improve by a few points on that day. However, fate had some other thoughts for me. I got the same exact aggregate score of Verbal and Quants which meant that I got less than 170 in Quants as I had a perfect score in the previous attempt. Since the verbal score was so low, below cutoff scores for most programs that I had to really work on improving my English skills needed for the task. I knew that I am not that bad in English as the test portrayed me to be in comparison with others. Thus, with a heavy heart and constantly spending 200$ on an exam I decided to give another attempt in GRE - a third time and this time with even more hours of work put in. GRE Attempt - 3 BIG TIME FAILED as I took break from my office work and used up most leaves granted for 10 days straight in this attempt. Got an improvement of just two points in the GRE exam and mind you all this while my TOEFL exam was getting delayed as it was almost 15th August and I hadn't given an attempt on TOEFL yet. So, I delayed the GRE exam for another attempt post giving the TOEFL exam. It is not that I am a rich person who could afford these many attempts but I had to weight in the risk involved with a failed attempt VS the rewarding experience in later stages. Realizing the mistakes made in past attempts with TOEFL exam. I read up online about how to go about preparing for the exam. Most sources said that Notefull is one of the best preparation material in addition to the official guides from ETS. Hence, I requested a friend of mine to provide access to Notefull as I couldn't afford spending amount on material for the exam. I went into the exam on August 27th fully prepared and was super excited to remove TOEFL off the checklist. TOEFL Attempt 1. First section went well which was the writing section for me. In the second section - Listening section, the audio suddenly went mute, I was in shock as to what happened as the audio clip was running out and there was no sound whatsoever. So I raised hand to call the assistant to help me with the problem since the complete section of audio had run out and it was time for me to answer questions based on the audio. I requested the organizers to check the error and reset back the audio. They restart the system twice, call their software provider and waste 15 mins of time in the middle of an exam where concentration is the key. I somehow kept my calm after the assistant asked me to randomly mark the answers at the moment since they had no control of exam if overall time of 3 hrs and 45 mins runs out and regardless of the section the exam would terminate. Heartbroken, I prayed to the almighty to get me some correct answers out of the randomly marked answers, however the complete section was without audio and out of 30 questions, I was forced to mark 24 based on fluke. I did get 12/30 eventually so some of the 24 fluke I did get them correct. However, coming out of the exam post arguing with the exam organizers and getting an assurance of redemption if I email the ETS company - [which was a painful process as I would have sent about 20 -25 emails exchanges with about an hour speaking with customer center to explain the issue]. With 12/30 on listening, 26 reading, 27 writing and 24 speaking - no schools where I wanted to get in was going to accept me in their program. So I knew now I had GRE attempt 4 and TOEFL attempt 2 to be given. TOEFL Attempt 2 Immediately after going home post failed attempt 1 - with no fault of mine, I was like why this is happening with me and all that sort of things one say to themselves when such event happens. Out of 250 students at that time, two students faced this software bug as it turns out that ETS was upgrading TOEFL software with new way to transmit audio and make their application lightweight. Now this time thinking that I was smart. I decided not to go itself to that center and rather take a new center hoping that it will bring me good luck and with those cliche thoughts - I went ahead and booked TOEFL in a new center. You will not believe - The center this time was small and now in a months period in September it was this centers turn with the new software update. Out of 69 students, I was the only student who was affected with the problem and the assistant there was helpless again. This time though post coming out of the exam with a dismal listening section, I spoke with the members conducting the exam and requested them to call ETS rightaway with the issues faced. It was a Saturday and at 5pm ETS was not reachable and so I was doomed and returned back home - - REALLY REALLY FRUSTRATED this time. Two days went by with the same depressed feeling on what is going on and the WHY ME mentality. I gathered myself seeing the dream goal which seemed like going away at this point of time. GRE Attempt 4 After receiving a score of 92 on the test with 13 in listening section, I wrote the test for the third attempt - again with the same money which I had paid for the first attempt as ETS acknowledged the error and sent a SORRY email which really I didn't care about at that time since their software was the reason for me feeling doubtful and doubting my own abilities. So this time, it was my turn to screw things up in the exam in month of October where I was unable to prepare well for the exam and overall leading to a minor 4 points improvement in the exam. However with 1 point improvement in the Analytical writing section since by this time I had read the GRE official responses atleast 5 - 6 times and written tens of essays in similar lines with efficient practice. My GRE score was still below par but since it was in 320 ball park - the score was acceptable in top universities with exceptional things on other parts of application. I wrote to universities to get a sense of whether my verbal score is acceptable since my Quant score was 169 - sufficient for almost all schools one wants to apply for. Some universities politely asked me not to apply itself as there is a minor chance of consideration of such applications below cutoff. Now I was 1 point below cutoff. That HURTS. However, I thank them today as it saved me application fees :P It was mid- October by this time. Then comes TOEFL another attempt. TOEFL attempt 3 - October 27 By this time my confidence in my abilities had started to diminish and I had to get atleast score of 100 as without that score I will miss applications ending on November 15. So, October end along with a major delivery at ARM, and submission of a research paper [To have strong points on other parts of application], I prepared for TOEFL and went into the exam hoping to clear the bare minimum of 100 points so that I can apply. This time I screwed it up and I sort of knew that I did worse than expected. I waited for 12 days just to learn that my score was 98. Could you believe it? In the meantime of 12 days, I had been to my college to request professors for recommendations and knew that 15th November I was cutting down on the university list. Thus, in desperation of getting positive response from some university on whether they are willing to relax 100 minimum bar requirement for TOEFL, I had to give up on my applications for 15th November for a few universities. This brought a change in my application list - meaning I need to realistically work on which universities is possible to get in and regardless of any matter I knew that I had to apply into CMU as it was my dream college and it is not going to change. One word - MORE work and even less time as TOEFL attempt 4 is pending and CMU looks an even more ambitious goal as I received response from CMU that 100 requirement is sort of mandatory and relaxed in extremely rare cases - which is also mentioned on their website in one corner. TOEFL attempt 4 This time I waited for my salary to come back before booking the next date which turned out to be a huge mistake as November 25th slots were filled. So my last last chance for the year was on December 2nd and I was working hard as crazy at this point of time. Didnt think of anything but just dreamed of CMU and how much getting there meant for me. I worked at office and even slacked at this point with my deliveries. However couldnt slack at lot as I knew that December 7\u201315 I definitely have to slack in office work. My leaves are used up and thus maintained utmost focus in office hours and ensured that within 8 hours all the work was done. Then went back - worked on research work with another publication in mind and TOEFL score, Statement of purpose, creating a website and stayed up late till 3\u20134 am and back to reset next day at 9am with 10 am in office and repeated this for the complete month almost with two days - NO SLEEP. I knew that this was the DO it or GET LOST moment for me from the universities applications and did my best to get a good score in TOEFL. Things went as expected, I still thought that something was missing and was not very happy with the result. However, I knew that 100 will be crossed successfully in the back of my mind. So I gathered myself sending out reminder mails to professors for recommendation, working on the Statement of purpose getting feedback as much as possible and even went to the get external paid support from Admission Table to receive feedback. Frankly, I did get good advice on style of writing and met one of the best persons whom I bonded with advisor at Admission table who gave me advice on NOT to apply to 10 universities in November. His viewpoint - Given the amount of time, don\u2019t spend your time in 10 applications as lets say you have 500 hours and you divide it by 10 you have 50 on one application assuming equal importance as one has to draft Statement of purpose accordingly and catered towards a university. If you apply to only 6 universities - 500/6 -will give you 83 hours. Additional 33 hours which looks like you are adding time to your application and thereby having a much stronger applications. I took the simple math calculation as it made sense as all I wanted to work out was that one application with dream application at CMU. One of my professors told me during the visit - Ankit apply only to those places where you really want to get into. Don\u2019t apply just for sake of applying - You will regret this decision a few years down the line. I consider myself lucky that I got such rich advice and amazing professors who stood by me and provided recommendation letters in time. A big thank you to them for their support. Things did work out as I got well above 100 in TOEFL with 26 in speaking score. Follow great mentors - I am lucky to have few great mentors whom I don\u2019t want to name publicly. I am grateful to almighty for having found them. So NEVER GIVE UP!It was the worst of times and took the best of courage and effort to get out of the situation. After 8 attempts I realized - One thing that always yields results is the ATTITUDE to NEVER GIVE UP and go after your dreams TIRELESSLY. Update: - I wrote this answer to recollect my strengths as I did screw up and didn\u2019t perform to the best of my abilities in the first semester and reminding myself that you have gone through worse times than this - So NEVER GIVE UP. KEEP being the best version of yourself and Go ahead to create your own LUCK. ",

A never give up attitude can be used to quash doubts that you once had and become more confrontational with your fears as opposed to backing off.
