            "answer_text": "A personal poem could be a text that starts with an intro to explain character strengths or flaws or how some relationship developed or give a summary of a person's life or experiences. Conversational style isn't designed for rhymes or exact phrases. So it's a matter of beginning well then maintaining interest yet finishing with a flourish or something intriguing, like maybe this happened next... or maybe not... It could end with something like I learnt a lot and I'll do better next time or I'll never do that again!With rhyming poetry, the lines may be precisely structured or varied to make a more interesting reading experience. If thinking of how a poem gets recited before an audience, then the poet must control phrasing even more, perhaps like a common metre hymn verse of 8-6-8-6 syllables so as to regulate the rhythm.Whatever form is chosen, the poem may rhyme with a typical A-B-A-B verse style or just A-B-C-B when only lines 2 and 4 will rhyme. Furthermore, the number of lines could vary for 2, 4, 6, 8 or maybe 12, 14 or 16. I like 8 lines for my poem verses until trying to share these with others. I may split up the lines to 4 lines at a time then a line gap, thus helping readers. Or join the 4 lines to create A+B then A+B as just 2 lines. Maybe then I will add a line gap to make reading even more easy.For personal poetry, whatever the story idea you have in mind today will be the same tomorrow, or you may have something extra to add. So feel free to revisit previous poems for extras later on when you've got the point of view to enhance something already written, yet not always shared with anyone. Describe the location to indicate the culture and the year to indicate your age and your world view at that time. Or describe a common event people identify with such as school, going to see a film, going on holiday or a necessary visit to a doctor or a dentist. Whatever comes to mind could be altered later to start off a different poem idea.Excessive details don't usually help nut it will help to identify yourself such as male or female, young, mature or older. Your financial status or career may also help. The vocabulary may be spot on or you may wish to simpligy the words to project the idea of being much younger. So even if a pensioner you can project the idea you are a teenager instead. I'll do what I wanna do, when and where I wanna do it, so there... No, Dad, please don't help me with my homework ever again! I'm in enough trouble now...If the poetry is a really serious matter to share, then you must control every single word and create a gentle and sensitive piece or a truly powerful one in accord with your topic. So you can use complicated words if you like or simplify to try to reach a wider family audience.If you are intending to write some kind of If only I'd done things this way, then prove your point of view so you leave no doubt that you could have succeeded after all.If just seeking a funny poem then make sure there are enough things to laugh at or about. Otherwise, go for the surprise ending and hope that's enough. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, a poem says something without outright stating it. A poem doesn\u2019t have to rhyme, and it can be as long or as short as you want. Usually they are very personal. If you want to write a poem, think about how words can describe how you feel, or how you felt once. Some poets write about events and about how they inspired or affected them in some way. You can write about a lost love, a dead family member or a pet even. Just mediate on it. Sit and think about memories and how you place yourself in them. How did you feel when you first started school or fell in love? Can you use words to describe this? What words describe it best? Here is a poem by a deceased poet who was quite talented, Sara Teasdale:  To The Years - Poem by Sara Teasdale To-night I close my eyes and see A strange procession passing me-- The years before I saw your face Go by me with a wistful grace; They pass, the sensitive shy years, As one who strives to dance, half blind with tears. The years went by and never knew That each one brought me nearer you; Their path was narrow and apart And yet it led me to your heart-- Oh sensitive shy years, oh lonely years, That strove to sing with voices drowned in tears.
