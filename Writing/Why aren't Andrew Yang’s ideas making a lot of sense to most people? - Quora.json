BUT everything he said during the debates made sense and seemed practical and constructive. Unfortunately, the press and he, himself, initially spent too much time repeating the $1000/month mantra which may have branded him as simplistic or reductionist to those who didn\u2019t listen critically. I would love to see him as president or veep and I\u2019m going to buy a bumper sticker that says \u201cVOTE YELLOW MENACE!\u201d ",
