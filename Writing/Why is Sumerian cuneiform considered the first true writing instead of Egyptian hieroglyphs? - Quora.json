            "answer_text": "It is a farce that cuneiform is considered such. The first recorded evidence of such claim was in the 17 -1800s, when Sumeria and Egypt writing were dated as having occurred around 3500 - 3000 BCE, both of them. It turns out that that theory was based up Scientific Racism, by racists in Science such as Voltaire, Blumenbach, Carl Leneus, Coon, Alan Gardiner, etc.; though Gardiner has been quoted as stating Hieroglyphics are the origin of Western writing systems. Subjective racists don't like to give due credit to Hieroglyphics, as coming from a purely African source. They even have a tactic of relabeling Hieroglyphics as Semitic (Afri-Asian Origin); though not true and logically impossible for their Origin to be from Asia and Africa at the same exact time. Additionally some argue that Hieroglyphics are not a pure alphabet. Well neither is cuneiform, but they get choked up or lost to avoid answering to that fact. Also they forget that Hieroglyphics dated back to Pre-Dynastic Egypt (4000\u201310,000+ BCE). RACISM in Western Academia is institutionalized, as founded by its racist founders. This needs be addressed and amended by UNESCO and the world to stop confusing people and just tell the truth as facts provide. ",
