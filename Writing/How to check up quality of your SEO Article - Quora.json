            "answer_text": "Your eyes! yes ! your eyes is the best tool to judge the quality of SEO article. Not a single tool can be alternative to your eyes.. Like other, if you think that com-putative tools are enough to check the quality of your article, that will be your wrong concept. What you have to have idea before content analysis.. By using tools, you can know the number of words, readability score, the number of sentence structure, active and passive voice and lots of factors. But you can not judge. You have to check the SEO article both your tool and your eyes. Your eyes and your heart are your priority. By reading content, you can know how trusted content these are , how much engaging the content are. Read more and more. Read every single sentence to know content. Harmony of the expression Coherence is highly important metric of content. Unless you maintain this, you will not be able to retain the readers\u2019 concentration. The ultimate purpose of content is to engage the readers and arise trust in the corner of readers heart. You can not judge the readers coherence using tools, you may judge the number of the transitional words of the content. But judge the quality of content through reading. Introductory intrigues Every SEO article need have the intrigued introductory. If you do not write the intrigued introductory part, it does not full fill the demand of SEO. Even you can not judge this using any tool. You have to read only the content. You must read the content and know the layer of emotion in your content. You have to use the tools for judge the content but nothing is alternative to reading. ",

            "answer_text": "By reading it. Gives you a good sense of how relevant, engaging, and informative the content is. Pass it through copyscape first to check up on plagiarism. In my experience with SEO articles, and when training new content writers, people often pick a single source and rephrase it. Or pick two to three articles, shuffling the points and rephrasing it. Copyscape is good at picking that, unless they\u2019ve rephrased it really well. Reading it yourself is still the best bet. And then doing basic research on the topic and reading up on some articles to see how others have done it. Your working experience with someone also plays role. After a while you can tell, if the content seems just too good and insightful to be from someone. Then you go researching yourself to find the source they\u2019ve duplicated. Warm Regards, ",
