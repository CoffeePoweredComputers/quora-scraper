            "answer_text": "Saw has (at least) two meanings. It is the past tense of see: I saw you. It is a \u201cknife\u201d with serrated edges used to cut (e.g., a wooden board). Now, back to your question. Hey, this board is cut! Did someone saw it? Or perhaps: I heard this strange noise all night. Did someone saw? However, to use saw as the the past tense of see, that sentence (Did someone saw) is not correct. You might say, \u201cDid someone see?\u201d Perhaps, you would say, \u201cSomeone saw (him).\u201d If you were to say \u201cSomeone saw him\u201d, there is the slight problem of interpretation (for a computer, for example). Is that an order for someone to dismember? Or is it a response to the question, \u201cDid anyone see him?\u201d ",
