            "answer_text": "How do I forecast the stock market? Use simple OLS linear regression analysis, scripts to find for free everywhere online. Download historical data from yahoo finance from stocks and indices (Your Yi) Download historical data of macro economic variables (Your Xi).  You are testing whether or not your X's forecast your Y's. You'll get a bunch of results, you probably won't understand.  Explain the basics of what it means that your rsq is so high, what the other tests mean. Like what does a t-stat mean etc. Explain the mathematical principle of including more or less variables in your regression as it will impact your rsq. You, based on your results, can conclude that if you expand your window, your rsq goes down (you don't have to test that, believe me on that), you can then also realize the OLS was useless, and in your conclusion for \u201cfurther testing\u201d you'd require investigation into higher moments of distribution as you can conclude that OLS doesn't work for using variables to forecast stock movement as risk is not two dimensional (mean/variance). Hey ho, what a shock. Ha. If you have time left over, tackle a few typical technical indicators in your X, and test it to smithereens. All technical indicators will yield horse shite results. You can link that to other academic results which got similar stuff. If you have more time left over, you can use hedge fund data (if you can find it) to forecast a Y-variable of your liking. It's easy peasy, as you'll be able to do some cleaning techniques on hedge fund data timeseries. You are basically doing all the basics of a 1\u20132nd yr BSc in Econometrics techniques whilst at your last year at high school. Guaranteed good grade. Well, it worked for me, given i did the above myself, but then at a factor 100 more as I was insanely driven and my thesis as last year student in high school was like the above. I looked it back up recently, I got a 100/100 score on that. I tested literally every technical indicator i could get my hands on, even came up with a way to forecast candle sticks. Don't be like me, but thesis/quantitative research topics for last year secondary school, seniors about \u201chow to beat the market\u201d is often a hit and with a bit of luck (in my case) I covered my entire first year BSc curriculum before I even started university.

            "answer_text": "Stupid. Fifty students each have a sliced piece of Wonder Bread buttered on only one side . They must all be weighed and be within 0.5 gram of the set standard weight . Each student must hold the bread with both hands by the corners using only the index and Thumb fingers very lightly not touching any peanut butter. The bread bottom edge must be held at between 27 to 28 inches above the flat and level floor inside a school auditorium with no wind and no fast air conditioner going. The peanut butter must be held away from the student. The Instructor or leader will stand in the front and middle of the Fifty students in a single line. The leader will call out a count from 10 to Drop instead of the zero. all the Bread on the floor will be photo taken as to how it landed The rules for recording the results will be as follows. flat with the clean bread up side flat with the peanut butter side up bread falls and stays up without falling over for 20 seconds Any bread not flat will not be counted and any bread on its side is not counted. Any bread which has bounced or broken up will not be counted Record each result and calculate the percent that falls with the peanut butter side down. Or up or was mixed result. now repeat this study 5 times. Now repeat this study with the peanut butter facing toward the student. Now repeat all this at a height of 35 to 37 inches from the bottom of the bread to the floor It is allowed to place a plastic sheet taped to the floor to provide for easier clean up. And to eat the study . The head of the study must provide a detailed paper to the School administration detailing the place and the permission to use the school auditorium signed and a discussion of ethical considerations , risks, side effects, and complications, A list of reasons why you did not include students who have only one functioning hand and a full ADA study. You must also have part of the study done with all male students by genetic DNA evidence and Female Students by DNA evidence. If not you must have each student reveal their own Birth Certificate in private to the study administrators. You must have an Ethics committee approve of the study before you do it. Privacy and potential side effects. You may decide that gender means nothing to the study. But are you sure? You must include summaries of any other published studies done regarding this topic . You must include the results of the ethics committee and the signed permission slips for all minors participating in this study . You must disclose the possible side effects and complications such as dirty clothing or having to wash the clothes or extra janitorial work., death , injury , mental illness etc. You must state the type of peanut butter you used and whether the oil was mixed with the peanut butter thoroughly to an outside observer. You may decide a premixed peanut butter is more likely to be uniform study . You must write out before the study your purpose of the study, the theories you may have for any possible result. For example gravity will pull down more on the peanut butter side. ( not sure this is true at all ). Lot of possible variables . We believe that the peanut butter side will almost always fall on the floor first. We believe the gender of the student dropping the bread will make no difference and we believe that the higher elevation may possibly affect the results. We will record the number of breads that did not fall flat on one side or the other. We will suggest our possible reasons for the results we found. We will discuss the complications and suggest possible causes of these complications (. Death may occur secondary to a fall and broken hip and pulmonary embolism. ). We will discuss prior studies that may relate to this study like the history of gravity research and bread making and bread cutting and the history of the use of scales to weigh the bread and the measurements used to insure the dimensions of the bread each within which weight and volume and L x W x D. You may devise any scoring system you may wish to be sure the bread slices are all very similar . Why have you used any particular measurement system. Science usually uses the Metric System. And grams. You must use a statistical analysis to show your results and the pertinent limits . ( plus or minus and a standard deviation ) You must provide your discussion of the results and discuss why you believe these results were expected or not expected. A discussion about further studies you may suggest to improve your study and you must discuss how this study is useful for the human race to record and potentially use. A list of costs and expenses and who funded this study and you must be clear that none of those participating in the study has any financial or other interest in the Peanut Butter company nor the Bread Company You may consider as well based on any results you find further studies to understand what was really going on. For example. What if we used a much thinner bread like Pumpernickel? . What if we used smaller bread like Saltine Crackers? What if we dropped the bread from a roof say 12 feet high or a ladder inside to avoid wind? If there is a gender difference in the results suggest further studies to confirm this or to be sure it is not that the girls are shorter or more accurate or secretly pushing the bread one way or the other. Do males keep laughing and refuse to obey the study rules? Suggest possible investigations as to why students felt the results may be one way or another. Compare the stats of the student opinions before the study to the actual results. Record any illnesses or mental illness that may have resulted from these study results , including sickness leading to hospitalization or death . You must ahead of time state possible lethal side effects and at what point or how many deaths you would tolerate before cancelling the study. Record ahead of time any results that would make you stop the study. ( for example the janitor refuses to help clean this stuff up or the dogs ate all the study material. Ethics question. Why would anyone waste good food to do this study and what if anything could we do to mitigate . Perhaps keep the floor with very clean plastic and eat all the study materials for the poor or to needy students. I hope you can take this study a little seriously despite its seeming silliness as it is really a serious and difficult to do study. It is a decent way to theorize and research prior research and prior scientific understandings. As well you can discuss the students opinions vs the results and discussion of whether this study lead to more investigations . Did this study result in any fights or other mental illness ? If anyone dies in this study will there be a reasonable apology to the family or medical malpractice insurance or will you attempt to cover up these outcomes? Do you think anyone will go to jail or prison for being a part of this study? ",
