            "answer_text": "Brilliant answers are written regarding this topic. However, each one of them is/are missing some point(s). I feel that the most important point, as highlighted by Vennessa Robertson, in Vennessa Robertson's answer to How do I start writing a novel? I have a perfect character and story in my mind. After you have the antagonist, you need to improve your protagonist. You can start with some basic features about his/her height, body shape, build, eye colour, hair colour, face-shape, etc and then you can move on to complex characteristics such as behaviour, faults, certain incidents that changed him/her. You can even observe the traits of real people around you and write it down. Just make sure that your character is not a Mary Sue. (Mary Sue - Wikipedia) After your character is ready, you need to jot down some basic plot events that occur, for example, It is later revealed that AAA was actually killed by BBB, not the accused CCC. You can either have a notepad or a Word Document, but I recommend the latter one, as editing is much more easier. You need to write down every single idea that comes in your mind. Sometimes, ideas will pop up in your mind at the most unexpected times. Some of them will be garbage, and some of them might be exceptionally brilliant, but you need to write all of them, even the garbage ones. And you need to write it down exactly at that moment, because those ideas tend to disappear as quickly as they came. Start writing. Now, it isn\u2019t necessary that you need to start at the beginning. You might start with one small series of events in the story which you are most confident about, and then write about it. Though I would recommend writing in a linear fashion, it is up to you. Once you start writing, don\u2019t stop. Write continuously, furiously, and regularly. Don\u2019t think about content at the first time. Just be sure to write with correct grammar. Decide an aim. Say, 500\u20131000 words per day. Then complete that aim, no matter what. Certain things will help you, such as being in a quiet, peaceful environment, where you feel absolutely comfortable. If you aren\u2019t getting any ideas, put on a pair of headphones, close your eyes and listen to just one of your favourite songs. It may help improve your cognitive function, and more ideas may pop into your head. After you\u2019ve completed one draft, take a step back and pat yourself on the back. Go outside and do something that you enjoy, say a walk in the park, a self-treat, etc. When you come back home, close your document. That\u2019s right. Close it and don\u2019t open it for another month or so. But in the meantime, don\u2019t stop jotting down any new ideas. Don\u2019t think about your novel for the month. The reason behind this is that when you come visit your forgotten novel after a month, you will be able to view it from a completely different angle. Some parts, which before you thought were awesome, will now make you cringe. Think about those parts. reread and review them. Consult your friend/family member and ask them to give their opinion regarding that thought. Sometimes you may have added an unnecessary side-plot. You may have found a plot hole. Some parts might even make slap yourself. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s quite natural. If you feel it is necessary, take drastic measures and rewrite entire chapter(s). The first draft and the final draft can be vastly different. Don\u2019t worry. As long as the final draft is good, it doesn\u2019t matter how much you had to change the story. Sometimes, you think that a certain idea is good, and then you implement it in your novel, only to come back later and find it so shitty that you delete it without a second thought. This all is a process in writing a novel. Last but not the least, always remember that writing a novel isn\u2019t a piece of cake. It requires lots of time, patience, hard-work, dedication, discipline, and regularity. If this is your first time, it may not be that good. Slowly, as you write more and more novels, you get better at it. Not everyone\u2019s debut novel is a hit. If your\u2019s isn\u2019t, don\u2019t lose hope and never give up. If you enjoyed the process of writing, do it again, and again till you have achieved success. Enjoy the process. if it feels like a drudge, take a break. Start writing after a couple of days. Just don\u2019t give up. Happy writing!  Edits are always welcome. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d suggest starting to write in the first person, as your character; have the character tell you about itself, as if you were talking over coffee \u2014 telling you about this thing that happened to them . . . and keep going. Make notes on the side of questions you don\u2019t have an answer to yet (\u201cMy father was a \u2014 bricklayer? Financier? Dragon from the Eastern Isles?\u201d), so that they don\u2019t stop the flow of the story while you figure them out. Keep writing, making no judgments. Just write it down. It\u2019s much better to have *more* first draft than you think you need. You will need lots of revision; everyone does. That\u2019s when you go back and maybe change the story from first to third person; develop other characters that your narrator showed you were important to him/her, and parts of the story that weren\u2019t that apparent or interesting to you at the start. You may find that in fact this isn\u2019t a novel at all, but a shorter story \u2014 a novella, or a even shorter than that. Keep going anyway; the next one may be a novel. This is something I think of as \u201corganic\u201d story writing; it works for me, but it doesn\u2019t work for everyone (well, this is art; *nothing* works for everyone, or it would be engineering instead). The other way, which is what most teachers teach, is construction work, or maybe \u2014 baking: you work up a recipe (blueprint): plot outline, back-stories of all your characters, time-lines of the plot, set-pieces, two hours every morning before everybody else gets up, work til you have a draft, and then you do revisions like everybody else. This method has never worked for me, but it does offer a structure for beginners, and most beginners will need structure at some point in developing their mss. So this is what you\u2019ll find in books about \u201chow to write a novel\u201d. It\u2019s meant to turn you into a publishable commercial novelist, and that\u2019s what most aspiring writers want to become. There\u2019s a third way, of course \u2014 a blending of both approaches, which is what many writers end up with (sooner or later, a big novel is going to need outlining just to keep the story \u2014 \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d, say \u2014 straight; and sooner or later one or more of your characters will become insistent about having their say, because the story needs them to).. Once you have a draft that you\u2019re not embarrassed to show to anyone, start looking around for a \u201cwriters\u2019 group\u201d to join, so you can \u201cworkshop\u201d your story \u2014 see how readers perceive it, what questions they have that your story doesn\u2019t answer, where people find it boring (cut cut cut), where it really takes off for them, etc. In a writers\u2019 group, you do the same for the other members\u2019 works-in-progress. This is how you shape and polish your story into a form that may not be the deeply satisfying way you tell the story to yourself inside your head, but that does make the story not just accessible but *attractive* to potential readers. Then, maybe, you\u2019re ready to self-publish, or take your work to market. If you don\u2019t get to that point, you\u2019ll be a writer \u2014 with pages to show for it. If you get published, IMO that makes you an author, even if it\u2019s only of one story that you\u2019ve learned how to share effectively with strangers. Good luck! ",
