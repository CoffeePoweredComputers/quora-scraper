            "answer_text": "How do you punish an employee for poor performance? Let\u2019s assume \"Poor Performance\u2019 in the question means Unacceptable Performance for the minimum pay range of the job. The more enlightened way to look at it is that an employer and an employee have agreed to a Deal, a Quid Pro Quo, an Exchange of different but equivalently viewed Value, a \"Tit For Tat\". The Deal is: \"I'll give you <this> money, in exchange for you delivering <this> acceptable work.\" Or viewed equivalently from the Employee standpoint: \"I'll give you <this> acceptable work, in exchange for you giving me <this> money\". So the employee/employer arrangement is a freely agreed to exchange of things of Value from each Party - <this> Money/Benefits from the Employer and <this> Results from the Employee. Now stick with me here for an Analogy ... An Analogy Let's say Summer is coming and you'd like to avoid a few backaches (value to you) and your teenager would like to earn a little extra money (value to him), and after going back and forth, you mutually agree that if he mows the lawn this Summer you'll give him $10 per week. And that consistency is important so the lawn reflects good on the family. That's a mutually agreed to Deal. Note that it is an Incentive arrangement - an agreement to an exchange of mutually agreed Value. His effort for your money. Note also that no exchange of Punishments was involved - that's not in the Deal (it could be, but it's not, just like real Work). So if your teenager doesn't consistently mow the lawn, you don't get to additionally Punish him by grounding him for a month or taking away the car keys or whatever ... because that wasn't in The Mutually Agreed To Deal. What you do get to do is bring him in after the 1st time he doesn't mow, explore if there were any mitigating reasons for the non-performance, and advise him he's not living up to his Obligations under the Deal and that if that continues you'll quit paying him and find someone else. And maybe the 2nd time he doesn't mow, you show additional forbearance, but advise him that That Will Be It, and if there's one more miss, he's not living up to his end of the bargain and so The Deal Is Off. I.e., you're Fired. This is how you deal with Unacceptable Performance - whether it's your teenager or an Employee. Back To Reality Similarly, \"Punishment\" terms are not in any (modern) employment deals. So you don't get to \"Punish\" employees for not doing acceptable work. What you do get to do is to hold them Accountable for living up to their end of the bargain by delivering acceptable work consistently and, if they can't or won't, terminating your end of the bargain (employing and paying them). So forget about \"Punishment\". It's about Straight Talk ... The \"Talk\" Many variations, but these are the core Talk points: 1) Your performance is not acceptable; 2) This is serious and will cost you your job if not fixed; 3) There is a deadline - this is not going to go on indefinitely; 4) What can I help with within reason that would help you get back to acceptable performance? Example verbiage: \"You're Not Living Up to Your End Of Our Deal, and if that continues, you'll lose this job because you're not delivering the Value I need for what I'm paying you and what I can generally get on the labor market.\" \"I can't afford for this to go on indefinitely, so I'm setting a deadline of having this permanently fixed by <date> or separating your employment.\" \"So tell me, what can I do to help you fix this before then?\" Give Me Some Consolation 19 times out of 20 an Unacceptable Performer will Never become an Acceptable Performer. Why? Because they were either the wrong hire for the job to begin with or are experiencing Personal Issues they cannot or will not correct within a reasonable time-frame. Acid Test: Do you feel you could hire off the market any number of people who would likely deliver Acceptable Results for the Pay offered? If Yes, then it's The Poor Performer problem to fix, not Yours to make excuses for or tolerate. ",

            "answer_text": "By letting them know what they did and how they can do better to achieve something big in their life. Play with their minds to make them feel energetic and help them to focus more on their work. Be honest, ask them reason behind poor performance and how they can improve themselve to connect with your firm. Some employees trying hard but didn't get to end task, you can use that energy by providing other or different tasks to distract for a while and again suggest them to work on same task until they finish that. Suggest them something or other employees to follow them or their ways of working to improve in performance. Guide them before they get misguided by others. Ask them if they really have interest in work or not, give few days rest if possible or in last ask them to find another job if didn't see any improvement but in last. Talk politely because no one knows when both of you will face each other and in what condition. ",
