            "answer_text": "Writing an essay is a mentally stimulating process. You first gather all the information you need. Then you work on a good opening statement, which you will support with your information. And then you arrange your information in a manner that explains your stand. You will learn a lot about the subject while digging for information. And the process of putting that information in a logical sequence will help you have a better grasp at what you have come to know. You will struggle with the writing process. You will have to pick the right phrases, choose the right words, avoid jargon and take care to explain what you know in the best way possible. You will have to write to express and not to impress. All of this requires much time and effort. And then you need to revisit your work. Keep your essay aside for some time, and go back to it later. You will find a lot of screws that need tightening up here and there. Get them in place. Do not be discouraged if you end up having to rewrite your whole essay. You will only have gained a lot more insight into the writing process by the end of it. Writing is a beautiful process. I personally like essays because they allow you to work so hard on a piece of a limited length. ",
