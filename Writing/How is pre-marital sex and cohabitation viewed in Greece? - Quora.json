            "answer_text": "In general, premarital sex and cohabitation are viewed in Greece as either natural or a necessary evil. Of course, generalising can only get you so far. Most people that are opposed to them, especially to premarital sex are likelier to belong in one of the following categories: Very religious, attending church regularly and taking sin seriously. A small minority in Greece.Very conservative, which usually goes with religious. Older generations are usually more conservative.Living in rural areas. Even when not conservative or religious, some people in rural areas might pretend to be against such things in order to avoid being the subject of gossip from the rest of the small community. In practice, what happens in the barn stays in the barn, or at least that\u2019s the plan.But even the categories mentioned above have fallen for what I like to call the \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d of relationship statuses: being engaged. Do this and suddenly cohabitation is socially acceptable by all but the strictest religious zealots. And of course, premarital sex is technically OK, as long as you manage to \u201cclimb the church steps\u201d or at least see the mayor before having to pay a visit to the maternity ward. During the past few years, the economic realities of youth unemployment and low salaries, have made cohabitation an increasingly attractive option for young couples that cannot yet afford to get married, especially for those living in the cities.
