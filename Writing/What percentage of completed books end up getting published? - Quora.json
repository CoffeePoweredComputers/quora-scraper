We can\u2019t look on everybody\u2019s hard drive or in the bottom drawer of their desk to find completed, yet unpublished manuscripts. Toss out any number you want. I do know the percentage of books published is higher since the development of easy-to-use self-publishing methods. Ebooks also upped the published percentage since the cost is nil. You want your own book published? Then do it. 100% guaranteed to be sent out to the public for purchase. That doesn\u2019t mean anybody will buy it, of course. ",
