            "answer_text": "When writing a book series, how do you decide when to end one book and start the next? Unless you are really experienced and already know (approximately) how long it will be, better to write until the end. You have to find spots that become \u201ccandidates\u201d for break points. You will then need to modify scenes to create a \u201ctail out\u201d section for the end of one book. Then modify the opening scene of the next book so it all feels planned out. Your goal, is to make next book somewhat accessible to a reader that has not read the first book. I generally do a \u201cwhat has come before\u201d kind of section that summarizes the previous book. This is a tactic to encourage re-reading. As a general rule, when a book starts getting over 100k words I start looking for places to break it.  ",

            "answer_text": "It would depend on the type of series you\u2019re writing. In a series like The Dresden Files, The Southern Vampire Mysteries, or Dan Brown\u2019s Robert Langdon books, each book has its own distinct plot. There\u2019s a beginning, middle and end of each mystery Harry Dresden or Robert Langdon investigates. Even if there\u2019s an overall plot arc that takes place over multiple books, the plot of each book is distinct and it\u2019s easy to see where the story starts and stops. In other series, there may be a natural break point. Like Harry Potter has a new book for each school year, or The Hunger Games first two books break after that year\u2019s game. In others, where the story of each book is more entangled, you have to find that break point. The Fellowship of the Ring ends when the Fellowship breaks up. A Game of Thrones ends with major turning points for Ned Stark, Daenerys and Jon Snow that are going to change the entire direction of their stories. Each book has its own internal arc that serves the larger story. ",
