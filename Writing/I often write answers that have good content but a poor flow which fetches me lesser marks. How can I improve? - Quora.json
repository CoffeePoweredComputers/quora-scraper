            "answer_text": "To train yourself on how to write better answers to questions that readers can enjoy and understand, consider the information as though you are writing a script for a radio commercial. You have 30 secs to get your message across in a way that absolutely anyone can understand it and you have 75 words with which to do it. Most people speak a lot better than they write so record what you want to say and then transcribe it. Hearing the playback while you're transcribing gives you a chance to identify where things are unclear, and where you need to add information. Once you're done, record it again then listen to the playback so you can fine tune it. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, I had the same problem few years back! Outlines Practice writing outlines. These are main points and a few sub-points about the question asked.  Consider: How to humans respire?Answer outline:1. Intro to respiration2.Gases involvedSubpoint: Oxygen inhaled, CO2 exhaled.3. Extra statistics of respirationSub-point: Respiration rate with respect to ageSub-point: Respiration rate with respect to work-rate Make sure you do not write any answer without an outline (during your preparation).Gradually, this will become your way of study, and taking mental notes too. It is a better and efficient way to not only have a flow to your writing, but have a flow to your learning and thoughts as well. Cheers. ",
