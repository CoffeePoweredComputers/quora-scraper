            "answer_text": "What are you trying to say? These sentences are both correct in different circumstances. You would say \u201cWhat an idea.\u201d if you wanted someone to know you thought an idea was very good or very crazy. A: \u201cLet\u2019s go to the ice cream store and taste every flavour.\u201d B: \u201cWhat and idea. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d or A: \u201cI think it should be illegal to own pets.\u201d B: \u201cWhat an idea! Why would you want that to be a law? You\u2019re crazy. The sentence \u201cWhich idea?\u201d is just asking for someone to pick an idea or to be reminded about an idea. A: \u201cWe have a lot of good ideas for the next story. Which idea do you like best?\u201d or A: \u201cI think his last idea was the best one.\u201d B: \u201cWhich idea was that? Remind me.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "First a few corrections. \u2018What an idea\u2019 is an exclamatory sentence, so it should be written as: What an idea! The second one \u2018which idea\u2019 is not a sentence, but you can frame a question sentence like: Which idea did appeal to you most? I hope this helps. ",
