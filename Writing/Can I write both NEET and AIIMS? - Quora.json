            "answer_text": "Yes, Ofcourse you can write NEET as well as AIIMS both in the same year. Because their is no such eligibility criteria that if you have filled the NEET form then you can't apply for it. Don't worry just go for it. And both the exams have separate dates Neet usually conducts its examination on the first sunday of May and Aiims usually conducts its examination in the last week of May. And not to forget the most important thing you should be able to fulfil the eligibility criteria for the particular examination. Just go through the eligibilty criteria once before applying for a particular exam. Thank you ",
