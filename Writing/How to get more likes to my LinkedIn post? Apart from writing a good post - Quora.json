            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re at all familiar with LinkedIn, you know that it\u2019s a network built on connections. When someone in your network interacts with a piece of content on the platform, you\u2019re likely to see that show up in your feed. As is true with most social networks, the content with the most engagement are going to show up at the top of people\u2019s feeds. The more likes, comments and shares an article has, the more exposure it\u2019s going to get from the LinekdIn algorithm. So, how do you get more likes to your LinkedIn post? Leverage An Existing Audience The key to this step is giving people a reason to help you out. I don\u2019t have a massive email list, but I know they love Amazon gift cards so I made things simple. I told my audience that if they liked and commented on the article, they would be entered to win one of four $10 Amazon gift cards. Around 210 of them clicked the link in the email. Let\u2019s say that 75% followed the instructions. That lands me ~158 likes and comments. Definitely enough to get started, but only a tiny fraction of the eventual 3,500 people who would interact. If you don\u2019t have an online audience, put together a list of 50 people in your network who might be willing to help you out. Hold a raffle like I did, or offer to buy them a cup of Starbucks. You\u2019d be surprised at how many people will be willing to help with a small task if you ask them directly. Timing Is Everything When posting your article, you want to make sure you hit the target audience at the right time. According to LinkedIn Marketing Solutions, the best times to post on LinkedIn are: Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday between the hours of 7:30am\u200a\u2014\u200a8:30am, 12pm, 5:30pm\u200a\u2014\u200a6:30pm. Get help from service provider Another kind of strategy that you can used, get LinkedIn post likes from service provider \u2014 reliable service provider would be better \u2014 so that your post with more likes can appears higher on followers news feed, search and suggested results on LinkedIn. From that, you can show people that your LinkedIn post is popular & get more people to like, read and share it.  Wrapping Up Content marketing isn\u2019t an easy game. There are so many articles, info grahics, and social media posts out there, it can feel like you\u2019re playing a losing game. This step strategy will help your LinkedIn posts spread like wildfire. Good luck. ",
