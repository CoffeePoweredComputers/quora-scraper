            "answer_text": "Great question, an important one for poetry, my genre. (Regret I'm not equipped to opine on prose fiction.) Building a poem requires two skills: a prophetic first-draft voice, followed by editoral text revisions of an analytic nature. FIRST DRAFT MATERIAL By this I mean that which is inscribed by an author for the first time. It could be a sentence, a stanza, a complete poem \u2026 even a single word. If it's the first time you've written it down, it's First Draft material. ANALYTIC EDITING OF POEMS While First Draft verse can be, and often is, entirely irrational, the edits to such material must be made in a rational way. This because the goal of an Editor is to make first-draft inscription more easily accessible, more engaging, and more beautiful to those who encouter it \u2014 whether by the reading of, listening to, or watching the text performed. In first-draft writing a poet expresses herself. In editing she clarifies what she's expressed by assuming the perspective of her audience. Both approaches \u2014 the subjective and the objective \u2014 are required to complete a successful poem. CHANGING THE POV The simple & easy way to control overuse of a first-person voice in first-draft composition is to change the pronoun during edits. \u201cI\" becomes she \u2026 or he \u2026 or they \u2026 or it \u2026 whatever! An author can never be her own protagonist, because an author is a human being, while characters on a page are composed. All creative writing is, for this reason, fiction. ~~ It's the writing that's important, not its author. When the time arrives for edits, divorce yourself from the First Draft text, and regard it as a stranger might. Change the \u201cI\" pronoun into someone who isn't you \u2026 everywhere it seems appropriate and necessary. (Indeed, a First Draft \u201cI\" can be many different characters within a given text: this is how dramatic dialog is written.) Your only responsibility as an author of fiction is to engage your audience from the first word of the title through the final word of the text. Whatever it takes. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, it can hardly be a surprise \u201cI\u201d appears a lot in first person narratives that center on yourself. There are, of course, first person narratives that focus on other people or on things or events. I think the problem is not so much using \u201cI\u201d as in repeating words (like \u201cI\u201d) and structures, something commonly considered bad style. I would begin by avoiding beginning a lot of sentences with \u201cI\u201d even if it just means moving the \u201cI\u201d further into the sentence. Rework your sentences so you can use \u201cme,\u201d \u201cmine,\u201d \u201cmyself,\u201d or \u201cwe.\u201d Add more descriptive material which will generally be \u201cit\u201d based. Take a look at famous first person narratives. ",
