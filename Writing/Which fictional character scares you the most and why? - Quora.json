Well, I don\u2019t give a crap what you think about it. Face it, you\u2019ve probably read a kids book as an adult before). So, hes this Irish criminal mastermind. Whose mind far surpasses that of a lot of human beings, save, Einstein or Mozart. But he\u2019s pretty high up on the scale. Now, you\u2019re probably thinking \u201cCmon, Alan! He\u2019s a 12 year old who can\u2019t run a fast mile and is just really smart. You shouldn\u2019t be scared of him, one bullet from your Ruger Precision Rifle will drop him!\u201d Yes. I get that, Artemis Fowl, even though he\u2019s a smart boy, is still a boy. But did I mention he managed to uncover a whole world of fairies living underground? And has friends among the highest ranks of their law enforcement agency? And, not to mention, Butler?  So tall he makes pro wrestlers cry mama. He even took on a fucking troll (if you don\u2019t know, here\u2019s a comparison: Take the most OP weapon in a game and multiply its stats by 10. You\u2019re almost there, but not quite) and won!   (I mean, well he kinda got his ass kicked at first but he got healed). By the time I pulled the trigger on my Ruger Precision Rifle Butler will likely have replaced the ammunition with troll shit months ago, before I even conceived the idea of killing Artemis Fowl. And I\u2019ll slap the magazine, wondering what the hell is wrong, and he\u2019ll tap my shoulder and say \u201canything wrong, Alan?\u201d before squishing my head between his meaty hands. And thats just Butler\u2026 Artemis would probably be able to get into my computer and (since he holds several advanced psychology majors under assumed names) slowly mess with my computer, gaslighting me into going slowly crazy. Don\u2019t mess with that kid\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm... Well, there are certainly some great answers already (considering that several of the previous answers/characters scared the living daylights out of me growing up). However, I'm going to mention a character that really did scare me the most and who no one has has thought of. So, here goes... The archangel Gabriel (played by the great Christopher Walken) in 1995\u2032s The Prophecy. Omg, that film and it's character Gabriel, gave my countless nightmares as a child. Every single time I watched it (especially at night) I had to sleep with my nephew right next to me because I was afraid of being alone which he hated of course. There are a number of things that made Gabriel (and several other characters in the film as well) scary. First and for most, I found the religious aspect (I was a very spiritual child and highly sensitive to anything religion related) and narrative of the film to be quite disturbing. The cold, sarcastic, evil, and diabolical nature of Gabriel (which Walken portrayed wonderfully) struck me. And of course Gabriel\u2019s intent and plans (which was to steal the soul of the most evil person in the world and then to have him lead the fallen angels in a war against God and all mankind and thus literally creating hell on earth) didn't help matters any. The fact that Gabriel (and all the others angels also) had black eyes in his natural state and sat kind of like a vulture on chairs (if you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about) kind of weirded me out. I also found the way in which Gabriel killed other angels (by literally ripping their black hearts out which of course was also the only way to kill Gabriel) unsettling. And then there were the scary special powers that Gabriel possessed including the ability to bring people back to life temporarily as ghouls and set people/angels on fire. And finally, Gabriel's look certainly (with the ashen almost translucent skin and black hair and nails) added to my discomfort. All and all, the turning of a sacred (and purely good) archangel into a crazed and evil demon-like creature and/or character intent on bringing about the apocalypse and destroying mankind was extremely uncomfortable/off-putting for me. That said, after seeing the film enough times the fear went away, and ironically, the film (including Gabriel himself) has become one of my absolute favorites. Honorable mentions: Most of the characters in 1995\u2032s film Tales From The Hood (especially Mr. Simms, Martin Morehouse, and the African/Slave Killer Dolls). The demons in the Demon Night film also a 1990s film from Tales of the Crypt. The character Flag in Stephen King's film The Stand. I hope that answers your question:) ",
