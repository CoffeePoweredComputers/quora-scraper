            "answer_text": "Hello, the answer to your questions depends on the type of writer you are aspiring to become. Even though the opinions of established writers and/or creative writing courses coaches might (and do) vary, I\u00b4d say, having studied some theory, it is best to start writing the genre you want to focus mainly on and write regularly and a lot.  As some of the people who have answered before me claim, it is important to note that a short story and a novel are two very different genres. I am making generalizations, but you should keep in mind that in a short story, every single word (or sentence at least) matters much more than in a novel. Since a short story is so short :), everything put in there must be justified perfectly and fit perfectly. On the other hand, the novel can have at least some degree of unimportant stuff, however, it is more difficult to handle strucutre-, plot- and character-development-wise.  If you don't know yet what you would like to write and what would be better for you, I emphatically suggest starting off with short stories, because they are shorter, which makes them suitable for your purposes in several points: 1. I t takes you less time to produce one, i.e. you can write more in the same time as, for example, writing one novel.2. This means you can be more flexible in your style, themes, etc. and can do more experimentation.3. This means you can submit more and more diverse pieces to potential publishers and find out where your strenghts might be and what might be potentially attractive to the publishers. 4. You wont get disappointed so easily after being refused, since you might have some other stuff to submit or at least it would not take you so much time and effort to write some more5. As I have written, since the short story is shorter and everything in there must be perfectly justified, it trains you to hande your writing seriously, to consider every word and thus perfecting your style, it makes you think very carefully about your plot, theme, characters etc. It simply doesnt let you do what you really cannot affort if you want to become successful (and good, which isnt always the same) writer, and it is quite \"strict\" with you. 6. It requires less characters, plot twists, settings, etc., so even if it is very difficult to handle them all properly, the big plus is that you dont have that much to handle at the same time, and can gradually progress from less to more.  Hope this hints help. ",

            "answer_text": "Short stories. You will be able to practice your style without feeling the burden of a years-long product that may fail. (That is simple statistical reality; few people write a publishable novel the first effort. ) As you get better, and come up with new ideas, you get to start fresh, not saddled with your earlier mistakes. It\u2019s easier to get meaningful feedback from friends. It\u2019s easier to stay inspired because each new story is a new voyage of discovery. A story can be any length it needs to be; you won\u2019t go crazy trying to figure out how to add or subtract 20,000 words to your precious creation just so you can call it a \u201cnovel\u201d Most important, you will get the positive reinforcement of seeing a finished project in a relatively short time. Sitting down every day to work on a project where you won\u2019t see the end product for a year or more can sap the most determined spirit. Short stories are easier to sell than novels. There are magazines in every genre, contests galore to be found on Google. Write something good and you might see it in print in the near future. Write a novel\u2026 well, read other threads for discussions on how hard that is to sell. Lastly, other answerers are correct. Short stories *can* be harder to write than novels, in terms of style. Your writing has to be clean and comprehensible, Every word has to count. Every scene must have purpose. A novel can have a few paragraphs bloated with excess verbiage and the world won\u2019t end, but that will strangle the life out if a story. Those all involve important skills for a writer to master. Any writer. I recommend to every aspiring novel that they write a few short stories at least before tackling the Great American Novel. ",
