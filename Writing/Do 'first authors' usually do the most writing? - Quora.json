I was the second named author on my first book and did most of the writing. But my coauthor was much better known and supplied most of the ideas. I was the first author on my second book because by then my name was more well known (because the first book had been a bestseller). We split the writing evenly. I was the the second of three author names on my third book. We all contributed; I did most of the writing. I have ghostwritten two books last year and of course my name is smaller than the authors for whom I was writing the book. Don\u2019t assume \u201cwriting\u201d = \u201cthe work.\u201d Do not assume assume that the first author did most of the work of any kind. The choice of whose name goes first is a marketing choice or driven by politics, and may not reflect at all how the book got written. ",
