            "answer_text": "I think it really comes down to personal preference. And my preference is that I hate infodumps. I\u2019ve read only one author who actually got me interested in infodumps, and that\u2019s H. Beam Piper explaining how the Ullerites work in Uller Uprising. Apart from that, my preference, both when I read and write, is to integrate details as they become relevant in the story. And once in a while, go into a expositional tangent no longer than a paragraph if it helps establish the feel of the world, even if it doesn\u2019t directly drive the plot. However, that\u2019s what I put on the page. But I generally establish the rules of magic, super-science, or whatever, before I start writing. I do this to maintain internal consistency. And before I introduce a new idea I thought of six chapters in, I can consult my notes and see if I\u2019m contradicting myself now. If not, it\u2019s good. If so, I need to decide if it\u2019s worth doing the necessary rewrites of earlier chapters. The thing is, as the author, you will know more than ever makes it onto the page. But many authors give into the temptation to show off all that worldbuilding with long boring info-dumps. But we as readers don\u2019t need to know that. We don\u2019t need to see your world vivisected before our eyes. If it works, makes sense, and is internally consistent, then we will be able to tell that there are bones and sinews beneath the skin of your story. For example, you don\u2019t need the entire background on how the intersection of the internet and magic gave rise to net-spirits, you just need to know that Selena the tech-witch uses them. Several stories later, you need to know that they don\u2019t really understand the outside world, so while they\u2019ll gleefully do as Selena asks, they sometimes return unusual results. Like when she asked them to retrieve a video file in a computer that was air-gapped, and she didn\u2019t know the exact file name, they returned every single scrap of video file on that computer including all the porn.  Original question-Fantasy book series: Would it be better to establish the world and magic system in the first book and explore the minor details as the story needs them or to establish a little bit of the magic system and world throughout all the books?

There isn\u2019t a single answer to this question. Some works of fiction attempt to explain the world\u2014and hence the magic that is part of it\u2014in exposition or de facto exposition, whereas others take the approach of revealing it in dialogue and plot points. Sometimes, stories demand to be told in certain ways. Whichever approach makes the most sense for the story being told is the best approach. If it doesn\u2019t serve the story being told, it probably doesn\u2019t belong in the story. ",
