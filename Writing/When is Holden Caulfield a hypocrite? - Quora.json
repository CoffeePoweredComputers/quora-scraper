            "answer_text": "Holden is a \u201chypocrite\u201d when he makes up stories about himself and pretends to be someone he isn't. He constantly criticizes members of society for being \u201cphonies\u201d but he behaves similarly by lying to others. However, this hypocrisy is more than just an oversight on Holden\u2019s part. It is an indictment of society, since they completely buy Holden\u2019s lies if they're in the realm of reason. It's an example of people seeing things their own way versus how they really are. ",
