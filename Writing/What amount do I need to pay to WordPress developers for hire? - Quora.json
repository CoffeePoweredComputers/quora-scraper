            "answer_text": "As a WordPress web developer, many of us never quote what we think the client can afford, we quote what the real amount is, and are never afraid to quote high. We\u2019re often a one man show, and need to pay rent and put food on the table. You can expect to pay anywhere between $30 to $90 an hour. The average rate is usually around $50 an hour. It really depends on the scope and scale of the project. It also depends on what you need. Some agencies can pump out a website in under a week, others take months. Paying more and waiting longer is certainly worth it when it comes to quality, as websites made in a week are filled to the brim with typos, coding errors and crappy design. Web Development agencies provide quotes. So get as many quotes as you can and compare them all. With web developers, It very much helps to hire local web developers who are close to you, as you can talk to them face to face, and you both understand each other. You\u2019d be surprised how many web developers you can find in the middle of nowhere! Let me tell you know - If you go over the original scope throughout the project, you can expect to pay a lot more! This is known as scope creep, and web developers absolutely hate it, so we almost double our rates. That\u2019s the truth. Many agencies will try to push there \u201ccost effective\u201d or \u201cbudget\u201d services, but the real price could shock you. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is like asking: I'm looking to buy a car, how much will it cost? Just like with a car, it will depend on exactly what you want to web developer to do\u2026 what other things that need to be solved that you may not have thought about.. and the overall skill level of the developer. With more experienced develop their costs will be higher, however in the long run they are far FAR cheaper as you get a far better development from them\u2026 For example let's say you just wanted a 5 page brochure style website.. An ametuer developer (which is 90% of them and easily the most likely you will get access to)!would probably charge \u00a3500 An experienced developer would probably charge \u00a33000 for the same site.. However the work will be 100 times better, the website won't be full of viruses, will have a bespoke design tailed to your brand, it will rank in search engines, provide a better experience for your users, do what it's supposed to.. etc etc\u2026 However if this same site needed something really complex, the price could easily be \u00a330,000 or even \u00a3300,000 Anyone who just pulls a price out of thin air, or has set prices, or gives you a price without a 100% detailed spec of exactly what you need, should be avoided like the plague as this is a clear indication they don't know what they are doing ",
