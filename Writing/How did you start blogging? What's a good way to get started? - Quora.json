            "answer_text": "A good way to get started with a blog is to choose a topic you would like to blog about. Once you decide, you can purchase a domain name and hosting, and build a website. If you don\u2019t want the trouble of building your own site, you can get started more quickly by signing up for an account with HubPages. This is a blogging site which offers free hosting and you can write on the site for free. There are a couple of downsides to using a free hosted site: Your content doesn\u2019t rank on Google - Most free hosting sites don\u2019t get ranked on the search engines so their traffic is limited to the hosting community where your content is posted. You can still share content and connect with other members though to build up your following.Your affiliate links are limited - Monetising your content can be done with advertising or affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing is commonly used by bloggers to monetise their content. With free hosting sites, the products you can link to (with affiliate links) can be limited.So it\u2019s much better to build your own website and get your own hosting if you eventually want to monetise your blog. Start by getting into a habit of blogging regularly and sharing your blog on social media. You can also get a plugin which will help you write SEO (search engine optimistation) friendly blogs which should help you get more search traffic. See Niche Blogging For Profit for more info. ",

            "answer_text": "good way to get started is to jump right in. Buy a domain, pay for hosting, and within 1\u20132 hours, you can post your first thoughts on whatever subject you know. If you blog, then you are sharing your thoughts, but most people don\u2019t want to read someone\u2019s personal diary unless it offers something of interest or value to them. For the most part, blogs are used to sell things, but not in a spammy sort of way. You must create some form of entertainment or educational material. And embedded within your content can be a brief and unobtrusive way to recommend a paid product. This is what it means to be an affiliate marketer. It\u2019s how you make money from blogging. But the act of blogging, of writing and publishing onto the web, begins with a simple post through a website. You can start with Wordpress. ",
