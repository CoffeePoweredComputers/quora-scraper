For example, here\u2019s a few of my dramatic diary endings: The greatest risk of them all is not taking one. (I\u2019m so proud of this one. I actually sound wise lol)I like salad only because I can put a crap load of blue cheese. All I want to taste is blue cheese. Nothing else.Another reason I like salad is because it reminds me of the truth. The gross green leaves is the truth. The blue cheese is the lies.And all people what to hear is lies. Just because its easier to believe.You can play with fire, but remember that you are flammable too.Hope this helps! -Tempest ",
