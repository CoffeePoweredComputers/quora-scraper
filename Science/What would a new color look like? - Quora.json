            "answer_text": "sorry to say, but \u201cnew colors\u201d don\u2019t get created. Unless our eyes somehow magically get better, you won\u2019t be able to see any new colors. All the colors in the visible spectrum are what you can see. Some animals see more colors than we do maybe, and many animals see way less. But even with the amount of colors we can see, there are 16,777,216 colors that your computer can differentiate. Your eye can see even more than that. Take time to appreciate the beautiful colors we already have. Studying color theory is really amazing actually. Learning how light bounces off object and each object\u2019s color affects the color of the objects around it as well is pretty cool. But anyway, yeah, colors are in a way limited. ",

            "answer_text": "We have no real way of knowing. Color exists only as a construct of a given visual system; we don\u2019t know for certain that, for instance, the color that we both call \u201cred\u201d causes the same perception in my mind that it does in yours. (We believe it does, because there\u2019s no good reason to think otherwise, but we can\u2019t really say that we know for certain.) There are a few humans who have four types of color receptors rather than the normal three; they seem to be able to distinguish shades that the rest of us see as being identical, but we have absolutely know way to know just what the world actually looks like to them.
