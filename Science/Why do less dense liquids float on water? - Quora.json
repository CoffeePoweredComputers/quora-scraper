            "answer_text": "When any material is placed on a volume of water that is much larger than the material being placed on it, the material which is less dense than water will displace the amount of water equal in weight to the material placed on it. If the material is a liquid such as an oil it will displace only 80% of its own volume. Because that leaves 20% above the water the oil will spread out until it becomes one molecule thick. At this thickness it will still have 20% above the water surface. I have stated that oil is only 80% of the density of water. This may not be accurate but is sufficient for this explanation. Many years ago when I discovered liquers I also discovered that the alchohol content varied enough to allow different liquers to float on each other, and when poured carefully into a tall glass in the correct order you could have a rainbow liquer. This discovery had been previously discovered by the barman at the hotel in Jersey where we were ataying. Quite attractive and very potent.It is the same principle for all things that float. This was first discovered by Archimedes way back in 210 BC. Look him up in Wikipedia. A solid block of steel will sink, but a steel hull ship will float because it has a large space within it that is filled with air and therefore the amount of water displaced by the overall weight of the ship is not enough to swamp the ship, and thus it floats.

            "answer_text": "Less dense materials occupy more volume than equal weight of water. This is by definition: density. Let's start with this. When this object is placed in water, it displaces some water. The amount of water displaced must be exactly equal to the volume of the object that's submerged under water. Due to the density difference, one can conclude that the weight of the water displaced is greater than the weight of the object below the water line. What happens when something heavier ends up being on top of something lighter? It has a higher potential energy. The combined system will attempt to dissipate the potential energy by reversing the situation. The heavier water will try to go under the object, thereby pushing the object to float on the water surface. That's simply why less dense materials float on water. Minimum energy state. ",
