            "answer_text": "Are there any objects in space that are completely flat, or is it not possible? The ISS\u2019s solar panels are pretty flat.  As for natural objects, you\u2019d need to find a way to make them flat. When objects get above a certain size gravity overcomes material strength and compresses them into a round object. So, you need smaller objects, under a few hundred kilometers diameter to avoid rounding. Asteroid 101955 Bennu, currently visited by OSIRIS-REx, is small enough not to round itself into hydrostatic equilibrium with gravity (though it is round-ish). In fact, the asteroid is quite tiny. However, a look at its surface shows another issue: natural processes don\u2019t make small objects flat. In fact, they make them look like a pile of rubble. And the chunks of rubble have no mechanism to flatten themselves. They get irregularly flaked and cracked by solar heating and cooling, and dinged and dented by micrometeorites. They coalesced from bits of dust blown out by a supernova, and never really had a chance to flatten.  Sedimentary processes under gravity can produce flat-ish layers, though on a larger scale they\u2019ll still follow the curve of the Earth and local geological processes, which might add all sorts of curves.  So you might get flat bits like shale:  Shale, along with other locally flattened rocks like basalt from lava flows, can turn up on multiple planets. But you wouldn\u2019t see an entire asteroid or planet that was flat. (Gale crater on Mars: some flat shale and mudstone.)  Saturn\u2019s moon Pan gives an old college try at being flat. It orbits in the Encke Gap of Saturn\u2019s rings, collecting ring dust around its equator. That process could continue for a while, but you can see that the dust isn\u2019t accumulating evenly and the core (~14km radius) is round-ish. If you extended loose piles of dust like that to make Pan larger and flatter then you\u2019d see dust slides to round off the moonlet. (Dust/debris slides have been spotted on even smaller comets and asteroids. Gravity starts trying to round things even at small scales. Everything wants to drop to a minimum energy state.)  So a totally flat natural object is improbably. You\u2019d need artificial intervention. ",

            "answer_text": "How powerful is the resolution of your microscope? If you view a sheet of graphene using an electron microscope, it will appear to us as completely flat, but that is made by humans, not nature and you asked about objects in space (unless you send some graphene up there ;-). The notion of flatness is a product of the human imagination. Physical reality shows us countless examples of curvature everywhere, especially elliptical orbits, parabolic \u201cfly-bys\u201d, geometry of mass aggregates (the larger they are, the rounder their surfaces, sort of). When asked about flatness in nature, crystals are often cited as an example, however, on closer inspection, the molecules of crystals are not perfectly aligned with each other, so it is really a matter of viewing resolution. I think this question is more than just amusing; it calls attention to a fundamental aspect of physical reality which in turn calls attention to how our imaginations work to interpret our perceptions of that reality, and thus the concept of flatness emerges, which highlights curvature in contrast to our concept of flatness. Now the question is, which condition dominates our visual imagination as we then go on to think about the geometry of physical reality in the contexts of very large and very small scales. It appears that flatness is regarded as the norm and curvature a departure from that norm, whereas in reality it is the other way around, and that profoundly affects how we regard physical reality.
