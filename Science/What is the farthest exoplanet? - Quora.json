            "answer_text": "Based on current evidence, most stars in the universe have planets in orbit around them. So there isn't any one \"farthest exoplanet\" - there are planets everywhere, although we can't observe most of them. Even \"what is the farthest known exoplanet?\" is a question without a unique answer. The quasar QSO 0957+561 is gravitationally lensed from our perspective due to an intervening galaxy. A fluctuation in the quasar's brightness seen in 1996 might have been due to a 3-Earth-mass planet in the lensing galaxy passing through our line of sight. That planet would be 4 billion lightyears away from here. But there's no way to confirm that the fluctuation was indeed due to a planet. Similar microlensing monitoring projects of the Andromeda Galaxy suggest planets in orbit around stars there, 2.4-2.6 million lightyears away from here. Follow-up observations to confirm those planet candidates are not currently possible, although given a couple of decades and significant investment in specialized astronomical hardware they might become so. The farthest-away exoplanets that have been discovered and had that discovery confirmed are currently OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb , which is 21.5 \u00b1 3.3 thousand lightyears away, and SWEEPS-11 and SWEEPS-04 at 22 \u00b1 5 thousand lightyears. BLG-390Lb is about 5 times the mass of Earth, and was discovered and verified by gravitational microlensing measurements. SWEEPS-11 and SWEEPS-04 are super-jovian planet discovered because they transit the stars they orbit as seen from here. At the moment, the distances to those three planets and the stars they orbit are uncertain enough that we can't say which is the most distant from us (although BLG-390Lb is most likely closer to us than the other two, that's not definite at this time). The Gaia spacecraft is now obtaining data to get much better distances to as many stars in the galaxy as possible, and should resolve the ambiguity. But by the time Gaia has finished its survey, there will probably be new distant exoplanet discoveries to consider. ",

Currently, that title goes to a gas giant about 13,000 light years away from Earth, a NASA telescope has co-discovered one of the most distant planets ever identified: a gas giant about 13,000 light-years away from Earth. [See Newfound Alien Planet Is One of the Farthest Ever Detected ; Newfound Alien Planet Is One of the Farthest Ever Detected]  NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope co-discovered an exoplanet more than 13,000 light-years from Earth, far from where most known exoplanets are.
