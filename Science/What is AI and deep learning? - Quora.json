            "answer_text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the intelligence exhibited by machines and software. Some of the areas that it includes are: Machine Learning (ML) - software that automatically learns and improve from experience (data) without being explicitly programmedImage recognitionNatural language processing (NLP).There are many different Machine Learning algorithms and some of them are based on Artificial Neural Networks - a very simplified version of how the neural networks work in human\u2019s brain. Deep learning is a subset of neural network based machine learning algorithms. There are different algorithms for deep learning like these ones: Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN)Backpropagation Neural NetworkConvolutional Neural Network (CNN)Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)Deep Belief Network (DBN)",
