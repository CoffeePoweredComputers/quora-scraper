            "answer_text": "Organic solutes tend to have many C-H bonds for instance alkanes, benzene, which are non polar due to low electronegativity differences. Hence predominant intermolecular forces (solute-solute) are van der waals interactions. Similarly for organic solvents like hexane, many C-H bonds are present, and VDW forces are also predominant. For solubility, dissolution occurs when solute-solvent interactions are equal to or greater than solute-solute & solvent-solvent interactions. Or an easier way to put it would be that like dissolves like. Since all interactions here are VDW forces, dissolution occurs ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah like dissolves like ,as polar solvent dissolves polar ,and nonpolar dissolves nonpolar.basically what happens when you add polar organic compound in other polar compound , they try to come in same phase vai diffn kind of intractions as vanderwaal\u2019s attraction.
