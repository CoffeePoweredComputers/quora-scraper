            "answer_text": "I recommend you to learn and excel in your talent. Start with what you are good at and showcase it. This will take 2-3 months. Once done search for opportunities that relate to your developed talent. And indulge in it. I believe when one pursues his/her talent with passion better than good opportunities come their way.You will earn a lot of money this way and make your family and yourself happy.Meanwhile you can take up small jobs like literature editor etc. And learn to spend frugally. Make the most of your education too. Give your parents the satisfaction that the money invested is not wasted. ",
