            "answer_text": "Carbon . The Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process is the major industrial process for smelting aluminium. It involves dissolving aluminium oxide (alumina) (obtained most often from bauxite, aluminium's chief ore, through the Bayer process) in molten cryolite, and electrolysing the molten salt bath, typically in a purpose-built cell. The Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process applied at industrial scale happens at 940\u2013980\u00b0C and produces 99.5\u201399.8% pure aluminium. Recycled aluminum requires no electrolysis, thus it does not end up in this process. Elemental aluminium cannot be produced by the electrolysis of an aqueous aluminium salt because hydronium ions readily oxidize elemental aluminium. Although a molten aluminium salt could be used instead, aluminium oxide has a melting point of 2072 \u00b0Cso electrolysing it is impractical. In the Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process, alumina, Al2O3. is dissolved in molten synthetic cryolite, Na3AlF6, to lower its melting point. In the Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult the carbon electrodes are used.

            "answer_text": "Electrodes in cells are mostly coke which has been purified at high temperatures. Pitch resin or tar is used as a binder. The materials most often used in anodes, coke and pitch resin, are mainly residues from petroleum industry and need to be of high enough purity so no impurities end up into the molten aluminum or the electrolyte.
