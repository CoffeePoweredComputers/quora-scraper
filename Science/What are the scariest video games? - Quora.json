            "answer_text": "I played a lot of horror games. Horror is my favorite genre. As a kid, I used to watch lots of horror films from the '70s, '80s and the '90s. I watched scary videos, read scary stories, played scary games, and that was all part of the fun. Games like Amnesia: the dark descent, Alien: isolation I did enjoy. They didn't really scare me. In amnesia you pretty much walk around the castle, solve puzzles, and encounters with monsters are rare. Sometimes you hallucinate, and you have to figure out if the monster that's chasing you is real or a hallucination. Alien: Isolation has a great atmosphere, level design, and most importantly, excellent A.I. The game itself didn't really scare me, it more frustrated me because of the xenomorph's unpredictable A.I. If I had to pick a game that deeply unsettled me, both physically and mentally. I would have to choose the Power Drill Massacre.  Power drill massacre is an indie horror game that was released in 2015 by Puppet Combo. Puppet combo (originally Pig Farmer games) is an indie horror game studio, mostly known for creating 80's styled VHS slasher horror games for PC. The developer did release a lot of good horror games, but the power drill massacre is what put him on the map. *Spoilers ahead* The plot follows a woman named Megan, who gets in a car crash, far from the city. She survives the crash but her passenger Jeff is badly injured. She grabs her flashlight and goes into the woods to look for help. She eventually stumbles across a seemingly old, abandoned factory and goes inside in hopes of finding help. But soon she wishes she never entered the factory in the first place, as it turns out to be a lair of a dangerous killer armored with a power drill. The game itself is very reminiscent of ps1/ps2 games like silent hill or resident evil. The atmosphere of the game is very eerie, the whole interior of the factory and details are very realistic, it's like a real factory. The goal of the game is to explore the whole factory and escape. You pretty much walk around, gather items, read old newspapers and notes, and you listen to the surroundings.  And there's the main attraction of the game: The killer. When you walk and suddenly hear loud footsteps, you must run because it's him. Each time he appears the screen starts flashing and the killer makes a loud pig like screams. To avoid him, you must run as far away from him. When you reach a certain distance, he will stop chasing you. Also, avoid large metal doors, because that's where he can also appear from and attack you. The killer showing up isn't the only scary thing in the game. One time while I was walking down the hallway, I came to a public bathroom and heard somebody crying. I stood there listening but had to retreat because the killer appeared (it wasn't the killer crying). Similar things like in Silent Hill 2. Also in the game, as I mentioned before you can read torn newspaper articles and notes that you find in certain rooms. There are many newspaper articles that you can find describing the missing cases of campers and hitchhikers. Outside the factory you can see somebody standing on the balcony, could it be the ghost of a camper that was murdered by the killer? Also, there's one newspaper that mentioned a little girl that went missing many years ago. She was camping with her parents and as her parents described, she went to play somewhere outside the camp area and disappeared. Her parents believed she was abducted. In the game, if you pay attention, you might be able to capture a little girl running down the hallways and disappearing. Could it be her? Parts of the game that get me the most, are the endings. Yes, there are 2 ending to the game. In the bad ending after navigating through the sugar tunnel, Megan stumbles across the killer's lair, it's details are really chilling and disturbing. The wall paint is falling off, there's meat on the floor, there's some old furniture, the skeleton in the mattress, and there's one corner with toys. Megan describes it: \"Whoever lives here seems to have the mind of a child.\" Soon, the killer shows up and attacks you. There's nothing you can do at that point because you're locked, you can pretty much run in circles but the killer will get you. After killer captures Megan, she wakes up locked in the cage, with her clothes stripped and starts crying for help. The killer shows up and Megan screams in fear. The killer tries to talk to her, and by that, I do mean tries. He mumbles and talks gibberish, like a child trying to speak. Megan doesn't understand him, so he walks away, puts a lullaby on and attacks Megan, butchering her with a power drill. A biblical reference is displayed: \"AND DEATH AND HELL WERE CAST INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE. THIS IS THE SECOND DEATH. REVELATION 20:14\" Power Drill Massacre: Bad Ending In the true ending, after you manage to collect all 3 keys and unlocks the door on the 2nd floor, Megan finds herself in a very long hallway. She sees a little girl in the distance and calls for her but the little girl doesn't reply and instead runs away. Megan runs after her, and after catching up with the little girl, the little girl suddenly stops running. The killer appears, little girl vanishes and killer pursues Megan through a long hallway. As Megan is being chased, the screen slowly flashes in until it completely fades to white. Afterward, the screen fades to a nighttime view of the mountains from the beginning, while a radio station is played, it mentions that Jeff, that guy who got injured in the crash was found but Megan is still missing. As the radio changes to a static, a lullaby plays over, and somebody could be heard groaning, screaming and crying out loud as the game title appears. Power Drill Massacre [All 3 keys + True Ending] People have many theories about this ending. Many speculate that Megan was captured and tortured and those cries are hers. However, I don't think that's the case. Those screams sound more from a frustration, devastation, anger and crying at the same time, but not suffering or pain, if you've seen the bad ending you know what I mean. Also, I don't hear a power drill. So I think that's the killer crying, after losing Megan he returned to his lair, put the lullaby on and started crying and throwing tantrum. Megan may have escaped into the woods, still far from the city, suffering from emotional shock. It is pretty evident that the killer is a 2-meter cannibalistic maniac whose mind remained at the level of a 3-year-old child. But what made him a murderous killer? Also, one newspaper article mentioned that this place was originally an orphanage that was later converted into a factory, could the killer be one of the children from that orphanage? Was he abused as a child? The long hallway where the little girl is running away from Megan doesn't look like a factory interior, it certainly looks like an orphanage. And those were my thoughts on the power drill massacre. I recommend this game if you're a fan of horror. Also, check out Puppet Combo's other games.

            "answer_text": "What? Or which? This is a very personal question. Some people would like one more than the other. Those who like classics will immediately think about Silent Hill, and they may just be right.  The thing is, suspense always have their eras. Back in the day, Silent Hill and Resident Evil were top notch \u201cscary games\u201d. Particularly, I could not play the first silent hill, I had nightmares for days because of the damn radio sound, but then again I was just a kid. While Zombies did already exist, they set up a generation of games. The Era of monsters, if you want.  In the darkness of this games, another not-as-well-known title existed, System Shock 2, that fussed Half Life gameplay style with horror, REAL PSYCHOLOGICAL horror.  When the world was thinking that was it, something happened. They got a taste of Japanese Horror, in the form of Fatal Frame II. And my god this game is terrifying.  The world saw Japanese horror could take the genre by storm, and so they tried. But as this was happening, one game again turned the tide  Fear took the best of action games like System Shock, and the horrifying Japanese style horror, and mixed into a complete masterpiece. And my god this game was terrifying. After a while of sequels, capcom would make \u201cmaster move\u201d and release the so awaited return of Leon Kennedy, in Resident Evil 4, one of the best games ever made.  However, this game wasn\u2019t so great news for the lovers of the suspense and horror, as it barely had any of it left. This game would lead companies to kinda forget about the horror genre for a while. FEAR 2 and 3 got influenced by this kind of culture, and in came games like Resident Evil 5, a total disaster, and to my disappointment, Silent Hill Homecoming. While Silent Hill still had goriness and suspense there and there, it was a very long shot from their predecessors, which made you think if they had actually learned anything from what they had done before. And then, the horror genre had made a full stop. Until this game appeared.  Penumbra was a good game, but it couldn\u2019t almost be considered a game, since it was not a commercial success by a long shot. Amnesia however took the bull by the horns. The fact of being unable to defend yourself against the monsters, the fact that being in darkness was, for once, really bad for your health, was an incredible concept made true. This was psychological horror in ways that were never seen before, forcing people to hide from danger, to hear each and every sound, their ears being their only real method of surviving. And of course, the gaming industry took notes. The new era had begun. Amnesia did a revolution. Games like Outlast and Soma came up. And with them, a demo we will forever remember  PT took on a combination between Amnesia and FEAR. You are powerless against a ghost that haunts you. This DEMO terrified the entire world. There are still games being released to this day based on PTs playstyle, like Layers of Fear. Even Resident evil took their own from this, as Resident Evil 7\u2019s Demo was made in the same style as PT, and the game itself is as well terrifying, and now, we can see this \u201cdarker style\u201d as well in Resident Evil II remake. For all of this, I believe PT, even being a Demo, is the best horror game ever ",

            "answer_text": "I wish there were more that I could recommend, but unfortunately horror games are rare in the industry lately. Even so, there are a few out there.   Bioshock is not as intense of a horror game as the rest of this list, but it does have some good jump scares. Even though it's as old as it is, I think that many of the horror elements hold up. Bioshock 2 and onward, though, lost the horror element, I think, to focus more upon story. The great thing about the first Bioshock, though, is that it does a good job of combining jump scares with story and combat so that, unlike with some horror games, you don't need to put the controller down to give your heart a break.  Daylight is, in my opinion, more frightening than some of the more mainstream, widely recommended horror games. For being released in 2014, some of the graphics in the game are little off, but it delivers the atmosphere well. Some games tend to rely too heavily on jump scares, which is good to get the adrenaline flowing, but if a game developer can manage to combine a frightening atmosphere with those jump scares, then they have managed to create a successful game as far as I'm concerned.   Outlast is a great horror game because not only are there creatures coming after you in the entire game, but it takes place in an asylum. Yes, asylums are as cliche as orphanages and schools, but no matter how many times we see games in these environments, we continue to shake in our boots as soon as doors lock behind our character. The video camera is a nice touch and adds to the horror movie feel of the game.   Dead Space will forever be my go-to recommendation for a horror game. Up until the third installment, these games were well-known for being the space survival horror games. Like Bioshock, they combined atmosphere, jump scares, and a captivating story to keep the player invested in it. The plasma cutter and the available upgrades only added to the combat style, so even if the player is freaking out screaming while they're getting attacked, they can still appreciate the decapitation moments.   Silent Hill will, of course, always have a place on the horror game list. Some of the games do a better job than other installments when it comes to the horror feel. For me personally, I find that the Silent Hill games horror factor comes primarily from the atmosphere. They rely less on the jump scares and more on gore in their games. I enjoy Silent Hill for the story more than anything, but I have played many horror games and seen many horror movies and gore just doesn't do it for me. Even so, the eerie feel of the games is always enough to make me anxious while playing.   Cry of Fear is a free game that I always have the hardest time remembering the name of, but I can always remember the details of the game. I was addicted to it when I first started playing it not only for the suspense, but the atmosphere and general chaos in the game. It initially seems very straightforward, but the further you progress in the game, the more disturbed your character seems to be and the less you understand about what is really happening around you.

            "answer_text": "I won\u2019t be the first to say this, but it\u2019d have to be Amnesia: The Dark Descent.  Now, there are many reasons why this game enjoys a reputation for being one of the most scary games ever made. These reasons include the pacing, atmosphere, themes, music and more. But one of the main reasons is, to quote H. P. Lovecraft: \u201cThe oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\u201d And Amnesia delivers this horror in spades. Although the phrase \u201cLovecraftian\u201d is bandied about these days, Amnesia is unarguably a Lovecraftian inspired game. As the name suggests, the protagonist in the game suffers from Amnesia. So you as the player suffer with him as you explore what is a completely horrifying and seemingly alien castle of Brennenburg, slowly discovering not only the horrors of what were performed there and the insanity behind the main plot itself, but the horrors of what you yourself have done in the past through scraps of journal entries (with excellent voice acting). Not to mention, you are slowly being pursued by an unknown \u201cShadow\u201d that warps the castle and covers the walls with harmful flesh as it gets close. This experience would be horrifying enough on its own, but there is the additional depth of the castle\u2019s residents. Amnesia demonstrates excellence in the pacing of exposure of the player to the monsters of the castle, with limited glimpses and close encounters initially before having to navigate your way past them later. The insanity mechanic of Amnesia means that observing disturbing events or staying in the dark for too long results in hallucinations, as well as making it easier for the monsters to find you. Additionally, looking at the monsters themselves will rapidly decrease your sanity as well, and who can blame you?  This means that Amnesia not only controls your exposure to the monsters to begin with, but later on you are also encouraged to limit that exposure due to sanity - multiplying the horror of each experience while maintaining your fear of each creature. I would like to give an additional commendation for the music in these situations, as the unique pieces for when a monster is close or pursuing give a feeling of terror that you could not feel otherwise. However, as developer Thomas Grip later discussed in a talk about Frictional Games\u2019 latest game SOMA, Amnesia did so well in creating a horrifying experience that the main ideas behind the story were often lost or overlooked:  That led to Frictional Games designing SOMA slightly differently to allow for a more story focused, but still scary, game. I highly recommend SOMA as well as Amnesia, as it puts forward themes rarely seen in games, and does it exceptionally well. Anyway, those are my two cents!

            "answer_text": "The atmospheric and slower-paced Silent Hill series (at least,the first four) get my vote.         I'm going  to make an unpopular statement, and say that Silent Hill 3 is the best and scariest of them, followed closely by Silent Hill 4. The first two are outstanding, but... sorry, you spend far too much time wandering around aimlessly, and although the stories are better, the atmosphere gets less scary every minute you spend not knowing what to do next.  SH 3&4 don't have this problem. You don't spend a lot of time wandering around - the things that are terrifying push you from one event to the next. The very fact that they are more on-rails makes them scarier: the character you're controlling has almost no control over the events transpiring around them. You're just trying to survive, and find out what's going on so you can keep surviving. It's more intense than wandering around a foggy town. SH2 is amazing, but it takes a while to get into it, and that while is too long. Everything after SH4 is pretty much a train-wreck, by the way. The production studios changed, and the new one brought a more American-Horror-Movie aesthetic to the games. Now, American style horror movies are great (I'm a huge fan of them), but what works in a scary movie isn't what works in a scary video game. The southeast Asian (Japanese, Korean, and Thai especially) style of movie horror, to me, works much better in video games. Since SH4, the landscape of horror games has changed. There's a lot more spring-loaded-cat, and a lot less atmosphere. Doom 3 is good for the occasional jump-out-of-your-pants scare, and does have a seriously creepy vibe to it. Likewise, F.E.A.R. has some great scares to it. The problem with these two, however, is that they focus on the action. That's fantastic for the games themselves (you'll never hear me bad-mouth either one of them), but it does make them a bit less scary. Dead Space has some pretty creepy moments  But after a point, you get the feeling that the freaky monsters are looking for disco lights to stand in so you can see them better. That's not cool in a horror game. Fewer monsters that spent more time in the shadows - and made you feel completely outclassed when you fought them - would have gone a long way toward making Dead Space on part with Silent Hill in terms of pure terror.  To bring this to a close, I thought I might mention one more game from the past that's scary as all holy hell, for much the same reason the early Silent Hill games were. If you've never played Fatal Frame 1 or 2, you should. At night. With all the lights off. All alone. Which is how you should always play horror games anyway.  ",

            "answer_text": "Among the most popular are the works of Frictional Games (studio): the Penumbra series, Amnesia series and now their newest hit SOMA. They are all first-person psychological horror games, in which you are not the typical first-person shooter badass who can take on huge monsters and carry dozens of guns; instead, you are typically stranded in a hostile environment full of threats both physical and psychological, and you may \"lose\" by losing either your physical or psychological health (i.e, something kills you dead, or you lose your mind).  The elements that make these games so friggin' scary are: a) Lighting: Majority of the locations are poorly lit, full of shadows, and your mind has the tendency to fill these shadows with imagined threats (especially once the game shows you that a threat COULD hide in one of these). Lack of mobile light sources (lanterns/flashlights) or their limited light-emitting duration means you won't be able to check every shadow. b) Sound: The sound artists of these games deliberately create otherwordly sound effects which would scare the shit out of anybody who hears them. Also, the games utilize frightening music to constantly darken the atmosphere. And of course the game features many occasions where a sound is played \"off camera\" just to mess with your mind (Did I just hear... growling? Should I... turn around and look... or is it actually better to just sprint towards the door at the end of the room, hoping that I don't get eaten by whatever made the sound?) c) Monster design: Unlike a shooter game, which, over time, teaches you not to fear the monsters, but rather execute them on first sight, monsters in these games are quite rare, but when they appear, you cannot fight them conventionally. They may be invincible, or require some specially designed/scripted event to kill. If they attack you successfully, you are either dead instantly, or they cause so much damage that your only option is to flee the spot and hope they lose your track. The monsters are typically shown only in a semi-revealing manner (in a shadow, or partially concealed etc.), and there's also tendency to make your psyche go insane when you look at them, so if you would like to spectate these monsters, you will lose your (character's) mind. This results in players actually looking away, never quite sure what they saw. d) Mind-blowing plot twists: Obviously, talking about these would be a major spoiler, so just be prepared that what you think you know at the beginning of the game and what you think you know at the end will be very different. In SOMA, you begin the game thinking that you are a man who somehow got to an underwater research/scientific base. Somewhere in that sentence is a detail that is not true, as you will discover... ============================ Besides the works of Frictional Games, there are other games worthy of notion. My favourite is F.E.A.R. This horror first-person shooter cleverly switches between reality and dream-like sequences; in reality, you are fighting mind-controlled soldiers and are trying to find out what the hell was the secret research company doing; in the dream sequences, you are crawling through pools of blood, being targetted by telepathic powers of one of the scariest \"villains\" of all times - Alma. To make it a bit more complicated, there are at least 2 Almas, one of them kinda helping you, the other being very merciless in her actions. As you get deeper and deeper into the conspiracy/mystery, you can't help but feel pity for her and rage at those responsible for her fate.  ",

            "answer_text": "I was five years old when I first played my first video game (Pac-Man or Combat on the Atari 2600) and I\u2019ve seen pretty much every game rise like Quake, Wolfenstein, Doom and Diablo. I would say that those were the precursors to actually scary games and I quickly became a fan of the genre. I\u2019ve played several games in the genre like Resident Evil 4, F.E.A.R. 3, Alien Isolation and Dead Space but nothing, and I do mean NOTHING that I\u2019ve ever played came close to the psychological assault that is called Silent Hill 2. When I got the game, I was eager to get into it because I had just bought a PS2 and, while I am still addicted to Ace Combat 4, 5 and Zero, I wanted to try something other than aerial combat. I had heard of how great the original Silent Hill was on PS1 and thought \u201cUsually the sequel isn\u2019t as groundbreaking as the original.\u201d so I wasn\u2019t expecting anything that I\u2019d never seen before. OMFG, was I in for a rude awakening. Silent Hill 2 doesn\u2019t just scare you, it makes you cry. It strikes so deep into your psyche that you\u2019re affected by it even when not playing it. The game isn\u2019t just scary, it is absolutely HEART-WRENCHING! The game should have a warning that says \u201cPsychopaths Only\u201d. If you have any empathy or foresight whatsoever, this game will turn you into an emotional wreck. Most horror video games have at least a small amount of comedy in them to give your soul some respite. Silent Hill 2 has NONE. If I had ANY idea of what Silent Hill 2 is like, I NEVER would have played it. I do not recommend it to anyone as its\u2019 possible that Silent Hill 2 is TOO frightening and disturbing, to the point that I think it could actually be psychologically damaging. It is worth mentioning that I was in my twenties when I played it, I was not a kid but if I were, I don\u2019t know what damage Silent Hill 2 could have incurred. No other game can do to you what Silent Hill 2 can. It stands alone as the most frightening video game ever made. No kid should be allowed to play this game because it could seriously scar them. In some ways, it has scarred me because I will NEVER forget the name Silent Hill 2. Hell, one of the main antagonists in Silent Hill 2, the disturbingly freaky \u201cPyramid Head\u201d has his own Wikipedia page!  Pyramid Head - Wikipedia ",

You can pretty much only run and hide from the alien. It\u2019s fun. Really. The Forest  Here you are stranded on a island with cannibals. Different tribes, that sometimes fight amongst each other, but will definitely try to eat you, or drag you deep into a cave and eat you later. This game has survival and crafting elements, so you can at least build yourself a refuge\u2026. until some multi-legged mutant comes and knocks down your walls. The AI in this game is pretty damned good though. Layers of Fear  This is a short, but highly enjoyable psychological horror game. It\u2019s kind of a creepy/sad themed plot, and makes good use of surrealism to play into the atmosphere. ",

(Warning, graphical content yadda yadda)  This game is one of the most scary games out there, and when I played it too much for a day it was sure to give me a nightmare. The atmosphere is of pure loneliness and danger - every corner can hide something dangerous, \u201cthey\u201d come from literally anywhere. And \u201cthey\u201d I mean the necromorphs. They simply don\u2019t give up, and they won\u2019t die by shooting in the head, or the body. These guys only die by completely disabling them (cutting arms and legs).  When the game designers were making the concept art of the enemies, they studied bodies that were run over by car accidents. So they should look very deformed. The first ones you encounter look deadly enough.  And boy, they are fast. Lucky for you that you got a stasis module so you can slow them down. Later we got some other enemies that are faster or deadlier or just more stealthy. Well, this game gives me chills when I play. ",

I usually don\u2019t play horror games but this one is so creepy and unique I have to mention it. Dark Deception has many different levels but I am stuck on the first one which alone is enough to scare me badly. The first level starts in a hotel where you have to collect crystals. It\u2019s like first person pacman if the maze was hotel hallways and the ghosts are- Killer monkeys  In the game you have no idea where the monkeys are and you have to escape them based on the sound they seem to be coming from. When the monkeys are about to get you the last thing you see before your gruesome death is this.  The monkey business level of dark deception is absolutely terrifying. ",

The Climb is a virtual reality game on the Oculus Rift. In it you are climbing up the side of mountains in the Swiss Alps, Grand Canyon, and other locations. The games graphics are very realistic, and inside of VR the feeling that you are thousands of feet up in the air is all to realistic as well. The game will make your knees shake and give you a true adrenaline rush as you work your way up the side of the mountains, hoping not to accidentally fall to your death below. Possibly not everyone scariest game - but very scary to me! ",

I\u2019m actually surprised no one has mentioned it yet. The cool thing about Sanitarium is that it is not primarily a horror game; there are no jump scares or thrill moments, and the game is basically a point & click isometric adventure. Its main appeal is its bizarre storyline. And storyline it delivers\u2026 The whole game is an intensely mind-bending psychological trip, and is so disturbing that I\u2019ve had nightmares about it for years. I should mention, though, that I was only 11 y/o at the time, and so that may have had something to do with it. But I still get creeped out when I remember it. As someone who\u2019s not into horror games (or movies) at all - this game is one of my all time favorites. If you\u2019re the kind of person who likes movies like Shutter Island, you will probably enjoy this game very much. Some screenshots:    ",
