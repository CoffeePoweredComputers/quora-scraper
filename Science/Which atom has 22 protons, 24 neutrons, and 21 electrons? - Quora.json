            "answer_text": "It's the positive ion of an isotope of Titanium. The titanium atom with 24 neutrons has a presence of 8% in nature with respect to the total amount of titanium. It is stable and hence does not emit any alpha or beta radiation unless it is stimulated. The fact that has 21 electrons means that it has being ionised once, hence one electron has been ripped off its shell and dispersed somewhere, leaving the atom positively charge. ",
