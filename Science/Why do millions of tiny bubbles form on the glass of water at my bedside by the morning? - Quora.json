            "answer_text": "Water contains dissolved oxygen. If it didn\u2019t, it would taste pretty awful. The inside of your glass may appear smooth but under a microscope it is actually quite rough. The miscroscopic roughness of the glass surface creates nucleation sites which allow oxygen to concentrate at these points and form tiny bubbles. If you drink the water, it will possibly taste a little odd because it has lost the dissolved oxygen. Take a sip. then stir it vigourously for 30 seconds with a spoon or swizzle stick and taste it again. It will taste different because you have re-incorporated oxygen back into the water. ",

Any object that is colder than the ambient air will cause humid air to give up moisture - water from the air will condense on the surface of that object. Same thing happens with a can of soda pop you take out of the fridge. Water beads up on the outside of the can. ",
