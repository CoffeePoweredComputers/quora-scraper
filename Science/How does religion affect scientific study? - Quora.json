            "answer_text": "If you are talking about individual scientists, then it does not. Individual scientists run the full gamut of religious beliefs, from devout theist to ardent atheist, and it does not affect how they do science at all. Ian Barbour, in his book Religion and Science, comments that when he gets together with his fellow astronomers, religion is never the topic of discussion. There are, of course, exceptions. Jonathan Wells got a Ph.D. in biochemistry specifically so he could criticize evolution. But, if you look, Wells has never done science in that he has never done research and published. Michael Behe is a spokesperson for Intelligent Design. While he was still a practicing biochemist, his published articles were like any other scientific work. Now he is a full-time IDer and does not do science anymore; he does ID propaganda. So, come to think of it, religion does not affect scientific study. Everyone who does science does it the same, no matter their faith position. If you mean how religion as an institution affects scientific study, that is more complicated. Ian Barbour came up with the classification of the ways religion and science have interacted.1. Conflict2. Independence3. Dialogue4. Integration Many people focus on conflict and ignore the other 3. More thorough scholarship shows that conflict, while dramatic, has been overall the least common form of interaction: Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction: Gary B. Ferngren: 9780801870385: Amazon.com: Books Most study, of course, has been on the effect of Christianity on science, since modern science developed in Europe, which is predominantly Christian. I strongly suggest reading the book above. I will just note here 3 positive contributions of Christianity to science that are often overlooked:1. The basic assumptions about the nature of the physical universe. In order for science to \u201cwork\u201d, it must have 5 basic assumptions about the physical universe: rationality, accessibility, contingency, objectivity, and unity. While it is possible to arrive at those assumptions independent of religion, it is very difficult. Christianity has those assumptions as inferences or conclusions based upon the characteristics of Yahweh. 2.  Science got the idea there should be no miraculous gaps from Christianity. I know that sounds implausible in the light of creationism/ID\u2019s activities today, but Christianity teaches that Yahweh created a complete universe that should have no gaps. This is how Christian theologians saw the situation during the formative centuries for modern science (1200\u20131700), so science picked it up. 3. Day jobs. It was not until the second half of the 1900s that people could actually earn a living being a scientist. Even then, it was not until the 20th century with public colleges that there was extensive secular jobs (teaching at the university level) where people could be scientists. Either the person had to be independently wealthy or have a day job. Gegor Mendel and William of Ockham are just 2 famous examples of a scientist who was also employed (as a monk in their cases) by the Catholic Church. In Darwin\u2019s day, most of the scientists in England were ministers in the Anglican Church, which is why Darwin studied for the ministry. In the event, after the scientific fame Darwin got from his work during the voyage of the Beagle, Darwin\u2019s wealthy doctor father bought him a town! Darwin lived off the rents (and income from his books) for the rest of his life, letting him do science. Without those day jobs from religion to pay for mundane things like housing, food, and clothing, there would have been far fewer scientists. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t. If something such as religion affects scientific study then it is no longer scientific. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve ended up with Creationists and Intelligent Design. It\u2019s sciencey-sounding but baseless because its proponents have binned the scientific method in favour of scrabbling about looking for anything, no matter how insignificant, convoluted or dishonest, that the faithful might swallow in favour of a predecided thesis. Neil Degrasse Tyson sums up generally how science is done by honest believers.  ",
