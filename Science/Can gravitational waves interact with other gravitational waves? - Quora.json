            "answer_text": "Dori is absolutely right. To go further, gravitational waves (GWs) are indeed different than sound waves or electromagnetic waves. Those are linear (for sound, it can get non-linear because they involve matter interactions, it's molecules or atoms that compress or expand their distances from one another), and although they can interfere with each other, the interference is simply LINEAR superposition of their waveforms.  For GW's, no such luck. They will certainly also interfere mostly the same way, but if strong enough they will exhibit nonlinear interactions with each other. That's because Einstein General Relativity (GR) equations are non-linear. Electromagnetism is linear. At a quantum level it is predicated (not detected yet, maybe not for many years) that gravitons carry the GW's, but if they exist they are much more complicated than the photons which carry the electromagnetic field. In gravity at a quantum level small enough the gravitons, and specetime, may form into a sort of foam that is constantly interacting with itself. GW's we seem and other gravitational effects we see are weak filed approximations that are mostly linear with some correction terms, but which don't capture the full story. Part of the problem is that gravity is the shape of spacetime, and how do we visualize that if not in space? Read Brian Green(e?) popular books to see a lot more.  But yes, totally non-linear and they interact with each other and with everything else there is. WE still don't understand the half of it. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the fundamental properties of gravitation is its non-linearity. What it means is this: Anything that has energy and momentum is a source of gravity and responds to gravity. Gravitational fields and gravitational waves have energy and momentum, so they, too, can be a source of, and respond to, gravity, including the gravitational effects of other gravitational waves. This is not merely interference; interacting gravitational waves genuinely alter each other. BUT... the effect is very, very, very, very very weak, because the coupling between gravity and energy-momentum is very, very, very, very weak. Still, this non-linearity is one of the reasons why Einstein's gravity can be fiendishly difficult in the strong gravity regime (where such effects cannot be ignored) and why quantizing gravity turned out to be such a difficult challenge.

            "answer_text": "Yes gravitational waves do in interact with other gravitational wave.  Gravitational waves comes from a weak field approximation (unlike solitons) which mean there will be interaction terms between them. Since gravity is a very weak force, the interactions will be very weak as well.  Regrading specific pheonoma coming from the interactions. I don't know enough. Likely the example from the sea are vary far from the thinks you can get with gravity. ",

            "answer_text": "The fact that Dark Matter, which is thought to be required to explain the current expansion rate of the universe, is called Dark suggests that the interaction is most likely to be via gravitational waves. I believe that the presence of Dark matter and the absence of Antimatter in our universe is a current important problem to cosmologists. Unfortunately some mathematical theoreticians believe that they can only solve this problem indirectly by using their hypothetical models, with hypothetical particles like \u201cmagnetic monopoles\u201d, in their solution. If only they would accept the CPT symmetry model, which says that we have a twin universe, they might realise that the above matter problems are solved and that there is a gravitational interaction between our universe and its antimatter twin which does not annihilate both universes! If you are interested in the model look up my short paper \u201cThe Symmetrical Universe\u201d - no maths required - just logic using well accepted physics principles. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "As u know gravitational waves are just like to be compared as normal waves such as sound waves. So they may interfere with each other causing some constructiveness or destructiveness. Once a theory was published that we can relate black holes as mixing up of two or more gravity lines of celestial bodies which increases its gravity. This may result in such a anamolous behaviour of black holes. White holes are just opposite. The waves here interfere destructively.  ",
