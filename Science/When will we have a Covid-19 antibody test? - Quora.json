            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A: I would expect that antibody assays are in development. However, these are more of academic interest rather than of any real use in the combat of the ongoing pandemic. It\u2019s importan to understand that antibody response is delayed compared to viral replication. If you want to detect an infection in its early stages you would ideally want to detect the presence of either viral proteins or the nucleic acid of the virus using a PCR based amplification method. The first method is usually employed in rapid influenza tests, that are usually based on the nucleoprotein antigen of the influenza virus. While PCR based methods are usually used to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific serotype of a virus. PCR based methods can also be used to quantify the amount of virus present in a sample to give additional power to the analysis. The strength of both of these methods directly detects the presence of the virus rather than the immune response, which we know is delayed. IgM antibodies are more cross reactive and less specific, while present earlier in the infectious cycle there is a higher risk of cross reactivity or non specific binding which may yield false positives. With specific IgG antibodies, the best indicator of a specific immune response against the pathogen, can usually being detectable about 1 week after the infection is manifest. Serological studies are thus mostly of academic interest once the epidemic is under control and you want to determine the portion of the population that has been exposed to the pathogen and thus calculate more accurate figures of the rates of infection and mortality of the disease. They are however of little help when you are triaging patients in the ER where the presence or absence of a influenza infection can determine whether or not the patient needs to be isolated or not. Edit: So I get several responses saying that yes serology is important because\u2026 Now, in the surge of patients hitting the ERs in a pandemic situation the health care system will already be struggling to manage the influx of patients. The prevalence of immunity is low in this situation and a titer test isn\u2019t going to aid any of us in the triage of patients. We need to know which patients with severe upper respiratory symptoms are actively shedding viruses and needs to be treated by staff in PPEs and which patients are suffering from other problems and can go to a general ward. When labs are clogged with COVID-19 samples that are sent from ERs they aren\u2019t going to have time to run routine serology en masse. There will also not be any significant amount of health care staff to draw blood on healthy asymptomatic individuals. Hospitals will be clogged with sick patients and you certainly don\u2019t want to pull healthy people there and expose them to a high risk environment. You can\u2019t send them to primary care as they will be clogged with patients diverted from ERs. This will be patients that don\u2019t have upper respiratory symptoms but need fairly urgent care which the hospital system can\u2019t currently meet. Primary care will cancel all non essential visits and will have a huge load that would normally be ERs cases. Serological testing is of interest for screening essential functions in society such as health care staff, first responders, law enforcement, truck drivers needed to keep essentials flowing, utility workers etc. but not the general population. Serology may be important in the second wave scenarios where you will be seeing a new surge of patients as you start lifting quarantines. But in the first wave you\u2019ll be seeing a drop in the number in the ERs as a sign of being passed the first peak. By that time health care staff will be exhausted and over stretched at best and needs to prepare for the next surge that is expected as quarantine rules are lighting. ",

            "answer_text": "Having an antibody test for Covid-19 is very important as it may show people who are infected and have recovered and then may be safe to go back to work, Presuming that those infected and recovered, have developed antibodies, so that even if they are expoused again, their body is able to fight it off and not get sick, but keep the virus in check and not build up numbers that could spread to others as well. SO, not only having tests, where someone has Corona, but also antibody tests for people who seem healthy are very important to have. They do not exist as yet to be widely available but work is being done to develop and make such tests in large numbers. When that will be, and rolled out and widely available, the sooner the better and I do not know when available in America. Just very small and expensive in research facilities. Not available generally., ",
