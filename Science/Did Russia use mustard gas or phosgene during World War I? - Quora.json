            "answer_text": "The Imperial Russian Army organized a Chemical Committee in 1916 to develop their own chemical warfare capacities: by June 1915 it had tried its own chlorine shells and a year later was manufacturing phosgene and chloropricrin. But despite producing hundreds of tons of chemicals, efforts to deploy them were mostly unsuccessful: \u2026according to the available statistics, by April 1917, most of them remained at storage and production sites, with only the minuscule amount of 138 puds (just over 2 tons) of liquid chlorine actually delivered to the front.[1] The general breakup of the Russian war effort and the first serious flare-ups of the Revolution by then meant that the chemicals were kept in storage, the degraded Army unable to take them from the manufacturing plants to the front. ::Did Russia use mustard gas or phosgene during World War I?:: Footnotes[1] https://www.history.ubc.ca/documents/BigScience2002.pdf",
