            "answer_text": "Yes, all plants do produce water during photosynthesis. However, they also split water during photosynthesis, and more water is split than produced, and therefore the net reaction is loss of water, not production of water. The full reaction of oxygenic photosynthesis is 12 H2O + 6 CO2 \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6 H2O + 6 O2, and you can naturally delete 6 H2O from both sides: 6 H2O + 6 CO2 \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6O2. The splitting of water is, however, a speciality of photosynthesis (sunlight is needed for it) whereas production of water is very common in biochemical reactions. Production of water during a bond formation is condensation, i.e. the reversal of a class of reactions called hydrolysis reactions. The production of water occurs during the carbon fixation reactions known as the Calvin-Benson cycle. ",

            "answer_text": "12 H2O are split in the light reactions to produce 24 e- to reduce 6 CO2 in the Calvin cycle. Essentially, 6 of those H2O are added to the 6 carbons making sugar, and the other 6 H2O are regenerated in the reduction of oxygen from CO2. ",
