            "answer_text": "It is Methane gas.  Gases of decomposing plants, natural gas, and the atmosphere of Saturn's moon, Titan, all have in common? Give up? They all contain methane! Methane is a colorless, odorless, highly flammable gas at room temperature and can be found in a wide variety of sources on Earth. On Earth methane can be found as a major component of natural gas that is stored in the earth's crust. Methane is also a common by-product of the decomposition of biological matter, such as decaying plants or animals. Earth, however, is not the sole location where methane can be found in the universe. Methane is present in the vast reaches of interstellar space as well as solar systems beyond our own. Many planets in our solar system, including Venus, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, contain significant amounts of methane in their atmospheres. In fact, the recent Cassini mission to Saturn's moon, Titan, uncovered large bodies of liquid methane mixed with other similar compounds. Bonding Basics Methane is classified as an organic compound, a substance composed of mainly carbon and hydrogen. In fact, methane is a compound that is made exclusively of carbon and hydrogen, or a hydrocarbon. With a formula of CH4, that is, four hydrogen atoms bonded to a single carbon atom, methane is the simplest of the hydrocarbons, a group also referred to as the alkanes. The chemical bonds found within methane are classified as covalent bonds. A covalent bond is formed when two or more atoms share one or more electrons located in the outermost energy level, also known as the valenceshell. The valence electrons from each donor atom form pairs through overlap of their electron clouds to create a covalent bond. For methane the covalent bonds form from the sharing of a single electron from each hydrogen with the four unpaired valence electrons of a single carbon atom. The hydrogen atoms are arranged around the central carbon atom in a geometry known as a tetrahedral geometry. Tetrahedral geometry means that, if you drew a line to connect three hydrogen atoms on the same side of the molecule, you would have a pyramid with four triangular faces. ",

            "answer_text": "Any substance whose simplest chemical structure containing more than one atom is a molecule - even if a substance is made up of only one type (element) of atom. CH4, or methane, is a molecule as the simplest part of its chemical structure (one molecule) contains five atoms. One methane molecule contains one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. Even oxygen (in its naturally occurring form) is a molecule as it contains two oxygen atoms bonded together. Every gas on the Periodic Table occurs naturally as diatomic molecules - that is, two atoms of said gas bonded together in pairs. The only gases that don\u2019t conform to this \u2018rule\u2019 are the Noble Gases which you\u2019ll find down the last column of the periodic table. These gases exist only as free atoms in nature.
