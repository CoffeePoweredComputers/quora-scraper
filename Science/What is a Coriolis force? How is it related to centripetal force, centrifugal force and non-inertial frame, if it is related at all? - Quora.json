            "answer_text": "We are all accustomed to centrifugal forces experienced radially outwards sitting stationary in a Merry-go-round but to experience the coriolis force you have to shed your laziness and walk along its radius. That means Coriolis force comes into picture only while studying the rotational Dynamics of a non rigid body. Let us try to get the mathematical equation for this force by computing the rate of change of angular momentum as the mass moves radially outwards and equate it to Torque applied by coriolis force ( Did I forget centrifugal force ? definitely not as RADIAL forces cannot generate Torque). Angular momentum L= m\u00d7v(tangential)\u00d7r (Did I leave the RADIAL velocity ? ) v(tangential)=w( angular velocity)\u00d7r L=m\u00d7w\u00d7r^2 dL/dt = 2\u00d7m\u00d7w\u00d7r\u00d7dr/dt= Torque=F(coriolis)\u00d7r F(coriolis TANGENTIAL note !)= 2\u00d7m\u00d7w\u00d7v(RADIAL) (comes out independent of r and proportional to w unlike centrifugal force) One may also consider the mass moving with constant velocity along the circumference relative to the rotating frame and switch to ground frame to calculate the net centripetal force F( centripetal ) = -m\u00d7 ( v+w*r)^2 /r = -m*v^2/r -2\u00d7m\u00d7v(TANGENTIAL)\u00d7w (coriolis force) -m*w^2*r NOTE- When the mass moves radially coriolis force is tangential and vice versa , ideal candidate for a mathematical cross product F( coriolis) = -2m*(W\u00d7V) So to move a mass radially in a Merry go round you have to push SIDEWAYS to counter the Coriolis force. Note: Both centrifugal force and coriolis force are inertial or pseudo force in the sense that they cannot be traced to be originating from material bodies unlike electromagnetic or nuclear forces and are invoked to make Newtons second law valid in an accelerated frame . They vanish the moment we choose an inertial frame easily accounted by the fundamental property of Inertia of Newtons first law. Coriolis forces have an important role in movement of air and water over large areas on surface of Earth being a rotating frame, but that is part of Geography not PHYSICS). ",

            "answer_text": "As it is well known this force was found out by the french scientist coriolis in the early of the twenty century.When he was working on the theory of water weals.It is a type of force connected with a motion of frame of reference,it is also called a fictitous force.It acts on on the objects in motion relative to a rotating frame of reference.In case that the frame of reference rotation is in clockwise direction the force acts to the left.But if  the direction of the frame reference motion  is counterclockwise the coriolis force will act to the right.This force has great effect on the motion of the winds,where the earth is in motion about its axes as it is known.The centrifugal force is a force acts on a subjec in orbital motion toward out of the orbit ,as the radius of the orbit of motion increase the force will increase , but as it decreases the force degrease and the objet fall into the centre.The centripetal force it is aforce that acts on an object  in orbital motion toward the centre of the orbit.It is clear the coriolis force is a special kind of force as  shown above.
