            "answer_text": "Lyn, If you\u2019re asking which scientific theories form the basis of an undergraduate-level introduction to science subjects, then you\u2019ll likely be considering In physics: The full range of classical mechanics - Newtonian, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanicsMaxwell\u2019s Equations for electromagnetismSpecial Relativity, before General Relativity at a later stageQuantum mechanics and some particle physics, with quantum field theory to follow.Various branches of thermodynamics and statistical mechanicsIn Biology Cell theoryDarwinian evolution,Molecular GeneticsBio-energeticsFor Chemistry Atomic theorychemical bonding theoryreaction kineticsmolecular quantum mechanicsAnd the relevant theories in other areas such as geology, engineering, space sciences\u2026 But if you want to know what scientific theories are covered at an introductory level in science education, at High School then you\u2019ll be learning things like: Classical mechanics - statics and dynamics based largely on Newtonian physicsPerhaps some basic electrostatics and circuit theory, early ideas about electricity and magnetism from Volta, Faraday and othersSome basics of thermodynamicsMendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution, cellular structure etc. in biologyThe Periodic Table of chemical Elements and some ideas about chemical reactions.But you won\u2019t get much in the way of full-blown theory, as ideas at this level are not presented very formally - you\u2019ll have to wait for university-level education for formal theory. However, there is no precise answer to the question as asked because there are very few useful scientific theories that can be called \u201cintroductory theories\u201d. Rather, one gets exposed to many of the ideas associated with scientific theories before reaching a level where you can learn the theories that support them. Alternatively, if by introductory theories you mean the historically earliest theories, then you really need to be able to define what you mean by a theory, as early ideas that we would call scientific today, as with say Aristotelian physics, were not usually developed or presented as we understand theories (which today are often very quantitative). Hoping this helps - Paul ",
