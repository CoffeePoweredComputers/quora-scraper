            "answer_text": "This can be explained on the basis of sp3 hybridization in accordance to the valence orbital of oxygen atom .one s- orbital (2s) and three p- orbitals( 2px,2py,2pz) intermix and redistribute into four identical sp3 orbitals.As there are six electrons and two sp3 orbitals get pairs and two sp3 orbitals get one electron each.Now, the two sp3 orbitals of oxygen atom overlap the s orbitals of two hydrogen atoms to give sigma sp3-s bonds.One more thing,angle is 104 degrees and 31 minutes.",
