            "answer_text": "Yes. I believe architecture has features of both. There\u2019s a science to building any structure. There\u2019s an art to making a structure functional and beautiful. We, in the Western World tend to categorize or classify things. Quite often, these things will fall into more than one category. For example: Consider a definition for the word art: skill acquired by experience, study or observation. Now, consider a definition for the word architecture: the art or science of building; specifically : the art or practice of designing and building structures and especially habitable ones. \u2014Definition source: Merriam-Webster online dictionary. If we look at the etymology or history of our words, the original meanings will shed light on our usage today; which may be much narrower than the definition and usage of the word. Sorry Jacob, I think I got carried away with this answer. Thanks for the opportunity to share. Best!Paul ",

            "answer_text": "its both. though this is a matter of debate but i personally think architecture is both art and science. architecture is the art of space. by space i don't mean the cosmos but rather the environment, natural or built that is around us. rather than saying architects design buildings i think its better to say architects design experiences through the manipulation of space (again, by space i mean our surrounding environment). now in order to give a person the best experience architecture-wise, an architect needs to study things like circulation, ergonomics, climatology, acoustics, optics, structure, electrical engineering, sociology, psychology, physical planning, construction management and many more. the common misconception that architects don't need to be good at math is simply false. architects need to study mechanics, trigonometry, geometry, calculus quite a lot. so bottom line, i would say architecture is both, sometimes more science than art or sometimes the other way around depending on the project requirement and the architect\u2019s preferences.
