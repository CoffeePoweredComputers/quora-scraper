            "answer_text": "Richness is like beauty: ity is a perceived (subjective) aspect of a sound, an esthetical judgement by individuals - and that is something that is hard to \u201cprove\u201d (the eye of the beholder and all that). But, there is also the fact that between simple and complex timbres there is a difference in the number and spread of over- and undertones, and the rule of thumb is that \u201cricher\u201d sounds tend to have more of those. So pictures (or better: movies) of a frequency analyzer can be used to \u201cprove\u201d this. Test oscillator (very boring \u201cpoor\u201d sine wave, no under- or overtones, at all, the sound of \u201cbeeeeeep\u201d):  Lush synth sound from a Korg synthesizer:  About the same pitch, but many more visible (and audible) consonant overtones. Still pretty regular though, an even richer sound will have more dissonant under- and overtones:  This is not \u201cproof\u201d though, this is, at best, evidence. If someone claims that the second sound is more \u201crich\u201d to their ears than the third, you cannot \u201cdisprove\u201d that. Perception cannot be \u201cproven\u201d in any way. Making the overtones in the high frequency area (above 3 kHz) more pronounced adds to the feel of richness:  ",
