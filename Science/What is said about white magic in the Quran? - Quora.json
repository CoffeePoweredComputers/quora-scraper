            "answer_text": "White magic is completely wrong. Solution for demonic possesion? Quran. Any type of magic done without the help of Allah is evil, magic itself becomes evil.  The Quran explains when magic came to the world, in babyloon (today iran) two angels called Harut and marut came, they warned people that if they learned the magic from them, they would go to hell but people took it and the devils and men spread it. Harut and Marut. But the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say, \"We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic] [2:102]. Today, there are many of them who use jinns (demon race) to cause problems to people and posses them. But there is protection and healer, the quran and be used to take out a demon from some one Cure for Black Magic, Jinn/Evil Spirit Posession, Manzil, Ruqya. It is better when a person who knows reads it upon in the losses person. It was miracles, that Allah gave to the prophets and those whom he favourd, peace be upon them.The last person who had this type of miracle that Allah allowed (controling jinns, unseen creatures/demon race) was prophet Solomon pbuh. And to Solomon [We subjected] the wind - its morning [journey was that of] a month - and its afternoon [journey was that of] a month, and We made flow for him a spring of [liquid] copper. And among the jinn were those who worked for him by the permission of his Lord. And whoever deviated among them from Our command - We will make him taste of the punishment of the Blaze. Quran [34:12] Prophet Solomon pbuh was one of the 4 men that ruled this world, 2 Muslims and 2 non-Muslims, made a du\u2019aa (suplication) to Allah, saying give me something that No one after me will get, thus making it no more acceptable. And Solomon inherited David. He said, \"O people, we have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from all things. Indeed, this is evident bounty.\"Quran [27:16]. So the magicians fell down in prostration [to Allah ]. [26:46] the verse above is explaining when prophet Moses pbuh showed the sorcerors of pharoah through the help of Allah, and they saw how their magic was useless and Allah saved them from hell. (I think he turned his stick into a snake.) And when I am ill, it is He who cures me Quran [26:80] All power belongs to Allah, if he has not granted you anything, have patience. Our time for us to do such things will be in heaven (if we are granted), this world isn't for enjoyment, it's serious and it determines our final destination. They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to good deeds. And those are among the righteous. Quran [3:114] ",
