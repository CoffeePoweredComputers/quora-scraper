            "answer_text": "Essentially, these are organic compounds (meaning that they are made primarily out of carbons) that are small and light enough to easily vaporize. The ability to turn into vapor at room temperature is what makes them \u201cvolatile.\u201d Not all VOCs are bad! More on that later. Now, VOCs can be bad for a few reasons. First, organic compounds as a rule tend to be flammable. So if you have enough vapor from a VOC, you can easily get a fire or explosion (in fact, you could say that gasoline is a VOC). Second, some organic compounds interact with DNA in ways that lead to mutations, and these mutations can potentially lead to cancer. Now, if the compound is capable of easily forming a vapor (so it\u2019s a VOC), it is possible to ingest that compound by breathing, which is bad because you might not realize what you\u2019re breathing in. Some organic compounds can get broken down somewhat in the stomach, but if the compound enters through your lungs, it can get into the bloodstream without too much difficulty. Third, some organic compounds are *acutely* toxic, meaning that if you breathe them in, even in small quantities, you can die. Some VOCs are acutely toxic, and indeed, some poison gases are even designed to be that way. Now, VOC is a very broad category, but usually the VOCs we encounter in everyday life are: Solvents. Things like acetone (nail-polish remover), hexanes, and things like methyl-ethyl ketone (MEK). Stuff that you sometimes find in cleaning supplies, or paints. Some of these can do serious damage to your liver if you breathe enough in, and this is why architects of laboratory spaces pay close attention to containment and ventilation.Plasticizers. You know that \u201cnew car\u201d smell? Well here\u2019s where that comes from: a lot of plastics like PVC consist of carbon chains that are very tightly packed together, and this makes them hard to shape into what you want. So companies will add some small molecules to interfere with the chains a little bit, make the plastic softer, and therefore easier to shape. Of course, once the plastic is in the right shape, you actually do want it to be stiff and not so flexible: ideally you want the plasticizer to go away. Because the plasticizers are very light molecules (indeed, because they are VOCs), they will evaporate, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re smelling in your car.Perfumes. Not all VOCs are bad! In fact, often times they have nice smells, and are harmless, which is why we use them in air fresheners and perfumes.Before I get off my soapbox, I\u2019ll say this: there\u2019s often a misconception in the public mind that \u201cchemicals=bad\u201d, which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Yes, some chemicals are dangerous. Some are extremely dangerous. But other molecules that somebody makes in a lab make our lives much more pleasant, and don\u2019t cause any harm. I just wish people would take time to learn the difference rather than saying that all chemicals are bad. ",
