            "answer_text": "A gas such as helium or nitrogen is slowly swept through metal or glass tubing. In series with that tubing is a small section where a particulate solid can have a small retention effect on certain chemicals. That section might contain a solid adsorbent such as charcoal or a zeolite clay or it might contain a porous solid such as ground up fire brick that has been treated with a liquid such as a low volatility plasticizer such that 25 wt-% of the solid grains are the organic compound. A volatile sample mixture is then introduced into the flowing gas and the individual compounds tend to spend a different amount of time interacting with the \u201ccolumn\u201d material. In a well designed chromatographic system you will end up with the inert gas being followed by that gas containing compound A of the sample, followed by a section of inert gas again, followed by compound B within that carrier, followed by the inert gas, etc etc. A \u201cdetector\u201d at the end of the column can note the difference in properties of these gas blends and a recorder electronically notes the separation, which then can be quantified. The composition of the sample is established by examination of the record output and through repetition of the separation with calibrations with known compounds. There are excellent books written on this analytical technique and I would urge you to obtain one for accurate details beyond these generalities of how gas chromatography works. ",

            "answer_text": "Gas Chromotography (GC) involves the vaporization of molecules. These molecules are then transported into a column using a carrier gas (typically an inert gas like He or sometimes a typically non-reactive one like N2). The column is typically coated with a thin layer of polar stationary phase. The more polar compounds will be more attracted to the stationary phase and thus will elute at a different time. The resulting spectrum will have peaks that measure the time when each molecule eluted and the area of the peaks will give a rough estimation of the amount of each molecule. ",
