            "answer_text": "Solute+ solvent \u2192 solution (a homogeneous mixture). Remember like dissolves like. In general polar solvent dissolves polar solutes and non-polar solvents dissolve non- polar solutes. For example 1. Water is a polar solvent and dissolves ionic salt (polar) [Polarity refers to the separation of charges including partial charges within the molecule.]  Transfer of electron leads to the formation of ions. Oppositely charged ions are held together by strong electrostatic force of attraction i.e. ionic bond if formed.  Molecules form crystals.  Water is polar solvent. When sodium chloride is dissolved in water \u2013 first the attraction force between the molecules are weakened. Then the ions are surrounded by water molecules as shown. 2.Non-polar solvents dissolve non-polar substances such as oils, fats, greases. Examples of non-polar solvents: carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), benzene (C6H6), and diethyl ether ( CH3CH2OCH2CH3), hexane (CH3(CH2)4CH3), methylene chloride (CH2Cl2). Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "When a solute is dissolved in a solvent, there takes place few changes in solute and solvent. The intermolecular bonding between the solute particles and solvent particles like, Vander Waals forces, dipole-dipole interaction,etc. are disturbed and broken and a new bond between a solute and a solvent particle is formed. This is energy dependent. If energy of disturbing the solute and solvent bonding is lower than the energy needed for interaction between a solute and a solvent particle, then the solute does not completely interact and remain separate . If it is sufficient for new interactions, then there will interaction between the solute and solvent. ",
