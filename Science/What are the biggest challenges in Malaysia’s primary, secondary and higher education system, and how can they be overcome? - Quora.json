            "answer_text": "Context: A day in a government school for a 17 year old (Form/Secondary 5) student. *Moral Education Lesson* Cikgu Robot: Class, please memorise the definitions of of these moral values verbatim because they will definitely come out for your SPM (the Malaysian equivalent of the O levels). Of course, these moral values like 'Belief in God' apply to all of us... Atheist? Is it an edible plant? \u2026Oh no no no, of course you can't rephrase the keyword 'hardwork' to \u2018diligence\u2019 - that would be nonsensical! And of course, just by memorising 32 moral values and regurgitating them makes us all better people!! What a good use of precious time and resources in school! *English Lesson* Teacher: *explains English in Malay* class please memorise these essays for the literature component of your examination. You haven't read the text? You don't need to!! *Chinese Lesson* Lin Lao Shi (Teacher Lim): Class we only have 1 hour to go through the following because next Monday is a public holiday and Tuesday I'm having a meeting and Wednesday there is a schoolwide ceremony which takes up class time and Thursday there's no class and Friday it's another state holiday. Oh wait\u2026 I forgot I only have a one-hour lesson with you weekly. so now I'll teach you how to write the 1000 character essays and the summary, how to read classical Chinese, how to write calligraphy properly, how to memorise the classical Chinese proverbs (and also their origins, their definitions, the meaning of the individual words\u2026.), and above all, how to at least pass in the SPM because let's face it, Chinese is notoriously difficult to score as compared to subjects like Math, English and the Sciences because only a specific minority takes Chinese. *History Lesson* Teacher: What? You haven't heard of Hitler, Stalin, or Gorbachev? Have no idea when the World War I broke out? No worries, I am not going to teach you that! You only have to worry about local history because Malaysia history is the only history that teaches you how not to repeat the past\u2026 Of course History is more important than the Math and the Sciences! It is now a compulsory subject (and you have to pass History to pass the SPM!)\u2026 Also here's the exam question for your open book three-hour Paper 3. Please print everything you could find on this topic and copy everything you found on the internet in your exam answer. *Math and Sciences* Cikgu Siti: Today I will spend the first half explaining the concepts in English and the next in Bahasa Melayu ok!

            "answer_text": "By far the most damaging practice is modifying the standards to fit the number of straight A students that the government wants to report that year. It just doesn't make sense when there's no standard to be consistent on. What's the use of the marking system when you can just manipulate it to achieve what you want to report? Example: Say 75 points out of 100 is what you need to get an A. If 90% fails the subject, they'll just adjust it to say hey why don't we lower the A requirement to 60 points and cascade it for all other lower grades? Voila you have now 50% who passes the exam! ",
