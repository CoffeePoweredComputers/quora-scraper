            "answer_text": "At the risk of sounding circular, it is when it\u2019s pure. Gold is an element, and when you have pure gold you have nothing but gold atoms. (Leaving aside the niggling point that in real life, no material is absolutely pure.). This would be 24 karat gold. However, 24 karat gold is quite soft, and for that reason is a poor choice for jewelry or coins. Other metals are added to make it harder, and when this is done, the gold isn\u2019t pure any more. I think the highest purity routinely used in jewelry if 18 karat, which is 75% gold (18/24). Krugerrands are made of 22 karat gold; back when the US made circulating gold coins they were mostly 90% gold (21.6 karat). ",

            "answer_text": "Gold (symbol Au) is an Element so it is pure. However has has been said, very pure Gold is too soft for most purposes. To give an example pure Gold 24 carat is so soft you can scratch it with your fingernail. I may add that soft does not mean light, Gold is very heavy / dense it has a density of 19.32 g per cm sq. For comparison Iron or steel had a density of around 7.2 g per cm sq ",

Finer purities are available for scientific procesess, but you'd never find jewelery made of the stuff. As far as purity goes in more metaphorical senses, that's up to your personal ideals. ",

It\u2019s also lustrous even when exposed to saltwater, corrosive fumes, etc., doesn\u2019t tarnish, and is malleable and can be easily worked with hand tools. Silver is relatively rare, also malleable, but easily oxidized. Platinum is almost or perhaps rarer than gold, but not nearly so malleable, and to the untrained eye, looks like silver, detracting from its appeal. And so it goes. Gold always stands out, requires no maintenance (LOL), and so was highly desired in both ancient and current times. It\u2019s a symbol of wealth as a result, pretty much always has been. ",

            "answer_text": "Gold is precious not because of its utility value so much as its history and rarity. Gold in ancient times was easily noticeable in streams, being metallic and the color of the sun. Its color gave gold a mystic and sometimes religious connotation, and also the fact that it never rusted or corroded. Ancient kings and emperors, usually seen as gods or emissaries of gods, claimed this mysterious metal for themselves, and gave it monetary value. It has forever since been the metal of kings, rulers, governments and the wealthy elite. That is why it is precious. ",
