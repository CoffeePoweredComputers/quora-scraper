            "answer_text": "Very, spacious. No, literally a vacuum. The average density of a nebula is below the average density of artificially created vacuum on Earth. But variations of density are sharp. If you are in a dense region, you may find yourselves in the center of a protostar in a couple million years. As small variations of density occur in a nebula, denser regions attract less dense, and as mass is concentrated, if the pressure become adequate, nuclear fusion will begin.  These pictures are taken from afar, and are computer enhanced to display the full range of elements in their respective abundances in the nebula. But there is nothing cloudy about being in one. ",
