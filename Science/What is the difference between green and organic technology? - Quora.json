            "answer_text": "A green technology is one which minimises the damage to environment. For example, In power generation using fossil fuel or even in the manufacture of Portland cement a lot of carbon di oxide gas in evolved. If this gas is captured and not allowed to pollute the atmosphere then the the technology becomes green. Alternatively if the entire power generation is by technologies like windmills and solar cells then you call these technologies green as they don\u2019t pollute atmosphere. Organic techniques are a subset of green technology generally applied to organic farming in which use of toxic pesticides, sanitising chemicals and fertilisers are avoided in farming and in livestock maintenance.
