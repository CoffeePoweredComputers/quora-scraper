            "answer_text": "Anytime a person or group accomplishes an external goal (a WIN) with zero regard for HOW it\u2019s accomplished, that person or group LOSES over time. This is because even the BEST external goals can be ruined and corrupted by a terrible HOW. The reason is: You can\u2019t directly change someone\u2019s true beliefs, you can only influence them over timeWe are sometimes too impatient to persuade, so coercion is often chosen over influencingCoercion forces empty verbal compliance which is meaningless when you lose powerIn a \u201cperfect world\u201d, there would be one true belief-system, which we all shared, aligning us on external goals. This would decrease the importance of HOW we accomplished anything, since logic could fix most discrepancies between the belief-system and the end goal. People sometimes forget that we don\u2019t live in this perfect world, so some feel justified in enforcing external goals on others based on their \u201ccorrect\u201d belief-system. The logical fallacy at play is that any rejection of their tangible goals or ideas is often interpreted as a threat to their very belief system (belief systems can be very deep or be very ego-driven). Again, because coerced compliance requires no patience, teaching, or understanding, it\u2019s shallow and lasts only until there\u2019s a shift in power. In the long run, this tactic always leads to failed external goals and, if there were initially good intentions, it likely includes a compromised belief-system. Examples: When the Catholic Church persecuted Galileo, they forced him into giving a worthless apology. They believed that any idea countering their explanation was a threat to their belief system, so a public observation of stars couldn\u2019t be tolerated. All this stemming from a belief system around Jesus\u2019 teachings. The Church won immediately. In the long run, Galileo got his message out and the Catholic Church lost a lot of credibility over time from this one event.When Robespierre gained control during the French Revolution, he was so heavy handed in enforcing a precise outcome based on his ideals that he actually turned against some of his ideals (they got in the way of the outcome). He had opposed Capital Punishment, but flipped his stance when he got anxious that some were undermining the Revolution. He encouraged thousands of prompt executions in a period known as the Terror, where many were executed for mere \u201coverheard\u201d words. He had other Revolutionary leaders executed as disagreement about how to best implement Revolutionary ideas was no longer tolerated (if your opinion was in the minority). Robespierre had \u201cwon\u201d until, one day, he found himself in the minority and his unwillingness to budge from his desired outcome led to a revolt, his execution, and many abandoned ideals.Today, extreme political protesters on all sides (nuff said).Today, abusively controlling people like Harvey Weinstein (nuff said).The WIN\u2019s here are always based on shallow, coerced compliance rather than true influence. When a person or group is no longer powerful enough to coerce, they have a lot of ticked off people to deal with. It also denies the way humans are built (see Joseph Campbell\u2019s hero\u2019s Journey). We all want to find our own meaning and most of us don\u2019t want it to be dictated to us.Most beliefs can be changed but there are no shortcuts. It\u2019s a long process involving patience & listening.People CAN NEVER be grouped and defined quickly. If Person A calls Person B something they\u2019re not, based on an aggressive interpretation of a word or action, Person B will stop listening because Person A has lost credibility. The 1st political party that learns this will see a surge of swing voters.We all evolve and we can\u2019t be defined by a point in time. Very few people believe in their 60\u2019s what they did in their 20\u2019s. The high school bully may be a charitable citizen.Finally, in the long run, HOW someone consistently behaves is much more inspiring than WHAT they are saying.There\u2019s no such thing as a perfect Outcome or Win if it\u2019s implemented in a way that denies the humanity of others. Over time the Win will become a Loss. ",

            "answer_text": "One thing that immediately comes to mind is winning the hand of a woman with Histrionic Personality Disorder. She was the best dressed, best quaffed, prettiest girl in school. She was the most popular girl in school. You can\u2019t believe you actually won her affections. You marry this gorgeous woman thinking your are the luckiest guy on earth. A hundred guys would have given anything to be in your shoes. At some point you realize your perfect situation is not so perfect. You are now married to someone with a serious personality disorder. Here is the criteria for Histrionic Personality Disorder: Behave or dress in overly seductive waysEasily influenced by othersOverly concerned with physical appearanceExcessively emotional and dramaticOverly sensitive to criticism (thin-skinned)Blame personal failures on othersConstant need for approval and reassuranceLow tolerance for delayed gratificationAttention seeking (self-centered)Overestimation of intimacy in relationshipsShifting emotions (others may see them as shallow)You then come to realize this person does not actually love or care about you and may cheat on you. She will spend you into oblivion without any concern for the ramifications of the debts she runs up. You have to walk on eggshells because she is overly emotional and will fight you on any situation. You are embarrassed when you take her to your company party and she is dressed like a prostitute (perhaps a high class hooker) and acts very seductive with your coworkers. At the party she has to be the center of attention and embarrasses you with her behavior. There are 80 pairs of expensive shoes in her closet and you can\u2019t pay the minimum on your credit card. At some point she may have an affair and leave you for someone who she thinks can take care of her lifestyle better than you did (if you get that lucky).",
