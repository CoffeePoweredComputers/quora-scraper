            "answer_text": "First, I admit to not being an engineer, so I'm sure the engineers on Quora will add to (or clarify) my response.  Both AM and FM transmit a signal via electromagnetic waves.  But they do it in very different ways:  as you know, AM stands for  \"amplitude\" modulation, and FM stands for \"frequency\" modulation.  How radio waves are modulated (altered or varied) depends on whether the signal is carried on the AM or the FM broadcast band.  AM radio provides a much stronger signal: the carrier wave on AM can travel for longer distances because it can adapt its direction to accommodate what is going on in the ionosphere.  But while the AM signal can be sent for hundreds of miles (WBZ Radio, a famous AM station in Boston, has been heard at night in nearly 30 states-- the ionosphere reflects radio waves best at night), the bad news is that AM radio signals are often prone to interference (static from stormy weather, interference from other stations, etc).   With an FM signal, it's the frequency (the number of times each  second that the current changes direction) of the carrier wave that  varies; the signal strength (amplitude) stays about the same.  So, an FM signal is not susceptible to noise or interference; it's much clearer and cleaner, but it's also much more local.  It is generally line of sight:  the signal is sent from point to point and can thus be blocked by a tall building or a mountain. (Many FM stations in big cities get around this by putting their transmitter on the top of a tall building, so the signal won't be affected by other buildings or land masses.)  Bottom line:  AM signals tend to carry much farther (hundreds of miles, in some cases) but they are affected by weather and other atmospheric conditions.  FM signals are usually much cleaner and do not get affected by static in the atmosphere, but they also cannot travel for long distances. ",

            "answer_text": "FM radio operates at higher frequencies than AM radio; that's just the way the frequencies were allocated. Did you ever notice that you can easily hear bass notes around corners, but treble notes don't carry as well? That roughly what happens with radio waves, too. Longer wavelengths (i.e. lower frequencies) tend to refract more than shorter wavelengths (i.e. higher frequencies), so AM signals can \u201cbend\u201d to produce a range that exceeds the distance to the horizon. Because of the frequency range allocated for FM radio, FM is often described as \u201cline of sight\u201d. The frequencies used for AM can sometimes \u201cskip\u201d or \u201cbounce\u201d from certain layers in the ionosphere. That can allow a signal to travel enormous distances -- sometimes thousands of kilometers. The effect is more pronounced for \u201cshort wave\u201d radio, but it can happen with AM radio. ",
