            "answer_text": "For a hydrogen bond: 1 Hydrogen is in Shell-1, so it has two bonding positions. One contributing (red spring), and one receiving located at 180 degrees.  2 Bond are where the outer electron of a 2nd atom finds an open path (negative valance) into another atom.  So, the electrons net-attracts to both nuclei - settlinging into a bond at a particular angle as the surrounding outer electrons repel each other making it like tongue-and-groove.   The nucleus has more electrostatic count (# protons) so attracts (blue arrow), but the surrounding electrons repel each other (red arrow) which gives the bonding angle stability (yellow arrows). 3 So, when you have a contributing Hydrogen, like H2O, the resulting molecule is proton-outward.  Only in gas state (rotating fast enough) do the looks like \u2018orbits\u2019 or angular momentum. In fact, that movement is the entire atom structure rotating - as a set. There are no Bohr orbits nor the related angular momentum concept. 4 However, that 2-electron Shell-1 for a Hydrogen bond, has not side stability (yellow arrow).  As such, these are easily broken (weak bonds). They are the major reason for \u2018stickiness\u2019 - glue, adhesives. 5 This leads to hydrogen bonds in any atom with contributing Hydrogens. That is certain places in the below cholesterol.  6 Most pairs are those two Pauli 1/2 of the hemisphere with the opposite electron sitting on the far side at 180 degrees. Both attracted to the nucleus (large # opposites, but as both negative (like-kind repel) wanting to be as far away from each other as possible.  7 So, that finally gets to your question. Sorry, you need the full background. The graphic from by Scrunched Cube Tools for SolidWorks at 1) shows Hydrogen has only one electron. It is a lone pair. Further, the receiving atom [Oxygen in H2O in 3)] must have a lone pair - to make that Hydrogen act as contributing at the open positiong [2)]. In H2O, the Oxygen has two lone pairs (negative valance) positions where 2 Hydrogen bond contributing creating 2 potential hydrogen bonds at the 180 degrees position. 8 My method gives not the Lewis diagram, but the 3D particle settling positions - much better than Lewis or VSEPR. I work to get 3D adopted in the science community. ",

            "answer_text": "The hydrogen bond is more prevalent in molecules where hydrogen is covalently bonded to a more electronegative atom, such as, oxygen (H2O), nitrogen (NH3) or fluorine (HF). In these molecules a dipole is formed between hydrogen atom and other electronegative atom (O, N or F); as shown in the figure given below:  Since the lone pair of electrons are present on O, N or F, they are attracted toward electron deficient hydrogen atom, leading to a weak attractive force called hydrogen bond. Without the lone pair of electrons on O, N or F, this type of weak attractive force will seldom happen with hydrogen atom. ",
