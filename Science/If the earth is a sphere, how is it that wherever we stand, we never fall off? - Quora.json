            "answer_text": "This isn\u2019t as crazy a question as it seems at first glance. Alright, it\u2019s pretty crazy, at least for the Earth, but not not completely out of the question for a small asteroid. Let me explain. First, let\u2019s correct the location. The place where you are most likely to \u201cfall off\u201d the Earth is at the equator. Specifically it\u2019s atop the mountain Chimborazo in Ecuador. The reason for this is simple. The Earth is round (duh) and it spins on its axis, an axis which runs through the North and South Poles. Since it makes one full revolution every 24 hours, then we can calculate the velocity of an object at the equator through space. According to Wolfram Alpha (thank you Mr. Wolfram), any object at sea level at the equator is going 463 m/s, west to east. Now, if you want to calculate the centripetal force required to keep those objects (including us) from flying off into space, you just need to use the centripetal acceleration formula. a(c) = v^2/r That says that the acceleration on an object needed to keep it from flying off into space is equal to its velocity through space squared divided by its distance from the center of rotation. Now, if we plug the numbers in (google them if you want to follow along) we get the centripetal acceleration at the equator is 0.033 m/s^2. Now, considering the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/2^2, that\u2019s not a whole lot. But here\u2019s an interesting question: How fast would the Earth have to spin in order for us to fly off into space if we\u2019re standing at the equator? Well, since we know the grav. acceleration is 9.8 m/s^2, and we know the radius of the Earth at the equator, we plug that into our above equation and solve for the velocity. Thanks to Wolfram Alpha again (seriously I love that website) we find that the velocity necessary to float off into space at the equator is 7906 meters per second. What the heck does that mean? It means that a day would only last 1 hour and 24 minutes (and 29 seconds)! Yeah, that\u2019s pretty fast. Actually, it\u2019s so fast that the shape of the Earth would actually change significantly. What??? Well, it turns out that the Earth is thinner through the poles that it is through the equator, for the simple reason that the material in a spinning object will tend to migrate towards the equator. This is why hurricanes and tornadoes and whirlpools have an \u201ceye\u201d in the center of them with less stuff present (one of the reasons, at least). This means that, not only do you feel lighter at the equator from how much faster you\u2019re moving (as opposed to at the poles), but you also feel lighter from being farther from the center of gravity. It\u2019s enough that a fairly simple experiment can determine the difference. So, what about that asteroid? Well, a small asteroid can be as small as 100 meters in diameter. If that asteroid is spherical in shape (almost guaranteed it\u2019s not), then the mass is around 1.6 billion kilograms, which is honestly not that much. As a result, the gravitational acceleration turns out to be a minuscule 10 micrometers/seconds squared. That\u2019s a million times less than Earth\u2019s gravity. Quick caveat here. I\u2019m playing fast and loose with the laws of gravitation. One, asteroids are homogeneous distributions of matter. In other words, the density isn\u2019t the same throughout. Two, small asteroids are almost never (read pretty much never) spherical in shape. That has a huge effect on how we calculate gravity. And finally, I used the density of large asteroids for my small asteroid. That\u2019s pretty much guaranteed not true. All that aside, this is still just a fun calculation that put\u2019s us in the neighborhood. I\u2019m not planning on using these calculations to land spacecraft on small asteroids. And if you do plan on doing that, please do not use my calculations. Do your own homework. So, how fast would that asteroid need to be rotating to throw you off into space? Only 3 centimeters per second! That\u2019s means our little baby asteroid only needs to complete one revolution every 2.6 hours!! So, obviously a little asteroid doesn\u2019t have much gravity, which is pretty easy to realize when you think that here on Earth there are hills bigger than our asteroid. And you certainly don\u2019t feel yourself stuck to them. So I guess the lesson is, if you\u2019re gonna land on a small asteroid, don\u2019t count on gravity holding you down. Bring a harpoon. ",

            "answer_text": "I love this question. It opens up so many possibilities! I'd probably stick to classical mechanics in my explanation...I'd start by saying \"down\" is just another word for \"the direction the earth pulls us\". You know which direction is down, even if you're standing on your head, because you can feel the Earth pulling you. Imagine: how would you know which direction was down if you jumped in the air and didn't fall? What if you fell into the sky, what direction would be \"down\" then? So the reason that people on all sides of the Earth stand on their feet is because that's the direction the Earth is pulling on them.  Of course, that begs another question: why does the Earth pull us? Well, basically every thing in the universe pulls on every other thing (we usually call \"things\" matter when we're talking about this sort of idea). Gravity is what we call the fact that things in the universe all pull toward each other. Weight is what we call the pull. Every bit of matter in the Earth pulls on you. Because of the way all the pulls balance out when you add them together, we're actually all being pulled toward the center of the Earth!  In empty space, there is no down: we feel weightless! If we were standing on the moon, we'd still have a \"down\", but it feels considerably less \"down-y\"--the moon is small enough it only pulls us about a sixth as much. On the other hand, even a basketball pulls us a little bit, so it's a little bit \"down\". But the ball doesn't FEEL down. Why? Well, for one thing, the Earth pulls a hundred million times as hard as the ball! And perhaps more importantly, we're strong enough to push the ball away, so it doesn't seem like \"down\".  So: where's the limit between things that are big enough to feel \"down\" and things that aren't? if we were drifting in space next to an asteroid, would it feel \"down\"? Well, sort of: an asteroid 5km across (about the size of the one that crashed into the Earth and led to the dinosaurs dying off) could pull hard enough to make you fall onto its surface if you didn't fight it--but, on the other hand, you could jump hard enough--or run hard enough--to take off like the space shuttle. However, in weird sorts of borderline situations like this, the way we describe things here on Earth doesn't quite tell the whole story. We could just as easily say that the asteroid is big enough to be pulled into our hands, but that we can push hard enough to throw it like a basketball! Since both you and the asteroid are in empty space, you can't tell who's pulling and pushing who--in fact, you're both pulling and pushing equally. The really cool thing? It wasn't until just a few hundred years ago that someone (Isaac Newton) figured this out--and we're still trying to iron out the details. One more interesting thing about the asteroid: the reason the Earth and moon are spheres is because all of the matter in them pulls on all the other matter hard enough to pull it all as close to the middle as possible. If you compare a ball to a cube, you can see how the cube has bits that stick out further--if you make a cube out of clay, and keep pushing the corners in until it's as balanced as possible, you'll have a ball. Asteroids, on the other hand, don't pull hard enough to make themselves into spheres, so they can be all sorts of weird shapes!  What happens if you rocket off the Earth and don't fall back down to the surface? Well, one possibility is that you just keep going. Another, more interesting one, is that--if you're just high enough, and going sideways just fast enough--you could be falling forever, but keep on missing the Earth! Try drawing it out to see how that might work. We call this orbit. There's no end to the questions you can come up with if you keep thinking about it. In fact, that's what scientists and mathematicians get to do...keep on finding more and more interesting questions. Have fun with it--curiosity is an amazing thing! ",
