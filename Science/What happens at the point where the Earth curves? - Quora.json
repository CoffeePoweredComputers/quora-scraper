            "answer_text": "It is a continuous curvature forming a sphere. Spheroid to be precise. Your vision depends on straight line view of objects. Light from any object has to travel in a straight line to your eye for you to be able to see it. Under your feet, you are so close to a huge sphere, you can see it all around for miles so you don't feel it. However at a distance, i.e. the horizon, the curvature dips gradually below your line of sight so it appears as if that is the point where the earth curves. However, that point as you approach it will maintain a constant distance from you as it is just a huge continuously curved sphere. ",

Due to it's rotation ",
