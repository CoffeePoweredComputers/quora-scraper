Heating a fat is normally just a phase change: from a solid to a liquid (like in shortening) or from a liquid to a runnier liquid (like vegetable oil when it gets glossy). Even if it burns, that's not the process necessary to add more hydrogen to the molecules to make them solid at room temperature. ",
