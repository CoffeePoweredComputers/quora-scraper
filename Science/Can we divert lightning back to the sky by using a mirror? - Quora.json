            "answer_text": "No I guess not. As you see, lightning is not a laser OT just a beam of light. It electricity and heat. A lots of it. The heat produced by lightning is as equal to that of the surface of the sun. So if u try to deflect it with a mirror, the mirror will blast due to the heat itself. And you will also get zapped and die instantly. SO PLEASE DON'T TRY IT ITS DEADLY. YOU CAN DIE  . ",
