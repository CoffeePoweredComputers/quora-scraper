            "answer_text": "The concept of rebirth is different in each religion. In reality there is no rebirth, because we do not have an immortal soul. In Christianity, Judaism ans Islaam: soul will go to eternal hell or eternal heaven based on its karma or deeds. There is no rebirth. Buddhism: The concept of a permanent soul is just an illusion. When you die, every aggregate o your being disintegrate. You are reborn as a pure consciousness. Consciousness has no memory. Only brain has it. So you will not born again with this memory or personality. Jainism have the same idea. You are just pure consciousness. Your name and personality is a false concept. Hinduism: There is also the same concept of consciousness. But the stories of people with memories of their past lives are false. It is not mentioned in any religion, but is made up by the people who do not understand the concept of soul or consciousness. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer, NO. There is no such thing has rebirth. Religiously speaking, concept of rebirth is reincarnation of a \u201csoul\u201d in a new form. Now that's just ridiculous. I'm an Atheist so I don\u2019t believe in concepts like god, or rebirth, etc. With that being said, consider this; one of the basic laws in physics says, \u201cEnergy can neither be created not be destroyed, it can only be transformed from one form to another.\u201d We all have certain energy at a molecular level. We costume food which in turn gives us energy to perform our daily tasks. When we die, we lose our consciousness but the energy we possessed\u200b can't get destroyed, it is utilised by nature (bacteria can feed of our bodies they in turn produce essential constituents for plants and food chain continues) . We were born to this Earth, and we shall return to it! ",
