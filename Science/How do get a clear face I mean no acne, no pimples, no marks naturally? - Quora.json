            "answer_text": "I just want to say to be careful with the recommendations you read here. I also wanted to get clear skin and thought that natural remedies were the way to go. For years I used things like a tea tree lotion, rose water toner, and a Lush face soap including a lot of herbs (including tea tree and rose) and my face was always breaking out. I thought to myself, wow, my skin is awful\u2014good thing I have these nice products or it might be even worse! Well, I\u2019m allergic to tea tree and rose. Two VERY common ingredients touted as natural solutions to skin problems. If I use anything with either of these ingredients I break out like crazy. It took me until I was about 23 to figure it out! So don\u2019t assume that everything that\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d will be good for you. To answer your question though, here are some things that HAVE worked for me (although that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll work for you): honey and cinnamon as a face mask, green tea or chamomile tea as a toner, and witch hazel as a toner. Another great option is oil cleansing. Basically, you take a mixture of oils and massage them into your skin for about two minutes. Then take a hot washcloth and drape it over your face to soften the oils, before very gently rubbing them off. (You can also use something besides a washcloth that\u2019s designed to be gentler on your skin.) I did this for about two years with a mixture of castor oil, jojoba oil and a little tamuanu oil. Jojoba oil is moisturizing and castor oil is drying, so you have to use both and adjust the ratio to find out what works for you. I originally did half and half but noticed that my skin was too oily so I upped the castor, and that worked perfectly. Tamuanu oil is very expensive but very good for acne and you only need a few drops. If you like you can try a different \u201cacne-fighting\u201d oil such as sea buckthorn or tea tree (if you\u2019re lucky enough to not be allergic!). Oil cleansing can make your skin break out at first before you adjust, but even during the \u201cadjustment\u201d period I could feel that my skin was loving all the rich nutrients and feeling softer and healthier. Many people like to \u201cdouble cleanse\u201d by using oils first and then using a more standard (gentle!) cleanser or micellar water to make sure all the oils are gone. I never bothered with that but if you have a very good cleanser you want to use, that might be a good thing to do! By the way, jojoba oil also makes a great body lotion after a shower and it\u2019s good for your hair as well. It absorbs well and won\u2019t feel greasy. I always keep a bottle around the house. ",

            "answer_text": "Acne can be caused by a slew of things such as diet, hormones, medications and/or dirty/oily skin. My profile photo is a few years old, when I was 17. You can see that my face was clear although it only shows half but it's the same on the other side. I wasnt really one to believe that all of this can go into Acne other than dirty and or oily pores. I get asked alot, even recently, what do I do to keep my face so clear. I always laugh because it was never something special, it was just always soap & water. I've been using Ivory Bar Soap since I was a kid and wash my face twice a day-- in the morning when I awake & right before I go to bed. Sometimes I can feel my face being oily and it results in me washing my face more than twice. Summer time, I washed it more due to all of the sweating. My diet was never good (I drink pop every day), I was on medication as a teenager due to depression and was under a lot of stress. But because I washed my face every day, I was fine. Everyone's body of course is different. My sister has super oily skin. Her only reason for having a face full of acne. She would try to use these advertised acne treatments on her face (Proactive, etc) but I remember a while ago reading somewhere that alot of these products actually causes acne to reappear so that you can continue buying their product. (Alot of chapstick companies are this way as well). I told her to just wash her face daily with soap & water. Shes been doing this for the past 2 years and it has cleared up significantly. The problem though when she washes her face is that her skin becomes super dry which means alot of healthy oil was being washed away as well. I recommended to her to buy a bottle of Aqauphor. It's a type of petroleum for severe dry skin but isnt as oily as vaseline. So when her face gets dry to the point her skin is flaking, I told her to just put a dab of Aqauphor in each quadrant of her face-- L/R Cheek, L/R Forehead and a dab on nose. SO LONG STORY SHORT, GET A BAR OF IVORY AND JUST WASH YOUR FACE 2X DAILY\u2026 ALSO, make sure your pillow/pillowcase is clean. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Friend, Acne / pimples is a most common skin condition and almost 85% of people get it at some point in their lives. Acne occurs when the skin pores are clogged by dead skin cells. Excess sebum or oil in the skin and bacterial infection makes it worse causing pimples, puss, blackheads and whiteheads.  All of our pores contain a hair follicle and a sebaceous gland, which produces sebum, our skin\u2019s natural oil. The body is constantly regenerating and shedding dead cells, but when those dead skin cells get trapped within the sebum of our skin, they combine to create noninflammatory acne. These are those black and white bumps on your skin \u2014 otherwise known as blackheads and whiteheads.

            "answer_text": "First and most important thing to have a clear face is to clean it every day irrespective of whether you are using make up or not. One of the natural possibilities is to use oil based cleaning method. As the name suggests it is based on vegetable oils. This technique is even known back in ancient days.  In order for this method to work you need to pick an oil based on your skin type (not every oil is suitable for every skin). Here is a list which shows different types of oils: LOW possibility for clogged pores - argan, castor, hemp, grape seed, mango, pomegranate seed, rosehip oils and shea butterMEDIUM possibility for clogged pores - almond, apricot, avocado, evening primrose, hazelnut, olive, peach, sesame oilsHIGH possibility for clogged pores - cocoa butter, coconut butter, linseed, palm butter, wheat germThe usage of non gentle cosmetic products every day can harm your skin and make it dry or too oily. How this method works - pick oils based on your skin type and rub it gently into your skin. What will happen is that the oils will dissolve the impurities leaving it nourished and soft. After that remove the oils with wet warm cloth.  Other possibility for natural cleaning is to use clay. Here are different types which you should pick based on your skin type Green - this clay is suitable for oily skin. It regulates the fat secretion and naturally matts the skinWhite - it is ideal for sensitive skin. It can be even used on babies and children and is perfect for every skin type.Red - can be used on moderate skin and has revitalizing propertiesYellow - suitable for aged skin, has lifting effectBlue - known for its hydrating properties is perfect for mixed to dry skinGray - ideal for very dry skin, makes the skin lively and elasticIt can be used as a cleaner mixed with rose water or as a mask, but remember - leave it on the skin not more than 10 min.

            "answer_text": " Usually to answer this kind of question, people start mentioning skincare products such as serums, lotions, and cleansers. Truth is that the process to obtain a healthy and beautiful skin starts from within (even though it sounds clich\u00e9). From within means the food we eat, but also our habits play a huge role. When I say habits I mean applying sunscreen for long sun exposures and avoid alcohol and cigarettes. One of the best thing you can do to purify your skin is to do high intensity workouts and sweat. Sweating is nothing to be afraid of. However, excessive sweating can make the skin break out, especially if the person is acne-prone. Use a gentle cleanser free from alcohol, fragrance and harsh surfactants (for example a micellar water). Once your skin is all fresh and shiny again, it\u2019s the best time to apply skincare products. In fact, the blood circulation is still increased from the previous workout putting your skin in a state where it is particularly receptive for treatments such as serums and moisturizers. Exercise is also great for your skin. This is mainly due to the fact that the effort and heat generated increases blood circulation and oxygen supply to the skin, which is clearly visible in reddening of the skin during exercise. More oxygen and nutrients in the skin also mean improved cell growth, which is reflected in an increased renewal rate of the cells. You will look younger with regular training! Furthermore, the increased blood circulation supports the removal of dead skin cells and free radicals. However, I need to add that if you are struggling with acne, unfortunately living healthy is probably not going to solve your problem. Acne has hormonal causes; you need to consult an experienced dermatologist in order to find a solution. I\u2019m a cosmetic chemist\u2026I will never tell you skincare products don\u2019t work; however, true beautiful skin comes from sacrifice and discipline like anything else worth pursuing. If you still would like to know which kind of skincare products you should buy on top of all this you can read this article I wrote on how to recognize good quality skincare: How to choose the best skin care products Hope this helps!

            "answer_text": "Getting clear skin requires following certain things daily.Achieving great skin does not happen in over night.Caring your skin sporadically does not result you clear skin. Along with care,you have to take care of your diet also. Follow Cleansing,toning,moisturising routine daily twice. Always apply sunscreen before step out of your home.For the evening rituals, you can remove dirt by using glycerine and then apply almond or any oil of your choice over your face.Then use your face wash to completely remove the dirt.Once or twice in a week use natural scrubber like sugar with honey or oats with curd.Then apply rose water or any toner.As a final step in the ritual, you can apply any moisturiser or LactoCalamine lotion as well. If you have pimples then apply tea tree oil overnight or wipe it off after 3 hours.If you have dark circles then apply Vitamin E oil or Almond oil around your eyes overnight to wipe it off before you hit the sack.Vitamin E oil removes dark spots as well.These are Spot treatments. Check out this post as well Kalaivani Velusamy's answer to How do I remove pimples and dark spots overnight? Based on your skin problem just seal your skin with the specified treatment for that before closing your evening ritual. Have Green tea regularly,drink lot of water,eat lot of nuts and cut down Junk/white sugar/Salt/processed food. Thanks for A2A by Prajwal and Garima. ",

            "answer_text": "I have answered something like this on another question but here it goes: How to treat any types of pimple, from normal zits to cystic monsters kind. If you have normal clear skin and suddenly a pimple shows up, or you can somehow tell a pimple is on its way to make its debut (be it from redness or you could feel a slight pain/bumps), you should not worry. Go to your kitchen, open your freezer, take an ice cube, and rub it for as long as you can on your (soon) pimple. I dont have problem with rubbing it directly on my skin because i am used of its coldness but if you are new consider on putting towel paper or tissue as a barrier between ice and skin. Now, if you belong to the unluckiest like me, who struggles constantly and keep having a war with monstrous cystic good-for-nothing cystic acne; i got you covered! Keep in mind that, if your cystic acne comes from bacteria or any severe inflammation inside your body, YOU NEED ANTIBIOTICS. Visit your trusted dermatologist to help you. Okay, let\u2019s continue with my trick for cystic acne. Exfoliate your face ONLY WITH CHEMICAL EXFOLIATOR. I highly recommend AHA and BHA from The Ordinary, but any other products your skin is suitable with is fine. As long as you are sure that the product exfoliate your skin thoroughly.Wash your face with normal water and favorite cleanser. For me i use cetaphil (gentle or oily types both products work great on me) and then i was my face again with warm tea (green tea/ black tea/ yellow tea, any will work just fine).Grab your ice cube and rub it on the concerned area. Do this as often as you can, at least in the morning and night.Benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin phosphate are your best weapon at night. DONT SPOT TREAT THEM. APPLY THEM EVERYWHERE TOPICALLY ON YOUR FACE IN JUST DECENT AMOUNT. Honestly, do this everyday whether you have pimple or not.Repeat the step 2 until 4 everyday. Step 1 only can be done twice a week.Five steps above will make your pimple \u2018debunk\u2019 itself. If you do this steps very early, you have a good chance that the pimple itself will never showed up and ended up becoming a small dry comedo then you can peel it off very easily. My skin now is almost flawless I hope I can help as much people as i can. I feel your pain. Everyone need to know this ",

Out of all the skin types, oily skin is more prone to acne, blackheads and pimples. As someone who has been studying Ayurveda for past four years. here are the few things that I have tried over time some of which has drastically helped me in skin care. Aloevera - It is Ayurveda\u2019s one of the most premium herbs for skin care. Known as Ghritkumari,use it in its natural form. A plant in your garden and your are set. Using the gel at night is your complete night care routine. It will make your skin glow like that of a kid. Consistency is the only key.I am not going to mention the numerous face packs that you can make at home. There are tonnes of DIYs that are already present on the internet. I just use mulatni mitti ( Fullers earth) with few drops of rose water and a tinge of turmeric. NOTHING BEATS THIS NATURAL REMEDY. Ty it out and you will see the results for yourself.Clean your face with milk every evening. Better brightening agent than most creams today.Go less spicy with diet to prevent breakouts. acne, pimples are basically due to the pitta nature of the skin ( a body type according to Ayurveda). To balance it out, add cool drinks(coconut water) to your diet.Wash off your face with cold water at least twice a day. It closes the pores and thus helps in preventing breakouts.Nothing topical will help if the internal environment is not favorable. Make sure to have lots of water and watery fruits to help balance out the body\u2019s heat.Most important point, If you think the breakouts are more than normal and are painful do not hesitate and go see a dermatologist.

Water helps maintain your skin\u2019s moisture level by keeping it hydrated and keeping pimples at bay. Drink at least 8 glasses of water for healthy glowing skin. Some tips to follow in your skincare regime: Cleanse your face well with a good mild oil control facewashExfoliate your skin with a good face scrub, preferably natural, at least one a weekDetox your skin with a good face mask at least once a weekKeep your skin hydrated, drink at least 8 glasses of water a daySpot treat your pimples with Tea tree oil diluted with water(patch test recommended)Invest in a good water-based or gel-based moisturizerDo not pop your pimples as they leave dark spotsThe main reasons for pimples include- Clogged pores: Usually skin pores get clogged due to exposure to dirt and pollution, excessive makeup products, not removing makeup properly and excessive oil production by the skin. Make sure to cover your face when stepping out, instead of using multiple layers of skin-enhancing products use one which does all the work, keep your face clean. Less water: Dehydrated skin produces more oil to make up for water and excessive oil leads to acne. Stress: Stress can trigger acne and can also make existing acne worse. Ever wondered why do pimples pop out at all the wrong timings, especially before an important event? This is mainly because of overthinking and unnecessary stress that we take. Keep yourself calm and worry less. ",

So you need an appropriate skin care routine. As far as washing your face goes, you should use a gentle cleanser, without soap. Rinse thoroughly with cold water and dab your face dry with a clean cloth. Anti blemish creams usually dry out the skin and that's not a good thing. There are other creams that are more soothing and they worked better for me as long as I used them consistently - I personally used a cream called \u201cKeracnyl PP\u201d by Ducray and it worked wonder, not that I want to advertize any brand in particular.

Official guidelines vary from country to country, in France it\u2019s said you ought to eat five servings a day.

Though one day while I was at work, as I often would sweat a lot, I decided to start washing my hands, and then my face, (with soap and water), and then after drying my skin applying some lotion to it. I would repeat this whenever I began to sweat, (about 4\u20135 times a day as an initial way of keeping myself cool), and it eventually became my savior. After about a few weeks of doing this I noticed that my acne had completely disappeared and that my skin was silky smooth and completely clear. People began asking me what I did to get such clear and smooth skin though did not believe me when I shared this information with them. They were too convinced that I was using ProActive or something of that nature. It was a gigantic boost for my self esteem and I have never had acne again since then. This will definitely work for you as well and after you achieve the same results, I just ask that you share it with anyone else who may be in need of an answer to their acne. ",

            "answer_text": "To get completely clear skin with no marks is going to be hard. Marks come with age and sun exposure so you can prevent it, but you can\u2019t get rid of them naturally. However, you can reduce the appearance of marks with different creams and topical treatments. You can also try to stop more appearing by using sun screen every day (even if it\u2019s not sunny), drinking a lot of water, eating healthily, and keeping your face clean. For acne & pimples, you want to make sure you have a good skin care routine. Here is an example of a skincare routine which should slowly work to reduce acne/pimples (remember, there are no quick fixes): Wash your face with a gentle cleanserUse a chemical exfoliator with Alpha-Hydroxy Acids in (Luminositie (you can find them on Amazon I think) do a good AHA serum). Stay away from exfoliating scrubs like St Ives - they cause damage to the skin when you scrub your face with them and open you up to sun damage.Use direct acids (such as Salicylic) or a Niacinamide cream which are great for cell turnover, reducing the appearance of pores, and reducing sebum productionMoisturise! This is so important. Find one that suits your skin type (oily, dry, normal, combination). If you don\u2019t moisturise your skin could react by creating more oil to make up for the fact it is dry.Getting rid of acne is not a quick thing, you need to spend time and energy and make lifestyle changes if you want to reduce the chances of it long-term. I hope this helps! ",

Those will make you break out more, cause microtearing on your face, and make your acne scars worse. I quit using mine about 4 months ago, and my skin has never looked better. Drink plenty of water (I add some turmeric extract to mine. Turmeric is a natural anti-inflammatory and you can barely taste it when added to a drink). You can also take vitamins (I take collagen occasionally, vitamin E, vitamin C, and iron) and supplements like turmeric capsules. These are all things that I do every day (minus the supplements, those I do several times a week) and the skincare can be found at just about any drugstore (or grocery store like Giant and Food Lion).

My recommended is at LEAST 97%, but 99% works best. If you can get hold of the plant, even better. However, unless you buy ready plant strips, you'll have to wait a while until the plant actually grows. It is healing, soothing and completely natural. You can use it as a mask, use as a moisturiser (if you have dry skin I would recommend topping it off with your usual moisturiser as it will dry out your skin) or as a spot/mark treatment. The reason it will be particularly good for acne is because it is antiseptic and anti-inflammatory. I started having cystic acne at the age of 19 and it took me forever to find a replacement for my benzoyl peroxide. I didn't want to use chemicals or medications on my face to aggravate it more. After a couple of days of using the gel, my inflamed acne was almost gone. It took the marks about 2 weeks to a month to completely fade depending on the size, degree of inflammation and whether or not I was picking it (one of my worst habits, please don't do this).

Well, I\u2019m 28, and I still have breakouts on my chin. I bought into the hype about raw ginger a few months back, and my face broke out the worst I had ever seen. I found pimples popping on my cheeks and alongside my jawline. No topical preparation, including Himalaya, would work, so I started looking on the internet and did a ton of research on how to get rid of these zits without using chemicals. I\u2019m someone who gives preference to home remedies rather than medicinal products. I found out acne can be due to lack of essential nutrients, too much oil on the skin\u2019s surface, or hormonal imbalance. I came across the benefits of fuller\u2019s earth and curd for all type of acne problems and decided to take a chance. Within a month, I noticed the pimples starting to disappear, and my skin becomes brighter and softer as I continue using it. Now I won\u2019t go without the remedy. Curd helps me combat my dryness issue while fuller\u2019s earth helps heal pimples. I\u2019m a true believer, and I have been using them since October 2015. ",

On top of that, it also minimizes the appearance of sleep creases upon waking up that have been linked by research to premature wrinkle-formation. In fact, a study by the Department of Dermatology in Medical University (Austria) found that a special type of silk textiles had positive results on back acne after wearing a silk shirt for six weeks. Although the silk fabric used for pillowcases is not exactly the same as these, we can infer from the study that silk is a better fabric than cotton when it comes to sensitive and acne-prone skin. I purchased my silk pillowcase on THXSILK website and it only cost me $13 and it really worth the price! My acne has decreased a lot and the silk texture is much more comfortable than cotton.  ",

Acne occurs when oil glands attached to the hair follicles are stimulated at the time of puberty or due to other hormonal changes. Here are some few tips on how to clean the skin: Put fresh lemon juice into a bowl. Dilute the juice with a little amount of water if your skin is too sensitive. Some cases, you don't need water so better use the normal juice. Use a cotton ball, dab the fresh lemon juice over the acne scars and pimple marks. Keep your face clean. Whether or not you have acne, it's important to wash your face twice daily to remove dirt, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin's surface. However, if symptoms persist, I strongly recommend to see an expert. That would be the best option! ",

There are some natural chemical peelers like sugar (glycolic acid), and citrus fruits (citric acid). One face mask for exfoliating and lightening skin tone that I love is Yogurt and lemon juice face mask. Add few drops of freshly squeezed lemon juice and mix with 3 tablespoons of plain yogurt, apply to your face and leave on for 10-15 minutes before you scrub gently. Then wash with warm water and apply a moisturizer. You will have to use such face mask for a while before you see visible results. Good luck! ",

Keep the massager vibration at low, since the bigger pimples can hurt with strog vibrations. Try using modules like those with soft comb type teeth, and something that has small round bumps. Finish with the attachment having plane surface. Shouldn't take more than 15 mins. Do this daily and you'll see the effects after a week or two. Then make it Alternative day.

If used regularly you can see results within a month. Be sure to use organic products ( aloe vera extract directly from the plant or a product from the market which has 70% or more aloe content and for sandal wood, it is better to buy the sandal wood stick from a ayurvedic store rather than buying the powder form). After the breakouts are gone, you might still be left with scars ( Acne scars) you can continue using chandan and aloe vera gel but I would advise you to include BIO OIL in your skin care routine ( use aloe in the morning and bio oil ant night, that way you can get the goodness from both products ). Having said that, it is also important to have good eating habits (NO OILY FOOD), drink plenty of water ( minimum of 4 Liters a day! ) and of course, a good nights sleep (as stress is often the cause of pimples on forehead)! EDIT : TEA TREE oil can be used on the pimple to dry it out, but this is not advised in the winter season since the skin is already dry (and sometimes flaky too) in this season! ",
