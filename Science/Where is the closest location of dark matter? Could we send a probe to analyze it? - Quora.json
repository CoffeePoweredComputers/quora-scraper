            "answer_text": "Here is the thing about dark matter: It may not even exist. We\u2019ve never seen it, hell, we\u2019ve never even detected it. We\u2019ve theorized it. Dark matter is something that is a bit misconstrued outside of the scientific community. You see dark matter is nothing more than the missing difference in an equation. That\u2019s it. When we look at other galaxies and the stars within them, we can make a lot of measurements. Two of the most important measurements are: We can measure how fast the stars in the galaxy rotate (technically, \u201corbit\u201d), around the galactic center.We can measure the amount of mass that galaxy contains by looking at the stars it contains (planets and other small objects will have a negligible amount of mass).Now, we know that the amount of mass a galaxy contains determines the strength of its gravity. Thus, we also know how fast stars at a galaxy\u2019s edge should be able to travel before they reach escape velocity and fling out into intergalactic space. The problem is: The stars at each galaxy\u2019s edge travel faster than the gravity should allow them to. By our estimations, the stars at the edges of all of these galaxies should be flung out into space. But obviously, they\u2019re not. Which leaves us with two possibilities: There is some hidden matter that we cannot detect which gives the galaxy more mass and therefore more gravity than what we would measure in the stars.Our fundamental understanding of gravity is wrong.And, since door number two means that we have to throw away a couple centuries\u2019 worth of theories that, as of now, suit every other purpose we have for them just fine, we assume that the first possibility is true. And we call that hidden matter, dark matter. We have no idea what substance dark matter is made from, where in our own galaxy we can find it, or even really if it exists at all. But for the sanity of humanity\u2019s understanding of physics, we\u2019re assuming for the time being that dark matter is a \u201cthing\u201d, and we just don\u2019t have the technology to detect it yet.

            "answer_text": "Good question. That's the thing about \u201cdark matter\u201d and \u201cdark energy\u201d. They\u2019re\u2026 \u201cdark\u201d. What that really means is that we infer their presence from other observations, such as the rotational behavior of galaxies and the accelerating behavior of the expansion of the universe. As a result, there's a sense in which we \u201cdon't really know what it is we\u2019re looking for\u201d. Is it all over the place, or just in clumps here and there? Is it truly invisible (like neutrinos)? Or is it just very diffuse and very, very cold \u201cordinary\u201d matter? That's the dratted thing about the \u201cdark\u201d stuff. We don't know how to answer your quesrion. For all the scientists actually \u201cknow\u201d (positively, based on direct observation), dark matter may be in the air you're breathing right now. Or you might have to send a probe to intergalactic space in order to sample it. \u201cDon't know\u201d is \u201cdon't know\u201d is\u2026 \u201cdon't know\u201d. As long as the stuff is Dark, the very fact you're able to ask the question all but precludes the ability to answer it. ",
