            "answer_text": "The maximum meaningful temperature is called the Planck temperature, 10^32K.  It's not really meaningful to talk about \"at the time of the big bang\" since the Big Bang wasn't a point in time, and the laws of physics cease to have any meaning at temperature scales that high because the discrepancies between quantum mechanics and general relativity dominate. The smallest time we can meaningfully talk about is 10^-43 seconds \"after\" the Big Bang (the Planck epoch), at which time the temperature was the Planck temperature. (\"After\" isn't really the appropriate word here, either, but no other word really applies so it's the one that gets used.) ",

That is, the Big Bang isn't a single event so much as a scenario where (i) the past is finite and (ii) at every moment of that finite past, the average temperature and density of the universe has been declining. We're still in the Big Bang, just the very slow, boring tail of it. ",
