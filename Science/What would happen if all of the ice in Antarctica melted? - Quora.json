            "answer_text": "Well first of all you could easily expect an rapid rise in sea levels all around the world, at minimum of 58 meters, according to this study [1] owning to the fact that during winter the Antarctic ice sheet holds 6.5 million cubic kilometers of ice.[2]  Consequently hundreds of cities all around the globe would be submerged underneath all the water displacing millions if not billions depending on how fast your \u2018ice melting event\u2019 happened along with it being a right headache for everyone, not just because of the \u201cwater in my house\u201d, but because it could potentially cause catastrophic heatwaves across Africa (as if it wasn't bad enough), leading to unpredictable and devastating weather and generally reworking nature as we know it. For a sense of scale if you take the 58 meters of sea level rise and bring it down to a comfortable 50 meters and go on this website: Global Sea Level Rise Map you can already see that large swathes of land will be rendered inhabitable and in simple words can be summed up as \u201csad!\u201d.  On a positive note your house could now be worth a lot more as a luxury seaside getaway Other effects of literally all the Antarctic sea ice disappearing would be that we would suddenly get a very new landmass which according to National Geographic would be very rocky and mountainous but habitable albeit with most submerged beneath the waves.  In regards to animals if the ice just melted away I would assume it would be due to an accelerated greenhouse effect so I reckon it would be safe to wager that the population of krill would explode and therefore whales too with a lot more diversity among all organisms present them as it now opens up the environment to not just highly adapted Extremophiles. An ecological disaster for some so to speak.  Antarctic Krill All things considered there is no doubt that many would die in the coming months from wars over territory and extreme weather but unfortunately this is not an everyone dies scenario.

            "answer_text": "Here are the average temperature graphs for Antarctica summer and winter.  Please note that it is always below freezing on this continent. See that little bit that is sticking out in the top left corner? That is where the weather station is situated that recorded the warm temperature record. Esperanza Base, on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. This is where the previous high temp was also recorded. As you can see there is a major influence from the surrounding sea and air currents that are not indicative of the Antarctic continent. The average monthly high temperature here is -1C. Compare this to the average monthly high for the Vostok station of -50C or the record low of -89C. For this outlier station of Antarctica, It will take another 150 years for the average high of -1C to rise to 0C (the freezing point) at the current rate of temp increase. That is if it doesn't start to drop which is more likely due to the solar minimum we are entering. In addition, ice shelves break off the continent as part of a cycle that is predictable and repetitive. The floating ice is eventually pushed away from the land by the glaciers that are growing and flowing behind them. The ice pack is undermined by the ocean currents working on them from below. There is a large number of volcanos situated under the ice and any activity here will also aid in ice pack movement activity.  Established Volcanoes under and above the ice.  This is where a large section of ice was calved in the last few years. Note the proximity to the higher temperature region and the volcanic region.  Antarctica will be OK. The breaking off of ice shelves does not add to sea-level rise as they are already floating. The announcement of a record high temperature is of minor concern. Please complete research before drawing conclusions on climate alarmist proclamations. Projecting what would happen if Antarctica melted is like saying what would happen if the moon fell on the earth. An unnecessary exercise in Climate hysteria. ",
