            "answer_text": "He only \u201cseems\u201d to believe it is hoax because you have fallen for the hoax. Let\u2019s have a deep dive. At a rally in South Carolina, President Donald Trump said Democrats are trying to use the coronavirus to damage him\u2014and called that \u201ctheir new hoax.\u201d He did not seem to be suggesting that the outbreak itself is a hoax but rather claimed that his ctitics are \u201cpoliticizing\u201d the situation to make him look bad.  If you believe Trump called the Coronavirus a hoax, can you find a clip of him calling it that? I mean, really try. If you can\u2019t could it be like evidence of the Loch Ness Monster - definitely exists, only can\u2019t quite find it this minute? So is there any evidence of this hoax [to politicize the outbreak to score political points]? Let\u2019s take a look at Opinion | A Complete List of Trump\u2019s Attempts to Play Down Coronavirus I\u2019m not going to go through the entire thing, but take a typical point it lists. Trump, however, repeatedly told Americans that there was no reason to worry. On Jan. 24, he tweeted, \u201cIt will all work out well.\u201d OK, Twitter has a 280 character limit, so 25 characters for \u201cIt will all work out well.\u201d is brief by anyone\u2019s standards. Without looking at the tweet, do you think he meant it would blow over? That\u2019s the accusation. Here\u2019s the actual tweet, and you can see straight away that he said a lot more, there is more context to \u201cIt will all work out well.\u201d that the NY Times left out to make it seem he was downplaying the threat.  What actually happened is the China did contain the virus, but lied their socks off about the transmissibility, such that WHO concluded from Chinese data it was difficult to catch. Thus, transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission. Persons who are symptomatic will spread the virus more readily through coughing and sneezing. https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200201-sitrep-12-ncov.pdf Which it total BS, and only found to be wrong based on Occidental cases. That\u2019s enough for now. ",

            "answer_text": "I have seen that crap so many times I wrote an answer and kept a copy. Now I just cut and paste: To this day the left, the media, and assorted uninformed people here on Quora claim Trump called the coronavirus a hoax. He said no such thing. While the country was distracted by impeachment, the Trump administration was busy addressing the coronavirus outbreak, taking various measures to limit the spread of the virus in the United States. Impeachment quickly faded, so they decided to aggressively politicize his response to the coronavirus outbreak. Joe Biden even called Trump\u2019s travel ban with China an overreaction, and accused him of trying to scare the public. \u201cThis is no time for Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria and xenophobia and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.\u201d President Trump responded to these allegations during a rally in South Carolina, calling the Democrats\u2019 politicization of the coronavirus \"the new hoax.\" The media jumped on this line, claiming that Trump called the virus, not the Democrats' reactions to it, a hoax. The lie spread like wildfire and Joe Biden even used the lie as a talking point on the stump. There was quite a stir when Politico\u2019s story repeating the false claim that Trump called the virus a hoax was flagged by Facebook fact-checkers as fake news, but other fact-checkers couldn\u2019t deny that the claim was false either.
