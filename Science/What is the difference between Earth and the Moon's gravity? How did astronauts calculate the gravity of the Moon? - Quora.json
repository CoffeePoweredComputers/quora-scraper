            "answer_text": "Gravity (or gravitational acceleration) of a body on its surface is calculated using formula g= G*M/R^2 where g=gravitational acceleration G= universal gravitational constant(6.674 30 x 10^-11 m^3kg^-1s^-2) M= mass of the body R=Radius of the body In case of the Earth, put mass of the Earth, M=5.972*10^24 kg Radius of the Earth, R=6.371*10^6 m gives g= 9.819532 m/s^2 In case of the Moon, put mass of the moon M=7.346*10^22 kg Radius of the Moon R=1.7371*10^6 m gives gravitational acceleration of the moon g= 1.624754 m/s^2 ",

            "answer_text": "The difference between Earth\u2019s gravity and moon\u2019s gravity is 1/6. It was also determined that the gravity of moon is inferior than Earth because the moon is revolving around the earth and also that the mass of the earth is more than that of moon. The scientists (astronomers) used practical and theoretical methods to find and determine it. pls join - info for space amateurs none of the content copied from google! ",
