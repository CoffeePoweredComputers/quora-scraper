            "answer_text": "Today\u2019s youth don\u2019t seem to know how to search for topics, how to brainstorm, how to categorize and find holes in our knowledge base. If Google doesn\u2019t know about something, it is assumed to be unknown. That\u2019s dangerous. There a great awakening coming, in that if we were to experience a serious setback in our energy generation, satellite systems, or climate change impact that eliminated or reduced the internet, the kids would be lost, unable to find, know about foods to eat, how to protect themselves, how to make potable water. Many don\u2019t seem to know how to write. Few know how to find a book, have patience to read a chapter, have interest in anything that is not electronic, moving, changing, changeable, colorful. There seems to be reduced interest in art. There is extreme interest in copying pieces in entirety or snippets. If they can\u2019t find it online first then maybe its not worth a few minute visit to see what it\u2019s all about. Perhaps 90% or more of kids under 4 in the US and other developed countries use digital technology more than their parents. Youth eyesight is suffering from red eyes, eye strains, tired eyes, blurred vision, too much smart phone usage. Kids are suffering from too much cellphone usage. I am as guilty about this as my kids. I have a five-year-old who carries her cellphone around with her and calls her Dad on Skype whenever her Mom leaves the house (though there are always other adults in the house), she doesn\u2019t call to say hello as much as she wants to feel she is with her parent (not to mention that her Dad is 5,000 miles away from her every day). So the cellphone is like a security device. Kids are suffering from technology-driven brain development challenges, problems with attention, learning languages, listening, hearing, and obesity from eating and sitting too much. ",

            "answer_text": "The technology which surrounds almost everyone in the modern society, affects both work and leisure activities. Technology contains information that many would rather it did not have. It influences minds in good and bad ways, and it allows people to share information which they would otherwise not be able to attain. Even if a person does not own a computer or have credit cards, there is information on a computer somewhere about everyone. The technology which is just now beginning to be manipulated and harnessed is affecting the minds of small children and adolescents in ways that could be harmful. It is affecting our immediate future. It also gives another form of communication and exchange of information which was not available before, information that is both good and bad.  Technology is one of the principal driving forces of the future; it is transforming our lives and shaping our future at rates unprecedented in history, with profound implications which we can't even begin to see or understand.  Many different elements affect how satisfied we are with our lives. The impact of technology on these elements can change how safe, healthy and happy people feel. Throughout history, people have looked for better ways to meet their needs and to satisfy their expectations. Technology has improved the way people feed, clothe and shelter themselves. Technology has also changed other aspects of everyday life, such as health care, education, job satisfaction, and leisure time activities.  People have used technology since they first chipped stone blades to improve their hunting. Yet some people call the current age the \"Technological Age\" because of society's dependence on technology. For the first time in human history, almost all the goods and services people use depend on technology. The products of technology are available to almost everyone in society. The economy of a country influences how the people of the county live.. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, there are many effects of technology on the youth. The youth of today has become tech savy and is unable to imagine a day without being surrounded by gadgets. The most important of all being the smartphone. Even I am using one while tapping this answer into the 5\u2033 screen. The positive side of being surrounded by technology is : There's better connectivity.There's an open platform for exchange of ideas.Internet has saved us many visits by bringing payments and purchases online.We can sit in our rooms monitoring the entire globe.Banking and other public services have improved.It has paved way for smart work, putting the hard work to rest.The youth has plenty of time to save(which unfortunately it does not).Thechnology has eased learning through various interactive videos.Lastly, technology has helped the youth prosper at a faster rate than our ancestors.As is the case with all stuffs, technology has its negative effects too. Opens up opportunities for the youth to waste unnecessary time.Has made the youth lazy.Has made the youth forget the importance of hardwork.Fed unnecessary stuffs into young minds.Excessive exposure leads to social conflicts.Misuse of information.Opens up opportunities for cybertheft.The emission of radiation that affects the young and vulnerable body.Well, these were some of the effects- good and bad- that technology today has on the youth. In my personal opinion, I think, technology is a part of the process we call development. Good or bad, it has made the present life much more easier and hence I vote in favour of good technology and its effective usage. ",

Both generation having a good and bad impact on technology and it\u2019s impossible to live without technologies now a days. It figure out the prominent acknowledgement in youth today\u2019s life as we can say by giving an example that the use of technology from a very younger age helps in schools, due to the fact that it helps students want to learn, as well as makes it possible for each student to learn at their own pace. Additionally, it allows learning to become more interactive than it has ever been before. Advantages are many as it makes the student if they want to know something they can look it up on the Internet and in just a few seconds have an answer. They literally watch out that the parents talking the help of internet in doing some project work or some making home remedy they also follow the same. This will only lead to future generations becoming more and more introverted and technology obsessed in the years to come. And their is one more impact that our RANLETHON EDUCATION is giving to younger once the ability of working with ROBOTICS. This kind of technology is good and adorable for the student as the generation are becoming that much powerful in skills of technology filed the more upcoming generation the more upcoming with new technologies GADGETS and controlling the world with ROBOTS. Our team members as In \u2013 Indian Institute Of Technology Kharagpur \u201c Mr. Sagardeep Debbarma (COO), Mr. Abhishek Singh (CEO) and Mr. Suresh Singh (CMO), have introduce this ROBOTIC way of learning to the student by providing them the knowledge of this kind of education in the technology world so that student can come-up with the success in this ROBOTIC filed. There is no escaping technology\u2014 society just needs to learn how to use it in a way that is more beneficial than it is harmful. ",
