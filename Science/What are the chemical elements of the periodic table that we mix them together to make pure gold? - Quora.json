            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, none. Pure substances are substances made of only one element, or type of atom. Mixing two substances together means that they are no longer pure. The substance they create, however can be defined as pure. So unfortunately there is no way of mixing elements to create gold. You can, however, speed them up, such as in the Large Hadron Collider, and smash two elements, say Calcium and Praseodymium (Atomic Mass 20 and 59 respectively) to literally combine the atoms and form an element which has an atomic mass of 79, which is gold. I am not certain if that is entirely correct, if you will get gold from those two elements, but it is the same method used to create new elements such as Oganesson (Atomic Mass 118), so I assume it will work for smaller elements too.

            "answer_text": "Gold is a chemical element: it is composed of protons and neutrons in its nucleus, and orbiting electrons. The number of protons determines the type of element. There are 79 protons in each atom of gold. Chemical reactions, that is, mixing together of other elements, have no effect on the elements themselves. A great deal more energy, the energy inside exploding supernovae, is necessary to alter the composition of an element. All the gold in the universe comes from these stellar cataclysms. So although alchemists tried very hard to find a chemical reaction that produced gold, they were not and could never have been successful. On the other hand, their work produced the foundation for modern chemistry, a much greater gift. It is possible to reproduce, on a very tiny scale, the nuclear reactions that occur in supernovae. We actually can transmute elements, albeit a few at a time. But the cost is enormous, and will never be profitable. The benefit of this work is improved understanding of physics. ",
