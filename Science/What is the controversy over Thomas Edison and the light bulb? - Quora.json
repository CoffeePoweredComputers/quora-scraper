            "answer_text": "The only controversy over Thomas Edison and the light bulb is that people love to state that Thomas Edison did not invent the light bulb and then make some smart remarks about Edison. While others like to look at his place in history as a visionary. People love to argue about who invented something. Success is not always creating entirely new ideas, but often success is taking existing ideas and putting them to work in new ways, taking them to new heights. There were more than twenty inventors that filed patents for various versions of the incandescent lamp before Edison, and there have been dozens of inventors that have filed patents for incandescent lamps since Edison. Edison's invention was a break through in the long process of experiments and discovery that lead to the practical light bulb. Edison took the ideas and theories and created the practical light bulb that lasted long enough to be useful. His first attempts lasted a little over half a day, but eventually his efforts led to a bulb that could burn for 1,200 hours. The patent that made Edison famous was U.S. Patent 223,898 filed on November 4, 1879 and granted on January 27, 1880. Edison had 424 patents concerning electric light and power. Edison\u2019s ideas went way beyond perfecting the light bulb. He realized that for the light bulb to be truly practical, there needed to be a system to bring power to the light bulb. The creation of the Pearl Street station in lower Manhattan in 1882 was the catalyst for the modern electric utility industry.  Who was Thomas Edison? What were his contributions to science and how did he die? ",

            "answer_text": "THomas Edison did NOT invent the light bulb. He was about the 50th person to produce one. His only contribution was the carbon filament since he wanted bulbs to have a high enough resistance to work with his impractical 115 volt DC power distribution system. In fact his demonstrations were rigged because at the time he had so many production difficulties. He remains one of the most overrated inventors of the 19th century mostly because of his efforts at self publicity. ",
