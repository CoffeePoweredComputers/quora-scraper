            "answer_text": "Not sure which one is best but you can see the ranking either here by a local newspaper or by Times Higher Education (THE). We have several Public Universities in here and a lot of Private Colleges and/or Universities. Below shows the ranking of Malaysian Public University.  University of Malaya (UM) was in top 100 university worldwide a few years back. Anyway, It actually depends on your field of study. If you are into science, medical, your choice would range on UM, UKM and USM. Engineering, computer science, would be in UTM, Universiti Teknologi Petronas (UTP). Islamic studies, IIUM. Accounting, management, business studies, UUM. Please be noted that this is just a very rough and little information given. A lot more detailed research on these universities and others as well is needed in order to know more. I may be wrong or slightly incorrect in informing above paragraph to you. But I guess now, you know where to start and what keyword should be googled, right? Not to mention try to contact certified counsellors in your home country too to know more about this, or you can also directly contact the universities you\u2019d like to know more about. All the best. ",
