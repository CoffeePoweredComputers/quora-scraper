            "answer_text": "Face mask are now the symbol of so many things and to show up in political rallies demonstrate that the US needs more distribution of testing,the fact that it's not a time to relax mandates but to use masks to further the economy. The addition to the protesters cause is the best opportunity now since Rodney King back in the 90's because Law Enforcement is showing a better commitment this time by their own account in public. Anybody coming to a support rally needs to wear a surgical face mask so they at least look serious about COVID19,President Trump would do himself and the public watching, a service to himself,and the voter if he wants to gain votes by apologies in public for calling this disease a hoax which was a terrible show of disrespecting most people,considering the death rates in the US keep going higher than most original estimates. It will give the President's voice a sense of humility,and show a willingness to correct mistakes which got him elected based first on the economy,and reflected by investors confidence on Wall Street with historical highs in all three indicators. Showing up without a mask on only reinforces past false optimism and the contempt that people saw,by their own President should never happen again,and people seemed to have been right on being critical about. Before I thought his return was a given to win and he's been here almost four years and I would rather see the Republicans in office facing China to make better trade agreements and finally put an end to Police brutality whether it's racism or not. Racism as an institution only increases the division of wealth and has been too long a factor that stops economic growth. ",

            "answer_text": "The wearing of a mask in the U.S. has become a political statement. On the one side, you have the scientists and doctors, asking for people in public to wear a mask to protect others. Then you have Trump, who refuses to wear a mask. Why does he forego wearing one? He\u2019s making a statement, still trying to convince his followers that Covid-19 is no big deal. It\u2019ll all just magically disappear. Everything is fine. He did a great job, seeing to it that it\u2019s not as bad as it could have been had he not been in charge. All illusion, of course. This leaves his followers with no choice but to follow his lead. They believe that he handled the corona virus very well. For them to wear a mask has somehow become an insult to their Dear Leader. In short \u2026 they will NOT wear masks. ",
