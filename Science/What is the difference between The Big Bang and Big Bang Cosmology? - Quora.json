            "answer_text": "Big Bang Cosmology an era of the Universe when the cosmos is expanding from the pressure of radiation and matter.  Big Bang Cosmology is sometimes called Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology or Friedmann-LeMaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology.    Big Bang Cosmology was discovered through the ubiquitous recession of all distant galaxies relative to us that was first discovered by Edwin Hubble. In addition to the recession of distant galaxies, the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis have led to precision probes of the expansion of the Universe back to early times. The Big Bang is the extrapolation of Big Bang Cosmology back to .  However, no one really believes that this actually happened.  There is now strong evidence that the Universe was in a different phase known as Inflationary Cosmology before entering Big Bang cosmology. ",
