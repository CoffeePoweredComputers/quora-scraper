            "answer_text": "JJ\u2019s Q: \u201cWhy does gravity slow down the expansion of the Universe?\u201d This question gives chance to logically introduce more proof of gravity and the \u2018expanding at an increasing rate\u2019 universe. Answer: Gravity causes contraction at an increasing rate, or if expanding, the \u201cslow down of expansion of the universe\u201d. Logically, gravity is empirical. And most would agree gravity would logically \u2018slow down\u2019 expansion. Expansion that is perceived because of the redshift observed spherically all around us. Gravity & Light- Yet what if the \u2018expansion\u2019 is nothing but a \u2018mis-perception\u2019 concerning redshift/light, and, i can prove it? Would you change your mind about \u2018the universe is expanding at an increasing rate\u2019 in defiance of gravity? Dark Energy- Mysteriously being done by some opposing force called Dark Energy. Dark energy opposing gravity/physics and never has a spoonful of dark energy been in attendance or has where it comes from been explained\u2026.empirically. Years- For years my work increasingly proves the universe is contracting at an increasing rate, logically due to gravity. i say- Expansion is a misinterpretation of \u2018redshift\u2019, and, erred reliance on light to dictate what is theorized/explained. Mistakes- Based on the \u2018expansion theory\u2019 mistakes are inevitable. Mistakes simply because of the misunderstanding about (expansion) space and distance, related to light\u2019s measurements verse gravity\u2019s empirical affects. Pioneer 10 & 11- The Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 anomaly is one such inevitable \u2018mistake\u2019. My lab- Simply by the NASA mistakes/anomalies The Theory of Everything and its contraction theory is confirmed. ToEGravityLightpaperP1011 The P 10 & 11 anomalies shared by the \u201cUlysses and Cassini spacecrafts have brought out the existence of an anomalous acceleration towards the Sun with a value of aA = (8.74\u00b11.33)\u00d710-10 m/s2 (Anderson et al.. 2002a; 2003)\u201d The universe, my lab, proves contraction rather than the belief expansion is right\u2026if expansion was right there would be no anomaly. Anomalous acceleration - is the \u2018slowing\u2019 of the spacecrafts\u2019 trajectory. Unexpected by NASA/science so they call it an \u2018anomaly\u2019 instead of error because they checked every possible cause over and over\u2026.a consistent anomaly found in all the data. Alarming- This would not seem so alarming except, both P 10 & 11 were built/programed to precisely manage flight mechanics\u2026especially acceleration/trajectory. And note, the anomaly is found in all 4 spacecrafts\u2019 trajectories/acceleration. Predicted- The ToE and its contraction theory predicts such error/anomaly will occur. Why? The NASA trajectories/acceleration is based on Hubble\u2019s expansion relating to the space and distances; leading to the imminent error in trajectory/acceleration.  The Gravity & Light paper # P1011 page 4 simply shows the difference is \u2018expansion distance\u2019 and contraction theory distance. In short layman\u2019s terms, the NASA error has to be reconciled with facts the \u2018anomaly\u2019 proves. By the flight trajectories the facts-actual-contraction get reconciled to the perceived- planned-expansion. Radiation- Granted, NASA/science has addressed the issue and agreed the anomalous acceleration is due to radiation\u2026a similar radiation used to explain the end of a black hole radiating to death\u2026poppy cock. Such radiation could never explain the anomaly as indicated; the radiation should be less as time progresses, the anomalous acceleration is increasing\u2026and what else is increasing?\u2026expanding at an increasing rate! Therefore- The anomaly is related to the \u2018expansion theory\u2019, the error/anomaly was ensured by relying on expansion theory space/distance, don\u2019t rely on NASA for long range trajectories- theory. Gravity is empirical- The ToE is gravity dependent, though gravity force may decrease with distance, it is infinite. The expansion theory via Hubble\u2019s expansion and STR-GTR is light dependent. The ToE Gravity & Light papers address the differences, and, the differences explain the anomalies and the differences in expansion and contraction of the universe. Summary- Gravity does slow expansion and it speeds contraction. douG Ref ToEGravityLightpaperP1011 Gravity - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Nature does not answer\u201dWhy?\u201d questions. Science can do no better. In the model of General Relativity, expansion and gravity are just the shape of spacetime. One has no grip on the other. Whatever \u201claws of physics\u201d gives mass the ability to produce gravity, gives the Universe the requirement to expand. And recently, expansion has been accelerating, getting faster. ",
