            "answer_text": "They can collide with eachother, elastically, changing their velocities in accordance with the conservation of momentum.They can collide with the walls of their container, applying a pressure to it, bouncing off like billiard balls, with no change in their KE.If at least one of the walls is movable, like a piston, then the pressure will do work upon it, decreasing the average KE, and causing cooling.",
