            "answer_text": "The formula of Ferric chloride is FeCl3 Ferric Chloride, also know as Iron(III) chloride, and Iron trichloride is an industrial scale commodity chemical compound. It is a common compound of iron in the +3 oxidation state. Physical properties: Anhydrous ferric chloride is a salt, which in general present an orange-brown color. Sometimes, the ferric chloride crystal can have a dark green color. Chemical properties: Ferric chloride is formed by the cation Fe^3+ , which a metal transition element with d-orbital available to accept electrons, thus the ferric chloride is a weak Lewis acid and it can be used as catalyst in organic synthesis. Preparation: 2Fe(s) + 3Cl2(g) \u21922FeCl3 (s)2FeCl2(aq) + Cl2(g) \u21922FeCl3 (aq)",
