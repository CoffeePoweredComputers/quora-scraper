            "answer_text": "As fire is just a result of atomic transitions of elements rather than an element itself, it doesn't have a symbol. But the recipe for the fire can be certainly shown. Fire is the result of combustion of organic material and oxygen. For exampleCH4 + 202 -- CO2 + 2H2O  But the colour of the fire is directly related to quantum physics. Literally every objects emits light. You, me and everything around us. But the reason we can't see us glowing is because we glow in infra red. Our body temperatures are too low to glow in visible spectrum. If combustion of such object is clean anf if its temperature is high enough it produces a blue light like in the case of candles. Or if combustion is unclean it emits a lot of smoke disturbing this blue light. All the red glow, orange glow that we see every day are in between clean and unclean combustions . ",

            "answer_text": "Fire is the result of a chemical reaction, called combustion. At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. Fire emits heat and light. In order for combustion and fire to occur, three things must be present: fuel, oxygen and energy (usually in the form of heat). Combustion is a chemical reaction chemical that occurs between a fuel and an oxidizing agent that produces energy, usually in the form of heat and light.  A combustion reaction is a type of chemical reaction where a compound and an oxidant is reacted to produce heat and a new product. For example, the commonly used propane gas burns completely when it combines with the oxygen in air to form carbon dioxide  and water.  There is no \"chemical formula\"  for Fire. ",
