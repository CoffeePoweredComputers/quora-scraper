            "answer_text": "The Aeneid is one of the greatest works of literature produced in history. Centered around Trojan hero Aeneas, a minor character in Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey, the Aeneid offers an alternative interpretation of the Trojan War, one that frames Romans as the direct descendants of brave and valiant Trojans. The story is compelling and craftily drawn out. Virgil engages the audience in a deep and twisting plot that sees Aeneas\u2019s fleet hop from island to island only to face even more troubles. Pro-Augustan propaganda is skillfully weaved in throughout; Virgil spends a good deal of time articulating the strength of the Roman Empire and Augustus via divine prophecies (such as in the Underworld, where Aeneas observes all the great Roman generals and emperors). Yet Virgil\u2019s greatest strength is his luscious poetry which compliments the engaging storyline. Virgil exhibits impressive command over multiple literary devices and metrical patterns, ranging from writing consistently in dactylic hexameter (without much use of syncopation, or condensation of syllables for metrical purposes) to alliterative onomatopoeia (\u201cmagno misceri murmure\u201d to describe a booming storm) to chiasmus and tmesis. Virgil was a masterful innovator in literature; prior to his work, Latin poetry was primarily written in couplet and focused far more on alliteration and metrical patterns. Virgil\u2019s ability to synthesize techniques from all branches of Latin literature was truly unparalleled in this sense. As for the story itself, which is what I assume the OP is asking, we follow Aeneas for twelve books. A divine prophecy has foretold that Aeneas and his Trojan warriors will bring about the destruction of Carthage and establish an empire (Roman) in Italy. This angers Juno, who holds Carthage close to her heart and in turn becomes intent on destroying Aeneas and his men. From the get-go, it is clear that Aeneas is a blemished hero: he has little control over the divine forces that are using him as a pawn in their own disputes and is easily distracted by love (Dido) and menial affairs. His apologies to those he may have wronged are half-hearted and uninspiring, albeit truthful (Dido in the Underworld) and often seems clueless and ignorant of the chaos around him (it takes divine intervention to get him to escape Troy during the Greek destruction). Eventually, a series of twists and turns brings Aeneas face to face with Turnus, a sworn enemy and last man standing in the way of the establishment of Rome. After Turnus had been defeated by Aeneas, all the Trojans were being able to found Rome (sorry about the last sentence, just wanted to write a Caesar-esque sentence to cap off my reply). ",
