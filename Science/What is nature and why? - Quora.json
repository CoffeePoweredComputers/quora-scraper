            "answer_text": "Nature is a vast, closed, fully integrated, living system we exist in. This system is built on, governed by strict, unchanging Natural laws that sustain a fragile balance and homeostasis life and optimal development depends on. In this system - which encompasses the whole Universe - all parts, elements are instinctively integrated, existing in a special \u201cmutual guarantee\u201d, each automatically making calculations, existing only to help sustaining the general balance and homeostasis for the sake of life and optimal development. Human beings are given a very special, unparalleled role, purpose in this system. We have to consciously, proactively and methodically develop into becoming the system's only, independent, conscious and objective observers. For this role Human beings need to posses a very unique duality. On one hand we have to be independent, \u201coutsiders\u201d in relation to the system as opposed to everything else that are by default integrated. Then on top, against this opposition we need to acquire full integration into Nature's system - by integrating with each other's first, again and above our inherently selfish, egotistic, distrusting and exploitative nature. When we consciously, methodically - through a special purposeful and practical educational method - reach this duality, becoming the independent, conscious, \u201cinsider\u201d witnesses, observers of Nature, we will receive the answer to \u201cwhy\u201d: we will understand the purpose and goal of the system and also what our true, Human purpose is in it.

            "answer_text": "In principle everything sounds good! In the 19th century the British empire convinced the world all the benefits the colonies benefits from the colonialism. Gandhi who was the inspiration to Martin Luther King believed in passive aggressive opposition pointed out that freedom, self determination and economic equality is a human rights. When the British government invited Gandhi to tour the economicly deprived areas that was effected by the Indian resistance that Gandhi was the lead organizer of. Gandhi was approached by a labor leader who pointed out the deplorable condition hundreds of thousands were due to the Indian leaders resistance movement. Gandhi in a low voice replied. There are three hundred million Indians suffering from your policies! The basic principles of British policies were: Using colonies to provide low cost natural resources to Britton. Britton would use it's industry to make products out of those resources, than Britton would trade back the finished product to her colonies. It all sounds great! What a nice colonial power Britton was! Untill we analyze the trade! Britton controlled all aspect of the business cycle. This allowed them to devalue the natural resources the colonies we're providing. Britton also controlled transportation, and the products colonies we're allowed to import. This total control of the colonies forced the colonies into a subservient economic condition. Today Britton has few colonies, most of the former colonies are self sustaining free economies. Do I think globalization is a good thing? Well yes, and no. It brought progress to many cultures, it also ushered in different type of misery. Globalization also highlighted the ever greater appetite of greed driven Enterprise who are able to morphed into other entities to benefit not the global environment or human kind but guarantee ever greater profits. It is not the globalization at faults but these organizations who suck of great profits, and the nation's inability to control them. ",

            "answer_text": "The basis of globalization is based the theory of comparative advantage. Comparative advantage allow each country to concentrate on those activities (such as manufacturing and services) they are most profitable for them compared to their other activities. Thus every country benefits from globalization regardless of how competitive they may be. For example, take the US and Bangladesh. The US is more efficient at both manufacturing and services than Bangladesh, but services is more profitable for the US. Thus it makes sense for the US to concentrate most of its efforts on the more profitable service industry rather than manufacturing. Manufacturing is thus left to other countries, like Bangladesh, even if it is less efficient at it than the US. Bangladesh chooses manufacturing than services, because it is more profitable for the country (because of cheap labour) than services. This is why that high tech service company is based in the US, and why your clothes are made in Bangladesh these days. So globalization does allow for more opportunities at the country level, but it is also opportunistic because countries sacrifice entire industry sectors to maximize their profits, thus hurting those workers in the abandoned sectors.

            "answer_text": "The original question was \u201cIs globalism opportunistic by nature\u201d. My question is why did Quora change the question? Globalism is opportunistic by nature. There is no need of such a defining word unless a nefarious agenda is being hidden, and many of us now know that there is a nefarious hidden agenda to maintain the status quo of a few elite families holding all the wealth and ruling all the people. A complete perversion of the intelligently designed, universal system of free will. Human beings are exponentially awakening around the planet to the evil that has manifested in the top echelons of power. Evil is not a universal attribute, Kindness is. Our universe is the solar system and the greater universe is the Milky Way galaxy. The intelligent light energy that pervades the solar system is an enhanced version of the intelligent light energy that pervades all star systems of the galaxy. The benevolence of the galaxy energy was enhanced with kindness in the solar system. This is not a fairy tale as it is easy to see when we open our hearts to unconditional love. The nature of planet earth is to create abundance, kindness, and joy. Trees are an example of abundance as are the ocean\u2019s and the rivers. Greed, selfishness, pedophilia and hate are not natural ways of being for the mass of people. 2020 is a year of double action and 20/20 vision,20/20 hindsight as well as 20/20 foresight if we want to perceive the future of humanity. The first action was an evil and nefarious one that was created by factions of the ruling families. As is the way of evil, their plans got stuffed up, and COVID-19 was accidentally released before it was made lethal. Now the disgusting people who run governments around the world are not sure how to react. The world Health Organization and The UN are showing their true colors as instruments of evil. In March 2019, humanity began the shift into a new age of positive consciousness development that will continue for the next million years. In 1990, planet earth shifted into becoming positive, fourth density consciousness so that she could support humans when we also shifted. There have been humans in the past that experienced higher consciousness, but they never had the unity of planet earth as she was being retarded by the evil that was present in humanity. The evil that we are now witnessing cannot be maintained on planet earth as it is unsustainable. Those people who are following the path of evil are not destined to remain on planet earth. ",

            "answer_text": "Originally the term was exclusively used to mean the nature of something, that is its inborn (or innate) characteristics. Then along came propositions like \u201cA gas expands to fill the space available to it\u201d. Because in doing so a gas was said to be obeying the dictates or laws of its own nature, the word was given a capital letter, Nature, as if it was some realm with its own laws mirroring human polities with theirs. Science was now considered the study of this realm. ",
