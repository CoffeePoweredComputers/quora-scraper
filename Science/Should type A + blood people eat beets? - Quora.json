            "answer_text": "and know the blood type diet is nonsense. There are 36 human blood groups and many blood types. Why should the ABO blood group system, one of the easier ones - one gene and four types - determine what you eat rather than the other 35? Should you \u201ceat right for your Duffy type?\u201d or \u201ceat right for your RHCE gene?\u201d BTW the diet is for the ABO group not plus the Rh group RHD gene (the + or - suffix on your ABO type). People should eat what they need to stay healthy. That is a varied diet low in sugar high in veg and fruit with milk, cheese, nuts, pulses, eggs, fish and with meat in moderation. (Humans need haem iron, that\u2019s in muscle tissue. Getting sufficient iron as non-haem from plants is hard work.) The blood type diet is an indulgence amongst some sections of the western population whose privileged income and lifestyles are far removed from the problems facing the bulk of the population in their own countries let alone elsewhere in the world. I wrote a longer answer here, which looks at some of the evidence studies and what is being done in some parts of the world to improve the uptake of iron from poor and/or limited diets.How does your blood type determine whether you should eat more or less meat? Don\u2019t think I gave this reference, this is what Harvard Medicl school has to say about blood type diets. Diet not working? Maybe it\u2019s not your type - Harvard Health Blog Don\u2019t know what you mean by beets. Beetroot? It\u2019s good for you, eat it if you like it and if not don\u2019t. ",
