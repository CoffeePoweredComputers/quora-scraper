            "answer_text": "I am currently working in this field and can give you some insights. Yes you can buy ready-to-spray superhydrophobic canisters at relatively cheap price at HomeDepot such as this one: Rust-Oleum Stops Rust 18 oz. NeverWet Multi-Purpose Spray Kit-274232 at The Home Depot  Why aren't we seeing it on everything? I think there are three main reasons: 1) technical limitations, 2) health, safety and environmental considerations, and 3) whether the added benefit is more than the cost and the trouble of applying these coatings. Let's talk about the first one first, technical limitations. Current approach to achieve superhydrophobicity is to reach the cassie state (extra reading: Wetting), exactly like how lotus leaves achieve superhydrophobic properties:   The main drawback of these surfaces is that they have very small features, usually in the nanoscale, and the nanfeatures are fragile. The physical implication is that they can be easily damaged from external forces, such as scratches and wear and tear. Out in the nature, lotus leaves float on top of water, there is no animals to damage their surfaces, therefore they are safe from the physical damage. However for a lot of the surfaces you mentioned (toliet bowls, car windshields, bodywork), their normal usage usually consist of physical wear and tear, and that makes a major bottleneck of employing superhydrophobic coatings to them.  That does not mean there is no good application for these coatings, external wall of houses and satelite dishes are nice applications---because they do not face physical scratches usually:   Health, safety and environmental considerations Remember nanofeatures? A lot of them are achieved by adding nanoparticles to the surface to make those nanofeatures. And those nanoparticles can easily come off, get onto your skin, inhaled into your lungs, reach to the environment. The long term negative effect of nanoparticles is still not very clear, but it certainly isn't helping with promoting the technology yet. Next, whether the added benefit is more than the cost and the trouble of applying these coatings. Fact is nowadays, most of the wet weather gears are already hydrophobic to begin with. With a little bit of shaking, I can get most of the water off my textile jackets. Is there really much need to make them superhydrophobic? I'm not so sure, a decent modern day outdoor wear probably has hydrophobicity similar to this, and to me this is pretty damn good, I wouldn't get wet beneath wearing these textiles:   Lastly, humans are lazy. If something is good enough, you wouldn't go through the trouble of buying something extra and apply them just to make them a little bit better. There are a lot of such niche products that target just about everything, but it's hard for them to become the mainstream. We'd rather buy something that is ready to go, actually a lot of the hydrophobic material you use everyday have been treated to impart hydrophobic or oleophobic properties.Unless it can drastically transform the performance, it is not worth the trouble.
