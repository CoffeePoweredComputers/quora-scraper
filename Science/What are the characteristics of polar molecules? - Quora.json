            "answer_text": "Some characteristics of polar molecules are discussed below: 1) Polar molecules should have opposite charge. 2) They should have some dipole moment value. 3) They should have electronegativity difference. 4) One the basis of solubility principle \u201clike dissloves like\" they should be soluble in polar molecules and insoluble or sparingly soluble in non-polar molecules. 5) Due to opposite charge bearing, polar molecules have strong electrostatic attraction, due to which their melting and boiling is high as compared to non-polar ones. 6) Polar molecules are formed by combination of metals and non-metals so have ionic bond.

            "answer_text": "Polar molecules \u2026. A polar molecule has polar bonds (usually). A polar molecule is usually asymmetrical. It has a net dipole moment (the vector sum of the individual bond dipoles). A polar molecule has a partial positive charge at one end, and a partial negative charge at the other. A polar molecule is attracted to other polar molecules (Keesom forces). A polar molecule can induce a charge separation in a nonpolar molecule and have a weak attraction (Debye forces). Polar solutes will dissolve in solvents consisting of polar molecules. Polar solvents will often have lower vapor pressures and higher boiling points than nonpolar solvents (but there are boatloads of exceptions). ",

            "answer_text": "The positive end of a polar molecule will tend to attract the negative end of another polar molecule. Polar particles in the gas phase will behave somewhat less ideally than non-polar particles. For compounds with comparable molar mass, polar compounds will tend to have higher melting points and boiling points than non-polar compounds (in which the only attractions between particles are van der Waals; forces). This is especially true when hydrogen bonding can occur (only between hydrogen and oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine). ",
