            "answer_text": "A great website I use is MRUniversity, they provide great resources for economic courses such as Principles of Micro/Macroeconomics, International Trade, and Development Economics, and etc. I used it for an independent study in Development Economics my first semester in junior year and it has been extremely helpful. Although George Mason University (the institution associated with MRUniversity) has been associated with the Austrian School of Economics, the website is pretty subjective for most of the times. A great part about MRUniversity is that at the end of each teaching video, it will show several academic sources of research papers mentioned in the videos, which are always interesting to read. Another good resource is Jason Welker\u2019s The Economics Classroom. I used it last year for AP Micro/Macroeconomics during my sophomore year, and it saves my life when I was struggling at night with AP Micro. It has really good explanatory videos for principles of Economics, but I don\u2019t know if it has any good stuff on deeper level of Economics materials. If you want deeper level stuff, check out the Intermediat Microeconomics materials I am currently using for my independent study: Econ 101. It has free PowerPoints, assignments and solutions, and Midterm exams based upon the Georgetown Intermediate Economics course. It is pretty helful when it comes to more advanced economics, given you have a Multivariable Calculus and Principles of Economics background. Ah, and Free Online Course Materials (MIT Open Courseware) and Economics textbooks are always helpful as well. Hope this helps, and have fun thinking about Economics! ",
