            "answer_text": "Well, yes, it is a good approximation but if you\u2019re interested in a more exact answer, you have to take in to consideration the closest distance that any two molecules of radius r and volume V=(4/3)*pi*r^3 can be within before repulsive forces dominate so they are unable to approach any closer. This distance is 2r (Atkins\u2019 Physical Chemistry, 8th Ed.) so the volume excluded is actually (4/3)*pi*(2r)^3, which is equal to 8V or 8 times the volume of a single molecule (for any two particles). At any given time, there can only be up to n/2 collisions of particles, where n is the total number of particles in a container. Therefore, the total volume excluded is half of the calculated excluded volume above. Excluded volume, then, is equal to 4V or 4 times the volume of each molecule. However, the volume of a gas molecule is small enough that a factor of 4 will not be greatly missed. ",
