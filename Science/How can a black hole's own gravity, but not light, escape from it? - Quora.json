            "answer_text": "Gravity does not prevent light from escaping. Light has no mass and is not subject to gravity. Light can be diffracted by matter around the sun. Black holes are not holes since they are argued to contain dense mass and should be called black bodies. These black bodies do not prevent light from escaping, simply because no light is observed here on earth from that space. Light can be simply extinguished, blocked, refracted, or pointed a different direction, etc. The last thing one should propose is that gravity is at fault. The original photographs of starlight during an eclipse in the 1902\u2019s used a simple camera mount on the ground and did not control for the different atmospherics between morning and noon so the proposal that gravity bent starlight is mistaken. An actual astronomy telescope in England photographed the same episode and saw no bending at all. Indeed, light is not subject to gravity. ",

Speed has nothing to do with it - light (has mass/energy) and gravity (is a force). Where is the escape velocity and how is it measured? The idea that nothing can travel faster than light is a Theory until proven otherwise of experience\u2026 The question arises is WHAT would happen relative to the concept of time and space if one or something traveled faster than light in the play of gravity how might that warp the fabric of our sense of the Universe of our experience. IFs are fun & THENs are guesses & THEREFORs await to be called into the play of the game we can experience the action of a cause and effect result. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it turns out that General Relativty is a lot more mathematically sophisticated than pop science books and YouTube videos have led you to believe. The Einstein Field Equations of General Relativity relates the curvature of space-time, represented by the metric tensor, to the energy, mass and momentum in space-time, called the stress-energy tensor. The metric tensor in turn allows for the calculation of geodesics, or allowable paths through space-time. In a black hole, which is presumably what you are talking about, the allowable geodesics in space-time all lead towards the center of a black hole once anything is past the event horizon. That is, the only allowable paths through space and time through a black hole lead to the center, and none lead out of the black hole. If someone has told you it has to do with escape velocity, that person is basically telling you Santa delivers presents at Christmas. ",

Light does NOT do anything. It tdoes not travel. Light speed is not even about light traveling. Light speed is the velocity of the interaction of objects. Light is, as such, on its own, it-self, the interaction of objects, namely the transfer of property (energy and corresponding, corrrelated, aequivalent mass) from a light source to a light receiver.
