            "answer_text": "Can we control technology ? For now\u2026 yes. At least some of us. Technology is getting easier in one way, and harder in the other. Let me explain what I mean by that. There are automated tools, that help engineers to do their projects. For example creating software, this is my area, so I relate to that. There are RAD - Rapid Aplication Development systems, that let programmers create software much easier, with lots of libraries, visual tools for creating GUIs, etc. Apps created this way can be released before client gets home from specification meeting. But the app is heavy, simple messanger can occupy more memory, than 100 computers had when Windows 98 where current system. The other thing is that when something goes wrong, it is hard to debug when the code is not yours, but it\u2019s inside ready made library. Technology goes in such a way, that IT student will not have a clue about how CPU works, how to code in assembly language. I like to compare it with Hogwart. You can learn spells and accompanying wand movements, you are a wizard. But somebody created these spells, technology behind a wand, an accelerometer perhaps with small microcontroller, but the wizard does not know it. He has only book of spells, the knowledge how it really works is gone. Technology will become a very hermetic knowledge for real experts, but most engineers or advanced users will only see the surface and the rest is magic. The real danger is AI, especially when humans will loose expertise. But I mean real AI, and we don\u2019t have it yet, and I think it\u2019s a matter of at least 50yrs to get there. ",
