            "answer_text": "From the big bang moment or just all of a sudden, no more gravity? The first case is almost impossible to conceive.  Minds much greater than mine do not understand how gravity really works, nor does anyone have full understanding of that awesome \"let there be light\" moment.  My logic tells me that that would have pretty much been it.  Just one incredibly bright flash of light that no one would ever see. There could be no mass.  Whatever might form, would be massless  and continue at the speed of light which might  or might not be the same  as it is in this universe with the basic fundamental constants of the universe having been so profoundly messed with. The second thought of instantaneous weight loss is more fun to think about, but it would be terrifying for the few moments before you died.  The Earth's atmosphere would almost instantly be sucked into the vacuum of space as everything not firmly fastened to Earth's surface headed skyward, being thrown off by the centrifugal force of the Earth's rotation.  People, vehicles, buildings, boulders, animals, and all manner of debris would suddenly be set adrift in space.      And the oceans, OMG! Before the water froze  it would swirl over the land in the most astounding tsunami imaginable flying skyward with fish and whales and all of its life quickly going into the final deep freeze.      Earth, just spinning, no longer orbiting the sun would be on a lone path through the universe casting off bits of itself for a short while.  Short because it would not outdistance the Sun in time to escape the consequences suddenly having no gravity would produce there.  Stars are held together by gravity and it is the gravity that allows nuclear fusion to proceed.  All that heat and energy pushing outward with nothing to restrain it?  Kaboom!!!!   And then its atomic fires would cease functioning as the sun expanded, very quickly moving beyond all the former orbits of the planets, probably at or near light speed, making toast of the planets that had not drifted far enough away.  That might be all of them.  The gas giants, Jupiter and friends, might not even be giants anymore, just gas.  The same thing would be happening everywhere  else in the universe, though the awesome, short-lived spectacle would take years to reveal itself to any aliens who were lucky enough to be in an unaffected region of space. How would this affect black holes?  WOW!  That's quite a thought.  I suppose all the light that couldn't escape before, would suddenly have no more constraints.  Black hole explosions would dwarf those of the stars.  The super-massive central black holes of galaxies would release enough radiation to disintegrate almost anything that was still frozen and hanging together by chemical bonds or crystalline structures.  It would be quite awesome to view.  There might also be a sudden change in the universe's expansion.  Either it would suddenly stop or suddenly be completely out of control.  Your guess is good as mine. The bottom line.  Complete and utter devastation of the entire universe.  ",

            "answer_text": "It is impossible for the universe to exist without gravity, well not a universe that follows any of the laws of existence that we know. Forget about 1 + 1 = 2, that can\u2019t exist even as an abstract if gravity did not exist. If understanding information we realize that there is no law of the universe greater than another law, all the laws are equal, a change in one law means the other laws can not exist. This universe is made up of all the laws of the universe, if one law changes, it is not this universe. How can it be. It is like trying to get to a theory of everything without human beings, oh, let\u2019s just take out gravity, that universe can not exist, why don\u2019t we just take out 1 + 1 = 2 and ask would the universe exist? You can add infinite depths of complexity by saying the very fact of you reading this at this moment means the universe is as we understand it, all the laws of the universe. If you where not reading this the universe would not exist. Everything follows the laws of the universe. If you who is reading this at this moment was not reading this it means a law of the universe does not exist. Everything is probability, that probability affects everything from particle behaviour to human behaviour. If your grandmother was crippled by a fall at age 4 you would not exist to read this, but the chances the steps she took agreed with her surviving to have you, you who is here now understanding that if you did not exist, the probability function is so complex it must reach to the dawn of the universe, for you not to exist means an event took place at the beginning of the universe, such by chance you don\u2019t exist, but you exist and are reading this, for events to have been different is not chance, because chance has already determined that you exist and will read this at this moment, it is the future we do not know. For events to have been different means something else we can not comprehend. Gravity exists for what ever reason, if it did not exist, that means something that is fiction, it cannot be not there, when we know it is here. If it was not here we would not exist to ponder such a question, it is therefore a meaningless question at best. That existing can not be taken out. Even if the worst dictator wipes out people and their names, it does not change the fact that those people existed and died as we all will naturally or unnaturally, but it is all natural, better to say moral or immoral, you cannot remove humans from existence, that they exist means they are natural. If they poison their planet that is a natural cause of the universe, otherwise they would not, and humans have great influence over their chances, they have a mind, but that mind consists of the same stuff that makes a wooden chair, at the very beginning probability and chance allowed some electrons to be in us and others in trees, and others comprising make up of Jupiter. All laws are the same, the concept of 2 + 3 = 5, is no less than E = MC2 if we understand existence, the reason in simple terms is if any of the 2 concepts did not exist, it would be an existence we could not comprehend, the laws of existence would be different. Don\u2019t try and make one concept in terms of the other in terms of information, tell us how 2 + 3 = 5 is less of a concept or greater of a concept than E = MC2, you will wreck your head and tell lies, because both concepts have the fact that if either is not correct, it\u2019s meaningless to our existence, our existence was determined by chance at the very beginning, if any event was different that means there was a moment when 2 + 3 was not equal to 5, we exist because 2 + 3 = 5, we exist because E = MC2, we exist because of every law, everything exist be every law, if one law was changed if 2 + 3 is not equal to 5, how can 1 + 1 = 2 or 9 + 3 = 12, it is impossible, to take out 1, means all can\u2019t exist. Something for you to think about, that the electron exists, gravity exists, you can\u2019t take out one, you can\u2019t take yourself out of existence and imagine a universe without yourself ever having existed, you write a will because you know the process you leave a will for that that could have never existed without your existence, Not to put humans in the center of the universe but if humans did not exist it is impossible for the stars to exist, but then again if the stars did not exist it is impossible for humans to exist, because chance says we exist, and you are reading this. You can not debate away something that exists, it\u2019s a false debate, a false theory of everything, don\u2019t use the word everything and when somebody shows you everything must include humans, you qualify everything, what kind of politics qualifies everything instead of saying we where wrong, everything has to include everything, it must be based on information, it can only be based on information a theory/ a discipline of everything. Taking out a single piece of information means it is not our universe, it can\u2019t be comprehended because it doesn\u2019t exist, to the extreme every spatial dimension of existence would be affected, it doesn\u2019t exist. Any answer can never be proven because we can not recognize non existence. ",

            "answer_text": "The Universe will not exist without gravity. Gravity is a binding force continuously acting to bind matter. The Big Bang generated lots of energy flying in all directions. Gravitons , the particles mediating the force of gravity, absorbed almost most of the energy released by the Big Bang. There were no other particles. Gravitons started biding together to make particles, the first they made was a proton. An electron was a by-product of making protons. Sometimes electrons collapsed on protons and made neutrons which are composite particles, not stable if left alone. Then gravitons combined these particles to make atoms of hydrogen gas. The force of gravity is least understood among all fundamental forces. It is regarded as the weakest force in the Universe. That is not the case. If we consider the examples/events in the Universe caused by gravity, we can conclude that it is the strongest force in the Universe. It is this force that gave birth to all the stars in the Universe, all the galaxies in the Universe. We see the structure in the Universe that is due to gravity only. This Universe exist due to gravity. It is this force that squeezes hydrogen atoms in the belly of stars to ignite fusion reaction. Lots of energy is released from strong force within atoms. Explosions, neutrons, protons flying, rising temperature, yet gravity keeps the star intact and spherical. No other force including strong force, electromagnetic or weak nuclear force , no matter how strong and large, can counter act the force of gravity in stars. Indeed, gravity is the strongest fundamental force in the Universe. This Universe only exist due to gravity. ",

Big because, without gravity, it would have been expanding faster for the past 13.4 billion years. Boring because, without gravity, we would never have emerged from the \u201cDark Ages\u201d after Recombination \u2014 all the hydrogen and helium atoms would just have followed their individual trajectories, occasionally bouncing off each other, but never forming stars; as a result, no nuclei heavier than helium would ever have had a chance to form (and probably only a very small trace of helium, at that!). e.e. cummings would not have wanted to go there.

Gravity is omnipresent; there is no where in our Universe that had an absence of gravity, so a galaxy without it is meaningless. Our Universe? No, gravity is present, so the question is moot. A universe? We just don't know. We have only a single data point from which to extrapolate and we don't know all that much about even that. We could conjecture other universes that lack gravity, but we just don't know enough yet to take such thought experiments beyond speculation. As others have said, the balance of fundamental properties of our universe is quite fine, with little room for variation without our universe failing. It's likely that there are other metastable conditions, but we have no real means to test any hypothesis. ",

Gravity is responsible for things like planets, stars, star systems, galaxies, clusters and super clusters. The only elements present would be lots of hydrogen, maybe some helium and lithium, but without stars, no other elements would form. The matter in the universe would fly out at incredible speeds at the Big Bang, and without gravity, nothing would hold it back, so space would be even emptier than it is now. Basically, the universe would have existed for a mere blink of the eye before suffering near immediate heat death. ",

A big bang is the point where all \u201cthings\u201d exist as energy; since gravity is a bi-product of mass and matter begins to appear then (albeit small), there is\u2026 and always must be\u2026 of varying amounts.

A: When you start playing around with the values of the physical constants, including gravity, you get conditions under which universes would be very short-lived, either collapsing back into themselves almost immediately after their big bang, or expanding to nothingness quickly after their big bang. A stable universe existing for a long time, such as ours, would not be conceivable without gravity. ",

There were no masses per se, so what is today the intrinsic property of mass [called \u201cgravity\u201d], did not exists as such. With the formation of particles having mass, comes then gravity in the traditional roll as an implicit consequence thereof. So in one sense, there has always been a negative energy field, but in the NOW state of the universe, the roll of gravity is better defined. ",
