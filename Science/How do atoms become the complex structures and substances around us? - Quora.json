            "answer_text": "That's the field of chemistry. I'll give you a brief explanation because it's a very vast field which takes several years to even understand basic concepts. They'll teach it in highschool and middle school. So anyways, let's get started : Atoms are the smallest building blocks of elements (like carbon, iron, gold, etc) which have the same chemical and physical properties of that specific element. anything smaller than atoms lose that properties and I won't go to details about that. Atoms bound together and form molecules. Molecules are a little more complex than atoms. For example water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom which are both gases. Properties of oxygen and hydrogen are completely different than water molecules. And in another field of chemistry which is called organic chemistry some molecules bound together to form even more complex molecules( the DNA is the most complex molecule). If you want more details grab a chemistry textbook and start reading from the most basic things and eventually read about more advance things. There are plenty of textbooks and other sources online and even some youtube channels. (like khan academy, it's really good) Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "All Atoms in the Periodic Table of the elements have unique chemical and physical properties. By selecting the appropriate elements and allowing them to react under special chemical and physical conditions, you derive the building blokes from which everything around us is constructed. You can make practically everything out of the original atoms in the Periodic Table. Witout exaggeration, the whole Universe is made out of these simple building blocks, including the human body. Even probing into the Microworld you find that protons and neutrons make all atoms; and all protons are made from still smaller subatomic particles called quarks; with a proton made up of two-ups one down quarks. Simply, the whole Universe is made up of two-ups and a down quarks . ",

Depending on what\u2019s available in their neighborhood as well as required energy, atoms combine to satisfy the electrons. Various combinations of atoms make other things possible. One of these is the replication of molecules, including very complicated molecules that have to do with life itself. Now someone should make a cartoon \u201cproving\u201d that electrons rule everything. ",

Atoms with different numbers of protons in their nucleus make up the elements and everything is made by combining these elements into compounds and molecular formulas. This is accomplished by ionic bonds (moving electrons to another atom) and sharing of electrons (covalent and metallic bonds). ",
