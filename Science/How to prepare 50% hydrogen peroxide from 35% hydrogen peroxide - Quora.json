            "answer_text": "Remove the excess water by induced evaporation. This is not a recommended process unless you have an intimate knowledge of chemistry before doing such or are friends with a chem major at least. 35% is dangerous enough by itself 50% and up can get downright NASTY!! I can not begin to list the things that may react with it not to mention skin. Trying to pump 50% H2O2 in volume through a pump which had been used for pumping an organic chemical and was jammed, reacted with the organic and we had an uncontrolled pressure release. That was my not first acquaintance with the chemical but it was my most memorable watching all the little white specks and patches appearing on my hands and my face. I assumed my face as the red hot needles burning into my hands were doing about the same to my cheeks, thank god for safety glasses. Just a thought before you induce your evaporation and make it highly energetic and stronger. :| Cheers, Wayne ",

            "answer_text": "Distillation is one approach to concentrating hydrogen peroxided. However, one should do this distillation at pressures less than atmospheric (e.g., 20\u201330 mm Hg, what you get with a water aspirator). The reason for this is that hydrogen peroxide decomposes at temperature dependent rate. The higher the temperature, the more decomposition occurs. Reducing the pressure will reduce the temperature at which the water will distill off (to near rm temperature). As Stefan Gebhardt states, you will have to assay what is in the pot (not the distillate, that will mainly be water) to determine the concentration. A second method is to put it in the freezer. The water will freeze leaving liquid behind. Decant the liquid and assay. Note that with this approach you will lose the stabilizers making the hydrogen peroxide more dangerous to work with. Note that 50% hydrogen peroxide is not to be played with. It is a powerful oxidizer, potentially explosive, and not for those who do not know what they are doing. ",

            "answer_text": "This is something you should not even attempt. The only way that I can think of that MIGHT be safe is to study the phase diagram and selectively freeze out either water or peroxide and manipulating the phases to get the desired concentrations. The possibility of explosions is high. I don\u2019t know why you want to do this. If for some nefarious reason please stop and divert your attentions elsewhere. ",
