            "answer_text": "The European Renaissance was characterized by a deliberate focus on humanity, human history and human culture. European intellectuals then wished to apply the powers of reason, logic and the new scientific method to improve everything for humanity. That was the dream that lead to the Enlightenment. Instead of blind faith in tradition or theology, evidence of what worked and what did not work, as determined by careful rules of evidence and the application of logic and peer review. The famous scientists of the European Enlightenment such as Kepler, Newton, Galileo, Goethe, Darwin perfected the use of rigorous data collection and the application of consistent rules of evidence to explain everything they focused their minds upon. The power of mathematics was proven in establishing the laws of physics, chemistry, biology. It did not take long (a few hundred years!) for philosophers to apply these new approaches to human culture, language, economics, psychology and politics. In the 20th century even such things as the behavior of consumers became the subject of scientific inquiry. Now, we have Big Data Analytics applying mathematical precision to huge amounts of data on the internet, including this posting. :-) The short answer to your question is \u201ceverything in reality and in human imagination can be and is the focus of scientific inquiry and study.\u201d Kurt Vonnegut used to say that before the Enlightenment \u201cyour guess is as good as mine\u201d and so generals, popes, priests and kings would simple tell us what was true. But after modern science was invented, guessing was just not acceptable anymore. ",
