            "answer_text": "Japan is way ahead in terms of technology with many other country. We can put up many reasons why they are very success in technical filed.Japanese develop so many things which is impossible for some country like they build so many high rich graphics video games. high speed bullet trains, worlds tallest architecture, longest bridge and etc etc. This is possible just because of few thing which only Japanese do not other country people.From the very starting of the life they taught their kids how don\u2019t except thing easily as the way it is. Try to explore and find the best way you can modify and deliver to society.They are very hard working. As we know that japan have faced the nuclear attack. Other than japan any country would take too much to recover but NO! they again build there country more beautiful and technical.They have big vision and enthusiasm to do every thing. That are the reason according to me any suggestion are welcomed. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question, both countries are tropical (Japan is almost as hot and humid as the Philippines in the summer time.) both countries are island based. both get nasty typhoons and earth quakes. both are close to China, so why so different? I can think of 4 main factors that separate the two. Confucianism, this was adopted very early on in Japan and became the basis of their educational system and work ethic. Confucianism has a focus on Education and Social Order above anything else.Centralized government. Japan was largely united under a single government from about 7th Century AD. The Philippines was not until quite recently (16th century).Colonization - The Philippines was colonized by the Spanish, then the Americans and then later invaded by the Japanese. Japan has never really been colonized or conquered apart from the Yaoi migrations that happened 300BC - 300 AD.Geography - Though an island country, Japan, from Kyushu to Hokkaido is almost a single contiguous land mass. It is possible to drive from one end of Japan to the other because the islands are so close together. The Philippines on the other hand is broken up into about 10 or so main islands and hundreds of tiny islands. This makes the country harder to govern, administer and educate.",
