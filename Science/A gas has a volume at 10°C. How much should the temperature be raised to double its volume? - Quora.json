            "answer_text": "OK! I guess I am the only engineer here. So let me show you an engineering way to solve the problem. Some of you may really love this, but some of you may be offended since this method requires no understanding about physical chemistry. As everyone did, if we assume an isobaric expansion of ideal gas, we see a doubled volume at 566 K. (making assumptions is important.) But we still have no idea what the given gas is. Regardless of pressure, the answers are going to be the same. Of course all gases behaves differently. When dealing with real world, we can\u2019t use it. Visit NIST webbook. (Link: Thermophysical Properties of Fluid Systems)I\u2019m not sure this website is still available outside the United States. If it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m so sorry. NIST (National Institute of Standard and Technology) offers real data for real substances.Select your substance. I will test carbon dioxide. Choose whatever units you want for your physical properties.Select isobaric process. and Press to Continue.Input the numerical pressure value, and your desired temperature range. and Press to Continue.Hell Yeah! This diagram shows real data for real material, or specific theoretical models for specific chemical compounds under specific thermodynamic situation available in literature. You can modify X and Y axes whatever physical properties you want. Read value of Density at which the temperature is 10 Celcius.Divide it by 2. (molar density is just a reciprocal value of molar volume)Reat value of Temperature at which the gas has a density 1/2 of its original density.That would be the answer.If I draw the line at 1 atm, the answer is still 566 K. (very close to that from ideal gas) However, if we increase the pressure to 5 atm, the answer is 550 K. If we increase further up to 10 atm, now CO2 doubles its original volume at only 462 K. You are seeing the CO2 gas is losing its ideal behavior as the pressure is increased. This is because the volume of CO2 at the initial cold temperature is much smaller than ideal gas version of it, majorly due to the intermolecular interactions and the volume of molecules themselves. If you change gas from CO2 to some other noble gases like neon or helium, then you may see that the magnitude of the deviation from ideality is greatly reduced. \u201cI had TAed a couple of advanced chemical thermodynamics courses for graduate students, and I found an interesting phenomenon in the course of that: all chemistry graduate students used ideal gas law or other equations of states to solve problems, and all chemical engineering graduate students used this NIST table to solve the same problems. The former group of people used many elegant mathematics to solve problem, while the latter group of people essentially used no math at all. They simply just read available data. When I found that the latter people without math submitted by far much more accurate answers than the former people with heavy math, I\u2019d lost my words.\u201d - me ",

            "answer_text": "10\u2103 = 283 K (because 0\u2103 = 273 K) Now to solve this problem, you can use combined gas equation. So, P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2 Here, there is no discussion about pressure so we can assume that the pressure is constant. So P1 = P2 = P. So, PV1/T1 = PV2/T2 V1/T1 = V2/T2 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (1) Now, V2 = 2V1 and T1 = 283 K Putting these values in (1) we get V1/283 = 2V1/T2 So, T2 = 2 \u00d7 283 = 566 K = 293 \u2103 Note: If you put the value of T in \u2103 you will get wrong answer. In problems related to thermodynamics always put the value of T in Kelvin only. Also, it is not like that double volume means double temperature. So, the temperature should be raised by 283\u2103 to soluble the volume. ",
