Yes, it\u2019s an integral part of transparent intellectual discussion. The last thing you want are a bunch of people all agreeing with each other, not because they actually have good merits to hold those positions, but because you can\u2019t criticise the orthodox view. When I give talks or write my papers, I always assume I am going into a talk where people are going to disagree with my ideas in some form, and my goal is to convey the information in a manner to persuade them to the value of the work. Some scientific research has social consequences, many times these can lead to political activism tainting discussion or creating environments where transparency is next to non-existent. You might find this interesting: The Free Speech Crisis on Campus Is Worse than People Think - Quillette. When it comes to the creation, discussion, and publication of research, yes it matters. Some research is going to challenge certain political taboos or dogma even among experts, you don\u2019t want a community of scientists believing that certain topics can\u2019t be studied just because of the \u201coffence\u201d or the fear of being labelled a heretic that must be excommunicated. Heck, even in mundane research, sometimes you might take a completely different angle with the research than what is presently the focal point, and that can cause you to face hurdles, is it right to shut down that? My answer is no, you take apart the ideas and try to break them (not the person). It\u2019s no surprise at all to me like mentioned in the article that the research isn\u2019t being regarded as cutting edge. Paradigm flipping and challenging orthodoxies is important every once in a while in STEM fields as sometimes research leads you in different directions than the original research. You need those people prepared to jump on a wave to take the risk, it\u2019s not nearly as hard to do it once everybody else is. It\u2019s no surprise at all to me that in computing and maths these institutions are doing wonderfully: this kind of work usually doesn\u2019t require rocking the boat too much and there\u2019s an almost never-ending stream of applications work that you can do (without causing much theory to build out of it). You can easily fit a niche to your research and do work in it without it causing huge ripples (not to say the work that has been done isn\u2019t doing this). In the article it is describing what I think academia in the West will look like if people were to put accelerant on the current publish-or-die model of metrics on scholars. It\u2019s frankly not healthy to be overworked like that (heck, I\u2019m not a fan of it also in how it is done in the West), and I write this as somebody that loves doing research. I\u2019m curious how it is going to work out for those in China in the coming years though. ",
