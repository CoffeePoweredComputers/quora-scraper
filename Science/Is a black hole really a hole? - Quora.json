            "answer_text": "Is a black hole really a hole? Well, is a hole really a hole? A hole in a surface is a gap in it that forms a passage from one side to the other without going over its edge.A hole in the ground is is depression that doesn\u2019t allow passage in any direction other than down... and then back up again, if you can find the means to climb.A hole in a box is a way into, or out of the enclosed space defined by the walls of the box.All three of these examples are different things. Going into the hole has a different outcome in every case, but they\u2019re all described using the same noun - hole. This is a linguistic limitation, because clearly the word is not enough to describe the condition in full. Saying \u201cI found a hole\u2026\u201d doesn\u2019t tell anyone what kind of thing it is you found. Is it 1,2, or 3? In the case of a Black Hole, the term was applied because the effect of gravity is to pull you down into it. Unlike most holes though, since it appears nothing that goes in comes back out, there was (and still is) no way of knowing whether it\u2019s type 1 or 2 or 3. Our logical experience would tell us that all the stuff going in can\u2019t just vanish and would eventually fill up any hole of type 2 or 3, so the stuff that goes in must come out somewhere - and those who subscribe to that view will suggest therefore that it allows passage to a different side of the universe. It could be type 2, if you can accept that the more stuff you put into the hole, the deeper it gets. This is counter-intuitive to experience, but makes sense if you believe spacetime is stretchy. Every bit of mass that falls in stretches the hole downwards a bit more, so there\u2019s always enough room for more to fall in. Type 3 is similar, but the box can\u2019t expand so you have to consider that there\u2019s no limit to how tightly the stuff can squeeze together if it falls into the box. Or maybe it\u2019s type 4. Something entirely new, a kind of hole we can\u2019t really describe because it\u2019s using a dimension we don\u2019t understand to accomodate all the matter that goes into it. In any case, we can still call it a hole. Things can go into it, and that\u2019s a common factor. I\u2019m happy to live with the idea it\u2019s a hole of some kind. We now know that at least something, Hawking radiation, can come out of it too. I don\u2019t pretend to understand physics at this level, but that\u2019s something wonderfully exciting to me. And at last we have a photo of what surrounds a black hole, and can see its shadow, so we\u2019re entering a new phase of discovery. ",

            "answer_text": "No, black hole is not a hole, it is 3-dimensional sphere. What you call a hole? When you fall in hole you will come out from other side but this thing not happen with black hole. But, you can call a wormhole a 3-dimensional hole. Black hole is just like big sphere of very high mass and the high mass is concentrated at its center forming a singularity. A gravitational singularity or space-time singularity is a location in space-time where the gravitational field of a celestial body becomes infinite in a way that does not depend on the coordinate system. The quantities used to measure gravitational field strength are the scalar invariant curvatures of space-time, which includes a measure of the density of matter. Since such quantities become infinite within the singularity, the laws of normal space-time could not exist. Source: Gravitational singularity - Wikipedia And, black hole is not like planet because planet don\u2019t have singularity at its center, and also black hole is formed when star dies. Lets see how black hole formAll star dies with supernova. When star runs out of hydrogen, it starts to fuse heavier elements , the core collapse , when this happens ,a nuclear explosion occurs which is known as supernova.  But, the stars 3 or more time heavier than our sun it goes through other process. If the remaining core is between 1 and half to 3 solar masses ( our sun mass ) it contracts to form neutron star. If the remaining core is more than 3 solar mass it contract to form Black Hole.  The core is keep contracting beyond its event horizon and make the singularity at his center. Singularity means where a very huge amount of mass is concentrated. It form stellar black hole when it (black hole) came in contact with other star, a dice of gas rotate around the black.  Hope this helps clear things up a little for you. Follow me on Quora. Thank you! ",
