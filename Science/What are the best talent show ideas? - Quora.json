            "answer_text": "Know what I'd love to do?  Get an audience to join in by singing a refrain in a song. The song I was thinking of is \"Willow Tit Willow\" from Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Mikado.\"  The lyrics include several repetitions of the phrase \"Willow, tit willow, tit willow\" and the song itself is a \"humorous\" one from the 19th century about a little bird who is so unhappy at being rejected by his lover that he jumps into the water and drowns his little self.  I'd give the audience a background as to why KoKo is singing it and to whom in case the subject matter bothers anybody,  Google it to learn the story and to hear this song performed.   Of course there are many other songs (perhaps a bit less poignant) that you can do this with. The other fun thing to do with an audience is teach them to sing a round.  A round is where you divide the audience into sections (usually three?) and each section sings the exact same melody and words but they each start at different times which you indicate.  \"Row, row, row your boat\" is one of them but there are many others.  In \"Row\" each section starts when the previous section has finished the first phrase and you just keep on doing it until you signal each section to stop after the last phrase (\"Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily.  Life is but a dream\").  Stop the sections in the same order you started them in.  People really love doing this. Have fun and good luck in your talent show! ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s one idea. Get a group of your friends, a total of about 8, to join you in a faux synchronized swimming skit. It isn\u2019t difficult, doesn\u2019t require much in the way of costumes, scenery, or props, and is very entertaining. I think it would be a lot of fun to perform. You can view a group of 5h grade boys doing so for their school\u2019s talent show:  It\u2019s a riot and I\u2019m sure you and your friends can think of ways to make it even better. The music they used (Blue Danube) is not only very fitting, but because it was composed so long ago, the copyright has long since expired so you can use it for free. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "The \u201ccoolest\u201d thing anyone can do for any talent show, is to be so good, so unusual or so exceptional that the judges are blown away. Mediocrity is an absolute no-no. For nothing bores a judge more. Something that does have an exceptional affect is for you to appear so average, inept, old or bumbling, when the judges first view you; that they are totally unprepared for what you actually are capable of. To the point that they are completely shocked (in a good way) by your performance. A magnificent voice, flawless or unusual presentation, and a never before seen capability go a long way. Costuming may help but it is talent that ultimately impresses. ",
