            "answer_text": "It is the largest IMMEDIATE threat, and part of that is because it is on a timescale that puts the likely victims in a different generation than ourselves. Humans never evolved an ability to manage that sort of risk. We don\u2019t perceive it easily and we don\u2019t understand it in our guts. So it doesn\u2019t get handled except through science. Which is held in disrepute because of ideologies. Science in America - Neil deGrasse Tyson So I have to agree that we are our own worst enemy - as several here have already pointed out. I will however point at a rather different aspect of this as well. We have governments and leadership and inequality and consumption driven economics that are results of a single economic error, a basic and underlying failure of that profession. No economist has ever properly defined \u201cmoney\u201d and the functional definitions adopted absent a proper formal examination, left us with debt backed money. Real money represents work done. There are limits to how much work is done in a society and there are limits based on the laws of thermodynamics, which define how it can be handled. Debt backed money is based on a promise of work done and there are no limits to promises. Worse, it is based on a promise of interest being paid for the creation of that money and that is a violation of the law of conservation of energy. It is as well, forbidden by both the Bible and the Koran. Its existence encourages (and our economic system embraces) rent-seeking behaviour, despite the fact that almost all major Capitalist economic figures and all Communists, assert that this is wrong. This significant distortion of economics leads us to the situation that has us perhaps 250 TRILLION dollars in debt, no prospect of repayment, and all that fake money is actually fueling real consumption. Yay\u2026 the GDP is growing, rah, rah rah! ??? So 250 Trillion in debt, creating ever increasing inequality, putting wealth in charge of former democracies, fueling environmental destruction on a biblical scale, in violation of the major religions of the world and contrary to the laws of physics. That may actually be our BIGGEST threat\u2026 and almost nobody understands it. It is of course, us as do it too though, so I can understand someone saying \u201cits us\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Climate change is a symptom. The biggest threat is HUMANS. There are too many of us, we are too destructive and too consumptive. We care most about comfort, convenience and shiny objects, while those goals are both bad for human health and bad for the planet. Even in the anthropocentric view that humans are the the only factor of importance, the whole rest of the ecosphere consists of human EXO-METABOLISM, recycling human wastes into Oxygen, clean water and healthy food necessary to sustain humans. This means that the limits to bio-productivity and bio-diversity are the only true measure of wealth. Without air, water and food nothing else matters. We have destroyed roughly 3/4 of the one and only biosphere on which we are 100% dependent, and what is left can\u2019t sustainably support 7 billion of us. Half of all humans today were grown on chemical fertilizer, and even if nothing else nosedives (pollinators, runaway warming, ocean chemistry) we are irrevocably facing a fertilizer crisis in a few decades as the known reserves of economical phosphate and potash ore run out. Humans have killed half of all the forests, turning them to deserts and sandy, rocky arid lands; and the the remaining soils are half as thick now, meaning we have erased 3/4 of the bio-productivity and a substantial portion of bio-diversity. Beyond that is the depletion of trace elements. These dozens of discreet resources are unique and have no substitute in biological function, but do not affect crop yields measured in POUNDS. Rather, they are used by the crops to make molecules that resist insects, molds, viruses and bacteria; and to synthesize vitamins, bio-flanoids, anti-oxidants and immuno-support complexes that enable humans and livestock to resist disease. Irrigation and agricultural markets combined with water borne sanitation deplete soils of trace elements and kill the land. The plants uptake what they need, but those elements never return to the soil once the plants are removed and sold. After 20 years of export, even with chemical fertilizer, soils have collapsed chemistry and micro-biology. It took some 20,000 years to kill 75% of the land, but we have erased 2/3 of the life on the oceans\u2019 surface in the last 100 years. This is partly from over-fishing and pollution (including the noise pollution of motorized shipping), but the primary factor appears to be whaling. Phytoplankton are the base of the oceanic food chain, and the concentration of plankton is down 66% since the first global survey, measured by repeating the original nephelometric method. This is far more expensive but far more accurate than aerial and satellite surveys, which are colorimetric and produce conflicting results. This indicates there is a limiting factor which is also down 66% and the only candidate is loss of trace elements. There is a constant rain of bio-elements from the surface to the bottom from oceanic carcasses, and the only mechanism for lifting the bio-essential elements back to the surface is bottom feeding whales. They each bring 3\u20135 tons a day up from 1,000 meters under salt water, or rather, brought, since humans killed 95% of them. This means that the elements that supported robust biomes on land are now mainly irrecoverable on the bottom of the ocean; and the food production and CO2 recycling capability of the planet is down 2/3 in the last 100 years. It also means the Industrial Revolution decreased per capita wealth 97% measured in Biological terms. We have to stop mining and burning, stop driving cars, trucks, planes and ships. We will be healthier, happier and may survive as a species. ",
