            "answer_text": "Applied social science is the application of social science theories, concepts, methods, and findings to problems identified in the wider society (D. Jary & J. Jary 2000). Using this understanding in the segmentation of social science into distinct disciplines gives rise to the concepts of applied social sciences that include counseling, social work, and communication. In this typology, theories, concepts, methods, and findings of counseling define the counseling practice. The same is true for social work and communication disciplines. However, this description of applied social science minimizes or even omits the interdisciplinary aspect that is implicit to social science when it is applied. There can be no social issue that is purely one-dimensional. Different disciplines within the field of social science bring some unique dimensions to a better understanding of social phenomena. This means that applied social sciences cannot afford to be fragmented. Essentially, it has to unify and cut across. Social sciences are disciplines concerned with the systematic study of social phenomena. Basically, the term \u2018social sciences\u2019 is defined as the study of human society; that particular area of study that relates to human behavior and society. In a broader sense, it is a branch of science that deals with the institutions, the functioning of human society, and with the interpersonal relationships of individuals as members of society. There are distinct disciplines or branches dealing with a particular phase or aspect of human society such as socio-cultural aspects of human behavior. An Overview: Disciplines of Social Sciences The disciplines of social sciences generally include: anthropology, economics, sociology, political science, history, criminology, psychology, geography, and communication studies. The goal of these disciplines is to explain human behavior in its many cultural forms including the past and the present, individually or in groups, national and international geopolitical contexts, and to empower them as democratic participants in a rapidly changing world. The disciplines of social science taken together provide a substantive insight to the understanding of society and of the relationship of individual members and groups within the society. The disciplines also study all areas related to human behavior and society, the institutions and functioning of human society, and the interpersonal relationships of individuals as members of society as well as dealing with a particular phase or aspect of human society. To put this in context, the enumerated disciplines above give the sense of complexity and specificity to the disciplines involved. Applied social science is an integrated science cutting across ard transcending various social science disciplines in addressing a wide range of issues in a contemporary, innovative, and dynamic way. It aims at presenting a well-developed understanding of social systems, social theory, and social policy It integrates theory, social research, skills and professional experience, and critical thinking skills necessary to fully address social phenomena. Applied social science, therefore, is a broad field that draws on different social theories and perspectives and combines theory and practice drawn from different social disciplines that highlight the complexity of social issues. Historically, social science knowledge has been compartmentalized into different disciplines, which until the 1990s and 2000s became apparent to many social critics as fragmenting rather than promoting the holistic view and complexity of social reality. This view has advanced the position that it is best that these different social science disciplines work together to produce a more effective and coherent insights on social issues under one umbrella of applied science. In this sense, applied social science essentially reflects an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary view and approach to social issues, policy, and response. The focus of applied social science is less fixed and allows for specialisms in other areas to provide perspectives. It is very important to understand that applied social science is not an aggregation of various specialized social science disciplines. It transcends individual specialized social science and finds its true essence through active engagement with the larger society in action. It is praxis. In this worktext, three of the applied social sciences are emphasized to demonstrate how theories and concepts drawn from other disciplines can be brought together to bear upon one discipline in applied sense: counseling, social work, and communication. As discussed above, social sciences are more specific and focused on a distinct facet of a social phenomenon while applied social science attempts to focus on a distinct issue but use insights arising from various social science disciplines. While social science may explore broadly their distinct disciplines, some of their input may easily become applied while others may remain theoretical. When social science theories, concepts, methods, and findings gain application to problems identified in the wider society, then applied social science is achieved. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is an example: Sigmund Freud invented the social science of psychoanalysis. He discovered that persons\u2019 overt beliefs and feelings are often shaped by psychical contents which have been repressed. His nephew, Edward Bernays, applied this science to selling consumer products. For instance, Bernays applied psychoanalysis to sell cigarettes, since women did not ideate that a cigarette was only a cigarette (if you follow me here?). Freud\u2019s patients were a few mostly wel-to-do Viennese at the turn of the 20th century whose heads were messed up by their childrearing. Bernays\u2019 patients were all Americans in the 20th and 21st Centuries. His therapists are called: Ad men.
