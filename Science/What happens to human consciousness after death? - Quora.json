            "answer_text": "I\u2019m split on this one. I could conceive of both scenarios where consciousness ceases and where it continues as potentially true. I think it depends on how relativity and the notion of relative processes work. I conceptualise consciousness as a relative process, by which I mean, one\u2019s consciousness exists relative to a reference frame; that reference frame being of a brain. An interesting question that I\u2019ve often pondered is, \u201cwhy am I me, and not anyone[/thing] else?\u201d That can be translated as, \u201cwhy does what\u2019s occurring now pertain to this reference frame (i.e., of this brain), and not any of the many other possibilities?\u201d (E.g., another human, a field mouse, an iguana, an extraterrestrial inhabiting Gliese 581g, etc. \u2014 assuming these can be conscious.) That I am me, experiencing the world from this perspective, seems to me analogous to some sort of wavefunction collapse from a possibility space of other potential perspectives. (Note: analogous \u2014 let\u2019s not get into quantum mysticism.) Now, what happens after death? Most pertinently, the brain stops functioning and deteriorates. Making the reasonable assumption that consciousness arises from brain functioning, one would expect consciousness to cease. Sticking with the above analogy, this means the wavefunction collapsed state is now gone. What is \u201cleft\u201d is the possibility space. It seems entirely reasonable to suggest that, if this \u2014 the current experience \u2014 can happen, as it is doing now, it could indeed happen after death via another possibility from the possibility space. Note that this is not reincarnation \u2014 no souls are implied, and no transferal of which takes place, and no recall of the \u201cold\u201d existence would be available; just as you don\u2019t remember being your friend Dave. However, this hinges on the question, \u201cWhy am I me and not someone else?\u201d being a legitimate one. It might not be. The question might be a product of fallacy, in that even though I call my experience consciousness, and you call yours consciousness, these aren\u2019t in fact the same things, and therefore I could not be anyone else because I am this process, at this point in space and time, by definition. And therefore there is no possibility space because there is only one of this process which I call \u201cme\u201d, and the question essentially presupposes myself. In this case, I\u2019d agree with the conventional modern viewpoint that death is simply the ceasing of consciousness, and that\u2019s that \u2014 there\u2019s nothing more afterwards. To finish: I can see both as realistic possibilities. I do favour the conventional viewpoint as of now, but I could also certainly see death not being the end, in a certain sense, and I don\u2019t think this possibility should be discounted. ",

            "answer_text": "The strongest reason to believe that consciousness could live on after physical death is that we continue to observe phenomena which throws the materialistic view of consciousness into doubt. Some of these observations include: 1. Deathbead recovery of lost consciousness Some people with severely degraded mental capacity, dementia, brain damage, etc are reported to fully recover for hours before their death. Loved ones talk to them, they are aware that they are dying, etc. Not common, but according to Bruce Greyson from the University of Virginia, up to 13% of cases of patients with severely, chronically, irreversibly compromised brains return briefly to full consciousness just before death. 70% of caregivers in Nursing Homes  have observed patients with dementia become completely lucid in the last  hours before death.  2. Complex consciousness with minimal brain There are cases reported with people with hydrocephalus yet have normal, if not exceptional intelligence. Dr. John Lorber had a famous patient, about whom he said:   There's a young student at this university...who has an IQ of 126,  has gained a first-class honors degree in mathematics, and is socially  completely normal.  And yet the boy has virtually no brain...instead of  the normal 4.5 centimeter thickness of brain tissue between the  ventricles and the cortical surface, there was just a thin layer of  mantle measuring a millimeter or so. 3. Near death experiences Setting aside the subjective content of the NDE's themselves, some of what is claimed to have been observed includes:  Visits with deceased people who were not yet known to be deceased. Clearer, faster, more logical, more controlled thoughts than usual.The closer they are to death, the clearer the thinking.Experiences of seeing in those who are blind from birth.Veridical (objectively true) accounts of their resuscitation.Clear differences between NDE and hallucination or oxygen deprivation, including memories which are 'more real' than waking memories or dreams in their stability and detail.4. Past life memories It is somewhat common for children to have access to memories, personality traits, likes and dislikes, unlearned skills, birthmarks and birth defects that are correspond to actual people who have died 18% of the time, according to Dr. Greyson. 60% of the time, those who are remembered by the children died violently or suddenly. 5. Spirituality is an Anthropological Universal Without even considering whether spiritual concepts are true, what we can say is that we have never encountered a culture which lacked a concept of spirits or an afterlife. For beings who have no reason to believe that we are nothing beyond the functioning of a brain or body, we certainly attach a lot of significance to a surprisingly common nonsensical concept. We can say that this makes sense because of mortality and a fear of death, but that may be begging the question. If eternal death is certain, why should we fear it? Why is eternal life any less intrinsically terrifying? 6. Emergence is circular Perhaps the closest that science has to a consensus view about consciousness is that it is an effect produced by very complex neurochemical interactions. So far, it is hard to say how much of that interaction is a logical, computational phenomenon that is substrate independent (and therefore exportable/uploadable to a more stable physical substrate like silicon wafers) and how much depends on a living, organic substrate. In either case, the idea of emergence is that it is not necessary for the low level components (be they logical or biological) to have the top level property of consciousness. That however, is not necessarily true.  When we talk about systems as whole things-in-themselves, we are relying on our own perceptions to describe them that way. While it is true that an airplane can fly without each of their parts being able to sustain flight, really any part can be hurled into the air and 'fly' to some extent. Likewise, a fishing net is made out of woven fibers which cannot catch fish, but it is clear that fibers would obstruct a fish, or anything that has a body moving through space. When we look at the processes of a human brain, we find no evidence of any such potential for meta-physical emergence. As far as we can tell, everything that the brain does relates to itself, to the body, to the environment, etc, but nothing which would suggest aesthetic phenomena such as flavor, color, sound, feeling, etc. There is no reason to presume that any such thing as a 'system' can even exist outside of some view of components where they seem to be united. Without that view, there may be nothing that is a system, per se. When we say 'emergence' we really mean 'seems surprising because of the ignorance of our perspective'. Because of this, it would be circular to say that consciousness itself is derived from the ignorance of consciousness. 6. The Justification For Materialism Has Evaporated What we really like about materialistic explanations are their objective qualities. We see that matter is reliable, predictable, controllable, and we have seen how so many strange seeming phenomena have been successfully reduced to simpler, straightforward causes within physics. What changed in the 20th century however is that Relativity, Quantum Theory, and Incompleteness have concluded that the foundations of math and physics are irreducibly immaterial and beyond formal logic. We can make ourselves feel more comfortable by saying that consciousness is a function of the brain, but the brain is ultimately grounded in an interplay of spontaneous forces which is much more like consciousness than it is like particles in a void. In my view, and in the view of many of the founding fathers of modern physics, the fabric of reality is spun from the loom of perception and participation. Huxley proposed that the brain acts as a reducing valve - a proposition echoed by recent studies on psilocybin which showed dramatic decreases in brain activity where intense tripping was occurring. This is not to say that the way to enlightenment is to get rid of your brain, but taken all together with the other five points above, it presents a fairly puzzling picture to try reconcile honestly with materialism. We would really have to bend over backwards to dismiss all of these cases as being illusions or fraud. To me, it is clear that the skeptical view is one which supports the possibility of consciousness as more fundamental than physics as being at least equal to the assumption of emergence. ",
