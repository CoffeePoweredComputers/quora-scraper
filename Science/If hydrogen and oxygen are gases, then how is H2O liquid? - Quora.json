            "answer_text": "Hydrogen and oxygen are gases but water is a liquid because water is generally formed when hydrogen is combusted (burnt) in the presence of oxygen.   Water is liquid as when hydrogen combustes in atmosphere rich in oxygen then to form one molecule of water it needs two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom,and as it is a compound it's chemical properties will change so the elements which were once gases will turn into a new compound with new properties and form a liquid.
