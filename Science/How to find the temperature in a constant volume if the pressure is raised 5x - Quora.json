            "answer_text": "Appling the equation of ideal gas, is a good aproximation: pV=nRT, where p is pressure, v is volume, n is a quantity in Mol, R is a constant and T is the absolute temperature in kelvin. So, if you rase 5x p, and volume is constant, the final absolute temperature will be also 5x the initial temperature. Example: If Ti=26,85C = 300K and Pf=5xPi, then Tf=1500K = 1226,86C Ok, it's only an aproximation. ",

            "answer_text": "Seems like there is a coefficient you would multiply the substance by and get that answer. If your talking about air in general, look up the coefficient, I'd expect at sea level ((14.7 psig \u00d7 5 ) \u00f7 f)+ ta Where : 14.7 is atmospheric pressure at sea level f = coefficient Assumptions no solar or wind gain or loss in temp, and the constant volume is air. If this is a specific gas or mixture the resulting pressure may be out of safety zones for certain container types. Therefore Container is assumed to be safe at 5 times pressure as well. It could be I have the operators wrong or in the wrong place Could be : ((Bpt\u00d75)\u00d7f)+ta=T Where : But is Begining pressure temp f is coefficient ta is temp of ambient beginning My logic tells me it is decided by coeff and add that to the original temp Just a swag at it. I could be wrong. ",
