            "answer_text": "In very simple terms \u2014 Social Science \u2014 studies social Institutions and structures by using the quantitative methods of social statistics. It can study small groups, but it often involves statistics involving thousands, millions or hundreds of millions of people. It then forms theories from the actual social statistics. (Subjective level: 50%)Humanities \u2014 studies the Arts, including the Fine Arts, the Performing Arts, Literature, Poetry, Drama, Theater, Music, Dance, Acting, Ethics, Politics, Public Speaking, Rhetoric, History, and so on. (Subjective level: 90%)Natural Science \u2014 studies Nature, including Mathematics, Logic, Physics, Astronomy, Geology, Geography, Oceanography, Chemistry, Botany, Biology, Zoology, Anatomy, Psychology, (Subjective level: 10%)Those are the simplest terms that I see. The main similarities are that: (1) they are all college courses; (2) they are all professions; and (3) each segment can require a full career. The differences are obvious from these simplest of definitions. Especially the Subjective level, i.e. the amount of Original Thinking permitted for each discipline. The Subjective level is least for the Natural Sciences because all of their objects are given to our five senses. Everybody can see, hear, touch, smell and taste these objects \u2014 even animals can. There is no originality that humans can add to them; so the only Subjectivity allowed is New Technology (e.g. a telescope, a microscope, an electroscope, a computer, etc.). Yet most of Natural Science is a careful, quiet exploration of Nature herself. The New Technology is useful only if it helps in that exploration. The Subjective level is median for Social Sciences, because what do you do with all those social statistics? You put them in many fancy charts, but so what? Somebody must come up with a Theory to propose interpretations of the statistics. The statistics are what they are \u2014 given by reality \u2014 this is 50% of the Science. But the other 50% is interpretation. The Subjective level is highest for the Humanities. Originality \u2014 something new and different \u2014 Creativity is the highest value! The past is useful only as something else to surpass. Always changing \u2014 Opinion matters \u2014 Art Criticism is a plausible career in itself. Certainty is fleeting in this Department. Those are the simplest terms that I see. ",

Social \u201cscience\u201d is a lot a nonsense made up by people who cannot work in the other two categories. ",
