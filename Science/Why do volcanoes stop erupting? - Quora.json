            "answer_text": "A volcano erupts - mostly - because the driving pressure of gasses within the molten lava \u2018pushes\u2019 (almost explodes) to surface. Once the gasses are released (by erupting to surface) then that driving force is absent, and whatever molten rock is present flows out on the surface, then slows, then stops - until the tectonic forces at depth create additional lava (molten rock) with those same gasses - (gases - hmmm, checking spelling, apparently both work). Anyway, gases are held in solution with molten rock under pressure and as the pressure is released (as lava rises through the crust) the gases begin to separate from the lava, and help \u2018push\u2019 - gases rise faster than molten rock, after all. Eventually, a volcano totally stops erupting, because the tectonic forces creating conditions to melt rock at depth have moved elsewhere and the poor volcano is sitting on empty - so to speak. We don\u2019t really understand the processes well enough to accurately predict eruptions, but we have a pretty good idea, and predictions are getting better. ",

            "answer_text": "The area that was molten and hot under the surface has cooled. The easiest example to relate to is the Hawaiian islands. Kuaii is not active; however, the big Hawaiian islands is active. This is because the Pacific tectonic plate is slowly moving over a hot spot under the crust of the ocean floor. Imagine slowly moving a plastic sheet over a candle - close enough to melt it, but not letting it burst into flames. You can see a trail of old worn out volcanoes near Hawaii and a new volcano forming under the water near the big island. Most volcanoes have more complicated origens, but if they are not active, then they have cooled down. The great Yellowstone Caldera is not an active volcano, but it is still hot. It could still erupt one day, but scientists are monitoring it and will have advance knowledge before that ever happens. ",
