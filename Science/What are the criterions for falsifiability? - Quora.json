            "answer_text": "Not sure what you are asking about here but I will give you a sketch of the logic. First off this applies to hypothesis H that are taken to be universal empirical generalizations like all swans are white. Now say a hypothesis H implies observations O, H -> O, but instead we get a not-O then not-H. In practice what you usually have are auxiliary hypotheses, A\u2019s, when testing H like the equipment isn\u2019t broken and so on. So the situation becomes A1 ^ A2 ^ \u2026 ^ An ^ H -> O but if you get not-O then which of these is the culprit because you cannot just naively say H is false (i.e, Duhem\u2019s problem, naive falsification, etc). A well designed experiment takes A\u2019s into account so it can be determined if H is the culprit. A common and simple example is control groups in an experiment when testing the effectiveness of a drug. This can get more nuanced but it\u2019s a start. ",
