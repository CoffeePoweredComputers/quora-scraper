            "answer_text": "For pretty much all news and media questions, I go to a handy Media Bias Chart: Version 4.0, which I find very useful:  (image from Media Bias Chart: Version 4.0) According to the chart, everything in the top row is \u201coriginal fact reporting\u201d and everything that sits only in the green box is \u201cnews.\u201d So I think we can confidently say that the following sources are reporting entirely real news (in that they essentially report nothing but facts): AP, Reuters, Bloomberg, C-SPAN, NPR, and the Los Angeles Times. But you did say channel and the only one of those sources that has a channel (as far as I know since I\u2019m not as familiar with television news) is C-SPAN. However, we can also look at the second row, which is labeled as \u201cfact reporting.\u201d This, I think, is still real news in that you\u2019re still getting the facts with minimal analysis or selectiveness. By allowing this row (while still staying only in the green box), we add NBC News, CBS News, ABC News, Politico, BBC, The Christian Science Monitor, and The Hill to the list of real news. So if you\u2019re looking for a channel that provides real news and you don\u2019t want to watch C-SPAN, it looks like ABC News is probably your best bet, with NBC News, CBS News, and the BBC also being excellent choices. But we can go further because if a source is in both the green box and the yellow box, it just means that the source also has fair interpretations of the news. So if we stick to the \u201cfact reporting\u201d row but allow the yellow box, we can add Axios, USA Today, The New York Times, BuzzFeed News, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Skimm, and MarketWatch to the list of real news. So that\u2019s 21 different sources that we can call real news. Some of them do have some minor partisan bias (with BuzzFeed News being the furthest left and The Wall Street Journal being the furthest right) but as long as you\u2019re aware of it, it should be fine. And to be honest, you can pretty much watch and read from any source that is mostly in the green and/or yellow boxes and still be getting good information (just be aware of bias). Now, some of the big, well-known networks didn\u2019t show up in my lists above. Ones like CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News (the ones that tend to get talked about a lot when we talk about real vs fake news). Fortunately, the Media Bias Chart site also charts the individual programs of those networks: CNN: Early Start meets our previous criteria for real news and Newsroom comes close. It should be noted that while all CNN programs have a small skew to the left, they are all well within the bounds of fair interpretations of the news (and just\u2026news): MSNBC: Morning Joe First Look and Andrea Mitchell Reports both meet our previous criteria for real news, although both do lean left (and The Rachel Maddow Show comes close). It should be noted that most MSNBC programs have a clear partisan leaning to the left but about half fall almost entirely within fair interpretation of the news (while the other half straddle the line between fair and unfair): Fox News: None of Fox News\u2019 programs meet our previous requirements for real news\u2026America\u2019s Newsroom, Journal, and Shepard Smith Reporting come close. It should be noted that almost all Fox News programs have a clear or even extreme partisan bias to the right and while about a third fall into fair interpretations of the news, a few straddle the line between fair and unfair, and the rest, more than half, fall into unfair interpretations or even into propaganda and nonsense: (above images from Media Bias Chart: Version 4.0) So if you\u2019re looking at the well-known networks that come up most often in this subject, I think you can say that CNN will give you real news, MSNBC will mostly give you real news, and Fox News will give you some real news. Thanks Sean for the A2A! EDIT: changed my classification of The Economist, Financial Times, and The Guardian, which I had previously classified confidently as real news. I decided that because they overlap into the \u201ccomplex analysis or mix of fact reporting and analysis\u201d row, I would leave them off of the confident list. I do think that those three sources are reliable and provide real news but I had to draw the line somewhere. ",

            "answer_text": "The problem with this question is that there really aren\u2019t enough news to go around for a 24 hour daily news channel to report. That of course referring to the news stories that A) Can be readily researched or at leat preliminary fact checked within a few hours (Fox News has a habit of simply not bothering but just pick a story that fits their narrative no matter how prepostrious). Any longer and the risk that you will be scooped increases potentially B) Is of a nature that isn\u2019t too complicated and/or boring so the viewers won\u2019t switch channels. You CAN of course also have an in depth longer segment, but it takes time to do it right. Usually they just call the experts that they know have an opinion on everything (though often that is the same opinion they always have - adjusted to the situation of course) and are willing to come right away if you pay them enough. A TRUE in depth program takes weeks if not months to research - and by that time the story isn\u2019t news anymore\u2026and C) Is of sufficient interest to the viewer to report on. The war on Christmas for instance was and is it seems important enough to captivate the Fox News audience every Christmas season - nevermind it is a made up story. So if you are looking for real news you should probably avoid the 24H channels and either go directly to the news feed - but you won\u2019t get any analyzis but just what the cameraman caught and maybe a quick description OR pick a channel with a slower pace and with other types of programs as well. You may also try to define what real news is for you. Is a feel-good story about some fluffy animal that has been rescued real news? Or does it have to be a hard hitting story about cruelty to animals in the slaughterhouses? Both have problems. Because it would be very hard to find someone that doesn\u2019t think a rescued animal is a bad thing, or that cruelty to animals is a good thing. BUT if the reporter takes the same stance some (certainly not me) would say that this is fake news because they insist that real news have to be 100% non-biased in every way. Which is bullshit. Some things just are. Global warming is. The Evolution is. And unbelivable as it may seem, Donald Trump IS the President of the United States of America. Accepting that some things really only have one side is as important that some things have as many sides as there are people on Earth. And that you can\u2019t expect the news not to acknowledge this.
