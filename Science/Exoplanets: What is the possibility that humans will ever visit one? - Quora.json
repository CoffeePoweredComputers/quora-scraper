            "answer_text": "Possibility? 100%.  When? Near future - perhaps 500 years from now or less. Exactly when? Cannot tell but not in very near future. Distances from earth to exoplanets are so vast, that it is not possible to reach there using current technologies. However, theoretical few technologies exist which can enable us to travel near to speed of light or bypass that limitation completely. That will enable us to travel much faster. Some of them are below: 1. Travel at much higher than current speed using traditional but nuclear impulse rockets. However, it will be less than the speed of light. Below two methods completely bypass that limitation. 2. Wormholes (Wormhole) created by joining of two black-holes   3. Warp drives (Warp drive) which can enable the ship to travel by warping the space field around it.   All of these or any of these can be possible in near future if you consider the speed of humans in 1900 and in 2000. Just on 100 years, we started to travel from 20-30 km/hr on horseback to 1000s of km/hr in space rockets to reach moon. Just imagine, what can be achieved in 500 years looking at current growth in scientific research. Hence, I firmly believe it can be possible to visit one exoplanet in 500 years from now, or even less. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Ever\" is such a strong word. But you know what? I think the answer is \"humans will never visit an exoplanet.\" There I said it. You see, the distances are so, SO great. Farther than you could ever imagine or comprehend. Seriously. Right now the closest exoplanet that seems \"earthlike\" (defined as rocky and in the goldilocks range zone from its star) orbits Tau Ceti, which is about 12 light years away.Tau Ceti e Right now we can only travel a small percentage of the speed of light. New Horizons, when it launched, was traveling about 45 km/sec (100,000 miles/hr) relative to the sun. New Horizons The speed of light \"c\" is 300 MILLION meters/sec. Unless you can think of a way to get a LOT of speed, it is going to take FOR-EV-ER to get there. That New Horizons probe? At its launch speed (which, by the way, is way faster than it is travelling now) it would take 85 million years. I know we are going to develop faster ways of travel, but the truth is, I just don't see us ever getting close to c. So, no, I don't think we will ever get to visit an exoplanet. Now, if it does happen before I die, feel free to rub this post in my face. I'll deserve it. ",

Plans are in the works to accelerate small probes to very high speeds up to one third to one half the speed of light. If successful we may find out certain things about our cosmic neighbors. As far away as 20 light years away would take us between 40 to 60 years just to get there with our probes and then another 20 years for us to receive information back. We could send tens of thousands of them at a time with different types of mission objectives. They\u2019re small and we must rely on numbers to achieve an overall picture. We must remain content with just looking from a distance. Just wait until the Webb telescope goes up in 2021. We will be able to see so far that the stars it sees will have no exoplanets. Looking at places that we will never go is our lot forever in the vast universe. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd expect humans to send automatic probes to some of them within the next 50 to 100 years.  It would be pointless at the moment, because any probe we could send now would be overtaken by one we could send 20 or 30 years later. This assumes a simple development of existing possibilities and no dramatic breakthrough like a \"hyperspace drive\". Hi-tech projects do benefit the global economy in the long run.  At the moment it is mostly military, because politicians and voters can be persuaded it is necessary.  Space exploration would bring the same benefits without the risk and waste. As for humans going, that would be much harder, probably several centuries.  They will need life support and probably expect to return. ",

Humans are just too spectacularly unsuited for survival in space, especially at relativistic speeds. But if your definition of \u201cwe\u201d encompasses genetically modified primates who repair radiation damage, do not die from inhaling a little vacuum, and can hibernate for centuries \u2014 then the prospect of interstellar travel becomes much more plausible. Within next 500 years I would say. ",

It\u2019d take many thousands of years before it got there, and it\u2019d be without power and nonfunctional when it got there. We wouldn\u2019t know if it actually made it to an exoplanet, though, and even if it did, I don\u2019t think that would count as us traveling to an exoplanet. No human alive today will ever travel to an exoplanet, unless we get the problem of aging licked in the next half century or so. Perhaps in a couple hundred years we\u2019ll come up with some better technology that might cut the travel time down to something a real human could tolerate, but it\u2019ll be a while. ",
