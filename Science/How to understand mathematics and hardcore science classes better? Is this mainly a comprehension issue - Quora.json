            "answer_text": "In all subjects of which I am aware, understanding is developed through use. If you study a language, you need to read it and speak it. For history and philosophy, you need to not merely regurgitate facts and dates, but address questions such as: \u201cWhy or why not?\u201d, \u201cWhat led to this?\u201d, and \u201cWhat does this suggest may occur next?\u201d For the the STEM subjects, \u201cuse\u201d implies solving problems, lots of problems, and learning how to apply the knowledge you have gained. In the same way physical exercise is needed to gain body strength, problem solving builds mental strength. Both types of exercise involve work and commitment. ",
