            "answer_text": "Criminology is a broader domain, where penology is one of its many branches. Just like artificial intelligence is a broad field, and there are many branches of applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, automatic speech recognition, criminology is a cross-domain subject between social science, law, psychology and social work. Criminology is the study of crime and criminal while penology is the study of the handling of crime and criminal. The specific focus of penology roots from the desirable outcome of punishment. For example, if a man committed murder, should he be sentenced to death? Or should he be sentenced to life imprisonment? What would be the potential impact brought to the victim, the individual and the society? Do we want to see those impact? A contradictory topic on penology is whether child molester should be sentenced to death. A strong opposing argument comes from the potential harm brought to the victim. The question in mind is that if a person molested a child, and given the penalty is death, how likely would he or she kill the child to cover up his crime? Another topic brought the discussion to different school of thoughts on the objective of punishment. Restorative justice is the case in point that argues the goal of punishment is to give people who make mistake an opportunity to learn and to re-enter the society with new skill. Yet, some data shows a counter argument that people who join rehabilitation program does not have a significant change to their behaviour and many of them commit relevant crime again. During the course of the study, I cannot help myself but to review and form an opinion on human nature with all the discussions, case studies and data points coming from different researches. My conclusion is that pure evil does exist but as exceptional case. Human is good in general but human fallibility is also unavoidable that there are many limitations. Therefore, there must be culture and thought leader in a society who promotes positive values. Hope my answer stimulates you on the topic. ",
