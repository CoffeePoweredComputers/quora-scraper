            "answer_text": "Original Question: How does science explain near death experiences? In a word, anoxia. A near-death experience is a recalled hallucination which occurs when the brain is starved of oxygen (anoxia) immediately after the heart and lungs stop (clinical death) and blood no longer flows in the body, and importantly, to the brain. Very simplistically, it\u2019s caused when dying brain cells (neurons) \u2018release\u2019 the memories which are stored at the junctions between adjacent synapses. In someone who\u2019s religious, thoughts of their particular religion\u2019s views on death and a claimed afterlife often come to the surface at this time, even if only subconsciously, and become incorporated into the hallucination. The fact that the hallucination is based around religious belief can easily be shown because Christians will have a near-death experience based around Christian beliefs of an afterlife, Muslims will have a near-death experience based around Islamic beliefs of an afterlife, Hindus will have a near-death experience based around Hindu beliefs of an afterlife and so on. Atheists very rarely have any religious overtones to any recalled near-death experience, showing that they\u2019re based on what particular religious thoughts are held in that person\u2019s brain at the time of clinical death. In a small number of instances when someone is revived because of prompt medical intervention following clinical death they recall this hallucination in a similar way to recalling some dreams. To some of these people, the experience can seem to have been perfectly real, and the more religious they are, the more they\u2019ll be convinced that it was real, however, in reality, there\u2019s no more to it than there is to a dream\u2026 It\u2019s all in the mind. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Answering your question, it can\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t preclude dreaming up an experience after that fact. Having been through cardiac arrest, I\u2019ll just tell you that what I remember was nothing at all like the stories I\u2019ve seen in some of the best selling books. No spirit guides, no crystal palaces and halls of learning, no flying on the back of a butterfly. That strikes me as something you dream up in the here and now, and if you read some of these books, you\u2019ll notice that their writers didn\u2019t actually die in the sense that their hearts didn\u2019t ever stop beating. Mine did. And doctors tell me that their patients who came back 5, 10, 20, and even 90 minutes after cardiac arrest have stories like mine. You go to a wonderful place of reunion that is utterly unlike anything \u201chere,\u201d much more different than merely flying on the back of a hummingbird with your dead baby sister to a crystal hall of learning.
