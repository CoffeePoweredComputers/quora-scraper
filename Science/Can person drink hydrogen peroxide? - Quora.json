            "answer_text": "This started out as a comment re: Shelly Dust Andrews (Shelly Dust Andrews) \u2026 my apologies it\u2019s kinda turned into and answer so i\u2019m going to post it as such. First, Shelly Dust Andrews (Shelly Dust Andrews) , the concentration percentage of the typical brown bottle hydrogen peroxide is 3%, not .3%. Probably a typo and I\u2019m not trying to nit pick. but .3% to 3% is a considerable difference in chemistry. Second, I am curious, what do you mean in saying you notice a \u201cclarity of thinking\u201d when you ingest dilute hydrogen peroxide? Similar to intoxication? That \u2018s what popped into my head anyhow. In researching the original question, I find plenty of information talking about high concentration, accidental ingestions. see: * Accidental Hydrogen Peroxide Ingestion (Accidental Hydrogen Peroxide Ingestion) * Accidental ingestion of 35% hydrogen peroxide (Accidental ingestion of 35% hydrogen peroxide) * Cerebral air gas embolism from concentrated hydrogen peroxide ingestion. (Cerebral air gas embolism from concentrated hydrogen peroxide ingestion.) Also found, * Drinking Peroxide as 'Natural' Cure Leads to Dangerous Blood Clots (Drinking Peroxide as 'Natural' Cure Leads to Dangerous Blood Clots) Not a scientific paper but it does seem legit. Hydrogen peroxide is/is being look at as a possible caner treatment. * Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) induces leukemic but not normal hematopoietic cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) induces leukemic but not normal hematopoietic cell death in a dose-dependent manner) can\u2019t find any studies actually examining any long term, regular ingestion of low concentration hydrogen peroxide. Wouldn't be a bad idea for a smart sciencey type to pursue maybe?! In case anyone is interested, here\u2019s a technical safety data sheet on H\u00b2O\u00b2 and a toxicology report from the UK which is a pdf BTW. * https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1834-7819.2000.tb00261.x (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1834-7819.2000.tb00261.x) * https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/337708/Hydrogen_Peroxide_Toxicological_Overview_phe_v1.pdf (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/337708/Hydrogen_Peroxide_Toxicological_Overview_phe_v1.pdf) I\u2019ve always been fascinated with hydrogen peroxide. I\u2019ve ingested a small amount once had no increase in clarity at all and promptly vomited in up. I use it as an antiseptic. it helps to help everything so long as you don\u2019t over use it. It works wonders for helping tooth pain from an abscess. Swish around hard enough just a small amount getting into an infected gum almost instant you can feel the effects. i used in on zits, ingrown hairs and nails, cuts, hangnails. But yeah, H\u00b2O\u00b2 is not one I drink personally. ",

            "answer_text": "Hydrogen peroxide is a very powerful oxidiser which means it simply \u201cblows\u201d apart organic material. This includes human tissue. Years ago I worked as an environmental chemist in a large chemical company importing storing blending and distributing bulk corrosives. We had 10 million litres of 50% caustic soda solution on site and in a nearby tank farm 20 to 40,000 litre tanks contains concentrated sulphuric and nitric acids. We had twelve bulk chemical tankers delivering our product all over New Zealand. We also used 30% hydrogen peroxide. My point is that we had a lot of competent staff, but I wanted to reinforce the need to wear goggles as well as visors when handling pressurised delivery lines. I struggled getting old hands onboard\u2026 they thought they knew it all. So I started getting pigs eyes from the butchers and putting them under a microscope in the lab, directing the plant operator to watch whilst I used a pipette to place a drop of 50% sodium hydroxide solution, 98% sulphuric acid, 68% nitric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide. Whilst the employees watched with interest as soon as I put the hydrogen peroxide onto the pigs eye they all recoiled in horror as the eye immediately swelled and exploded\u2026. The other substances when visualised under the microscope slowly ate into pigs eye over 3 or 4 mins\u2026. Time in which a splash could be washed out. However the effect of the peroxide was immediate and total! I had no problem convincing staff to wear safety gear after that. I would be very cautious of using hydrogen peroxide for anything on or in our bodies. Even if diluted\u2026.including mouth washes.. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, some one can drink anything that is liquid at room temperature.The real (unasked) question is what effect drinking H2O2 would have on a person's health. According to H2O2 - Wolfram|Alpha The probable lethal dose for man is 600 mL (i.e. just more than about half a liter or 20.3 ounces).  It says it is a mutagen and a tumorigen, which means (with a high enough exposure) can cause your body to mutate or produce tumors. Scary facts that these sound like, remember that most common chemicals when used for the wrong purposes and improper doses can cause problems.Hydrogen Peroxide is usually sold in a 3% solution in 32 ounces (1 quart).  So to get a lethal dose will require someone drinking almost 7 bottles of drugstore H2O2 which is still almost two gallons. So this cannot be done by accident. I hope this helps.  I am not a doctor nor a medical professional. ",
