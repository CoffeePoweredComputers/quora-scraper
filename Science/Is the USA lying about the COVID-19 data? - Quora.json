Here\u2019s a summary of what he\u2019s said about the coronavirus: January 20: \"I know more about viruses than anyone.\u201d January 22: \u201cWe have it totally under control. It\u2019s one person coming in from China. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d February 2: \u201cWe pretty much shut it down coming in from China.\u201d February 24: \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA\u2026 Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d February 25: \u201cCDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.\u201d February 25: \u201cI think that's a problem that\u2019s going to go away\u2026 They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we\u2019re very close to a vaccine.\u201d February 26: \u201cThe 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.\u201d February 26: \u201cWe're going very substantially down, not up.\u201d February 27: \u201cOne day it\u2019s like a miracle, it will disappear.\u201d February 28: \u201cWe're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.\u201d March 2: \u201cYou take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?\u201d March 2: \u201cA lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they\u2019re happening very rapidly.\u201d March 4: \u201cIf we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work \u2014 some of them go to work, but they get better.\u201d March 5: \u201cI NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.\u201d March 5: \u201cThe United States\u2026 has, as of now, only 129 cases\u2026 and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!\u201d March 6: \u201cI think we\u2019re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down\u2026 a tremendous job at keeping it down.\u201d March 6: \u201cAnybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They\u2019re there. And the tests are beautiful\u2026. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.\u201d March 6: \u201cI like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it\u2026 Every one of these doctors said, \u2018How do you know so much about this?\u2019 Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.\u201d March 24: \"I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.\" \"I gave it two weeks\" ",

            "answer_text": "There is a lot of lying going around now, because pertinate (inconvenient) information is being suppressed. The initial assumptions about the virus were wrong. I do not know if that was deliberate or not (there seems to be indications of \u2018deliberateness\u2019) but since then we have learned the facts and NOW there is actual lying, people KNOWING the facts and deliberately suppressing or obscuring them. There seems to be several \u2018agendas\u2019 perpetuating these lies\u2026 Power, prestige, money to be made (quadrillions with (ineffective) vaccines and population control). Bill Gates is setting himself up to be the richest man on the planet. If you look at the actual science instead of the \u2018theroretical statistics\u2019 presented by the (very effective) fear mongers, you\u2019ll quickly realize that no further testing needs to be done. That it\u2019s time to STOP wasting time and money pandering to the fearful. Testing that has already been done (over 12 independent studies now) show that the actual mortality of this virus is equal to or less than a normal flu season. The only reason we \u2018locked down\u2019 was to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 to prevent hospital ventilators from being \u2018over-run\u2019.Note that \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 does not mean \u2018less people infected\u2019. It only means \u2018spread the infection out over a longer time\u2019. Now that we know that:1. Ventilators are the WRONG TREATMENT for this virus2. There are now effective, inexpensive treatments for the virus 3. Treated properly there is near zero mortality 4. Hospitals are near empty, with Doctors and nurses being laid off5. the Lock Down is killing more people than the virus ever could No further testing needed (although I\u2019m sure this will be the most \u2018researched\u2019 virus in history. This pathogen will fade into the background as our immune systems adapt and develop \u2018herd immunity\u2019, just as has been happening for millions of years. Time to admit we grossly over-reacted, take a deep breath (ignore the fear mongers) and go back to normal. ",
