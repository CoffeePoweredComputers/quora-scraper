            "answer_text": "\u201cMetaphysical\u201d is defined as \u201cbeyond the physical.\u201d We have five physical senses, but we also have five psychic senses that are the same: sight,hearing, touch, taste and smell. My metaphysical experiences began in my childhood. At the age of eight years old, I dreamed my grandfather\u2019s death the day before he died. I was able to \u201csee\u201d psychically what what's going to happen to him. The dream provided a symbolic scenario which my child like mind could understand. In my dream my grandfather was bending over at the fireplace making a fire, when the \u201cTin Man\u201d a character from the classic movie, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d came up behind him and chopped him in the back with an ax. The \u201cTin Man\u201d represented love for me, because in the movie, he was going to Oz to get the wizard to give him a heart. So in my child like mind I was not distressed, because my grandfather had been taken by love. The next night, as I lay in my bed by the fireplace, my grandfather came home drunk and sat in a chair right in front of me. I absolutely adored him. And as I looked at him lovingly, he suddenly fell over. He hit the floor and he was dead. I didn't cry because I had been prepared for his death by the dream. I felt that my grandfather was going to a place of love. The day of his funeral there was a big snowstorm in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where I lived with my grandmother and grandfather in the 50s and early 60s. My grandmother felt that the weather was too bad for me to go to the funeral. \"Go into the living room and tell your grandfather goodbye,\" she said. In those days people held wakes in their homes if they could not afford a funeral home. \u201c He's gone already,\" I told my grandmother. And I went back to what I was doing. I understood that my grandfather was no longer on the Earth and there was no reason for me to grieve. He was my whole world, the only one, I felt, who truly loved me. That began by adventures in the realms beyond \"beyond the physical\". I am sharing this with you because I am not some famous psychic. I am a dedicated student of the mysteries of life. The same capabilities that I exhibited as a child, you can develop for yourself. For more than 25 years I have been a Rosicrucian. I belong to the organization known in this century as The Rosicrucian Order, AMORC. I receive my lessons, which include the study of psychic development, philosophy, healing, world religions, alchemy, visualization, and other metaphysical mysteries. Only you can find out for yourself if the metaphysical is real. The work is a wonderful adventure!Always be a walking question mark. Explore! Experiment! Experience! #InwardandOnward! #TogetherWeGrow A2A Francesca C. Simon hosts \"Charting Your Course\" sessions on Facebook Live! on Sunday nights at 10 p.m. to 12 midnight, exploring mysticism, creative visualization, metaphysics, numerology, astrology, qabalah and tarot. DISCLAIMER: Please forgive any obvious mispellings or nonsensical sentences. This is due to Mr. Auto Correct, who mistakenly believes he can read my mind. However, he is often unfamiliar with the esoteric terms that I may use, and attempts to rewrite my posts! Grrrrrr! ",

As if I cant see the thing or hear or touch them - then I ask -and what is, that what there is, like? Now Ive said metaphysical things. While early analytic philosophy tended to reject metaphysical theorizing, under the influence of logical positivism, it was revived in the second half of the twentieth century. Philosophers such as David K. Lewis and David Armstrong developed elaborate theories on a range of topics such as universals, causation, possibility and necessity and abstract objects. However, the focus of analytical philosophy generally is away from the construction of all-encompassing systems and toward close analysis of individual ideas. Among the developments that led to the revival of metaphysical theorizing were Quine's attack on the analytic\u2013synthetic distinction, which was generally taken to undermine Carnap's distinction between existence questions internal to a framework and those external to it. [63] The philosophy of fiction, the problem of empty names, and the debate over existence's status as a property have all come of relative obscurity into the limelight, while perennial issues such as free will, possible worlds, and the philosophy of time have had new life breathed into them. [64] [65] The analytic view is of metaphysics as studying phenomenal human concepts rather than making claims about the noumenal world, so its style often blurs into philosophy of language and introspective psychology. Compared to system-building, it can seem very dry, stylistically similar to computer programming or mathematics. Despite, or perhaps because of, this scientific dryness, it is generally regarded as having made \"progress\" where other schools have not. For example, concepts from analytical metaphysics are now routinely employed and cited as useful guides in computational ontologies for databases and to frame computer natural language processing and knowledge representation software.
