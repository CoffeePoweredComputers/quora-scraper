            "answer_text": "Nanoclusters are basically aggregates of small nanoparticles (you could also say individual nanoparticles) that are formed due to attractive interactions between individual nanoparticles. As you might be aware that that nanoparticles apart from being extremely amazing, are also very unstable owing to Quantum confinement phenomenon. So like every other ordinary atom/molecule , small nanoparticles aggregate together to form more stable clusters. In case of nanoparticles, mostly the size of the aggregates/clusters also falls well within the 100nm limit, and these aggregates are referred to as nanoclusters. To give you a simple analogy- Just consider the case of powdered snow and snowballs. Another example could be 'Besan ke Ladoo', which are made from roasted besan, sugar and ghee. ",
