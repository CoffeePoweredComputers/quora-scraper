            "answer_text": "I support Brett Johnson's answer to What is the difference between a snowflake and an ice crystal? To a mineralogist, \u201cice\u201d is the scientific name of the crystalline form of water (http://www.handbookofmineralogy.com/pdfs/ice.pdf). Snowflake is a crystal of ice that fell as snow. \u201cIce\u201d refers to the substance, \u201csnowflake\u201d to a single crystal of that substance. All snowflakes are made of \u201chexagonal ice\u201d. Beyond our familar hexagonal ice, several other crystalline forms of ice (The ice phases of water) have been studied in the laboratory, or predicted by computer models. They are never found as snow on Earth but some of them might exist elsewhere in the universe, including the icy outer planets of our solar system. ",
