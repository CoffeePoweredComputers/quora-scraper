            "answer_text": "To be more specific, if you drink lots of water, your blood (and other extracellular fluids) become more dilute, which is to say that they contain more water and less of the other stuff like salts, sugars, etc., that they normally carry. The membranes of your cells are permeable to water, and since the concentration of salts, sugars, etc., in the cells is now higher that in the liquid outside, we get osmosis of water into the cells, which makes them swell up. Mostly, this isn\u2019t a big deal. It doesn\u2019t do much harm if your liver cells or muscle cells or kidney cells swell up a little bit. But, there\u2019s one rather important organ that is inside a rigid bone box. When your brain cells swell, your brain has nowhere to expand. It just squeezes tighter and tighter against the skull, and it\u2019s kind of like having a concussion over the whole brain. This can do a lot of damage, and among other things cause you to stop breathing. Disclaimer: I didn\u2019t watch the video, but I talk about a case of lethal water intoxication in my biochemistry class. ",

            "answer_text": "The Youtube video you referenced is a nice compilation of relative toxicities; I\u2019ve bookmarked it for use elsewhere. Thanks! Regarding \u201cwater poisoning\u201d AKA \u201cwater intoxication\u201d . . . and sometimes \u201chyponatremia\u201d (though that\u2019s not quite the same thing\u201d, the articles here:Water intoxication - Wikipediaand here:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1770067/provide detailed information. But basically, MANY body processes depend on the correct ratios of water to sodium and potassium ions (among others). When you drink too much water, you screw up the ratios, which screws up the body processes . . . which causes you to die!  By the way, the video referenced with the original question is worth watching for anyone who does not have a clear understanding of relative toxicities.  ",

            "answer_text": "Water is a biproduct of the combination of hydrogen and oxygen. In this purest form, water has absolutely zero trace elements of carbons, iron, calcium or atoms of other elements that water collects during rainfall. When entering the human body in this form, the water will literally strip and collect needed nutrients that are essential for human survival. These nutrients are then disposed of rather than collected by your body for needed nutritional importance. Over a length of time, drinking pure distilled water (which contains the warning label \u201cnot for consumption\u201d ) will literally dry you out and kill you. ",

People need to drink more water, and less juice (too much sugar to consume frequently) and soda (soda actually dehydrates you badly, and is full of processed sugar which is bad for you, and toxic additives that are mildly poisonous. Diet soda is even worse, because the aspartame in it converts to extremely poisonous formaldehyde in the human body during digestion. Water is the best thing you could ever drink. As long as it is clean, filtered, disinfected water. Technically, too much of any good thing can kill you. There\u2019s 1 report I read of 1 crazy woman who drank 6 gallons of water a day for a week straight as some sort of a crazy weight loss diet. She died. She literally drowned her own internal organs in water. But that\u2019s literally like 1 in 7 trillion chances of happening, and you\u2019d have to drink insane amounts of water. ",
