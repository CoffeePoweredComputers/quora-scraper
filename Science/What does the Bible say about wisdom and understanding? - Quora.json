            "answer_text": "There\u2019s actually quite a distinction as the Bible describes wisdom and understanding in the Old Testament and then in the New Testament. In the Old Testament proverbs gives us a lot of advice how to be smart, teach children, understand people, etc. Then in the New Testament, Jesus Christ became the fulfillment of wisdom and understanding to the world. And this depends on if we have a relationship with him. The Bible explains the wisdom of those who understand what he did as a sacrifice to die for our sins and the understanding that if we ask him into our lives, we will be saved and not separated from him. This ultimately becomes the context and key to why the Bible was written. The old testament describes the need for a savior, and the new testament explains who that Savior is in Jesus. This ultimately is the key to wisdom and understanding\u2026 ",
