            "answer_text": "Black holes are not imaginary. You can\u2019t see them directly, but that is not to say they\u2019re not real, as there is a substantial amount of indirect evidence for their existence. BenefitsAs for the benefits\u2026 There are many ways to respond to this. The first is by saying there don\u2019t necessarily have to be any benefits. Science is an enterprise for knowledge, and so in some sense the benefits come secondarily. Science isn\u2019t strictly done for the benefits. The second thing to be said here is that there are many things we study of which we don\u2019t know and possibly can\u2019t know whether they will yield results that could benefit us. It's often in hindsight that we come to the realization that certain subjects of study would produce beneficial conclusions. The third thing to say is that it could be argued that all knowledge is going to benefit us one way or another. Even if it wouldn\u2019t result in anything that is going to change our lives in a substantial or even in minor ways, the notion of knowledge is beneficial in its own right. Don\u2019t take this statement too seriously, but it may be that the benefit of studying black holes is to ultimately realize it\u2019s a dead end so we don\u2019t have to invest any more time in it. The realization that we will never know anything substantial about these astronomical objects would be quite profound. Quantum gravitationBut I must seriously object to the notion of the study of black holes not being beneficial. The study of black holes is about some of the most fundamental concepts in physics. It\u2019s an exploration in special relativity, so the study of black holes may yield more insights in this area; it may validate special relativity or possibly show misconceptions about physics. It\u2019s also an exploration in gravitation, as black holes are gravity wells where spacetime curves to the highest degree. Considerations are made about quantum mechanics and how to reconcile this with special relativity. There are several theories of quantum gravitation, including loop quantum gravity and string theory. By studying black holes, we can gain insights about the nature of gravitation, how to reconcile different theories that pertain to different scales, and we can possibly rule out certain theories so we no longer have to invest any time in them.  \u200bMajor implicationsBut also consider that the theories that pertain to reconciling quantum gravitation with special relativity have major implications for the universe. For example, if loop quantum gravity is true then this may completely change what we know about the universe; it would get rid of the notion of singularities, including the singularity from which the universe emerged. It could lead to the realization that the Big Bang was one of many in an infinite cycle and that the 13,82 billion years we currently attribute to the age of the universe is only the age of the current cycle. If the universe is in fact infinitely old, then it most likely wouldn't be infinitely large.  \u200bSingularitiesBut black holes are also studies for their singularities and how to make sense of them. A singularity is defined as a 'location' where a lot of mass is packed within zero volume, or an infinitely small space. This is where the laws of physics seem to break down, and so by trying to understand singularities we may solve this riddle. This could either lead to the rejection of the existence of singularities (which would have major implications for how we ought to think about black holes) or a new way of making sense of how physics apply to this 'object'.  \u200bTimeBlack holes are also studied for the effect they have on time. A black hole is made out of a singularity and warped spacetime. Everything that falls into a black hole is forced within the curvature of this spacetime to go into one direction, which is the center of the black hole. It's thought that the singularity at the center is essentially a point where time comes to a halt, and distinctions between cause and effect can no longer be made. This is essentially why the laws of physics break down. An understanding of this singularity may have major implications for how we ought to think of time, and possibly even if time is a substance (realism), an interpretation (idealism) or a way to relate events (relationism). I can also highly recommend watching the following video:  Gravitational lensingBlack holes are also useful to study other objects. Due to the intense warping of spacetime, black holes can function as a gravitational lense, thus acting as a magnifying glass. Below is an image taken with the Keck II telescope where a supermassive black hole is spouting energy from inside the galaxy (called a quasar) and thereby magnifying a much more distant galaxy behind it. Black holes could in principle also be used to view objects behind its host galaxy which couldn't normally be seen.  \u200bQuasarsAnd that brings us to quasars. When a black hole acquires mass, an accretion disc forms around the black hole. When too much mass falls into the black hole at once, beams of energy will emerge from the poles in the form of X-rays and gamma-rays. These intense sources of energy are the brightest light sources in the universe and can be used as so-called \u2018standard candles\u2019, which are used in astronomy to measure distances. So not only do supermassive black holes that produce these jets offer us a way to deduce distance, but by studying black holes we may also deduce how quasars form in the first place, and how the spin of the black hole affects the outflow of matter, as supermassive black holes have been found to spray matter like a fountain. Galaxy regulatorsWhich brings us to the next reason for studying black holes. There is a correlation between the mass of a supermassive black hole and its galaxy, and black holes have been found to regulate star growth in galaxies; a process by which the largest elliptical galaxies continue making stars long after their peak years of star birth. Megan Donahue of Michigan State University explains: Think of the gas surrounding a galaxy as an atmosphere. That atmosphere can contain material in different states, just like our own atmosphere has gas, clouds, and rain. What we are seeing is a process like a thunderstorm. As the jets propel gas outward from the center of the galaxy, some of that gas cools and precipitates into cold clumps that fall back toward the galaxy\u2019s center like raindrops. Grant Tremblay of Yale University further explains: The \u2018raindrops\u2019 eventually cool enough to become star-forming clouds of cold molecular gas, and the far-ultraviolet capabilities of Hubble allowed us to directly observe these \u2018howers\u2019 of star formation. We know that these showers are linked to the jets because they're found in filaments and tendrils that wrap around the jets or hug the edges of giant bubbles that the jets have inflated. And they end up making a swirling \u2018puddle\u2019 of star-forming gas around the central black hole.  \u200bSo by studying black holes, we may gain more insights about how they correlate with galaxies, how they regulate galaxies, and why there are supermassive black holes at the center of most galaxies in the first place. They seem to be quite essential. It has also been found that supermassive black holes can have a maximum mass of 50 billion solar masses before the disc of gas around the black hole crumbles into stars, thus preventing the black hole from growing larger (though it could grow larger in principle, for example by galactic mergers). These are important findings for the direct relationship between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. Information paradoxBlack holes are also studied to resolve an apparent problem in physics, which is the black hole information paradox, which emerged when in 1974 Stephen Hawking applied quantum field theory to black hole spacetime and showed that black holes will radiate particles with black-body radiation called Hawking radiation, which slowly evaporates black holes over time. This poses a major problem for physics, because it implies that the information that constitutes the matter that falls into the black hole is lost forever, while the law of conservation indicates that information is never lost. There have been a myriad of attempts at solutions to this problem over the years, including: 1993 \u2014 The holographic principle \u2014 Gerard \u2019t Hooft, Leonard Susskind2002 \u2014 The fuzzball \u2014 Samir D. Mathur, Oleg Lunin2012 \u2014 The firewall \u2014 A. Almheiri, D. Marolf, J. Polchinski, J. Sully (AMPS)2015 \u2014 The brick wall \u2014 Gerard \u2019t HooftIn short, the holographic principle says that the information is embedded on a two-dimensional surface and thus is never lost. The fuzzball says that the interior of a black hole is made of strings (string theory) rather than a singularity, and thus information is never destroyed. The firewall says that an old black hole lost so much information through Hawking radiation that there is not enough information left to represent its interior, and since there is no interior, all matter that falls in is incinerated at the event horizon, so information is never trapped or destroyed inside. The brickwall is a variation on the firewall, where information bounces back. There is no solution to this problem yet, but it\u2019s a fundamental problem in physics which ought to be addressed. Laura Mersini-Houghton has recently done work to show that during the collapse of a star so much mass is lost through Hawking radiation that there is no longer enough mass for a singularity to form. Since a singularity wouldn't form, there is no apparent problem. This discussion will probably go on for many years to come, but while working out all these theories, there is always the potential that it will result in beneficial things or confirm or reject other theories.  \u200bGravitational collapseAnd finally, black holes are studied because they constitute the end point of stars of a sufficient mass. When a star collapses at the end of its life, it will produce a white dwarf, a neutron star or a black hole depending on its mass at the end of this process of gravitational collapse. Stars with an end mass below the Chandrasekhar limit of 1,39 solar masses will produce white dwarfs; stars with an end mass above this limit but below the Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit (up to 3 solar masses) will produce neutron stars, and everything above that will end up as black holes. Quite obviously we are interested in these mechanisms and at the general evolution of stars. The study of black holes is a necessary component of astrophysics, if we truly want to understand stars and the universe at large.  \u200bFrankly, a lot of theories depend on how we ought to make sense of black holes, so the study of black holes will potentially lead to a tremendous amount of benefits and knowledge.

            "answer_text": "The \u201cneed\u201d to study about black holes\u2026\u2026 or\u2026.. ANYTHING for that matter is \u201ccuriosity\u201d. It would be the same \u201cneed\u201d as a child who thinks they \u201cneed\u201d to stick a fork in a wall outlet to find out what happens\u2026.. the need to stop a garage sale to see what they have\u2026.. Do we as \u201chumans\u201d actually NEED to study black holes? Not really because our lives will go on quite nicely without ever even DISCOVERING black holes\u2026. The need to study anything is because we humans ask WHY? HOW? and have a need to know the unknown. Right now\u2026\u2026 we really know NOTHING about space\u2026.. ok\u2026.. maybe a LITTLE BIT as we have stepped out onto our \u201cporch\u201d and ran around in our \u201cyard\u201d a little bit\u2026\u2026 but for the most part, we know NOTHING about it. Everything we \u201cknow\u201d about space is really nothing more than \u201ctheories\u201d about what we can see out there by gazing at it. Here is an example. Scientists say that the faster an object moves away from us the redder the light becomes as we see it\u2026. so\u2026 the redder an object appears, the faster it moves away from us\u2026. The scientists are using this \u201cformula\u201d to actually CALCULATE how fast objects are traveling away from us (Earth). What is wrong with this \u201ctheory\u201d? Ever look at the moon and see it as different colors? Ever see the orange/reddish color in it? Hmm\u2026.. It must have fell out of ORBIT and started to speed away from us because it turned a reddish hue\u2026. Or\u2026.. what if a Red Giant is casting a reddish color onto a planet and we gaze at and see the red light reflecting off of it??? Even though it could in all actuality be traveling TOWARDS Earth, we would say it is going away at such and such speed because of the \u201cred shift\u201d\u2026.. Or\u2026.. if reddish color gasses/dust is between us and the light source = magically we see a red hue to the light as it is \u201cfiltered\u201d and showing us the color of the \u201cfilter\u201d (gas or dust). See how little we actually know but think we have mastered? We will never really start to KNOW anything about space until we are able to actually leave our \u201cfront yard\u201d and get past the moon\u2026. We are expanding our knowledge at a great pace now with the advances in robotics and the ability to get those robots OUT of our front yard and into the yards of our neighboring houses on the street we live on. The only FACT and 100% TRUTH of science is that it is WRONG. Why do I say this? When I went to school, there was 9 planets in our solar system. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. Now if kids say 9 planets on a test, they give a wrong answer and get marked off. Pluto as a planet no longer exists\u2026\u2026 Whatever you think you know today will be WRONG tomorrow when something else gets discovered that SHATTERS the \u201cideals\u201d we have in the past. Before we broke the sound barrier, it was said it will not or cannot be broken\u2026. some even said that we would just simply disintegrate if we traveled faster than sound\u2026.. Chuck Yeager said lets go get disintegrated! and now it is common knowledge and common practice to go faster than sound\u2026.. Joe Kitinger almost broke the sound barrier WITHOUT a vehicle as he jumped from a balloon and skydived from a height of 19.5 miles high and was in free fall for 4.xx minutes and reached a speed of 614 mph with no vehicle. He aslso did this in 1960 BEFORE the first human reached \u201cspace\u201d\u2026.. but\u2026.. in all actuality, joe = first human to view the earth like this with his own eyes. In 2012 Felix Baumgartner reached 843.6 mph in his record breaking free fall from 24.2 miles high from his balloon becoming the 1st human to \u201cdisintegrate\u201d without the use of a \u201cvehicle\u201d to accelerate him past the sound barrier. I could link Joe\u2019s video but\u2026.. even though he was the 1st\u2026.. 1960\u2019s camera technology just\u2026.. sucked! So\u2026. here is Felix\u2019s footage as he records his jump from 24.2 miles above the Earth in HD!!!! Oh, and Joe got the honors of being the voice talking to Felix from ground control :)  What is the need to jump out of a balloon from 19.5 miles above the Earth? It is the exact same as the need to study black holes\u2026.. pure human curiosity and the need to know the unknown. Science says we will not break the light barrier\u2026\u2026\u2026 just cannot be done because we will just DISINTEGRATE!!!! Hmm?? sound familiar? Well, here is MY theory\u2026. Optical BOOM instead of SONIC BOOM when we break the light barrier\u2026. even if tomorrow, next week, 100 years from now, or 1000 years from now\u2026.. because we are human and as long as humans exist, the NEED to know the unknown and the urge to do what they say CANT be done = the evidence that one day, Light Speed will be broken just as Chuck Yeager crossed the sound barrier and traveled faster than sound. One quick question? If something DID go faster than light\u2026\u2026 how could you POSSIBLY SEE IT? :) Therefore we have never observed ANYTHING traveling faster than light\u2026. because the object would \u201cdisappear\u201d once it accelerated past the light barrier as they would be traveling faster than the light reflecting off it (if it COULD refelct off it, because it could not CATCH the object to BOUNCE off it.) Would you not see the object reach Light Speed and never a speed more than light if light can only travel AT light speed\u2026. so the light reaching your eye would lead you to believe it only REACHED it but never went FASTER than it? WE KNOW NOTHING about the cosmos\u2026. we only look in wonder and \u201ctry\u201d to explain the wonderful things we observe from our own little dot in the sky. It is pretty certain that once we do get out there, and see things up close and for ourselves\u2026.. EVERYTHING we know now will change\u2026.. THIS IS THE NEED WE HAVE TO STUDY BLACK HOLES\u2026.. Simply because they are THERE (or so we \u201cthink\u201d lol). ",
