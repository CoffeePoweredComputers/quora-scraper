            "answer_text": "If a ball lays still on the ground it has low potential energy. Pick it up and you impart some additional potential energy \u2014 the ability to do work \u2014 when it falls down again. The ball is gravitationally bound to Earth. Only by adding (a lot of) energy can you liberate it from Earth's influence and make it a free object. An electron in the vicinity of the nucleus behaves similat. It is bound to the nucleus and you have to add energy to move ot further from the nucleus (excite the atom) or liberate it completely (ionize the atom). When solving the quantum mechanical problem of an atom you will find that electrons can have only dome discrete values of energy. If possible, all electrons would crowd the lowest energy state. Fortunately, electrons are fermions, meaning they 'don't like each other\u2019, and thus only two can take each energy value. That's why electrons in atoms will be distributed in several orbitals. Sinsce the electrostatic force betwern the nucleus and an electron is attractive, just like the gravitational force between the Earth and the ball in the example above, the electron will try to move as close to the nucleus as quantun mechanics allows. And this state will have the lowesy possible energy, because the electron will be bound to the nucleus very tightly. em erst orbital is the lowest one in terms of energy, simply be ",

            "answer_text": "Because the first orbital is smaller, which keeps the electron closer to the nucleus. Since the electron and the nucleus have opposite charges, the potential energy is lower when they are closer to each other. The kinetic energy gained by falling to lower levels of the atom is only (approximately) half of the lost potential energy. Since total energy is the potential energy plus kinetic energy, the total energy is lower. ",
