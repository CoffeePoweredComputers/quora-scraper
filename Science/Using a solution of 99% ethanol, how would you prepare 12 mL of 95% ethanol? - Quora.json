            "answer_text": "Use the magical formula: C1*V1 = C2*V2 Say it out-loud 100 times. See-one-vee-one see-two-vee-two. It's one of the most important formulas in chemistry. C is concentration and V is volume. Always make sure the units match on both sides. So: 99% * V1 = 95% * 12 99V1 = 1140 V1 = 11.52 ml Hence, you need to combine 11.52 ml of 99% ethanol with 0.48 ml of water. Simple! ",

            "answer_text": "Your 99% ethanol solution is probably not a realistic practical starting point. It is more likely that ethanol is available as an approximately 96% solution due to inefficiency in distillation and the tendency for ethanol to take up atmospheric moisture. Thus your starting point is more likely to be 96% ethanol and you can then apply the methods outlined in the other answers v1c1 =v2c2 etc to give you the 95% solution strength required.. ",
