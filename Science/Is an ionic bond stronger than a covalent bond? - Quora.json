            "answer_text": "The following is from a handout which I wrote for my students: All chemical bonding, whether the bonds are so-called \"ionic\", \"covalent\" or \"metallic\", share a common theme. The neighboring electrons of the atoms are attracted to the nuclei of the bonded atoms. When the attraction between the neighboring electrons and the nuclei of the bonded atoms is the same or close to it, then the bonds have high covalent character. As the attraction becomes more polarized, the bonds take on more \"ionic\" character. There are numerous assignment of hypothetical electronegativity differences to describe bonds, including a value of 1.67 which supposedly separates \"ionic\" from \"covalent\". An electronegativity difference of 1.67 represents a bond with 50% ionic character. Does that mean that a bond with an electronegativity difference of 1.62 is \"covalent\" and one with \"1.72\" is \"ionic\"? There is not a bonding dichotomy. Instead, there is a bonding continuum. Just as there are continuous shades of gray between \"white\" and \"black\", there are continuous gradations in the polarity of chemical bonds. It's not an \"either-or\". The terms \"ionic\" and \"covalent\" refer to ideal bonds, bonds which seldom occur in nature. There are no 100% ionic bonds, and relatively few 100% covalent bonds. Real bonds lie along the continuum between these two extremes and have characteristics of both of the ideal bond types. This is why it is more useful to talk about the \"percent ionic character\" of a bond rather than saying it is \"ionic\" or \"covalent\" because it isn't likely to be either.   Most of the few 100% covalent bonds are found in the homonuclear, diatomic molecules of the elements (H2, N2, O2, F2, Cl2, Br2, I2) as well as molecules like P4 and S8. There are no 100% ionic bonds. But there are bonds which are very polar and have many of the characteristics of the hypothetical ionic bond. The percent ionic character of a bond can be described using the electronegativity difference, \u0394EN. Bonds with the greatest ionic character will be between elements with the greatest difference in electronegativity. The following empirical relationship was developed by Linus Pauling and gives a good approximation of the percent ionic character.  Percent ionic character = 100[1 - e^(-\u0394EN\u00b2/4)]   Compound .... percent ionic character  CsF ................ 92%  CaO ............... 77%  NaCl................ 71%  AlCl3 ............... 45%  CuCl2 ............. 33%  H2O ................ 32%  SnCl2 .............. 30%  PCl3 ................ 21%  CH4 .................. 3%   Don't be misled by statements that metal-nonmetal bonds are \"ionic\". Clearly, you can see that many bonds between metals and nonmetals have significant covalent character.   Therefore, the bonds in compounds which involve nonmetals have significantly greater covalent character. Bonds between the alkali metals (and some alkaline earth metals) and highly electronegative elements tend to have high ionic character. But for the transition metals and poor metals, their bonds with nonmetals will often have greater covalent character than ionic character. Therefore, you cannot say that all metal-nonmetal bonds are \"ionic.\" That simply isn't true. Metallic bonding is very similar to covalent bonding in that there is orbital overlap so that the valence electrons are free to move from atom to atom. The difference in covalent bonding and metallic bonding is that covalent bonds involve the overlap of the valence orbitals between two atoms (more if there are delocalized electrons, and pi bonding, for instance), and metallic bonding involves the overlap of the valence orbitals of ALL the metal atoms in the sample. The valence electrons are delocalized and free to move throughout the entire sample. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. It actually takes more energy to remove an electron from a sodium atom than is given back when the electron is added to a chlorine atom. But, sodium chloride isn\u2019t encountered as a single ion pair. Like all ionic compounds, NaCl exists as an ionic crystal in which there are layers of ions arranged in a manner that maximizes attractions between positive and negative ions while minimizing repulsions between anions and anions, and between cations and cations.The crystal lattice is very strong, Ionic crystals have very high melting points and boiling points. Yet, many ionic compounds dissolve in water, with the positive end of the water molecule becoming associated with the anions and the negative end of the water dipole becoming associated with the cations. Stable covalent compounds abound. Some, such as hydrocarbons, react with oxygen, burning to form CO2 and H2O. Again, the products are stable covalent compounds, but with much lower mps and bps than ionic crystals. As other respondants have pointed out, the strongest covalent bonds exist in situations where atoms and molecules have formed an extensive network of bonds. This would also be true of metallic bonding. Many properties of metals (luster, malleability, ductility) arise from the fact that the metal atoms form a network in which their valence electrons are free to move throughout the entire solid. ",
