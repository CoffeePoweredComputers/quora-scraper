            "answer_text": "The objects in the universe, as far as reflection is considered can be classified as two kinds - Luminous and Non-luminous. Luminous objects emit light by themselves. To see the luminous objects we need only another object, our eye. We directly see the luminous objects with the help of the light they emit (example: a light bulb, sun). To see the non-luminous objects we need two other objects - One, our eye and the other a light source. When light from the source hits the non-luminous object (books, chairs) the light rays are reflected and gets to the observer\u2019s eye and thus we will be able to see it. This is how we see the things around us. This is how even the Sunlight is helping us see nature. The color that is reflected by a particular object is the color of that object - a leaf is green in color since it is reflecting green and absorbing all other colors. When light hits an object, some of it is reflected some of the light energy may be converted into heat like when sunlight hits the skin, we experience heat - This is of course a different point of discussion.

            "answer_text": "Simplest and most significant importance of reflection is guidance of light energy at a desired path where we must reflection in particular ratio as per design of any experiment or event normally termed folding / changing path of a ray. Opposite to this most of reflections not desired by experiment or imaging are source of noise in image or signal and there we need zero or reduced reflection usually by antireflection coatings. ",
