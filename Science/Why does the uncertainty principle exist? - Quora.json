            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat causes the uncertainty principle, why does it happen?\u201d That\u2019s a very good question that physicists cannot answer, almost by definition, due to their need to have experimental evidence in order to be able to accept something as being true. As you probably know the Uncertainty principle - Wikipedia tells us that the more you know about one of a pair of complementary opposites, such as momentum and position, the less you can know about the other. So, because the math or experimental evidence cannot allow us to know the precise state of a particle (or a wave) at any given moment we cannot provide the evidence to validate any attempt to explain why and we are left with a conundrum. But that\u2019s not always been entirely true. You see, the scientific method requires two kinds of models that includes logical models that try to explain why something is true as well as mathematical models that attempt to quantify results that can then be verified through experimental evidence. Quantum Mechanics kind of abandoned logical models due to the intrinsic weirdness of experimental results that seemed so inexplicable in the context of only three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. However, once you reason through logical models or calculate through mathematical models that there must be extra dimensions of spacetime beyond the four we know about, then physicists lose the ability to test and verify any results or predictions, so they consider such hypothesis as not being scientifically useful. Personally, I have to strongly disagree with that system because without understanding why things happen, we cannot fully understand or explain anything. So, if you can accept the existence of extra-dimensions of space or time without having any experimental evidence to validate such claims than I can offer you my own hypothesis for a theory of everything that the reason that we can only know half of the necessary information that can precisely describe the state of a particle is because half of all such information is hidden from us in an extra-dimension of negative time. So, what is negative time? In order to explain that, I need to take you all the way back to the Big Bang at the beginning of time, when all matter and all antimatter was created in equal parts as entangled particle pairs. Now this brings up another great mystery of physics that I must first address: What happened to antimatter? Current theory believes that almost all matter and antimatter annihilated with each other as soon as it was created leaving only a tiny bit of matter left over that is the Universe today only that does not explain how particles that were created in pairs can end up unbalanced which still has no explanation today. This brings us back to my own theory or logical model that attempts to explain everything. The great physicist Richard Feynman once said that antimatter behaves exactly like matter only traveling backwards in time. While it\u2019s true, most physicists took this to be a kind of figurative truth and not a literal truth, but let\u2019s assume, for the moment, that antimatter really does travel backwards in time. Well then, antimatter that was created at the beginning of time, would not be moving in a frame of time where everything was moving backwards like video running in reverse. Antimatter would have to exist in a completely separate frame of negative time. To understand, think of a number line where you start counting from zero. If you counted forwards you would be counting positive numbers but if you started counting backwards from zero, you would be counting negative numbers. \u2026, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, +6, +7, +8, +9, +10, \u2026 So, in that same way, matter would exist in a dimension of positive time while antimatter must exist in an extra dimension of negative time and the two time lines, or more accurately time rays, would never actually overlap or co-exist except in a virtual manner via their entanglement.  Figure 1: A dual Big Bang model with symmetrical light cones where antimatter expands in a light cone in negative time while matter expands in a light cone in positive time and so the two types of matter never meet in order to self annihilated after the Big Bang. Instead, they created a dual universe that were equal and opposite and yet they would together have the same shared deterministic future due to their being entangled like two sides of the same coin. However, while the dual universes were tied through their entanglement to have a shared determinism, they would each be completely hidden from the other so any observer that existed in either dimension could not precisely know the state of any particle and therefore they are independantly prevented from calculating their shared deterministic future because half of the information is always hidden from them. That is what causes the Uncertainty Principle. What\u2019s more, that is why, together they can have a deterministic future, but relatively speaking, neither side can have the complete information necessary to determine their own future and so they each can have free will with consequences to their decisions that will determine their future.

            "answer_text": "This is another reason why Quantum Field Theory should have replaced Quantum Mechanics a long time ago. In QFT the Uncertainty Principle makes perfect sense, as I describe in my book. (If you want to see how QFT resolves the other paradoxes of QM and Relativity, please \u201cLook Inside\u201d my book here.) The probabilistic interpretation of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation eventually led to the uncertainty principle of QM, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927. This principle states that the exact position of a particle cannot be determined, but the uncertainty in position is related to the uncertainty in its momentum. So not only do we have wave-particle duality to deal with, we have to deal with particles that might be here or might be there, but we can\u2019t say where. If the electron is really a particle, then it stands to reason that it must be somewhere. Resolution. In QFT there are no particles (stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before) and hence no position, certain or uncertain. Instead there are blobs of field spread out over space. Instead of a particle that is either here or here or possibly there, we have a field that is here and here and there. Spreading out is something that only a field can do; a particle can\u2019t do it. In fact, there is a property of fields called Fourier\u2019s theorem that relates the spatial spread of a field to the spread of its wavelengths. Now in QFT the wavelength of a quantum is related to its momentum, so Fourier\u2019s theorem is equivalent to the relationship between position and momentum in the Uncertainty Principle. I still remember my moment of insight in graduate school when I realized that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is nothing more than Fourier\u2019s theorem. ",
