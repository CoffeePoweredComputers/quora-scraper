            "answer_text": "What the Raikov effect is all aboutWell, the Raikov effect is a form of neuroscience that uses a series of well known brain techniques to enhance the power of your mind and your abilities in any field such as sports, playing musical instruments, improving your personality and character traits, becoming better in your career, and any other area of life you feel needs a little boost. In layman\u2019s terms, the Raikov effect increases the quality of attributes in you which you want to get better at, using people you really admire in that field, using the series of brain techniques that are executed in a certain order to stimulate your brain and train it to become that better. The brain techniques which I am talking about, that have been used to create the Raikov effect include hypnosis, modeling, deep trance states, visualization, suggestion, positive thinking, believing and relaxations. (But please note that they are not executed in this exact order, I\u2019m just mentioning them.) These brain techniques have always been the best known strategies that have brought rewarding results in improving the power of the brain through the years, which is what makes the Raikov system very potent, if executed properly. 2. The History of Raikov Effect (To help you understand the science, and where it comes from ) This science was discovered by a well known neuropsychologist in Russia called Vladimir Raikov, hence the name of the science, or method if you will, the Raikov effect. He used it on students to make them able to release their latent genius capabilities, and succeeded in making one of them the best musical instrument players within minutes. He also used it to convince one of his students that she was the famous Italian painter, Rafael. And she used the Raikov effect method of brain training consistently, and she was able to come up with an amazing work of art, which was just as brilliant as Rafael\u2019s work. This science amazed many people included Krippner, an American physchologist. What Dr. Vladimir Raikov discovered is a certain order of training and stimulating the brain consistently to release the confidence and mental energy needed to handle any task out there. And as you keep using it, your brain keeps growing in skill and competence. 3. The Evolution of the Raikov Effect (into something even better) Since this science did not become much popular, it went underground and was later discovered by a brain improvement company called Inspire3. They studied it and developed it into a more comprehensive program that has now become even more potent than the original version, since during the days of dr. Vladimir Raikov (the 1970\u2019s) there were no advanced brain tools and technology as there is now. The Raikov effect that was improved by the company was designed into a 10 minutes audio that brings better brain changing results than those Vladimir Raikov brought in his students, in just 10 minutes. Inspire3\u2019s Raikov system comes with a pdf course, the 10 Minute audio, 5 targeted audios for stimulating and training your brain for confidence, brain power, weight loss, the law of attraction and wealth and abundance. You can learn more about the current version of the Raikov Effect by inspire3 in this review. It is the most detailed review I have seen so far. http://improveyourbrainpower.org/raikov-effect-review-my-favorite-genius-hack Finally, the Raikov effect is a very great program, if you will use it wisely, with full concentration and continuously for about 3 months to get the best results with it.

            "answer_text": "Raikov is the Hypnosis technique used to change the frequency of mind and make it set on the next level using Hypnosis Trance! How To Use The Raikov Effect To Activate The Genius Skills Of ANYONE You Want Moving on from the old approach of using hypnosis, psychologists and neuroscientists now advocate much simpler ways to attain the Raikov Effect. One of the foundational techniques is called anchoring, and it\u2019s as straightforward as it is transformative. The key thought is that you can create a physical trigger that launches you into a particular mental state. You already have these anchors in everyday life, often connected to physiological. For example, when you feel your stomach is empty, you want to reach for a food. What you now need is to find and cement anchors that allow you to seamlessly activate the genius skills of your role models. You can choose any anchoring trigger you like. However, the easier and subtler the physical movement, the more you can use it in public. For that reason, many people opt for touching the thumb to the index finger. Or, tapping the back of the hand. Once you\u2019ve connected that gesture to your genius state, you can reenter the state any time you like by repeating the gesture. Of course, there are other processes that can activate the Raikov Effect in different ways. The more of the techniques you know then the more genius states you can enter. However, the above example of anchoring gives you a sense of how easy, safe and potent these types of techniques can be. ",
