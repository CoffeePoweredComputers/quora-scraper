            "answer_text": "Well you think when you are doing kick box, go to gym or sitting in a chair. Actually all the time you are awake you are thinking even if you don\u2019t realize it. Some people think even on their sleep because they stress a lot. Brain is using carbs are fuel to think. Carbs are calories so yes thinking is burning calories. But since you are thinking either way that adds to the normal calories you need to sustain yourself and not like extra burned calories like lifting weights for example or running. If overthinking was burning so much calories all women would be less than 15% fat. :-P By the way sitting in cold also burns calories and a lot for a matter of fact. Cause your body burns fat to produce heat, and raise your body temperature on cold environments. Anyway don\u2019t put yourself on a fridge you will freeze yourself. :-D And since you like fan facts(I guessed that from your question) an ice cube has zero calories. Real zero calories. No fat, carbs or protein. But don\u2019t become an ice cube please. :-D ",

            "answer_text": "Ewan McNay, an assistant professor of psychology and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Albany, has studied the subject exclusively and has found that yes we do indeed burn some calories when we are thinking. For some context, the brain makes up 2% of a person\u2019s body weight and takes up 20% of their energy. Performing a more demanding, such as one that requires memorization, will burn more calories than just putting items in an Excel spreadsheet. The harder the task, the more calories you burn As for a number on thinking calories a person uses about 320 calories to think and this can go up by 5% depending on the task or activity. McNay says a person who spends most of the day trying to learn a new instrument could burn up to 200 calories which is on par with cycling or walking up stairs for 30 minutes. Now don\u2019t immediately give up going to the gym for trying to explain the plot of Inception to someone, but do remember that thinking does take up some energy. (c) ",

Your basal metabolic rate accounts for the calories burned pumping blood, breathing, and yes\u2026 your normal mental activity is part of it - approximately 20%. If your BMR is around 1500, your mental activity would account for about 300 of that. There are studies that show that you can raise that rate, but bear in mind that most of that mental activity is unconscious. The portion of that 300 that you can affect by \u201cthinking hard\u201d is far less than 300, and the amount that you might be able to raise it by is very small: maybe 10 to 20 calories.

That base rate of caloric metabolism is called the basal metabolism rate. It relates most closely to mean muscle mass but most calculators focus on height, weight, and sometimes age or BMI, and varies by individual. You also can get an idea of your own basal metabolism rate by using one of the online calorie counters such as the Livestrong MyPlate app. ",

Ever noticed when you\u2019re really hungry or completely exhausted from exertion that it\u2019s harder to think? Hard thinking takes fuel. And oxygen, which is a sign you\u2019re burning fuel. However, thinking does not burn a lot of calories. Mostly it just depends on your blood sugar levels that are more substantially affected by your large muscle activity and your eating. ",
