            "answer_text": "This is based on mole concept. So, Molar mass of C-12, M is 12 g. The given mass, m is 24 g. We know that the avagadro number is 6.023*10^23 n Thus, n= m/M*avagadro number That is 24/12*6.023*10^23 = 12.046*10^23 atoms. Therefore 24 g of C-12 contains 12.046*10^23 atoms. ",

Well, as the molecular weight of C12 is 12, thus, 12 gm of C12 = 1 mol C12 24 gm of C12 = 2 mol C12 Now 1 mol cobtains 6.023 * 10^23 atoms Thus 2 mol i.e. 24 gm of C12 contains 2*6.023*10^23 atoms = 12.046 * 10^23 atoms.

The calculation is simple and as follows- Molar mass of carbon=12g Since no. Of moles of atoms = (weight)/(molar mass) Therefore the total number of atoms =24/12 moles=2moles =2\u00d76.023\u00d7(10^22). ",
