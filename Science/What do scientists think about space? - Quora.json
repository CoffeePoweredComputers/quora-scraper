            "answer_text": "It's pretty cool. Hot in places too. I'm a physicsist - what on Earth (ha!) do you expect me to say? I think about space at least once a day - I've done hundreds of problems set in space, and in my free time I've stared at the stunning photos Hubble and other telescopes have provided us. I've followed the recent Juno mission closely - I was actually present at the launch in 2011, which is pretty cool. Space isn't something where opinion matters. It's like asking what you think of continental plates - they just are. Space exists. I think about that a lot. Things happen in space. I think about that more often. People live in space - I think that's pretty amazing. I could go on. You may need to be more specific if you want a decent answer. ",
