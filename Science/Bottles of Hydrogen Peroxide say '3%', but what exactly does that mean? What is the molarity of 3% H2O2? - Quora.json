            "answer_text": "All five of the other answers are \u201cwrong\u201d, as I detail in my answer to What is 3, 12 and 35% hydrogen peroxide in molar concentration? Not wrong, in the sense that they did something wrong with their equation, but because they assumed the reported concentration on the bottle is exactly what it says it is. And if you read my answer to What chemical do scientists fear the most, you know that just because a bottle is labeled as such doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s actually what\u2019s in it. Hydrogen peroxide, at any concentration, isn\u2019t stable and slowly \u201cleaks\u201d oxygen in the reaction 2 H2O2 -> 2H2O + O2 So what you need is a procedure to actually quantify how many moles of hydrogen peroxide is present[1] . And if you look into that procedure, you\u2019ll see it can be done with permanganate titration, and even permanganate isn\u2019t stable, either- you need to standardize and normalize your solutions of potassium permanganate, or make them fresh from pure solid. You can get a rough measure of e.g. 3% H2O2 being approximately 0.9M, and you could also round up and call it a \u201c1M\u201d solution for the purpose of estimation. But, dammit, don\u2019t assume that \u201c0.88\u201d or \u201c0.9\u201d or \u201c1.0\u201d is the right answer for any of it. It\u2019s invariably wrong. In all likelihood[2], it is made in an approximate concentration of 25% to 35% and diluted one-to-ten without too strict controls over exactly what the final concentration is. And it\u2019s not always pure, either- it may have some stabilizers or other preservatives in it, like acetanilide[3]. And then it rolls off the line, and immediately begins to lose oxygen.

            "answer_text": "It means that 3% of the solution (as weight) is made by H2O2. The rest is H2O (unless there is some stabilizer, that, however, should not affect the composition of the solution significantly). To know the molarity of H2O2 in that solution, you should know the density (aka specific gravity) of the solution. Since the large majotity of it is water, assume, as a first approximation, that the density is 1000 g/Liter. So, 3% of H2O2 means there are 30 g H2O2 in 1000 g of solution, that is in 1 liter of solution. Now, divide 30 g/L by the molar mass of H2O2, which is 34 g/mol, as easily obtainable from the molecular formula. The result is about 0.9 mol/L, which expresses the concentration of H2O2 in the solution under the form of molarity. Do not give the result more significant digits, since the starting one (i. e., 3%) had only one, and also keeping into account the approximations employed in the calculation. ",
