            "answer_text": "Well, transfer would not be the correct term. Potential energy does not actually change into another kind or type of energy. Both potential and kinetic energy are the same energy. Being potential or kinetic simply means the energy is at different states. Potential energy is energy, although in motion, that is at rest within a body or a finite region or space. In this state the energy has the potential to become more active to do work, either within its space or beyond. Potential that becomes more active, agitated or even projected is in these states called kinetic energy. The energy is not transferred it just changes states. Now, a particular potential energy can be projected as kinetic energy upon another potential form of energy that would then transfer at least some of its kinetic energy to the other. Kinetic energy is energy the was at rest motion within a body, region or space, that has become more active, agitated or even projected as work or actively doing something within or outside its potent state.

            "answer_text": "If I understand right, potential energy can be converted to other forms of energy. Potential energy is the energy stored in a system. Like mechanic tension of springs. Gravity bound objects. It can also be stored as chemical bonds. Releasing this energy results in heat, light or kinetic(like a sudden expantion of gas) energy. There\u2019s a but. I\u2019m no scientist so this is only my reflection on this topic. As kinetic energy is the energy of movement, it could be argued that heat is a form of kinetic energy as it is based on molecule movement and interaction. The more movement the greater the heat. Light is electromagnetic radiation, which is also movement of photons, but as photons have no mass, I\u2019m not sure if it can be classified as \u201ckinetic\u201d. I\u2019d risk the notion that potential energy can be converted into other energy types but it\u2019s conveyed through kinetic e. I\u2019m probably wrong, so feel free to correct me. ",

            "answer_text": "Potential everything can turn into kenetic energy. Hold a ball in the air and it has gravitational potential energy. Let it Go, and the ball falls converting that potential energy into kinetic energy. I have a feeling that you meant other than kinetic energy. Well sure. Potential energy basically is just saying that there is energy stored in an object. For instance a battery may have electrical potential energy. the energy is stored in the battery until you complete the circuit then current will flow and you know have real electrical energy that can do work. Even that gravitational potential energy can turn into other forms of energy along a chain. Get whatever you dropped to turn the wheel and you can convert that gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy, mechanical energy, electrical energy, then into heat energy, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you Istisk Hossain for A2A How do we define potential energy: It is energy possessed by a body by virtue of its position, stresses within itself, electric charge, and other factors. We have included gravitational, mechanical, electrical, nuclear and chemical. First three kind are convertible into kinetic energy, where potential energy is also understood as capacity to do work. Nuclear potential energy is the potential energy of the particles such as protons and neutrons that are present inside the nucleus of an atom. Nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, and nuclear decay are processes through which this kind of energy gets converted into kinetic, heat and light energy. Chemical potential energy is stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules. The chemical potential energy gets released often in the form of heat when the bonds between the atoms are broken. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are referring to gravitational potential energy, then no. To do anything at all with that energy (to reduce the amount of gravitational potential energy) you have to let the object fall in the gravitational field. That necessitates conversion to kinetic energy. So that\u2019s a first step. If you are speaking of more general forms of \u201cpotential energy,\u201d such as the energy of rest mass, then yes - matter/anti-matter annihilation will convert the energy directly to photos - electromagnetic energy.

            "answer_text": "As the question suggests the most common form of energy transformation is from potential energy to kinetic energy. There are machines that turn potential energy into potential energy of a different type. These would include hydro-electric dams, gas power plants, nuclear power plants and radioisotope generators. However, to do this they all have to turn the potential energy into kinetic energy first then back into potential energy of a different type. There's more info about energy in general in my Kindle book 'Zero to Physics in 60,000 Words'. You can read the energy chapter by clicking 'Look inside'. ",
