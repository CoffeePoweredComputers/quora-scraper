            "answer_text": "In both fission and fusion, your statement is exactly bass-ackwards. In a fission reaction, a large nucleus splits into two (occasionally three) smaller nuclei. The total mass of the reaction product is ALWAYS less than the original. The excess mass converts to energy via E = mc^2. In a fusion reaction, two small nuclei are shoved together into one heavier one. In the Sun, that\u2019s usually two Hydrogen nuclei glued together into one Helium nucleus. The mass of the He nucleus is less than the two H nuclei; the excess mass is converted to energy via E = mc^2. ",

            "answer_text": "In fission a nucleus breaks up, into two nuclei, with emission of neutrons. In fission for energy to be released, the sum of masses of the products needs to be less than the mass of the original nucleus. It is this difference in mass which is converted into energy in accordance with the relation E =m*c^2. In case of fusion two light nuclei combine to form one heavier nucleus. In this case the mass of the heavier nucleus is less than the sum of the combining nuclei. And again the difference in masses gets converted into energy in accordance with the relation E=m*c^2. So your statement is true only for fusion. ",
