            "answer_text": "You could, but there's no point. The advantage over air balloons would be miniscule. Buoyancy works by subtraction if densities, not division. Water has a density at sea level of 1000g/L. Helium has a density of 0.1786g/L. Air has a density of 1.225g/L. Therefore, an air balloon of volume 1L would have a buoyancy of 1000\u20131.225g = 998.775, and the same balloon filled with helium would have a buoyancy of 1000\u20130.1768g = 999.8232g. For all the effort and expense of helium, you only get 1 extra gram per litre of buoyancy. The only reason you would want to use helium I guess, is if you had some sort of contraption that started underwater, then when it was releases, floated to the surface, and continued into the sky. However, given that air in water is 999 times more buoyant than helium in air, if you had a balloon that could lift 1kg into the air, you'd need a 1 tonne weight to hold it under water!! Either way it seems impractical to me. ",

            "answer_text": "Patrick Hinchey provided a really complete answer. I just thought I\u2019d provide a photo to show that it is possible to actually work with balloons under water. This particular shot of my friend Bidou is showing a balloon poodle filled with air, not helium. As Patrick pointed out, the results under water are the same. You can see the tail of the poodle pulling up due to the bubble at the end of the tail. If he let go, the whole thing would rise.  If you look here: View complete picture entries You can see him inflating the balloon under water as well. ",
