            "answer_text": "I sounds to me like you are looking at your education as a means to an end and not an end in itself. Education is like playing with building blocks. The math you learn in middle school gives you the foundation to build upon in high school. Develop a desire to read as soon as you can and start reading rather than watching tv or playing video games and you will be well ahead of your peers who don\u2019t pick up a book until they have to. If you want to have the lead in the school play your junior or senior year, start acting as soon as you can in Church plays or other venues that are open to young kids. In other words, your performance as a Junior or Senior in High School will be influenced and informed in the work that you do in elementary and middle school. Commit to a love of learning and you will find that high school is not that difficult and with the proper work ethic you may find that colleges and universities will see you as the type of student that will add value and merit aid if you aren't financially in need.

            "answer_text": "I assume if you are asking this question you are younger than a Junior. Unfortunately, the answer is no. Your cumulative GPA is made up of grades from all four years of high school. Plus, colleges get your transcript from all four years of high school. So, they all count. In fact, in some ways senior year last half is less important because by that time you have already gotten into college! On the other hand, if you screwed up in your Freshie and Sophomore year it will help a lot to improve in your Junior year. There is a good chance that colleges will give you a \u201cpass\u201d on those years if you show improvement and do well on the SAT/ACT. ",
