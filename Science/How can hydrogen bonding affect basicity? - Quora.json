            "answer_text": "If the Hydrogen bonding is strong then the acid is unable to release enough H+ ions on disassociation and therefore is a weak acid for example in the H-bonding of HF the bonding is in zigzag manner and the h ion is locked or strongly attracted by two highly electronegative F so it does not give much H+ ions and therefore is weak acid.
