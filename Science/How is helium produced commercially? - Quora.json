            "answer_text": "Helium is not \"produced.\" It is a single element, number 2 on the periodic table, and cannot be manufactured in any significant quantity (although fusion reactors produce very small quantities of the stuff, and it is a by-product, also in trace amounts, of fission reactors as well). The helium that is recovered from the ground as a by-product of natural gas exploration is Helium-4, one of the 2 stable (non-radioactive) isotopes. The He-4 nucleus is exactly the same as an alpha particle, produced from underground nuclear decay of Uranium-235, U-238 and other radioactive elements, where it is trapped and collects. These elements go through many steps, emitting many alpha particles along the way and becoming one radioactive element after another, before reaching the end of their decay chains and becoming stable isotopes, no longer radioactive. Both common isotopes of uranium begin their decay chains by emitting alpha particles and becoming Thorium-231 in the case of U-235, and Th-234 in the case of U-238. Further decay ultimately leads to the production of stable isotopes of Lead (Pb)-207 if starting from U-235 and Pb-206 if starting from U-238. In addition, Thorium-232 will ultimately decay to Lead-208; also stable, and also with multiple alpha particles emitted along the way. There are other alpha emitters in the earth's crust, and all contribute to helium production in the same way. Each alpha decay reduces the atomic number by 2 and the atomic weight by 4 since each alpha particle carries away two protons and two neutrons from the nucleus. Since helium only comes from this one source, once it's released, that's it! The U.S. government does stockpile some helium underground, since it is such a vital gas, used extensively in manufacturing and other purposes. The underground storage facility, plus conservation efforts, plus helium yet to be pumped from the ground, may extend the supply to at least 2045. But since there is no way to efficiently retrieve helium once it is released, and since it is so light it eventually escapes into space, we will eventually be facing a helium shortage. Addendum: Even though the US government has a large underground stockpile of the gas, it has been selling it off at below market prices since the \"Helium Privatization Act\" directed the Department of the Interior to sell it off. It was operating at a financial loss, which is not surprising since it is a stockpile to keep helium for times of national crisis, not a business. Because it is so light and it escapes from Earth's atmosphere when released, look up and think of where the name comes from (Greek: helios, meaning sun). It was discovered through its spectral lines in sunlight before the actual gas was found on Earth. ",

            "answer_text": "Loring Chien, Spacecraft depend on physics Answered Nov 21 Originally Answered: What is the best idea to make helium gas at home?Helium is a noble element, a gas, that does not combine with any other elements so it cannot be extracted by chemical processes.On earth it is usually the byproduct of radioactive decay of heavy elements deep in the earth and is trapped in pockets, often along with natural gas. It is fairly rare.Once allowed into the atmosphere uncontained, its light weight allows it to relatively rapidly leave the earth for space, to be lost to us http://forever.So, no you cannot chemically extract this stuff. You cannot make it unless you have a nuclear reactor which most people don\u2019t have at home. Even a reactor makes a teensy amount.Final Answer: NO.2.4k Views \u00b7 View Upvoters ",
