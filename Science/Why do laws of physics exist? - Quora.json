            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cWhy do the laws of physics exist?\u201d In Cody Reisdorf's interesting and thoughtful answer to this question, he says: I can\u2019t see how a universe could not be effectively modeled by mathematics. We have mathematics to describe probabilistic (also called stochastic) phenomena, we have mathematics to quantify randomness, we have mathematics to describe deterministic (non-random) phenomena. So what else is there? And how would something ever elude our ability to model it? We know of something that can elude our ability to model it, at least to model it in detail: any system in which we play a significant part. In general, I don\u2019t think we know how to model free will. ((OK, you may reply that free will is an illusion, but I think those arguments swallow their own tail.)) Further, I can imagine a world where phenomena generally were probabalistic at times or in certain circumstances, deterministic in others, and seemingly arbitrary in others. It would be nightmarish, but it is possible. So, thank you Cody for helping me to focus where my answer to this question needs to go. I think this is a deep question. We are creatures in the cosmos with a capacity to do deep mathematics and to dredge up abstractions like the laws of physics. We know that we tend to see order when it is not there, or to, at least, exaggerate the order, but there really is a orderliness to phenomena that we are capable of discovering. Either our capacity to make those discoveries or the nature of Nature (such that such discoveries are available) needs explaining. My thesis is that such depth (either in thought or in Nature or both) is a result of an overarching unity to the cosmos that spans both reductionistic and emergent phenomena. And, to the extent that thought and rationality (or the capacity for them) is an emergent phenomenon, it is also intimately tied to that overarching, implicate order. So the \u2018laws\u2019 of physics are rational approximations of aspects of transcendental implicate order in the cosmos, and our species has evolved the capacity for culture which includes a progressive discovery of such approximations.

            "answer_text": "Of course they are only metaphorically \u201claws\u201d. The term is a carry over from Newton\u2019s time when it was assumed that the world was the creation of a law-giving deity. That viewpoint just pushes the question back to an even more mysterious level. People find it more satisfying because a \u201cwhy\u201d question asks for a reason, a motive, and people (and super-people) presumably have motives. We don\u2019t know where our fundamental motives come from, so we\u2019re used to ignoring the question of why this or that motive. Really it\u2019s easier to say it\u2019s just a fact that there are regularities than to say it\u2019s just a mystery that the gods made the world this way. The motives of gods are unknowable. But then it was found that the so called \u201claws\u201d weren\u2019t even quite right as Newtonian mechanics was first replaced by Einstein\u2019s relativity and then by quantum mechanics. Now these are more modestly called \u201ctheories\u201d or even \u201cmodels\u201d in recognition that they are our inventions to describe and predict regularities. In part this in recognition that the world is not completely deterministic, not a clockwork universe, as Laplace thought in summarizing the Newtonian world view. Quantum mechanics implies the world is mixture of determinism and symmetry with a certain grain of randomness mixed in a the fundamental level. So the question comes down to why are there regularities? Why isn\u2019t the world entirely random or at least much more random? Could the world be like our dreams in which the \u201claws of physics\u201d mostly work but are often violated. First, if the world were much more random, intelligent beings that remember things and formulate theories couldn\u2019t exist, or at least their existence would be a miracle, inconsistent with a random world. So, secondly could the world be just a little more random, e.g. could there be an occasional miracle as various religions claim. Yes, that would seem to be possible, although as Anatole France commented observing the cast off items when he visited Lourdes, \"All those canes, braces and crutches, and not a single glass eye, wooden leg, or toupee!\" So while it could be, it isn\u2019t.
