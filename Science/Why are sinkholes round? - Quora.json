            "answer_text": "Practically speaking, it it obvious that if a point is the focus of a change in energy, the effect will be circular. This happens with many phenomena such as earthquakes, sound, and water ripples. Likewise, when a part of the earth loses integrity from erosion, harmonics, corrosion, or some sort of weathering, the point of failure will fall inward first. Then, the parts that were directly leaning on it will fall after until there is a state of equilibrium where everything is leaning on the next in which the last part is stable and the first part has nothing leaning on it (that is greater in force than the force it exerts on the part it is leaning on) - confusing I know!  Now comes the part that is weird\u2026 sink holes are almost never uniform. Have you ever been to the beach? When you dug a hole too close to the water near the shore, the hole eventually starts to collapse on all sides and become a uniform, wide, and shallow hole. This happens because the sand has no structural integrity. The particles of sand don\u2019t have any support to hold each other up when overly wet. But, when slightly moist, they hold up for several hours but due to rigidity, they fall every now and then in random areas. The result is a nearly perfect circular hole when the make up of the \u201csink hole\u201d is unstable or has poor structural integrity (eg very wet sand). But, when the sand is only slightly wet and has better structural integrity, the walls can hold up well and the hole that forms remains similar but more rigid around the edges. The cause of nice circles around sink holes is due to the fact that there is a large hole with many factor that cause a build of of loss of structural integrity (excessive dampness, etc) that cause it to finally collapse but with smooth consistency like sand\u2026 thus collapsing in nice circles. Thanks for your curiosity. ",

            "answer_text": "Sinkholes are generally round because they are related to ongoing solutioning/migration of fine-grained material into the bedrock Lets say some water is flowing thru the soils. It flows across the bedrock-soil interface and finds a cave in the bedrock. As the water flows into the cave, it pulls soil down with it, slowly creating a little bubble of air in the soil right above the cave. As the bubble grows larger, it slowly will migrate upwards. When the dome ceiling of the air bubble collapses, you will see a circular depression at the ground surface. If the bubble of air makes it to the surface, you may see a giant open hole into the cave. This is all very dependent on soil properties and geology as well ",
