I will provide a few examples. (And remind that there is a 6 x cyclonic cornered hexagon on the North pole of Saturn, which I suggest is directly related.) CUBOCTAHEDRON   SNOWFLAKES:           So I would like to suggest, the symmetry of snowflakes is not \u201cjust\u201d six sided\u2026. It is 28 faceted, 24 points of intersection, an inner hexagon, an outer hexagon, a mid-size/half off-phase set if hexagonal intersection points. The whole works. Cuboctahedron. :-D Snowflakes. :-D ",

            "answer_text": "It has nothing to do with the shape of the water molecule, but rather the inevitability of fluids in freefall achieving hexagonal symmetry due to the geometry of echoing vibrations. The echoes insure that new molecules will usually freeze in symmetrical positions around the flake. (This seems to be an original theory, though it seems so obvious to me I'm incredulous no one else has ever pointed it out.) ",
