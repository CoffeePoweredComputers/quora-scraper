            "answer_text": "It is not just important to science. When things are finally figured out it will be obvious how important this knowledge is to every aspect of human existence. Do not expect one theory or one set of equations. The closest we have to that is special relatively and general relativity. Those top level theories discovered by Einstien do accurately describe the playing field of this universe. Other physics theories including quantum mechanics are lower level more detailed theories which describe interactions between particular objects. General relativity is still the highest level theory which applies at all size scales, it is higher level and does not address some of the details related to atoms which are covered by quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics only covers one small set of objects which are the particles that combine to form atoms, and only one quanta of energy exchange called the photon. Atoms only make up 4 percent of the universe. Searching for \u201cunification\u201d or \u201cone theory of everything\u201d is the wrong search. Anyone who starts thinking along those lines might as well just hang up any effort expended and toss it in the circular file where it belongs. That is wasted effort. The closest anyone will ever get to a theory of everything already exists in general relativity. If you want to know more about the universe then quantum mechanics needs to be generalized to cover all stable structures which exist in this universe not just atoms. That includes size scales all the way down to the Planck length and stable structures all the way up to the size of the whole universe. That would require new physics where the units of energy exchange include quanta much smaller than photons and much larger than photons. This generalization of quantum mechanics would still fall under the umbrella of general relativity. General relatively is the simplicity at the top of the pyramid of knowledge. Other physics related to both stable and unstable structures which exist inside the space time playing field defined by general relativity will require a wide range of more complex and more detailed physics models. Not just existing quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is one of the models needed that works well for atomic structures. Atoms are not the only structures that exist in this universe. Other structures, like the earth\u2019s magnetosophere for example, are bigger than a single atoms and cannot by created inside a particle accelerator. Failing to understand the physics of the earth\u2019s magnetosphere will be the down fall of the vast majority of people who are around when the magnetosphere begins to change rapidly. When that time comes maybe some people will look back on posts like this one and wonder why they did not pursue research like I have just described sooner. Eventually people will realizes how irrational the idea of molten iron rivers being the cause of the magnetosphere is, as the rate of change continues to increase. This should already be obvious. Molten rivers of iron cannot suddenly stop and reverse like they would have to in order to explain pole reversals. Magnetospheres create event horizons at the center of any planet, star, or galaxy with a magnetosphere. Those event horizons are complex and capable of creating mass including atomic particles and generating heat. Exactly how that happens requires a new field of physics similar to quantum mechanics to understand or model, but like the quantum uncertainty principle at smaller scales, good luck predicting reactions in any active core. Like an atom vibrates, Magnetospheres oscillate at much larger frequencies creating the solar cycle for example, so transitions like pole reversals can be predicted once they are are in progress by watching the progression rate. Every heavenly body is unique. ",

            "answer_text": "The desire for a theory of everything in physics stems from knowing that the orderly continued operation of the universe requires the existence of fundamental unity. The search for a theory of everything is a search for establishing fundamental unity. This will not occur due to the prominence of theoretical physics. Theoretical physics has, since the acceptance of Relativity theory, given itself looseness of empirical support allowing for a mathematical mix of physics knowledge, much of which is supported by direct empirical evidence, and imagination physics, if supported at all, that is supported only by indirect empirical evidence. This mix reduces the scientific integrity of physics equations. It allows for illusions, i.e., mathematical constructs, that unity is being approached. The official acceptance of the addition of properties that have no chance of ever receiving direct empirical confirmation has removed theoretical physics from any chance of achieving fundamental unity. The idea that such a mix can guide physics toward unity is imaginary. The inability of physicists to see that fundamental unity was lost back at the beginning of physics when mass was made an undefined property, keeps physics struggling with theory to do that which can only be achieved by going back to that beginning and define mass. The modern practice of modern textbooks of misrepresenting undefined physics properties as being defined by their rules of measurement is a theoretical error. There is no way that fundamental unity can be returned to physics equations while such a clear significant error remains kept out of sight of students of physics and is continued to be used unfixed.
