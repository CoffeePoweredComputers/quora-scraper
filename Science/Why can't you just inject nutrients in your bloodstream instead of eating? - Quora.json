            "answer_text": "My Friend it's not that simple that it looks like, Injecting nutrients directly in blood stream. Every part of the body or system of our body has its own way of working and purpose. We have two sets of nutrients one is macronutrients (carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins),each of these macronutrients provides energy in the form of calories are needed in large amounts . Other one is micronutrients (Vitamins and Minerals) . Micronutrients are essential elements required by humans in small quantities throughout life to orchestrate a range of physiological functions to maintain health. Both set of nutrients varies with each other every aspect (Requirement, Digestion, Molecular Weight etc.). So we cannot inject them directly otherwise various body function will become numb, harmonal imbalance, body fluid regulation imbalance etc. as nutrients reach to blood stream after undergoing various set of biological and chemical process.God has given us tongue to taste various food, brain sends signal regarding hunger and satity to the body. Important Macronutrients like Carbohydrate digestion starts from mouth only,Fat digestion starts from guts, Protein digestion take place in stomach. So to keep body function normal, we cannot alter the system by injecting nutrients directly , since our body is based on bio-chemical system. ",

            "answer_text": "I work in a team that monitors patients on Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) and most if them have psychological problems because they can't eat food. They get upset by seeing and smelling food that they can't eat and food is everywhere in cities - on TV, on the radio, cafes, restaurants, at work. The gut-brain connection is also very interesting as if we're starving the gut microbiome, what happens in our brain? I have suggested to researchers to test the stools of people on TPN as they still produce altered stools, and think that it could give us a lot of answers. The technique of giving nutrition via the veins is full of risks of infection and this happens a lot, even with the most hygienic of practices. Most patients aren't allowed to administer it themselves and need nurses to come to their house most evenings to set it up. They have to be home by 5 or 6 at night to wait for the nurse. As for trips abroad, forget it. TPN is given as a last resort. When people talk about appreciating the small things in life, food should always be one of these. I have started saying Grace at the table again. ",
