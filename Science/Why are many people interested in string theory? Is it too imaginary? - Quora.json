            "answer_text": "People are interested in theory because despite the frustration of having too many different varieties making too many predictions, it is the most promising approach to synthesize gravity, quantum gravity and QFT into one grand theory of everything. (TOE). Now I would like to think that twistors are still a competitor, but there doesn't seem to be much interest in them outside of Dr. Penrose and his students. And I don't think many of them keep it up after getting their PhDs. ",
