            "answer_text": "similar has many meanings. between atoms of similar sizes?between atoms from the same block on the Periodic Table?Between atoms of similar mass?I will answer each of my suggestions. all kinds of reactions are possible. Sodium and tellurium atoms are similar in size. they have an ionic bond between Na+ and Te2- ions. But Mg and Na are also similar in size. They have virtually no bonding in a mixture of the two. They would probably form an alloy of some sort.Na and Mg are in the same block\u2026 But O and S are also in the same block. they form covalent bonds between atoms. same for C and Si. Again, same for Br and F.this varies. there is virtually no bonding between He and tritium atoms (helonium hydride He-H does exist with H as Tritium, but this is an extreme case and is effectively non-existent). But F and O form strong covalent bonds. As do N and C. so does S and Cl, I and Te. Na and F have ionic bonds, and are of similar mass. K and Cl are also of similar mass. Cu and Zn are also similar in mass, but form alloys together.",

            "answer_text": "If the bond between same non metals or two different elements with a difference of electronegativity < 1.7, we can expect covalent bond, if the difference is exactly 1.7 then 50% covalent and 50% ionic bond, if the difference is > 1.7 we can expect ilnic bond. Generally ionic bonds are formed between metals and non metals i.e. extreme left side lements with extreme right side elements in the periodic table. ",
