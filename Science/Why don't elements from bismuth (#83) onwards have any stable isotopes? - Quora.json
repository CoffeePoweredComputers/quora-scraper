            "answer_text": "Instability in atomic nuclei occurs because the nucleus is made up of protons - each having a positive charge. These tend to increasingly repel each other as their numbers accumulate in the heavier elements. Adding neutrons helps alleviate the repulsion effects of large numbers of protons but only works up to a point (above Bismuth) at which the effects can no longer be overcome and the nucleus becomes randomly unstable. This effect continues to increase until the elements above Z=110 have half lives measured in seconds and fractions thereof due to their extreme instability. Having either too many or too few neutrons also makes even the lighter elements of the Periodic Table unstable. Thus, every element has unstable isotopes. ",
