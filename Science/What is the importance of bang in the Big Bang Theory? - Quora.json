            "answer_text": "The importance of the Big Bang Theory is that it provides a model of how the universe developed, that is verifiable by observation. It also predicts that certain events would follow from the Big Bang - like the way in which radiation and matter evolved into the structures we see today (like galaxies, stars, solar systems, planets, and life). The Big Bang Theory itself makes no hypothesis about how the universe began at time=0. That knowledge is beyond the capabilities of current math and physics. However, there are other logical hypotheses based on well established theories concerning the actual beginning, like the multiverse, big bounce, and others. None of these rise to the status of a theory as yet. For many reasons, IMHO, the multiverse idea is the most philosophically satisfying. ",

            "answer_text": "It appears to me that matter in our physical universe came from a rupture in the boundary of the dark universe that filled a void that was what we now see as our physical universe. It was a big bang from our perspective but a small poof from the perspective of the dark universe. I say this because for purposes of this discussion, a combination of our physical universe and the dark universe is the Megaverse. Composition of the Megaverse is theorized to be as follows: Dark Energy = 68%; Dark Matter = 27%; Ordinary Matter = 5%; Measurable Energy < 0.01%. These numbers indicate that the dark universe by far out weighs and is extremely more energetic than the physical universe that we can observe. So to answer your question, the \u201cbang\u201d came when mass spewed forth or was converted from dark matter during the rupture event over a relatively short period of time. As a side note, you may have heard the term singularity. This is simply the point of rupture from which physical mass spewed. It no longer exists since the rupture closed after establishing ordinary matter at 5% of the Megaverse. ",
