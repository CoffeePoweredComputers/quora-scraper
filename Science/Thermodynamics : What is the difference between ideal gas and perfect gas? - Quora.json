            "answer_text": "Perfect gas is one in which intermolecular forces are not considered. Most of the gases behave as perfect gases at low pressures and at very high temperatures. Perfect gas obeys ideal gas law and it has constant specific heats. Cp, Cv has constant values. For example if you consider air as perfect gas, Cp=1.005 kJ/kg. K and Cv=0.718 kJ/kg. K at all temperatures. So, internal energy of a perfect gas can be simply calculated from du=Cv. dT and enthalpy of perfect gas is dh=Cp.dT. Ideal gas is a gas that obeys ideal gas law and specific heats of an ideal gas are function of temperature alone. For example if you consider air as an ideal gas. Cp=1.005 +f(T) and similarly Cv=0.718+g(T). So, internal energy of ideal gas can be simply calculated from du=integral{Cv. dT} and enthalpy of an ideal gas is dh=integral{Cp.dT}. Most of the cases we can interchangeably use this both terms as both obeys ideal gas law which is the main concern while solving engineering problems. Now, what is a real gas. This gas does not obey the ideal gas law Pv=mRT. Because inter molecular forces and volume occupied by the gas molecules are considered here. Instead, they follow gas laws like vanderwaals equation of state, viral equation of state etc. For these gases Cp and Cv are assumed to be function of temperature, but change in internal energy and enthalpy are not only function of temperature, some additional terms will be there. Suppose, Change in Internal energy is, Integral{du} =integral{cv. dT} +integral{f(v) dv Change in enthalpy is, Integral{dh} =integral{cp. dT} +integral{f(p) dp ",

            "answer_text": "HERE ARE SOME OF THE POINT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THEM : Ideal gas follows postulate of kinetic theory of gases (KTG) which state that they are like tiny point & don't interact between each OTHER.They have high molecular speed & collide each other with elastic collision.They follow only ideal gas equation- PV=NRT ;where P:pressure; V:volume; N: no. of moles; R:universal gas constant & T:temperatureThus they depend on those physical qualities but YES! an ideal gas can behave as real when it is brought at high pressures & low temperatures this is same principle follow for LPGWhen it is done so it deviates from KTG postulate & try to interact due to dipole interactionsThen it follow new equation PV=ZNRT ;Where all have same notation here Z=compressibility factor & here is following graph: Leaving Hydrogen & helium all gas has ability to show real gas behavior Thank you!
