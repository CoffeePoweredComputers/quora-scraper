            "answer_text": "A stationary wave is a wave which oscillates in time but whose peak amplitude profile does not move in space. A periodic wave is a wave which revises its path after an interval of time. Stationary waves are always periodic in nature and they don't entirely depends upon the medium of propagation. So their won't be affected not much in whatever space they are. ",
