It feels like there are no real ghosts: I haven't seen it since childhood.Then, however, the only one person even in a large house, feels very fearful. It sounds like so many, but those who actually see the ghosts are so low.Others, however, are in talks with friends about what the original ghosts would look like Actually I didn't see them then but I didn't feel like I had to find them The ghost movies look like a scare once in a while.There are also some animated stories There will be fear.

            "answer_text": "That answer depends entirely on YOUR belief \u2026 OK, not on your belief really, for example, if you were to really believe the Moon was made of cheese, that would not mean the moon is actually made of cheese, BUT you would believe it was \u2026. So, back to the answer - if by \u201cghosts\u201d you mean spirits, then yes, they do exist \u2026 You can use very basic physics to prove that - \u201cspirits\u201d are pure energy, and as such we know, energy cannot be created nor destroyed so yes, they exist \u2026 With the reams of accounts of encounters with spirits that is available, from over centuries, we can be relatively sure \u201csomething is out there \u2026 Add in modern physics and the wealth of equipment for detecting energy and I say we can be almost 100% sure something is there \u2026 Remember the display you are seeing on your computer right now is the result of actions performed by energy \u2026 You can\u2019t see the wireless connection, the cell phone call, the satellite radio or tv, but you can see the result produced by something that is invisible to our eyes, and yet we know exists \u2026 Spirits are the exact same thing \u2026 The term \u201cghost\u201d has been applied to this very day to anything spirit focused - much the same way as we continue to call a tissue a Kleenex or a copy machine a Xerox \u2026 You get the idea \u2026 Ghost = Spirit = Soul and so on \u2026 In true Parapsychology, a \u201cghost\u201d is a very specific type of residule energy that is not to conflated with a sentient spirit, but we do not need to deal with that now \u2026 So, from my perspective, yes - they do exist, they always have and always will \u2026 I hope this helps \u2026 ",
