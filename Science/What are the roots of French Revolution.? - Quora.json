            "answer_text": "The French Revolution has many origins and they are very complex so I will only present the major causes of it. Mainly, the French Revolution is caused by different factors in different aspects of life: socially, economically and politically. Each of these aspects affected the lowest order, the \u2018\u2019Tiers \u00c9tat\u2019\u2019 or Third order in english. This order was composed mostly of farmers (85%), craftsmen (7%) and the bourgeoisie (5%). Politically, the nobles have many privileges and they are rivals to the king. The noble order, the second one, is slowly declining and losing power against the bourgeois who are getting very rich through trade and commerce. The nobles, trying to maintain their positions, oppose the king and succeed to turn down the possibilities of the bourgeois. Even if the society was split between 3 orders, you could move from one to another, mostly going up. This was the case of the bourgeois who could pay a small fortune to acquire a noble rank. However, following the nobles reaction, these possibilities were stopped. Add the fact that the nobles had a lot of privileges like not paying any taxes or being the only ones to be able to be officers in the army and you get angry bourgeois. You need to know that the bourgeois are the most important actors during the Revolution because they belong to the Third order, but they are powerful because of the money made from their occupations. Bankers, rich merchants and other liberal professions belong to this order. Economically, the finances of the kingdom are not in a good shape: during all the XVIIIth century, France has a lot of debt. The situation get even worse with the American Revolution which cost a lot for the king. Additionally, the administration is poorly managed and nobles take advantage of it. They sell back to the administration their offcial charges after having worked for the king. With the \u2018\u2019Convocation des \u00c9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux\u2019\u2019, king Louis XVI create an assembly of all 3 orders to discuss a new tax to cover the debts and it turns out differently... Socially, other things affect the population such as the corporations. The corporations are an organization of a type of professions which decide the production and the distribution of the goods made by the said profession. They possess a juridical status and are thus protected by royal laws. The bourgeois and the craftsmen, being restricted by those institutions of the past, want to free themselves from them. Finally, famine is another element of the social unrest. Until the XIXth century with the Industruial Revolution , famines were still haunting modern States. Bad weather caused bad harvest prior to 1789 and it sparkled a rise of the price of bread. The Enlightment and the newly Liberalism of the XVIIIth century are also important for the cause of the Revolution. Even if a big proportion of the population doesn\u2019t know how to read, the liberal ideas still manage to spread among the people, from the intellectual bourgeois down to the rest of the population. Ideas of liberty, truth and knowledge are motivating some people, but the way I see it, the bourgeois really wanted to expand their power\u2026 Mix all those elements together and get a pretty important social unrest. Obviously, the bourgeois are leading the Revolution because they are the most hungry for power, but they are still supported by a majority of the popualtion. The \u2018\u2019Tiers \u00c9tat\u2019\u2019, at first, are mostly against the nobles and their privileges. It\u2019s only later that they turn against the king and that the Revolution becomes more radical. ",

            "answer_text": "French Revolution was a conflict between the french common people and the monarchy. It sprang from a combination of intellectual ferment and material grievances ; and it was the intellectual ferment that made material grievances more fiercely resented. Following are the main causes: Political causes: Bourbon dynasty was ruling france and it was absolute monarchy. King had centralised the administration and there was ranpant corruption. Kings had all powers - legislative, judiciary and executive as well. There was no codified uniform legal system. Aristocrats and nobles had monopolised all important government offices and posts.Social causes: Society was divided three estates mainly: 1st estate included clergy and pope, 2nd estate included nobles and 3 estate included every one else. 1st estate had less than 1 % population but used to control 15% of the resources. They didn\u2019t pay any taxes. Used to control churches and run schools and public functions. Also laid compulsary tax on people called \u2018tithe\u2019. Peasants and others had to pay 1/10th of their income to church. 2nd estate consisted of aristocrats and nobles. They accounted for 2% of the population but owned 20% of the resources/ land but paid almost no tax. 1st and 2nd estate enjoyed special privileges. 3rd estate was like 97% of the population which included bourgeoisie class (wealthy business man and educated people who were doctors, teachers lawyers etc.) , workers and peasants. This estate used to pay high taxes but had no special privileges.Cultural and ideological causes: Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau and many others were philosophers who wrote about this privileged based society and condemned it. They talked about democracy and separation of powers theory. Also they questioned the authority of church and talked about abolishing church. They attacked the principle of absolute monarchy and criticised existing laws. They made people aware of the true character of their monarch Louis XVI.Economic causes: 3/4th of expense was being done on defence. King was continually on war. While America was fighting for their war of independence against british colonial empire, he send his army to help Americans but no source of revenue was there. Rest was spend of king and queen\u2019s lavish lifestyle. Also, flawed taxation policy, no uniformity of taxes led to high inflation. 3rd estate had to bear the brunt and led to poverty. Bread riots too occurred from 1770 onwards.Influence of American revolution: General Lafayette along with other france soldiers were send to America to help them in the war against britain. They fought along with General Washington. But after war, when they came back france, they realised that the people of france are also suffering due to monarchy and decided to help in French Revolution.Immediate causes: people were asking the king for reforms in the taxation policy along with other development reforms. King hired few finance ministers one by one but fired them too as all the finance ministers talked about implementing uniform taxation policy but since king was very weak and under the influence of his queen Marie Antoniette, and nobles and aristocrats, they never let king implement such policies and asked king to fire those finance ministers. Which led to anger among common people and finally they revolted.",

            "answer_text": "A culmination of events in a considerably short amount of time. These are: Changing Times  France, an absolute monarchy, become one of the last of its kind in Europe. The enlightenment spread and caught on rather quickly in other countries. The idea that a serf was created the equal of a king was, of course, dynamite for the neglected serfdom of France. With conditions improving in other neighbouring countries, the French felt they deserved the same. It also didn\u2019t help the king was incredibly unpopular. The American Revolutionary War  In an attempt to spite and weaken France\u2019s arch-nemesis, the British, King Louis XVI invested millions of tax money into helping the Americans fight for independence. This was incredibly unpopular, as why should a starving French peasant have to pay extra money for a war raging on another continent? France\u2019s involvement in the war also prevented any assistance from the British crown to aid the French royal family during the revolution (which was actually planned to happen). The Three Estates  At the time, the population of France was divided into three estates- the clergy, nobility and third estate (consisting of everyone else). This unfair, unbalanced system virtually guaranteed the preference in all areas of government to favour the upper class, leaving the rest to starve. The Three Estate System was archaic, even for the 18th century, and was a dated relic of feudalism. Much like feudalism, it put a majority of the population at a disadvantage and made it almost impossible to move up from the estate one was born into. Living Conditions for Peasants  Life for an 18th century French peasant was hard and short. Despite the official end of feudalism having been 400 years earlier, most farmers were legally unable to leave their land, and almost all lacked the means to do so. The immobility of the population worsened the effects of drought or famine and meant that most families were not able to improve their conditions. With the ever-rising taxes for both the war and the queen\u2019s poodles, French peasants starved and froze. The Hated Aristocracy  While the peasants starved to death, the gloating and frivolous aristocracy lived in splendour and comfort in fine palaces. Fashion at the time was extremely complex and colourful, with one dress probably costing as much as a peasant\u2019s house. The nobles also gorged on the most expensive haute cuisine, leaving the peasants with nothing but stale bread. Almost no nobles from the time show compassion for the lower classes and most were known to jeer at beggars from their gilded carriages. If a noble were to murder a peasant, it would likely not even be considered a crime. The system of the Three Estates ensured the nobility could live in splendour, even at the expense of others. The DESPISED Royal Family  If the nobility were hated, the royal family was despised. Money taken from starving farmers was used to fund lavish palaces, sumptuous royal parties, meticulous gardens and ostentatious fancies. Louis XVI even kept a pet elephant on the grounds of Versailles. In the gilded palace, the Bourbon family lived a ridiculously sheltered and luxurious life. They didn\u2019t even need to get out of bed without assistance. Tales of drunken orgies and satanic masked balls didn\u2019t help the family\u2019s image either. A Bad King  Louis XVI was one of the direct causes of the French Revolution. He had an arbitrary attitude towards the role of king, his spare time occupied by lock making. His people saw him as a cold, uncaring tyrant. While this may be harsher than the truth, it cannot be argued that he did not care much for the lowest of his people. A Misunderstood Queen  Of all people in history, Marie Antoinette is one of the people I sympathise most with. In my opinion, she was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. An Austrian princess by birth, she arrived in France at a bad time and married an unfortunately unpopular man, cementing what people would think of her. Due to her lavish lifestyle and seemingly disdainful treatment of her subjects, she grew to be one of the most despised people in France. The line attributed to her- \u201cIf they don\u2019t have bread, let them eat cake\u201d, was actually said by someone else, but this one sentence shows what France thought their queen thought of them. Marie Antoinette, in truth, almost never left the palace. She was unaware of what life was like outside of Versailles, and she knew little of the people she claimed to rule. Marie lived such a sheltered life that she never even saw the sea in her entire life. But regardless of how oblivious she actually was, France\u2019s utter hatred of their queen was one of the main causes of the revolution. To this day historians debate whether or not she was actually aware of how her subjects lived. I believe she did not, and was merely selected as a figurehead to represent the anger and frustration people had for royalty and noble privilege. Thanks for asking! I had fun answering this. ",

            "answer_text": "The three main causes of French revolution are as follows: 1. Political Cause 2. Social Cause 3. Economic Cause. 1. Political Cause: During the eighteen the Century France was the centre of autocratic monarchy. The French Monarchs had unlimited power and they declared themselves as the \u201cRepresentative of God\u201d. Louis XIV was the exponent of this view. The French Monarchs engaged themselves in luxurious and extravagance at the royal court of Versailles. They enjoyed unlimited power. By the Letter de Catchet, they arrested any person at any time and imprisoned them. They paid no attention towards their subjects. Louis XIV (1643-1715) of the Bourbon Dynasty was a powerful monarch. He was an efficient, hard-working and confident ruler. He participated in many wars. Louis XIV\u2019s concept of unlimited royal power is revealed by his famous remarks, \u201cI am the State\u201d. Louis XV (1715-1774) succeeded Louix XIV He was a \u2018butterfly monarch\u2019. His defective foreign policy weakened the economic condition of France. Louis XV fought the Seven Years War against England which brought nothing for France. France became bankrupt due to over expenditure in wars and luxury. He realised it later on. Before his death he cried-\u2018After me the Deluge\u2019. After Louis XV, Louis XVI (1774-1793) ascended the throne of France. During that period, the economic condition of France became weak. Louis XVI was an innocent and simple man. But he was influenced by his queen Marie Antoinette who always interfered in the state affairs. Out of frustration he uttered-\u201cOh! What a burden of mine and they have taught me nothing.\u201d Marie Antoinette was the daughter of Marie Theresa, the Austrian Empress. She always felt proud as she was the daughter of Austrain Empress. She always enjoyed luxurious and extravagant life. She sowed seed of the French Revolution. Thus, the autrocratic monarchy, defective administration, extravagant expenditure formed the political cause of the French Revolution. 2. Social Cause: The Social condition of France during the eighteenth century was very miserable. The then French Society was divided into three classes\u2014 the Clergy, Nobles and Common People. The Clergy belonged to the First Estate. The Clergy was sub\u00addivided into two groups i.e. the higher clergy and the lower clergy. The higher clergy occupied the top position in the society. They managed the churches, monasteries and educational institutions of France. They did not pay any tax to the monarch. They exploited the common people in various ways. The higher clergy lived in the midst of scandalous luxury and extravagance. The common people had a strong hatred towards the higher clergy. On the other hand, the lower clergy served the people in true sense of the term and they lived a very miserable life. The Nobility was regarded as the Second Estate in the French Society. They also did not pay any tax to the king. The Nobility was also sub divided into two groups-the Court nobles and the provincial nobles. The court nobles lived in pomp and luxury. They did not pay any heed towards the problems of the common people of their areas. On the other hand, the provincial nobles paid their attention towards the problems of the people. But they did not enjoy the same privileges as the Court nobles enjoyed. The Third Estate formed a heterogenous class. The farmers, cobblers, sweepers and other lower classes belonged to this class. The condition of the farmers was very miserable. They paid the taxes like Taille, Tithe and Gable. Inspite of this, the clergies and the nobles employed them in their fields in curve. The Bourgeoisie formed the top most group of the Third Estate. The doctors, lawyers, teachers, businessmen, writers and philosophers belonged to this class. They had the wealth and social status. But the French Monarch, influenced by the clergies and nobles, ranked them as the Third Estate. So they influenced the people for revolution. They aroused the common people about their rights. Thus, the common people became rebellious. The lower Clergies and the provincial nobles also joined their hands with the common people along with the bourgeoisie. So the French Revolution is also known as the \u2018Bourgeoisie Revolution\u2019. 3. Economic Cause: The economic condition of France formed another cause for the outbreak of the French Revolution. The economic condition of France became poor due to the foreign wars of Louis XIV, the seven years War of Louis XV and other expensive wars. During the reign period of Louis XVI, the royal treasury became empty as extravagant expenses of his queen Marie Antoinette. To get rid of this condition. Louis XVI appointed Turgot as his Finance Minister in 1774. Turgot tried to minimise the expenditure of the royal court. He also advised the king to impose taxes on every classes of the society. But due to the interference of Queen Marie Antoinette, Louis XVI dismissed Turgot. Then Necker was appointed as the Finance Minister in 1776. He published a report on the income and expenditure of the State in order to arouse the people. But he was also dismissed by the king. The next person who was appointed by the King as the Finance Minister of France in 1783 was Callone. He adapted the policy of borrowing in order to meet the expenditure of the royal court. But due to this policy, the national debt of France increased from 300,000,000 to 600,000,000 Franks only in three years. Then Callone proposed to impose taxes on all the classes. But he was dismissed by the king. In this situation, the king at last summoned the States General. The economic instability formed one of the most important causes of the French Revolution.

            "answer_text": "Causes of the French  Revolution ----------------- 1.  Absolute  Monarchism  (rule  by   a  King and Queen)      (Very little connection between the \"people\" and their government. This was a system in which the King and Queen did not have the \"consent of the governed\"  Nobody could question or challenge anything that the King or Queen ordered to be done.)  In France in the latter part of the 18th  Century  the King had power over everything   and everyone. When the King ordered something to be done, it was done, without any regard for the idea that a citizen had a \"legal right\" for  protection from an abuse by governmental authority.   A common complaint by the people,  was the King's use of SEALED LETTERS (\"Lettres  de Cachet\").  These were warrants (papers)  signed by the King,  which ordered either the immediate imprisonment of a citizen, without any trial whatsoever.  The warrant might be an order for the execution of a citizen, also without any trial in a court of law whatsoever.     Far worse, was the fact that King Louis XVI   would sign  his name to such warrants,  leaving blank the part of the document identifying who was to be arrested. The Ministers could abuse these warrants,  and fill in the name of any person  they chose to  take into their custody for imprisonment or execution.   During the reign of King Louis XVI, 14,000  of these  SEALED LETTERS were signed and issued.  People were angry about the idea that there were  laws  which permitted such abuses of governmental  power. . ======================================= . . . 2.   Estate System   (Social  inequality which operated as a \"feudal\" society. All people were NOT  regarded as   \"equal\".)       The people of France were divided into   3 categories, or classes called  \"estates\".      (a)   the  First  Estate is the CLERGY,  the cardinals, bishops, and priests  and the church system,  who where not directly  taxed, and who made up   about 0.6%   (6/10 of  one percent) of the population of France.  The clergy owned about   10% of all the land in France.     (b)     the Second  Estate   is  the  NOBLES, referred to as  the  Bourgoisie.  The NOBLES made up  about   2%  (2/100ths)  of the population  and they controlled 20% of the land.   These were the nobility,  and they  paid very few taxes.       (c)  The Third Estate, the common people or \"peasants\". The commoners owned no land, but paid  all of the taxes   demanded by  the French  King. .    Taxes were  demanded according to a citizen's  \"social class\". Even privileges  like voting,   or   expressing ideas  by  \"free speech\" depended upon  the citizen's \"social class\". . ================================================================= 3.  Economic Inequality During the reign  of Louis XVI, the royal treasury became empty. One cause  of the emptying of the  French  Treasury was the extravagant expenses of his queen Marie Antoinette. The  French King Louis XVI  was a fervent supporter  of the American War of Independence and decided to  sending  to the American Revolutionaries,  millions of dollars in aid. King Louis  also  decided to build a  powerful  Navy,  equal to or greater than the  English   Navy.     Moreover,  King Louis sent his Navy  to America  where the war of independence was raging.  Although this contributed to the victory  of the American  Colonists over the British Forces in America, this gesture eventually caused the French  King's treasury to   be completely emptied out. France was broke. The King couldn't raise more taxes and didn't have the power  to find the money he needed to govern.     The King   eventually proposed that the Nobles should be taxed, and that  caused even some of  the Nobles  to support the protests of the Commoners!  King Louis was caught between  the proverbial  Rock----And---A----Hard Place.  At this time there was immense poverty in France,  Taxes  upon the common people  were high.  The wages  of the  workers  were  low,  but the prices for bread and the basic needs of  the people were  high. As the cost of flour began to rise people were left to starve,  unable to afford bread anymore.  This ultimately became a cause of revolt as bread was    an essential part of the common person's diet.  Unable to provide for their families,  the lower classes of France were   in their own  economic  crisis,  which was one of the things that drove them to revolt against the King and his Nobles, and the Clergy.  There was a crop failure  in   1788 and the  cold weather in the winter of 1788 and 1789  was said to be so extreme that sparrows froze to death  in the trees.  The winter lasted too long, the spring was too wet,   and the  summer was too hot and dry.  France was already hurting economically due to the  prior loss of crop yields   These extreme conditions caused food shortages that led to peasant revolts in various parts of France.  Harvest failures, high food prices and hunger  all shaped the course of the French Revolution,  especially for the working classes.  Agriculture  (farming)  dominated France\u2019s domestic economy. Agriculture  accounted for about 75%  of all production.    France was broke.  The common people were starving. Fear and anger were  everywhere. ================================================== 4.   The \"Enlightenment\"   thinking that appeared in books was also a cause of the French Revolution of 1789. The ideas of logic and  science  were  thought of  as being   the basis for understanding human experience,  the structure of society, and   the ideas  Justice,  Freedom, and the Equality of all mankind  were spreading to many people worldwide.  One book which influenced the thinking of many people was   \"Spirit of the Laws\"  by Charles  Montesquieu ( 1689 -  1755);   This book  introduced new notions of good government. Despotism,  or the tyranny of an   absolute  monarch, was said to be a standing danger for any government. Montesquieu  argued that  an evil government  could be prevented  by a system in which different bodies or parts of a  government  (Legislative, Executive, and Judicial parts) were bound by the rule of law.  This theory of the separation of powers. Another important book which  was changing the thinking of many people was   \"The Social Contract\"    by  Jean  Jacque Rousseau  (1712 \u2013  1778)  .   His  ideas   about   Democracy  suggested that the classification  of   a  \"noble class\"  and the social distinction  of  \"titles\"  for noble families was an obstacle to the idea of   complete equality for all people.  This was the political thinking that was also  guiding American citizens  to   write their Declaration of Independence in the American Colonies,  dissolving   the tie between them and the English King.   They wrote   the U. S. Constitution which adopted the idea of \"Separation---of---Powers\"  and  it divided the government of the United States into three branches.  (a)  The Executive Branch, which is the office of the President and Vice President.   (b)  The Legislative Branch,  which is made up of  the Senate and the House of Representatives.    (c)  The Judicial Branch, which is the system of courts lead by the Supreme Court and the system of lower  Federal Courts, and the system of courts in individual states,  whose laws must all submit to the U.S. Supreme Court.  ============================================== 5.   Other  Revolutions which affected  the thinking of the people in France in  1789. (a)  The English Civil War(1642\u20131651)  was a series of armed conflicts  between supporters of  Parliament (The Legislative Branch) and the  Nobles who supported  King Charles I of England. The Parliamentarians,  led by  Puritan Oliver  Cromwell, defeated the armies of the Nobles.   The English Parliament  accused  King  Charles I of treason against England  by using his power to pursue his personal interest  rather than the good of the country.  The  King of England  was found guilty of Treason.  The indictment held him  \"guilty of all the treasons, murders, rapines, burnings,  spoils, desolations, damages and mischiefs to this nation,  acted and committed in the said wars, or occasioned thereby.\"[ The court challenged the  idea that a  King was immune to  all legal prosecution,  and claimed that  \"the King of England was not a person,  but an office whose every occupant  was entrusted with a limited power to govern  'by and according to the laws of the land  and not otherwise'.\"[ Tried  for treason, and  being found  guilty,  King Charles I  was sentenced to death. At about 2:00 p.m.   on  30 January 1649,  he was beheaded with a single stroke. (b)   In  1776   The American Revolution and its Declaration of Independence   lead to  a successful revolution and America's break  from  control of the England's King George.. . ",

            "answer_text": "There are several major causes of the French Revolution. First was the financial crisis France was facing. France was actually a very wealthy and powerful nation in the late 18th century, but the French Crown (aka the Government) was in serious debt (sound familiar?). The reason for this debt was because France spent lots of money on the Seven Years War and the American Revolution, and because how France collected taxes (more on that later) Second, France suffered a serious of famines in 1788 and 1789 that resulted in bread riots across the nation.  Third was the spread of the Enlightenment that bred ideas such as separation of powers and freedom of speech and press. When the Revolution started, few in France actually advocated for republicanism. That came later. Until 1793, most people in France (including people like Jean-Paul Marat) were monarchists. Fourth was the relationship between France's Three Estates and the Government. The first two Estates, the Clergy and the Nobility, were less than 5% of the population, but controlled most of the wealth and power. However, the Second Estate, the Nobility, deeply resented two things: the Monarchy's centralisation of power and the rising Third Estate. Contrary to popular conception, not everyone in the Third Estate were poor. In fact, many members of the Third Estate were wealthier than the Nobility. France was undergoing an economic boom that was creating a large Middle Class. This Middle Class, the Bourgeois, wanted more political power. They were also upset that they paid taxes, but the Nobility did not.  Most of the wealth still resided in the Nobility, so them not paying taxes is what was causing France's debt crisis. In 1788. Louis XVI announced the Estates General would meet the following year to tackle the debt crisis. His goal was to levy taxes on the Nobility. The Second Estate would have none of that. Compounding this, the Estates voted not per capita, but as a whole. Which meant even though the Third Estate outnumbered both the First and Second Estates, because they voted by Estate, the first two always voted together and beat the Third Estate. The Third Estate decided to leave the Estates General, and fearing an uprising, Louis locked them out of the hall. They moved to a nearby Tennis Court and signed the so-called Tennis Court Oath on 20 June 1789, renaming themselves the National Convention. Arguably this is the start of the Revolution.  Louis was content to give into the Convention's demands (which were pretty mild) but events took a turn for the worse in Paris. The bread riots continued, and a rumour was spreading that troops were being sent in to destroy the Convention. On 14 July 1789, the Paris mob broke into the Bastille Prison demanding weapons. They massacred the guards and put the governor of the Bastille's head on a pike. The storming of the Bastille is the real start of the Revolution because it inspired a general wave of riots that caused the peasants to burn down manor houses and ended feudalism and resulted in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizens ",

When he was a little boy, her mother and himself had to flee the castle. The nobles came to take the throne and kill the crown. This event was called \u201cLa Fronde\u201d. Louis XIV found the solution: keep your friends close and your enemies even closer. Make them envy your wealth, make them see you as a god, make them want to be notice by you and feel as being awarded the greatest gift in the world. To do so he needed the most magnificent castle of the world, away from paris, make them forget there can be another life, other possibilities and maybe riot. So the castle was built, it cost a LOT. Plus count the wars. The crown has very little money left. When Louis XV got the crown, his minister of money told him he has to find a solution to get money back. The crown had debts to make everyone live. It couldn't go on anymore. The solution was to tax more the third state AND begin to tax nobles. (Nobles were exempted of taxes as a privilege). They couldn't tax yet the church, the country was too religious. Louis XV didn\u2019t want the responsibilities and hassle of the crown. Only the money and fun. He said \u201clet\u2019s tax more the third state\u201d. When Louis XVI arrives to power, the situation of the state money was dire. The debts were huge, the third state couldn't be taxed more. Only solution begin to tax nobles. Louis XVI wanted to do it. Nobles heard of it. Nobles started to pay caricatures of the queen, pamphlets in the streets, gave money to start little uproars. And started everything\u2026 The people were starving, merchants wanted more power, not nobles wanted title. Use the poor who're starving, get the power. That's how it started. Edit: of course the reasons exposed in history books are more about poverty and taxes imposed on the third state. Edit 2: Louis XVI didn't have the internet elsewhere he could have a learn a lot from this video  ",

            "answer_text": "Hello! There were many reasons for the French revolution viz. ,social,economic and of course political. I would try to keep things as simple as I could. Social-The society was divided into 3 parts- The nobles,The clergy and The Commoners. The nobles didn\u2019t pay any taxes. The Clergy was divided into two categories-Upper Clergy and Lower Clergy. The Upper Clergy occupied high positions in churches and other offices. Also,they didn\u2019t pay any taxes to the king. The lower clergy led a miserable life. Thus the burden of taxes was imposed on the Commoners. This inequality influenced the people for revolution. This aroused the common people about their rights. Thus, the common people became rebellious. The lower Clergies and the provincial nobles also joined their hands with the common people.Economic: The economic condition of France formed another cause for the outbreak of the French Revolution. The economic condition of France became poor due to the foreign wars of Louis XIV, the seven years War of Louis XV and other expensive wars. The failed policies led to the the national debt of France increase from 300,000,000 to 600,000,000 Franks only in three years. Thus taxes were imposed on the Clergy and commoners,further deteriorating their condition.Political: As explained above,France became bankrupt and when Louis XVI ascended to the throne it became even worse. He was an innocent and simple man. But he was influenced by his queen Marie Antoinette who always interfered in the state affairs. She was the daughter of Marie Theresa, the Austrian Empress. She always felt proud as she was the daughter of Austrian Empress. She always enjoyed luxurious and extravagant life. She sowed seed of the French Revolution. Thus, the autocratic monarchy, defective administration, extravagant expenditure formed the political cause of the French Revolution.",

            "answer_text": "The French Revolution The French Revolution started in 1789 and ended in 1799. It was one of the greatest events of world history. All important events in Europe were somehow influenced by the French revolution. There were many causes of it. Some of them are\u2026 1.\tSocial Causes The French society was (like the feudal ages) divided into 3 classes/estates. They were\u2026  \u2022\tFirst estate comprised the Clergy. \u2022\tSecond estate comprised the monarchs. \u2022\tThird estate comprised the peasants and the bourgeoisie (merchants, professionals). They were the class that revolted. The peasants revolted because they didn\u2019t have money to pay taxes. The merchants had money but no social and political rights. That\u2019s why they played an important role in overthrowing the monarchy in France. 2.\tPolitical Causes  \u2022\tAt that time France was ruled by an absolute monarchy. The King has supreme authority that is not restricted by any written laws, legislature, or customs. This is a hereditary monarchy. \u2022\t In this case the King was Louis XVI. He lacked leadership qualities. \u2022\t Also he was greatly influenced by his wife Marie Antionette who liked to enjoy life. \u2022\tCommon people had no share in administration. \u2022\tThere was no system of laws, all punishments were biased and unjust. 3.\tEconomic Causes The economic causes played an important role in bringing down the monarchy. They are\u2026  \u2022\tLouis XIV waged many wars, therefore draining the royal treasury. \u2022\tHe also wasted a lot more money building a castle. \u2022\tThe nobility and clergy were exempted from taxes when they had they the money to pay. \u2022\tMarie Antionette and her husband squandered a lot of money.

He hired a crowd of Weishaupts, Mirabeaus, etc ., who were the prototypes of the Miliukovs of today . In 1778 Weisshaupt, a Jew* founded in Bavaria the \"Illuminati\" a secret society and instructed the \"Central Committee\" of the Grand Orient of France to be ready for a revolt . In 1782, Amschel R. I., summoned in Frankfort, the poor scoundrel, Adam Weisshaupt, (born in 1748) the official \"leader\" of the \"Illuminati\", who before he was hired, was unable to borrow 50 marks in order to pay for an illegal operation to be performed on his sister-in-law . Thereafter he miraculously developed his bandit work, covered Germany with Secret dens and poured thousands of cut-throats, mostly Jews, into Paris. Weisshaupt went to Paris with endless means to bribe able men, to unite all the parties against the Monarch (as Gambetta afterwards did in 1870), to organise a revolt and to upset him in order to free the throne for Rothschild, to shed an ocean of Christian blood and provoke all Europe to attack France and \"bleed her white,\" giving Amschel the opportunity to finance all the fighters. The Lodge of the Coq Heron alone had $4,'500,000 - at that time an enormous sum, but not for Amschel who had rallied all the Jewish bankers. Besides alone they were also able to create a \"fictitious famine,\" as they afterwards did in Paris in 1847-48, in Petrograd in February 1917, etc . But the Bavarian Government captured the \"Protocols\" of the \"Illuminati\" and forbade this Free-Masonic Lodge in 1786 . Officially dissolved, this organization only changed its name and continued to work, because it was supported by the H . H. New organisations (\"Enraged\", etc.) were created with butchers** Danton, Marat, Robespierre, etc . When all was ready, the Red (Roth) flag (Schield) was hoisted in Paris in 1789 . The \"French,\" but in reality Jewish revolution broke out and the best men of France were killed in order to place France under Jewish rule . \"It was a royalist assembly which proclaimed a republic in France\" (Aulard - \"Histoire Politique de la Revolution Francaise\", p . 37 and p. 175) . * Pouget de Saint-Andre, \u00b0'Le Auteurs Caches de la Revolution Francaise,\" \u00b0 p . 16. **) Many authors stated that Marat was a Jew-Mosesohn. M. Louis Marchand wrote in 1895 that Robespierre was also a Jew from Alsace called Ruban and Danton was a Polish Jew. This seemed incredible in 1895 . But did not all the Soviet Jews change their names into Russian! 63 THE \"MYSTERIES\" OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION . \"The more one studies the history of the French Revolution, the more one encounters enigmas\" (\"Les Auteurs Caches De La Revolution Francaise\" by Pouget de Saint Andre, p. 1) . \"Why were the reforms bought for 4 billion francs and 50,000 heads, when Louis XVI was offering them free?\" Granier de Cassagnac\"Causes de la Revolution Francaise \"). \"Why did the Convention shed so much blood? They say that bloodshed was caused by the hartred of the people against the privileged class *. How could the small percentage of executed aristocrats be explained ; only 55% of all condemned\" (Pouget de Saint Andre - \"Les Auteurs de la Revolution Francaise\", p . 3) . \"All the French people are against us, said Robespierre at the Jacobins' Club. Our only hope is based upon the citizens of Paris . No! answered Desfieux : even in Paris we would be in a minority, if the vothing were secret .\" (Buchez et Roux - \"Histoire Parlementaire\", vol . XX, p. 300) . \"The murder of King Louis XVI. was an act of the most hideous materialism the most shameful profession of ingratitude and baseness, of \"most roturiere villainy and of forgetfulness of the past\" (Ernest Renan in his \"'La Monarchie Constitutionelle en France\") . All the Revolutions and World unrest have been and will be organized by the same Jewish Occult World Government . That is why they ought to be studied carefully, without falling into fantastic hypothesis, as the \"hundred blind authors,\" quoted by Mr . Gooch in his \"Helps For Students Of History\" have done . Practically the only author in England, who honestly tried to throw real light on the French and World Revolutions is the talented and learned Mrs . Nesta Webster. It may be that by her woman's intuition she opened the door where male historians faltered. An immense amount of credit is due to her, because of her courage, and erudition. My articles (\"Plain English\", 1920) \"created herl All the books of the \"Hundred Blind Authors\" on the French Revolution ought to be abandoned, or kept in libraries as examples of how History ought not to be written . Herder says the French Revolution was as big an event as the rise of Christianity. No l It can be compared only with the other less important successes of Satan : The detachment of the Orthodox Church and that of the Protestant from the Mother Church, Herder's intuition suggested to him that the French, like any other Revolution, was not a mere political and economical event ! It must be considered as the beginning of the substitution of Christian Monarchies by the Jewish. * I do not think that Queen Marie Antoinette ever once missed an opportunity of saying an agreeable thing to those who had the honor of approaching her.\" (Mrs. Vigee-Lebrun in her \"Memoirs\") . 64 ONE HUNDRED BLIND HISTORIANS The future authors must take into consideration not only the \"jackals,\" which helped the Revolutions, but first of all, the \"Tigers,\" who have prepared the main roads to it and who have broken the chief obstacles against all bloodshed - the Christian feelings . According to my \"Science of Political Foresight\" each author must ask himself :- Where is, or will be the Hidden Hand?\" In his \"Helps For Students of History . The French Revolution\" Mr. G. P. Gooch, recommends \"The Lectures on the French Revolution\"-( there have been no French, Russian or German, etc . revolutions, but only Jewish revolutions, in France, in Russia, etc .) of Lord Acton, who like a horse in blinders, points out just what the Jews wished to prove through their agents-Cagliostro in Paris and Rasputin in Petrograd, that the \"worst of advisers was the Queen,\" She and Queen Amelia of Portugal prior to the revolution there ; and the Empress of Russia, were all discredited by the Jews and made the scape-goats by them for events with which they had no connection. Lord Acton attributes the failure of the moderate reformers to the intrigues of the Court (as was done in Russia) . He says : \"The Declaration of the Rights of Man-is the triumphal pro - clamation. This simple page of print outweighs libraries, and is stronger than all the armies of Napoleon . It had one cardinal fault it sacrifices liberty to equality, and the absolutism of the King is succeeded by the absolutism of the Assembly . The attack on the Church was a needless and fatal blunder .\" He \"overlooks\" the \"Tigers\"-the Hidden Hand. Yes! They \"sacrificed liberty\" but did not establish equality . \"The King was succeded by the absolutism of the Assembly,\" but the Assembly was itself obeying the absolutism of the Jewish Occult Emperor . The attack on the Church was not \"a needless blunder\" ; it was and is the main object of each revolution, because it is a Jewish means to destroy Christendom. Mr. John Reeves insists that the American \"revolt\" and the \"French\" revolution enabled Rothschild to lay the foundation of the immense wealth he has since acquired. He forgets the ancient dictum : \"Is feci cui prodest\", and neither he nor any other author exposed the role of Amschel in the above capital events . One can understand that Amschel financed both sides in the American bloodshed. But what \"side\" did he finance in the French? 65 ALL REVOLUTIONS WERE JEWISH - SATANIC. Of course, Prussia and England intensely desired the destruction of France even by beheading her through the murder of Louis XVI. All the dirty and bloody work, however was introduced into the Revolution by the Jewish World Government, or \"The Hidden Hand,\" then headed by Amschel Rothschild I . For those who ignore it everything is a \"mystery.\" \"It (the revolution) brought on the stage, forces which have moulded the actions of men ever since, and have taken a permanent place among the formative influence of civilisation\" (Mr. G. P. Gooch) . It brought the Jewish World Empire, and each Revolution surrenders a country to its yokel The \"equality\" remained a dream . The \"liberty\" excludes the \"equality\" . \"Despite its horrors, the Revolution was a great effort towards the emancipation of the common man,\" states Mr . Gooch. The common man was \"emancipated\" from his Christian King, who defended him, only in order to become more terribly enslaved by the Jewish rulers, who hate and despise the common men, as proved in the case of Gambetta, a Jew, et al. Mr. Gooch believes, that \"No man has done so much to expound the history of the Revolution as Aulard .\" Aulard was bought by the Rothschild who offered him the well-paid \"Chair of History,\" in Paris in 1886, if he would put more fog on the \"Cause of World Unrest .\" And he did it . My \"Science of Political Foresight\" or the \"Theory of Satanic Forces,\" which rule the World with its advice : In each event watch for the Hidden Hand, will do more to reveal the truth than the 100 blind or bribed authors, quoted by Mr. G. P. Gooch . \"Are any of you sorry for the French Revolution? Liberty was enthroned, the old order was destroyed and a new France was born,\" childishly wrote Mr . Clarence Darrow of Chicago in his \"Arguments in Defense of the Communists\" . By saving the two Jewish murderers Leopold and Loeb, and now potentially having freed them, Darrow proved, that the Jews are \"Above all Law\" here . For 10 years I lived in Paris . There is no liberty, but a slavery of the French under the Rothschilds' autocracy. All that made France famous was accomplished by the Monarchies . She is only eating this inheritance, incapable of producing anything grand. The utter failure of the \"III-rd French Republic\" is well described by M. Joseph Santo in his book \"La Faillite de la Republique\" and was proved by M. Urbain Gohier, the greatest Frenchman of to-day . 66 \"MYSTERY\" OF ROBESPIERRE REVEALED On the following pages I shall quote numerous \"mysteries\" which puzzled the \"historians\", but are clear for my readers. From whence came the influence of Robespierre upon persons far more intelligent and talented? Michelet, a progressive historian describes Robespierre, as a small lawyer with a poor figure, endowed with but mediocre intelligence and colorless capacities . \"One can imagine a tyrant surrounded by an army, not a tyrant alone and without soldiers\" (G. Lebon, - \"La Revolution Francaise\", p . 231) . The greatest Frenchman of today M. Urbain Gohier, and a famous French Historian, commented in his \"La Vieille France,\" N-261 (Febr. 2, 1922) about the strange fact, that while Danton has a monument and a fine st. eet dedicated to him in Paris, there is nothing to remind one of Robespierre. M.Grohier explains this by 'he fact, that Robespierre was incorruptible, while Danton was a dishonest immoral rogue and sold himself to everybody. Yes! to the H. H. But it was not, because of his honesty, that Robespierre received no reward from the \"French\" Republic . It was because of his last speech, in which he revealed that the French Revolution like all the others, was NOT run by the French, but by the foreign agents. What angered them in 1794, continues to displease them today. Robespierre then said imprudently : \"I distrust all these foreigners, whose faces are covered with masks of patriotism and who are trying to appear more republican and energetic, than we, ourselves . . . They are agents of foreign powers, because I know well, that our enemies did not fail to say : `our emissaries must simulate the most warm patriotism, the most exaggerated' in order to be installed into our assemblies. These agents must be crushed despite their perfidious art and the masks, which they always assume.\" Mr. J. Goldworth Alger even asks in his \"Paris in 1789-94\" \"Was he (Robespierre) afterwards a monarchist\" (p .447) . Why did Robespierre's two hours speech on July 26, 1794 cost him his life? And why on the Sabbath, was the Tribunal closed,* though it was destined to meet on that day to order the execution of Robespierre?\" (Alger . p.463) . Why was Robespierre badly wounded and not killed, by a Meda, whom people nicknamed \"Merda\" and whose brother was Meng? The \"French\" Revolution, as the others have been was organised and financed by the Rothschilds in order to murder the Christians, to plunder them and to obtain \"all the kingdoms .\" *Why did the Tribunal rest on Saturday-inference is they were in the Synagogues those \"French\" leaders of the \"French\" revolution . 67 ROBESPIERRE'S WORDS COST HIS LIFE The supposed \"leader\" Robespierre was Amschel's tool. \"It seems to me, that we are pushed by a 'Hidden Hand' above our will. Every day the Committee of the Public Salvation is doing what it decided a day before not to do . There is a faction conducted in order to ruin it whose directors we have not been able to discover\" . (Robespierre to Amar, Memoirs de Mallet du Pan, vol . II, p . 60) . Robespierre lost his life, because he dared to express his disgust, that the Aliens (Jews) introduced by Weisshaupt and by other agents of Amschel, had become the real rulers in Paris . He was not killed by Meng (not a Frenchman), but only badly wounded in the jaw, in order to cause him most awful suffering, prolong his agony as long as possible and by depriving him of the power of speech to prevent him from revealing, that it was not a revolution, but the grabbing of France by Jews . It was mere \"kosher-butchering\" ! 1! This confirms, that the \"French\" revolution was Jewish . \"It was not reason that created the French Revolution\" (Lionel Rothschild\" Sidonia, O'Coningsby \", p. 240) . And Mr. Alger's implying, that since Robespierre revealed the Jewish plots, he must be a monarchist, clearly reminds one of the same Jewish methods of today to class as a monarchist everyone, who believes CHRIST's warning, that the Jews are murderers and liars? Because Mr. Henry Ford boldly, patriotically and honestly revealed the Jewish crimes, the Hidden Hand induced \"Hearst's International Review\" through every possible means to insinuate, that Mr. Ford has become a \"pro-monarchist\" Does not this prove, that the Hidden Hand, which set fire to France, is doing the same here through the same system by pouring her Jews into the U. S.?* Thousands of rascals and cut-throats were brought into Paris by the agents of Amschel R . I., as the bolsheviks- Jews are brought into the U . S. daily** camouflaged as Frenchmen, Prussian, Poles even Irish (\"Plain English\") . They were helped by the stupid, greedy mob, which understood nothing, and had nothing to lose . And when the U, S . is drowned in an ocean of blood, may be, some American Robespierre will make the same discovery, that all revolutions are Jewish . *Please read \"Reds In American\" by Mr . R. M. Whitney ; \"The Red Conspiracy\" by Joseph J. Mereto ; \"Underground With The Reds\" by Fred P. Marvin and especially Mr. B. L. Brasol's clever books. **The Secretary of Labor J . J, Davis confessed that hundreds of thousands of aliens are coming to America clandestinely. Two thirds of those are Jews, of whom 99 per cent are bolsheviks or pro-bolsheviks . 68 TNF, \"MYSTERIES\" OF THE \"FRENCH\" REVOLUTION. Robespierre did not become a monarchist, but he understood, that the supposed \"French\" revolution was simply a \"Jewish\" acquisition of France and had nothing to do with welfare, freedom equality and other shibboleths . If Free Masonry was chiefly guilty for the ocean of blood in the \"French\" Revolution why then were its lodges closed in 1793 and why were so many free masons executed? It is true that many free masons claimed that the \"French\" (and the other) Revolution was staged by them .Thus Sicard de Plauzoles declared at the Convention of 1913 : \"The Free Masonry can with pride consider the Revolution as its own deed\" (Tourmentin - \"La Franc-Maconnerie Demasquee\") This was also affirmed by the free mason Louis Blanc in his \"History of the French Revolution\" . But the claim was especially set forth at the International Masonic Congress in 1889 by the free masons Amiable and Colfavru at a lecture on July 16 at the Grand Orient. They asserted that all the work had been done by the masons and that the plan of the Revolution had been elaborated by them before 1778 : It is also significant that the Masonic Congress was held in 1889, exactly 100 years after the outbreak of the Revolution of 1789 ... ! Yes ! But, however, all the leading (seemingly) masons : Robespierre, Danton, et al . were later on executed, after having accomplished the \"dirty work\" ... Who can explain why such a powerful' organization could not save its members from being assassinated?' Outside of France two monarchs proved to be opposed to the- Revolution : the King of Sweden Gustavus III and the Emperor of Austria Joseph II . When Gustavus decided to interfere against the French Revolution, he was stabbed at a court ball by the free masons.Joseph, also at a court ball, took some candy from a masked woman and died the next day (February 20, 1790) : When Mirabeau could have prevented the murders, by taking the side of the King, he was given coffee and \"suddenly\" died, while his two companions, who drank some of it with him (Fellenc and Frochot) became gravely ill .*) Mirabeau died in great, but well deserved suffering ... By murdering King Louis XVI., the Free-Masons were revenged for the execution in 1314, by King Phillipe le Bel of their satanic, \"judaized\" Grand Master, Jacques Molai . *) ''La Revolution, La Terreure, Le Direetoire\", by Despatys . 69 THE \"MYSTERIES\" OF THE \"FRENCH\" REVOLUTION. \"The party that pushed the Revolution to violence was directed by a Hidden Hand,* which until today could not be surmised\". (Alexis Dumesnil, - \"Preface aux Memoirs de Senat\") . \"There has been an Invisible Motor which spread all kinds of false rumors in order to perpetuate trouble . This centre must have a great many agents, and in order to pursue such an abominable plan it must be guided by a subtle brain and have plenty of money . Some day the world will know this infernal genius and the provider of funds\" ('Memoires de Bailly' vol . II, p . 33) Now this infernal genius and provider of enormous funds is revealed by me . It was Amschel Rothschild I, who used the immense fortune of the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel for the destruction of Christendom ; just as the Jews bolsheviks are using all the money they can find to destroy Russia, to \"blow up\" the U . S. and then all Christendom . Even a Jew, Gompers, asserted that the Jewish bankers are helping bolshevism with millions . \"An Invisible Hand rules the mob\" (wrote Lafayette on July 24, 1789) . \"The more one is near the instruments and the actors of this catastrophe the more one is in darkness and in mystery ; this will only increase with time\" (\"Memorial of Ste-Helene\", vol . II. p . 32) . Joseph de Maistre, a famous Frenchman, attributed the Revolution to Satan. \"Satan is the legitimate father of the revolution\", said brilliant George Sand. Gustave Bord in his book \"Le complot maconnique\" wrote that the Revolution was staged by the Free Masonry. Yes! The Free Masonry did much abominable work . But who gave the money? Who wished the spilling of so much blood, which was unanimously disapproved of by the whole French nation? Who is \"doing the lust of murder?\" CHRIST pointed it out! Cagliostro (the \"Rasputin\" of Marie Antoinette) learned that the secret society to which he was then attached, and the members of which shouted at his admission : \"We are 300\" (The Hidden Hand) - had deep roots and a great \"Treasury of War\" . This was still the fortune of the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, who confided it to Amschel Rothschild I and which the latter used to destroy Christendom . * Haugwitz, former mason and a stateman, and many other masons confirmed that the murders of the most kindhearted King Louis XVI . and of King Gustavus III. and the French Revolution had been decided 4-5 years ahead by the free-masonic conventions at Wilhelmsbad, Ingolstadt and Frankfort. But the palace of Wilhelmsbad was managed by Amshel Rothschild, who lived and ruled in Frankfort . And his mere valet Weisshaupt, also a Jew, was from Ingolstadt . Thus all the murders attributed rightly to the free-masons, were decided by Amschel! ! ! 70 THE \"MYSTERIES\" OF THE \"FRENCH\" REVOLUTION . \"The first blows of the conspiracy against the thrones should be struck against France . After its downfall, Rome (Papacy) ought to be dethroned\" (Confessions of Cagliostro, a Jew) . \"Cagliostro obtained huge sums for propaganda ; received the instruction from the sect, (\"Illuminati\") and went to Strassburg in France\" (Louis Blanc - \"La Revolution Francaise \", vol . II, ch . 2) . \"Why not suppose that our (French) monarchy was disliked by the Jew Weishaupt9 It was he who sent his coreligionist Cagliostro to prepare the French freemasonry to accept the leadership of the German Illuminati. He it was who organized the international federation of the lodges .\" (Pouget do Saint Andre - \"Les Auteurs Caches\", p . 16) One of the rules of the \"Illuminati\" was to spread the rumor, that a foe whom it was imprudent to kill, was an imbecile or insane . Mirabeau was lured into the \"Illuminati\" gang by a Jewess Henriette Herz, (Karl Rothschild was married with Adelaide Herz and the first \"Russian\" bolshevik was Herz-en) who introduced kim into the house of Mendelssohn,, The masonic lodge of \"Les Amis Reunis\", (\"United Friends\") to which Mirabeau introduced the ` .'German\" delegates, was directed by a secret Committee composed of Mirabeau, Talleyrand and Chappe de la Heuziere, the deputy of the Martinists, at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad. This committee convoked on Febr. 15, 1785 an International Masonic Congress at which were also present Cagliostro, St : Martin and Talleyrand, who \"discovered\" Napoleon I and through Talleyrand Napoleon was made the instrument to overthrow the Christian Church . Among other members of the Congress were also three Princes of Hesse, relatives of the Landgrave of Hesse, whose \"alter ego\" and the \"damned soul\" was Amschel Rothschild I . It was the lodge of \"Amis Reunis\" that schemed the affair of the necklace in order to defame the Queen Marie Antoinette, as Rasputin subsequently was to stigmatize the Empress of Russia. Most Americans do not believe, that a bloody revolt is possible here . At least now, through this book, they will know, who is staging it. \"The Judeo-masonic peril is a question of life or death for all the nations\" (Jouin, the famous editor \"Revue Internat. Des Societes Secretes,\" Paris) . \"Remember the French Revolution, to which it was we who gave the name of \"great\", The secrets of its preparations are known to us, for it was wholly the work of our hands\" (Protocols of The Learned Elders of Zion, 3) \"We, Jews, are still here, our last word is not yet spoken, our last deed is not yet done, our last revolution is not yet made\" (Dr. Oscar Levy, London) 71 ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this questions is very long and complex. I will try to sum up the most important causes that led to the revolution. This can be done, in my opinion, by separating the causes in four significant parts. 1) The influence of the Enlightenment on the Revolution The Age of Enlightenment was marked by a series of cultural elite, personalities, so-called theoreticians of the Enlightenment ideas. Through their writings, they would influence the thinking of a new era and change mindsets. The ideas of the Enlightenment spread mostly through books. Besides books, philosophers\u2019 ideas circulated via the press, through scientific, literary and artistic societies, through study rooms, but also through Masonic lodges. Enlightenment ideas spread through Europe and the American continent through brochures or large books. The Encyclop\u00e9die, coordinated by Diderot and d\u2019Alembert, had 35 volumes. It contained scientific and technical knowledge of the time, philosophic, political, religious and economic ideas, an analysis of society and the idea of human progress. Montesquieu was a nobleman and had been president of the Bordeaux Parliament. He considered that these institutions, as well as the States Provincial, had a special role in mediation between the king and his subjects. Their power prevented the king becoming a despot. The parliaments were enthusiastic about his ideas. Voltaire was a conservative Enlightenment philosopher. He created a vast body of work. His writings were aimed against social inequalities, superstition and religious intolerance. He criticized the Old Regime and the Church. He fought for freedom of speech and thought, and for all men to stand equal before the law. He considered that the evils of society could be removed through the alliance of monarchs and philosophers. Voltaire was the theoretician of enlightened despotism. J.J. Rousseau was a radical Enlightenment thinker. His works: Discourse on Inequality and The Social Contract express the aspirations of the minor nobility he represented. Rousseau considered private property to be the source of inequality and evil in society. As such, it should be limited. He also fought for the right of all citizens to participate in political life. The state must be organized in such a way as to ensure the sovereignty of the people. In J.J. Rousseau\u2019s conception, the republic was a society which appeared as a consequence of a contract drawn up between free and equal people. Based on this contract, the exercise of power was delegated to representatives of these people. General will was the political expression of a national community, representing the source of authority in a state. Thus, the idea of a representative political regime, as an expression of the people\u2019s sovereignty, was founded. The idea that there is a clear difference between public life and private life appeared. State authority together with administrative organization were considered forms of public authority. Social rules and order, gardens and markets were also considered public. Thus, public language is inaugurated, along with public conferences, and also the idea of public services. All kinds of people participated in the public debates: the intellectual elite, philosophers, scientists and the general public. They took place in libraries, coffee shops, clubs, Masonic lodges, in modern salons or in literary societies. In the name of public opinion, the general state of society was criticized, together with the king\u2019s policies. 2) Context of the Revolution and The Old Monarchic Regime The Bourbon dynasty dominated the history of France for almost four centuries. It started with Henry IV, King of France and Navarre, who laid the foundation of the absolute monarchy and eased France of internal wars between Protestants and Catholics. It ended with Henry V whose reign lasted only seven days because of the revolutionary disturbances France was passing through. The dynasty lives on today in the kings of Spain and Luxembourg. Centralization coexisted with lots of privileges and autonomies. Justice, for example, was exercised jointly by royal officials, by elders who inherited the right to do justice on their own properties and by ecclesiastical courts.Kings were creating new structures, but they could not abolish the old ones, continually adding new structures to the old. In 1789 in France there were 35 provinces, 135 dioceses, 38 military regions, 34 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9s and 13 parliaments. The tax regime was very grievous. Taxes were distributed unevenly, being borne almost entirely by the third estate. There were numerous financial reform attempts even in the time of Louis XVI, by the ministers Anne Robert Jacques Turgot and Jacques Necker. These attempts were thwarted by the king. The financial crisis haunting France at that time was also exacerbated by the various wars in which it was involved, which weighed heavily on the state treasury. Failing to cover its expenses, the monarchy was forced to take out loans. This led to interest swallowing up more than half of the state expenses 3) The 18th century French Society France registered significant demographic growth, from a population estimated to be anywhere between 14 and 22 million people, to an estimate of between 23 and 28 million. Even so, it was below the European average for that time.Agricultural production was growing continually, even though new technology and tools were not always used. Industry excelled, especially in the textile production sector. It was strongly supported by the construction of roads. Catholicism was the state religion. There were 130,000 clergy, of which 60,000 were members of the monarchic orders and 70,000 were secular priests working in parishes. The wealth of the Church came from the land it owned and from tithes. The church owned approx. 10% of the land. The second estates was the most powerful. Estimates of the numbers of nobility and their families in this period are not exact. There were between 100,000 and 300,000 noblemen, that is between 0.5% and 1.5% of the French population. The greatest power was held by the 4,000 court nobles. This category was, in theory, limited to those whose noble ancestry could be traced from the 14th-15th century. However, amongst these were also all those who could afford life at Versailles. The primary source of income was the land. The nobility owned between one-quarter and one-third of France\u2019s land. Besides this, it also received between 15 and 25% of the income of the church, since all the bishops were nobles. At the end of the 18th century, the ranks of the nobility were not closed. Anyone could become a noble, either through a direct favor accorded by the king, or by purchasing certain positions. The third estate was the largest in France. For the most part, it lacked political rights. At the same time it had to pay the most taxes, either to the church, to the kingdom or to feudal landowners. There were 2.3 million bourgeois, making up 8% of the total population. The bourgeois was rising in numbers and in wealth. Finance, industry and the banking system provided 20% of personal wealth in France. The greatest percentage belonged to the bourgeois. Many of these held jobs which could be purchased. The Third Estate was formed of the different types of bourgeoisie, such as: industrialists, bankers, landowners, members of the liberal professions, doctors, authors, members of the legal profession and civil servants. Also included in this category were free or dependent peasants and urban laborers. If the bourgeoisie was the richest component of the third estate, the peasants were the most numerous. Around 85% of France\u2019s population lived in rural areas, and most of these were peasants. They owned between 25-45% of the land, with big differences between the various regions of France. The big farmers, approx. 600,000 in number, cultivated crops for sale, hiring other peasants as day laborers and offering loans of money. Most were \u201cles labourers\u201d, peasants who worked the land to survive. In good years, they made a small surplus. They, together with the big farmers, managed well until the 1770s. In this period, \u2018feudalism\u2019 was all about rights and privileges enjoyed by landowners, but it also involved taxes and obligations owed to them by the peasants. All peasants were required to pay their tithe to the Church, taxes to the state and feudal rights to their elders. Urban laborers were the third component of the Third Estate. They lived in cities, in crowded and unhealthy accommodation. They were unqualified and poor. The nobility and the high clergy supported the existing regime. Those from the Third Estate, especially the bourgeois, wanted profound political change. From a social point of view, there was evident dissatisfaction, especially from the peasants and laborers. This state of affairs was produced by the fact that the nobles were exempted from paying tax. 4) The immediate Causes of the Revolution The French government became bankrupt due to the very expensive wars it had been involved in for 20 years, such as: The Austrian War of Succession, The 7 year war and The American War for Independence. Financial failure was evidenced by a deficit of almost one-quarter of the total income of the crown. This deficit led to an increase in national debt, caused by large loans. Very soon, the sources of loans for France dried up. Calonne, the general director of finances, had to begin a reform of the fiscal system. He proposed replacing taxes such as poll tax and vingtieme with a standard property tax, which must be paid by everyone, even by nobles and the clergy. The Parisian Parliament upheld the fundamental laws of the kingdom. According to these, the Estates-General was the only body with the right to vote on taxation. According to the same laws, French citizens could not be sent to prison without a fair trial, and the king could not modify the privileges and customs of the provinces. As a result, Lamoignon reduced the rights of the parliaments, especially the right to register royal decrees and to protest against them. The result of this act of force was the aristocratic revolt. The Parisian Parliament returned. But it quickly lost its popularity when it declared that it was calling a meeting of the Estates-General in the same conditions as in 1614. This meant that the clergy and nobility retained their privileges. Before the meeting of the Estates-General, the electorate of the three states wrote books of grievances and suggestions for reform. Through these, they were petitioning the king to make reforms which would serve their interests. When the Estates-General met, the government could have taken control of the situation. However, it didn\u2019t propose a single program and it didn\u2019t mention the constitution which all the books of grievance asked for. Thus, the government missed its opportunity to reestablish its footing. When the first two estates joined the meetings of the Third Estate, the National Assembly was formed. They requested sovereignty, considering themselves to be the representatives of the nation. King Louis the 16th promised that taxes would no longer be imposed without the agreement of the nation\u2019s representatives. Les lettres de cachet would be abolished and there would be freedom of the press. Internal taxes, la gabelle and la corvee would be done away with. But the Third Estate was not satisfied. So, the king ordered the deputies to meet separately. Journalists and followers of duke d\u2019Orleans established a permanent general headquarters at Palais Royal. Here, thousands of people gathered every evening to hear the speeches of the revolutionaries. The popular Parisian movement was directed from Palais Royal. The Bastille was a medieval fortress in Paris, which had become the symbol of royal despotism. It was used as a state prison and a place of detention for important people. The Parisian people\u2019s need for arms made them head for the H\u00f4tel des Invalides, an old home for soldiers used as an arsenal deposit. They found and took 28,000 muskets and 20 cannons. But since they did not have enough gunpowder or bullets, they headed for the Bastille fortress. The government sent troops to suppress the uprising, but they turned out to be unreliable. The soldiers from the French Guard, who in their free time practised various jobs in Paris and mixed with the population, were influenced by the agitators from the Palais Royal. Discipline rapidly deteriorated in this elite unit. Thus, two companies refused to go on the mission, and 5 out of 6 battalions of the guards deserted, some of them joining the Parisians storming the Bastille. There were 5,000 soldiers from other troops close by. The officers told their commandant that they could not count on their men. The army retreated from the streets of Paris towards Champ de Mars in the suburbs, and did not intervene. The Parisians laid siege to the Bastille without intending to storm it. But when they managed to enter the interior courtyard, governor De Launay refused to give them gunpowder, and ordered his troops to shoot. Thus, 98 of the insurgents were killed before the soldiers of the French Guard intervened. They had the cannons taken that morning from the H\u00f4tel des Invalides. De Launey was forced to surrender, then was killed and beheaded. Those who participated in the attack on the Bastille were not members of the rich middle class. They were revolutionary craftsmen, laborers and construction workers from the laborers\u2019 neighborhoods. In the peak of the rebellion, around one-quarter of a million Parisians were armed. The conquest of the Bastille had major consequences, since the king lost control of Paris. Here, the electors instituted a new form of government called a Commune, and appointed La Fayette as commander of the National Guard. The Assembly took the title National Constituent Assembly. Its purpose was to create a constitution which would no longer be threatened by the king\u2019s intervention. The power had effectively passed from the king\u2019s hands to the elected representatives of the people. Louis could no longer dictate orders to the Assembly, because he could no longer count on the army. When he came back to Paris, the king was received with hostility by the multitudes. Louis was forced to acknowledge the new revolutionary council made up of the Commune and the National Guard. He wore the red, white and blue ribbon of revolution in his hat. When news of the fall of the Bastille spread in the country, the peasants\u2019 revolt began, spread and intensified. The Paris revolt caused many nobles to emigrate, led by the king\u2019s brother, count d\u2019Artois. Approximately 20,000 nobles fled France in the space of two months. On the foreign front, the Great Powers, through their representatives: the duke of Dorset, the British ambassador, and Governor Morris, the American ambassador, concluded that the revolution was over and that the authority of the French king and nobles had been neutralized. France was a free country. ",

A/C me the noble reason for the cause of french revolution that increases one more chapter in our text book is Financial crisis. France was an active country in colonization before French revolution. France lost his treasury in the war for the purpose of their expansion that results into the heavy payback on the successor of the country. In 1774, Louis XVI ascended the kingdom of France at the age of 20. The war added more than a billion bucks to a debt to the french king from the lender . The humor is- At the age of 20, we still are part of our respective education system. The king has distributed their citizens on three different classes on the basis of their living standard and the position in the society,The first and top most estates holds the clergy. the second or middle one have big businessmen, merchants, court officials ,lawyers etc. At the last estates it was given to the small peasants, landless labor, servants etc. There are lots of contribution has been given by the top most two estates to the king in terms of funds for the war. To overcome from the the burden of debt, the king has implemented a heavy taxes on the people of the third estates and excluded all the people who comes under the top most two estates. This leads to a social breakdown in France. The king fail to pacify the interest of people due to the tax policy of the king. This leads to the cause of a french revolution. ",

            "answer_text": "French Revolution, like many other revolution in the end it exchanged authoritarian regime for an authoritarian regime. Like many other revolutions here also oppression, suppression,inequalty were buliding up for decades and finally the crisis appeared. Events in the context of French revolution was influence or consequences of few factors(or causes), these are, 1.French society and tax collection system.(mainly) 2. American revolution. 3. Poor leadership. 4.Enlightenment 5. Finally financial crisis appeared in 1789 due to less production and high bread price. 1.French society and tax collection system.(mainly) Albeit France was one of the largest and richest country in europe,primarily the seed was within the social division, French societiy was divided into estates. They were, 1st estate comprises 1% population and 10%of lands,they were exempt from taxes. They were mainly clergies. 2nd estate was nobility,2%of population, owned around 30% of lands,received many tax exemption,were crucial in the society. Leading in government, military forces,courts. 3rd estate had around 97% population,had 3 groups of commoner bourgeoisie(factory owner,lawyer,merchants) are big admirer and fams of enlightenment and they actually had a lot of money, worker and peasants. Peasants were 80% of population. This estate were the only one paid taxes,not only to the kings but to the 1st and 2nd estates, due to this discrepancy tax collective system was by origin faulty. The monarch Louis XVI based his authority on divine rights and granted special privileges to first 2 estates. Financially france was exhausted due to its support to American revolution and long running war with England.(I will explain later in answer). King Louis appointed Jacques Necker as financial minister,pushed for tax reforms won public support but kings advisors strongly opposes these initialtives,desperate for solution king called a Estate general, hadnt meet since 1614,an assembly or super parlaments of representative from 3 estates. But first 2 classes were eager to enjoy privileges but 3rd estate had 97 % population so 3 rd estate broke off and declared themselves as national assembly, pledged to draft a new constitution,with or without other estate. King Louie dismissed Necker but advised to 1st 2 estates to merge with 3rd estate. 3rd estate was National assembly. Then king send his troops to Paris primarily to quell uprising over food shortages. Revolutionaries saw this as a provocation. Some of them mentioned there are huge amount of gun powder inside Bastille,so they stormed upon on 14 the July,1789 and seized the castle of Bastille,a symbol of royal power. The revolution had begun.  Fall of Bastille castle The assembly s declaration of the rights of men and women proclaimed a radical idea of time, individual rights and freedoms were fundamental only government will protect them. Some of Nobel's fled France, Louis XVI remained as a figurehead of monarchy tried to escape in 1791,but was caught and charged with treason. After a public trial he was beheaded in 1793,signaling end of monarchy and finalizing 21 st September declaration of 1st French republic. Within a year the queen was also executed. Some leader were not content only with govt change,they wanted to change everything, multiple factions were there. Then extremist Jacobin lead by Robespierre launched a \u2018reign of terror' over 3 years to suppress slightest dissent,executed over 20000. Before Jacobs downfall, France found itself at wars with many neighboring monarchs seeking to strangle revolution before it spreads. Amidst the chaos a general name Napoleon Bonaparte took charge,claimed to show respect towards the democratic values. Next is known to all. 2.American revolution. The second aggrement, treaty of Alliance made the fledging US and france allied against Great Britain in the revolutionary war. The french decided to back the US in its milirary efforts until the US had full independence from Great Britain. So Financially france was exhausted due to its support to American revolution and long running war with England. In another way it influenced French revolution,introduced new political senses,driven by enlightenment idea of republicanism,which i will tell later in answer. 3.Poor leadership. Louis XVI,i mentioned his incompetency in early part of this question who failed to control 3 estates. 4.Enlightenment. By the end of the 18th century. Europe had undergone a profound intellectual and cultural shift, Enlightenment. Philosopher promoted reason,logic and human freedom over tradition and religion. It influenced French revolution in many ways,stand as an ideological basis of French Revolution,although originated in England( The English philosopher Edmund Burke was among the first to link the Revolution to ideas of the Enlightenment). The first chapter in the French revolution drew very much on the nobility and in particular the ideas of Montesquieu. He proposed a liberal constitutional monarchy in which power was devolved between different bodies. It tranformed monarchy(first in US) and ushered new Republican concept. Enlightenment philosophical senses started to contest with the morality and dogma of clergies and church. They accepted one god,the almighty but also they believed creation submits only to the nature,aka deisim. They introduced deeply in society man have to be happy,and government will escalate them. Voltaire, enlightenment writer promoted the idea of right to free speech, religious freedom. John Locke said no king should have absolute power.  As I early mentioned the bourgeoisie were fans of enlightenment and the 3rd estate. So the acceptibility and influence of enlightenment is now imaginable,as they have support and finance both. https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://madefrom.com/history/enlightenment/enlightenment-influenced-french-revolution/&ved=0ahUKEwiox_Hno63YAhWLNY8KHTubA2QQFgikATAb&usg=AOvVaw3bhjZjGXUI9vfHDQ22M1uh 5. Financial Crisis. Two things cause france to go into debt, Wars and supporting wars and lavish lifestyle of the king,queen. Debt was so high that half of collected taxes used to pay off on the debt. This nicely coincided with hailstorm ruined years harvest,raising the bread price,food price and cause hunger. But not the wealthiest king and Queen were starving or feeling.

            "answer_text": "now, let\u2019s image an idealistic society where people believe they are created to be equal in all kinds of aspects such as property, rights and freedom, etc, where privileged doesn\u2019t exist, when everyone all comes to shares the same treatment as others did, where no one gain more benefit than the other in an unreasonable way, where every individual can possibly achieve their greatness and strive for what they deserve in a society of competition, where we live in a society that people treat people fairly. I believed it is human nature that no one wants to be treated unequally in an unreasonably way, because it causes resentment, conflict and lastly violence. and this is what basically what french revolution is about, in which they take the completely opposite side of the ideology society. I would like to break it down into some point that it\u2019s important to discovered human nature when we come to study the history and try to analyse how their personality affects their decision social hierarchy: clergy/noble: by the power of God, I\u2019m greater than you, so I shall have a privilege (logic at that time)before the french revolution, France was ruled by an incompetence leader, named Louis xvi, who lives in a belief system that he was chosen by God and should be titled as\u201d king\u201d, which gives him the reason to rule all of the french people. Louis xvi is a weak man and is easily manipulated by those around him, a group of people who have the privilege to get to benefit from the common people in a reasonable way by being the nobles, and naturally the common people are those who have to suffer the most, however, throughout the wisdom of human from the purpose of avoiding suffering, this unfair system left the common people questioning, (even though most of the people believe the authority of the crowned and almighty god rather than their own ability) so when France was in severe financial debt and the heavy taxation comes along, the hardships cause the common people to start rising against the authority of the crown.Louis xvi later summons the Estate General and comes up with an unfair voting system for people to make a decision( sounds kind of democratic right? no), unsurprisingly, turns out clergy and nobles are the ones who can make most of the decisions for rest of 98 per cent of the population. this leads to what? the 98 per cent of the population outrage and decide to make their own rules, called the national assembly, this is when the power starts to separate from the crown, educate member like Maximilien Robespierre, Georges Danton who want the removal of the king even formed a radical political party, the Jacobin club, while others member of the third estate merely want equality, called moderateAs the situation developing tenser, anger detonate with violence, cruel inequality, harsh oppression, and starvation drove the people in Paris stormed into the bastille to get the weapon and start a revolution(this is when violent start to become acceptable in France)the spread of resentful ideas also form of a weapon, now let\u2019s talk about Jean-Paul Marat, his writing also plays a huge role in the french revolution, which became of the most popular publication in Paris, who is promoting the radical ideas by encouraging the citizens to have more resentment towards the aristocrats and call for the execution who have benefited from the cruel system of inequality.as violent go extreme to the kings' palace, the kings eventually agree to share power with the revolutionary government, this is when the authority of the crown start to undermine and the power of the revolutionary increased. seeing the situation rapidly turns against him, king Louis xvi decides to flee to Austra, however, he got caught on the road to Varennes and immediately send back to Paris, people were extremely furious about that and straight-up title him as \u201c a traitor\u201d who abandoned his own people.there is two reactions to this, one is moderate, who want the king's power completely reduced to constitutional monarchy, as him only being the figurehead. radical, on the other hand, want the king to be executed. in reality, more people want to see the king die, as the result of that, the radical outvoted the moderate, the king was being executed by the guillotine.",

            "answer_text": "The French revolution had both immediate and long term causes. Long term The root cause of the French revolution was basically the way the French society was formed. The society was divided into three estates. These estates were according to one's birth. The First estate was the clergy. The second estate was the nobility. The third estate was everyone else. They were the peasants, the businessmen, the artisans. The problem was that the first two estates were given some special privileges by birth. First was that they were exempt from taxes. The whole burden of taxes was borne by the third estate. They had to pay a direct tax to the state known as the taille. Added to it they were supposed to pay a tax to the clergy known as the tithe. The peasants were supposed to render service to the nobility for free, they were supposed to do the labour. Immediate causes The immediate\u200b cause can be the raising of taxes. At that time, France had it's treasury dried out. It needed more money to finance it's wars and the lavish court. The clergy and nobility were immune from taxes. So the king planned to increase the taxes on the already impoverished third estate. As soon as this news spread, the people were roused as the effect of this decision would be multiplied by the problem given below. During the years before the revolution , the crops failed. On this the king wanted to increase taxes. This increased the prices of crops beyond the reach of the poor. This led to massive riots in the capital, Paris. The Great Fear While riots we're going on in the cities, rumors were spreading in the countryside. A rumor spread that the Lord's of the manor, the local noblemen had hired brigands to destroy the ripe crop. In a frenzy, the farmers seized hoes and pitchforks and attacked the Lord's. They destroyed any papers of bondage to the Lord's and looted the hoarded grain. This spread village to village very quickly and soon covered the whole French country. On 14 July 1789, the king ordered troops to move into the city of Paris. A rumor spread that the King had summoned troops and was soon going to order them to fire on the people. In response, the people formed a people's militia and stormed the Bastille and the rest, as we know is history. ",

            "answer_text": "Because of the \u201cbourgeoisie\u201d, the wealthy middle class, who were kept as second class citizens because they were commoners and not aristocrats. They created wealth, paid heavy taxes and had no political power. Besides, the whole 18th century had seen an economic and cultural boom with big freedom of expression, and a tradition of political criticism had appeared with Voltaire, Montesquieu and Rousseau. Despite the image of peasant and urban mobs, all the leaders of the Revolution were from bourgeois families, or else they would not have had an education. It took highly literate people to create such a system. France was not the only country to have a \u201cbourgeoisie\u201d. The other countries who had a wealthy middle class happened to be protestant ones. Britain and Sweden had parliamentary systems, so that wealthy commoners had their word to say. The Netherlands and Switzerland had semi-republican systems from their beginning, and aristocracies hardly existed. Germany was a bunch of absolutist statelets, but there was a number of free cities where merchants held all the power. The French system remained very rigid and not adapted to modern realities, as an absolute monarchy supported by a very conservative church. So were Spain, Austria or Italian states, but these had weak bourgeoisies. It took a financial crisis and several bad harvests in a row, so that accumulated tensions broke out, and the angry mob attacked the Bastille prison on the 14th of July 1789. It was a symbol, since political prisoners were kept there, but only seven were still left there at the time. No one suspected the hallucinating events of the following years, nor the impact they would have on the world. France was not the first country to have a republic, not the first to have a revolution, not the first to have a constitution, not the first to have a parliament. Not the first to execute its king (England had done this in 1649\u2026). It was however the first country to make a declaration of human rights, to have a national flag, a national anthem, a national holiday. It was the first to proclaim reason as the main principle of its ideology. The infamous \u201cTerreur\u201d came in the later years, after neighboring monarchies tried to stop contagion, and the regime became paranoid and saw traitors everywhere. Mass public executions, including the royal family\u2019s, made understandably a horrific impression around the world. Still, the ideology of \u201cfreedom\u201d was popular, as the Revolutionary system was replaced by different governments (Consulat, directoire) which were equally held by the bourgeoisie. Without popular support, Napoleon would not have been able to organize mass mobilization against the enemies around France, and defeat them all. Even if the Republic was ironically to be replaced by an Empire\u2026 A little known aspect of the French Revolution was its radical atheist ideology. Religion was totally suppressed, since it was considered as the ally of monarchy. All the names starting with Saint- (and there are everywhere) were changed. A \u201cgoddess of reason\u201d was introduced to replace God. The calendar was changed entirely to a \u201crepublican\u201d one, starting with the Revolution, months had strange names referring to nature. Churches were vandalized, priests and nuns were massacred. Things calmed down after the Terreur, but religion remained banned. It was Napoleon who finally put an end to the system by making peace with the Pope when he was crowned Emperor. Religion came back triumphantly in the 19th century, but the memory of these events remained. The famous French secular fanaticism takes its roots in the Revolution. ",

If it defaulted, the interest rates would have been astronomical, and it wouldn\u2019t have been able to borrow anymore money from any country. So it turned inward to raise funds to repay the loans. The Nobility had all of the money (anyone who could afford it could pay for a title so they wouldn\u2019t have to pay as much in taxes), so that\u2019s where money to pay back the debts would have come from. The nobility refused and said they wanted to convene the Estates General to decided whether the king could tax nobles or not. The Estates-General began debates whether to vote by order (nobility, clergy and everyone else) or by individual, with the Third Estate (everyone else) wanting to vote by individual. The king said they should do it by order. This led to the Third Estate calling whoever agreed with it from the other two orders to join it, calling the body they had formed the National (Constituent) Assembly, and agreeing not to disband until it had worked up a constitution. When the king asked his finance minister what he should do, the finance minister said to let them meet. The king disagreed and the finance minister quit/was dismissed. When Paris and the National Assembly heard about this, they assumed the king meant to put down the support in Paris and sought to arm themselves. The Bastille Prison had gunpowder for the gun they had gotten from various Armories so they demanded it and stormed it when the Governor of the Bastille refused to give it to them. The king heard about it and rehired Necker and agreed to work with the National Assembly. ",

            "answer_text": "The French revolution started with an accumulation of structural problems and immediate issues for which the King was unable to bring solutions: I- structural issues The Old Regime was extremelly inegalitarian with 4% of peoples (nobles and rich clergy) owning all power and benefits who were living in very high luxury was a majority of peasants were barely able to survive and artisans and merchants, the bourgeois (usually city peoples) were hammered by taxes (sound familiar ?). As usual the people in controls were blocking any reform but what changed was a sronger education amongst bourgeois elite (following the enlightment period) and a wish for change. Therefore a growing discountaint amongst the bourgeois elite of this status quo. The Old Regime state was living on debt continuously (sounds familiar ?) with a large part of it being the 4% receiving huge pensions. The American revolution cost a huge amount of money and was the extra drop the state couldn\u2019t bare. In order to raise new taxes (there already was many), the King had to gather the \u201cEtat generaux\u201d means representant chosen amongst 3 caste : the nobles, the clergy and the rest of the peoples (understand that also being 96% of the population, their representant were half of the assembly). This assembly was planned to meet in 1789 close to Paris. II- immediate start Half of the assembly (and the King) only wanted to consider the financial problem, other half wanted reforms. A power struggle started immediately between the King and the bourgeois representant on procedure (should we vote by head or order). The wish for reform became asking for reform. With the King becaming more and more reluctant to grant any reform strong of his allegedly absolute power (he didn\u2019t realized it was no longer the case), the Assembly becoming more aware of their power to impose change in this occasion, and on background the economic crisis and starvation in the country (especially Paris very close to Versailles were the assembly seated) THE REVOLUTION STARTED. Mechanically: 1- the King close the door if the Assembly to block the gathering of the bourgeois representant. 2- the Assembly gather in a tennis (its ancestor) court close to it and swear to give constitution. 3- the king invite representant back but at the daily discussion only plan financial matters 4- the Assembly stays in the room amd continue on other topics 5- the King call many troops (made of foreign citizens) in case disorder happen in the capital while sending cavalery in the street of Paris to disperse gatherings / protestation. 6- Fear amongst Paris population leads to riots calling to arms to defend their lives (they go to the Invalides for weapons and La Bastille for powder). La Bastille is taken 14 july 1789 and a militia is created (National Guard) with Lafayette at his head. 7- the King capitulate and his imposed by the assembly a constitution (the Assembly takes over the real power). The monarchy becomes constitutionnal, all hope it will stop here with a British-like system\u2026 it didn\u2019t ! ",

The nobility, whom blithely assented to absolute monarchy in return for tax immunity, refused to believe the finance ministers or assent to rescue the crown from its enormous debts. Little did they know they were digging their own graves. Louis began to lose the obedience of the parlements to record his edicts as required to pass them into law. The ancien regime of France being so ancient in a modernizing country was constitutionally incapable of solving basic problems. Louis had no choice but to convene representatives of the French state - the estates general. Once he did that, a host of other problems simmering beneath the surface erupted into outright revolution. The common class had become educated, industrialized, and many were quite wealthy albeit not noble. The poor were sick of starving and being abused. They wanted more rights and had the power base to get it. The upper class was outnumbered 30 to 1, and the rest is history. ",

            "answer_text": "The French Revolution, along with the Industrial Revolution, has probably done more than any other revolution to shape the modern world.  Not only did it transform Europe politically, but also, thanks to Europe's industries and overseas empires, the French Revolution's ideas of liberalism and nationalism have permeated nearly every revolution across the globe since 1945. The need for absolute monarchy came partly from France's continental position in the midst of hostile powers.  The Hundred Years War (1337-1453) and then the series of wars with the Hapsburg powers to the south, east, and north (c.1500-1659) provided a powerful impetus to build a strong centralized state.  Likewise, the French wars of Religion (1562-98) underscored the need for a strong monarchy to safeguard the public peace.  The means for building a monarchy largely came from the rise of towns and a rich middle class.  They provided French kings with the funds to maintain professional armies and bureaucracies that could establish tighter control over France.  Justification for absolute monarchy was based on the medieval custom of anointing new kings with oil to signify God's favor.  This was the basis for the doctrine of Divine Right of Kings.  In the late 1600's, all these factors contributed to the rise of absolutism in France. Louis XIV (1643-1715) is especially associated with the absolute monarchy, and he did make France the most emulated and feared state in Europe, but at a price. Louis' wars and extravagant court at Versailles bled France white and left it heavily in debt.  Louis' successors, Louis XV (1715-74) and Louis XVI (1774-89), were weak disinterested rulers who merely added to France's problems through their neglect.  Their reigns saw rising corruption and three ruinously expensive wars that plunged France further into debt and ruined its reputation.  Along with debt, the monarchy's weakened condition led to two other problems: the spread of revolutionary ideas and the resurgence of the power of the nobles. Although the French kings were supposedly absolute rulers, they rarely had the will to censor the philosophes' new ideas on liberty and democracy.  Besides, in the spirit of the Enlightenment, they were supposedly \"enlightened despots\" who should tolerate, if not actually believe, the philosophes' ideas.  As a result, the ideas of Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu on liberty and democracy spread through educated society. Second, France saw a resurgence of the power of the nobles who still held the top offices and were trying to revive and expand old feudal privileges.  By this time most French peasants were free and as many as 30% owned their own land, but they still owed such feudal dues and services as the corvee (forced labor on local roads and bridges) and captaineries (the right of nobles to hunt in the peasants' fields, regardless of the damage they did to the crops).  Naturally, these infuriated the peasants.  The middle class likewise resented their inferior social position, but were also jealous of the nobles and eagerly bought noble titles from the king who was always in need of quick cash.  This diverted money from the business sector to much less productive pursuits and contributed to economic stagnation.  First of all, while the French middle class was sinking its money into empty noble titles, the English middle class was investing in new business and technology.  For example, by the French Revolution, England had 200 waterframes, an advanced kind of waterwheel.  France, with three times the population of England, had only eight.  The result was the Industrial Revolution in England, which flooded French markets with cheap British goods, causing business failures and unemployment in France.  Second, a combination of the unfair tax load on the peasants (which stifled initiative to produce more), outdated agricultural techniques, and bad weather led to a series of famines and food shortages in the 1780's. All these factors (intellectual dissent, an outdated and unjust feudal social order, and a stagnant economy) created growing dissent and reached a breaking point in 1789.  It was then that Louis XVI called the Estates General for the first time since 1614. What he wanted was more taxes. What he got was revolution. ",

First of all, the British and American Revolutions took place previously. This inspired some French to join revolutionary groups, as well as the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment inspired educated French. Then came the reasons that unified the nation, such as the loss of faith, as the clergy was too opulent and possessed too much for its size. Then the fact that the bourgeoisie was disadvantaged to the aristocracy because of taxes and privileges granted by the royalty to the latter. Then the fact that people had enough with the feudal system. Other important reasons include famine because of the droughts and a poor financial situation because of the money spent for the American Revolution. All of these reasons tied the French to the revolt and made the Revolution a bloodbath, as it was a war for the survival of a nation. ",

The Enlightenment: impulse for reform intensifies political conflicts; reinforces traditional aristocratic constitutionalism, one variant of which was laid out in Montequieu\u2019s Spirit of the Laws; introduces new notions of good government, the most radical being popular sovereignty, as in Rousseau\u2019s Social Contract [1762]; the attack on the regime and privileged class by the Literary Underground of \u201cGrub Street;\u201d the broadening influence of public opinion. 4. Social antagonisms between two rising groups: the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie 5. Ineffective ruler: Louis XVI 6. Economic hardship, especially the agrarian crisis of 1788-89 generates popular discontent and disorders caused by food shortages. ",
