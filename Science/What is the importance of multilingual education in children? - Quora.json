An early formal education can be quite stressful which will produce multilingual but perhaps a bit touchy, unpleasant adults [early stresses shift the hormonal levels]. Same with the puzzling 3lingual immersion: .. some kids are not predisposed for immersion too well and 3 tongues puzzle them so they react by excluding 1 or 2 from their active repertoire. ",
