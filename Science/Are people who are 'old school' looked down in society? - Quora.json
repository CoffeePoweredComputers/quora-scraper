The white audience gave them their best years until the end of their lives. Classic Rock is always making a comeback\u2026because it\u2019s Classic\u2026not because we were smarter , cooler(maybe) of \u201cbetter\u201d (maybe)\u2026if we were it was because it was new, the times were more positive and music was THE THING\u2026now it\u2019s video games and I-Phones\u2026seems like little kid stuff compared to music, which is not a big thing to most people now. Fashion, the old styles always come back, Young people are buying vinyl records! I was the LAST GUY to stop buying them, I think\u2026I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 back. People LOVE to say they recorded on reel to reel tape and recordig gear from the 50s. You can have it\u2026I\u2019m not a museum curator, I want to make as much music as possible..for no logical reason, I\u2019m just driven\u2026it give s me purpose. I just made friends with a young (to my 68) black guy who\u2019s an electrican working at my house. We talked music and I\u2019m collaborating with him. He gave me some modern hip hop stuff of his to play bass on and I gave him a classic rock bass/drum track to work on. I never cared if I was looked down on by \u201csociety\u201d\u2026in fact, I didn\u2019t WANT to belong to the \u201cFraternity of Man\u201d or any of the woke fraternities. I want to stand by myself. Old school, new school, just \u201cthe good stuff\u201d, by MY standards. I\u2019m NOT a victim because I did it on purpose, but I always maintained a look that would make people react, make me \u201cnot belong\u201d\u2026except to my society. Music is my only perspective for yuor question, but it kind of incorporates a lot of other things. ",

By the way, old-fashioned usually has a negative connoction attached to it. However, being old-fashioned is nothing to be ashamed of, especially when you add a bit of modern element to it. Be the kind of \u2018old school\u2019 who differentiates the good and bad from the past and present, and takes only the best of the past and improvises it to fit into present modern-day standards. In other words, you keep certain things worth keeping alive while letting go of those that should have never existed in the first place. If you could practice the above, who is going to look down on you \u2018old school\u2019? ",

            "answer_text": "It truly depends on which part of society is doing the looking. A lot depends upon whether one is part of a group that always needs to be \u201c\u201cforward-looking\u201d and thinks the past should basically be \u201c\u201cre-imagined\u201d to fit some more postmodern narrative ( you know, the people that think \u201c\u201cHey Boomer\u201d is some ultimate put-down) or if one values tradition and history in the classical sense. I do think that many younger people tend to reject what they see as \u201cold\u201d, whether it is mores and attitudes that have outlived their time or elderly people who (in their opinion) have outlived their usefulness. Sometimes \u201c\u201cold school\u201d just means an older and more complex way of building something or tackling a problem. Some would put aside traditional craftsmanship or artistry for more efficiency and lower cost. Some people think \u201c\u201cold school\u201d punishment ( like spanking children) is outdated and cruel. Some people think society would be better if we put some old-fashioned discipline back in place and burned the Child Psychology books. In general, I think \u201c\u201cold school\u201d implies a toughness, physicality, ingenuity and individualism that is counter to postmodern Progressivism. Personally, I think old school is badass\u2014 but I\u2019m old. LOL. ",

We are respected because we have expertise on our side, and we spent decades perfecting all those skills for which young people have only better or faster methods. 360-degree expertise is on our side, and being faster does not mean being better. Now young people don\u2019t ever want to admit this. They call us \u201cold\u201d and \u201cobsolete\u201d and \u201cold-school.\u201d Until they get stuck because their new faster method never took into account all the ways their endeavors could go wrong. And how could those youngsters know if they have no experience let alone expertise? If young people want to take this route, we old-school folks can handle the name-calling. We already know that with expertise comes relentless patience. We know something even more important: We were once the ones with those better, faster methods of doing things, and we learned along the way (sometimes the hard way) that those old-school folks had all of the problem-solving expertise\u2014and the patience. While we only had technology and speed. Our old-school mentors taught us how to solve problems, same as they taught us how to walk and talk. So we\u2019ll continue to humor and encourage the youngsters to keep plugging away at their newer, faster methods. We know they\u2019ll inevitably come to us voluntarily and ask for help. ;) ",

I\u2019m over 70 and I think in my life there have been more improvements in every aspect of life than in any other time in history. That said, I think there is one area we have perhaps taken a step or two backwards. In the area of relationships we now describe total strangers as \u201cfriends\u201d and people we have never met a BFF\u2019s. We meet online, fall in love online, get ghosted online, breakup online. When we finally meet the digital love of our life we are often disappointed due to exaggerations made online. If I could change anything it would be people spending more time generating true, well rounded relationships that lead to well rounded romances and well rounded marriages with well adjusted children that also value the concept of developing solid relationships face to face.
