            "answer_text": "To understand theory, try to understand meaning of every word. First understand that what theory is all about and think that someone is telling you the process ( which is there in theory). Once you get whole meaning think that someone is there in front of you and explain the process, by this your doubts will be clear. After words explain the process to others. If you have problem with understanding the theory then clear the doubt by asking someone. Without understanding you can\u2019t learn it. One more thing is imagination.. You should imagine that whatever you are reading you are watching that\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "While studying theory, always try to understand what the theory is trying to say. Consider it to be one of your friends, and what the theory explains is what your friend is trying to say. Now, try to understand it. Once you think you have understood the theory, explain it to someone like a friend or someone from your family in your own language. If you can explain it in the most elegant way that you can think of, you have understood your theory. \u201cIf you can't explain it, you simply haven't understood it well.\u201d After this simply go through it time and again.
