            "answer_text": "This is tough to say, as my own observations and experimentations were greatly influenced by the things I had been previously taught (told or shown by others). Does reading a book on my own count as being \"simply taught or told\"? I learned a great deal on my own after my formal education. I can say I have learned much more over the years on my own as I sought out information, people, and experiences that could help me in areas in which I became interested. All along the way I synthesized my own knowledge as I began to fit pieces together in ways that no one explained to me. In that way, much of my knowledge is \"mine\" even though I was taught and told by many who came before me. I do not submit to the rigidity of the so-called \"scientific method.\" That is a simplistic construct of how a narrow range of scientific work is done. A great deal of \"science\" is done in the mind and in conversations with others. Many discoveries were due to serendipity and minds that were open to see what no one had seen before. Some science is observational in nature, and with no experimentation. That one must have an hypothesis before one begins to explore is mistaken. So is the notion that one must generate \"data\" in a particular quantitative format. ",
