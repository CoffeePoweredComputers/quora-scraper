            "answer_text": "Jesus alludes to Adam and Eve only indirectly. In the major reference found in the gospels Jesus takes Genesis 1:27 (So God created mankind \u2026 male and female he created them) and the institution of marriage in Genesis 2:24 (That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh) and then describes divorce as a concession to the hardness of the \u201cyour hearts\u201d. \u201cHaven\u2019t you read,\u201d he replied, \u201cthat at the beginning the Creator \u2018made them male and female,\u2019 and said, \u2018For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh\u2019? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God hasjoined together, let no one separate.\u201d (Mt 19:4-6) Jesus replied.\u201cBut at the beginning of creation God \u2018made them male and female.\u2019\u2018For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,and the two will become one flesh.\u2019 So they are no longer two, but one flesh.Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.\u201d (Mk 10:6-9) One need not believe in a historical Adam and Eve to believe that God ordained marriage between a man and a woman, or that this was part of his plan for creation from the beginning. One also need not believe in a historical Adam and Eve to use Genesis to teach about marriage. Dr. C. John (Jack) Collins has written a book Did Adam and Eve Really Exist?: Who They Were and Why You Should Care that makes an argument for the historicity of Adam and Eve in some real sense. When he considers the evidence in the gospels (pp. 76-78) Collins also points out that the major allusion to Adam and Eve is really a statement about marriage. He takes this one step further, though, and suggests that the fact that the law in Deuteronomy 24:1-4 allows divorce is because something changed after the beginning when God instituted marriage. This leads him to Genesis 3: \u201cThe obvious candidate for making that change \u2013 indeed the only one \u2013 is the sin of Adam and Eve, with its consequences for all human beings.\u201d (p. 77) Thus, it appears that Collins\u2019s main reason for thinking that Mt 19 and Mk 10 point to the historicity of Adam and Eve is because he reads in this passage a reference to the Fall. The other possible references to Adam and Eve in the gospels are slim indeed. Collins notes that Jesus makes a passing reference to Abel (Mt 23:35 and Lk 11:51) \u2013 but \u201csince this is just in passing we need not make much of it.\u201d There is also, perhaps, a passing reference to the serpent and Genesis 3 in John 8:44: \u201cYou belong to your father, the devil, \u2026 He was amurderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him.\u201d Collins thinks that the phrase \u201cmurderer from the beginning\u201d is an allusion to the serpent in Genesis 3. This is the extent of the evidence we have concerning Adam and Eve from recorded words of Jesus. (The genealogy in Luke 3 goes back to Adam, but this is not part of Jesus\u2019s teaching.) http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2013/06/04/jesus-on-adam-and-eve-rjs/ ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cBy nature, before the rebirth of the spirit, mortal man is subject to inherent evil tendencies, but such natural imperfections of behavior are neither sin nor iniquity. Mortal man is just beginning his long ascent to the perfection of the Father in Paradise. To be imperfect or partial in natural endowment is not sinful. Man is indeed subject to evil, but he is in no sense the child of the evil one unless he has knowingly and deliberately chosen the paths of sin and the life of iniquity. Evil is inherent in the natural order of this world, but sin is an attitude of conscious rebellion which was brought to this world by those who fell from spiritual light into gross darkness. \u201cYou are confused, Thomas, by the doctrines of the Greeks and the errors of the Persians. You do not understand the relationships of evil and sin because you view mankind as beginning on earth with a perfect Adam and rapidly degenerating, through sin, to man\u2019s present deplorable estate. But why do you refuse to comprehend the meaning of the record which discloses how Cain, the son of Adam, went over into the land of Nod and there got himself a wife? And why do you refuse to interpret the meaning of the record which portrays the sons of God finding wives for themselves among the daughters of men? \u201cMen are, indeed, by nature evil, but not necessarily sinful. The new birth \u2014 the baptism of the spirit \u2014 is essential to deliverance from evil and necessary for entrance into the kingdom of heaven, but none of this detracts from the fact that man is the son of God. Neither does this inherent presence of potential evil mean that man is in some mysterious way estranged from the Father in heaven so that, as an alien, foreigner, or stepchild, he must in some manner seek for legal adoption by the Father. All such notions are born, first, of your misunderstanding of the Father and, second, of your ignorance of the origin, nature, and destiny of man. From the Book www.jesusonians.com ",

            "answer_text": "When I saw this question, I initially thought that Jesus must have mentioned him at some point, but doing a bible search it appears He didn't (at least in recorded scripture).  As Christian points out, Adam was mentioned in a chronology and then several times in the epistles. To me, I don't believe it's theologically significant just a \"weird but true\" thing.  Jesus clearly looked at Genesis as authoritative.  In his argument about divorce He quotes Genesis 2 (\"A man shall leave his father and mother...\") which is the first chapter on the account of Adam and Eve. Further as I alluded to earlier, not everything Jesus said was recorded in scripture.  So I think it's highly likely Adam was a topic of discussion multiple times in His ministry.  (John 21:25). ",
