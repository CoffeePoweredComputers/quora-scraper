            "answer_text": "THANKS FOR A2A!! You must have seen and appreciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow. The prism probably split the incident white light into a band of colours. Note the colours that appear at the two ends of the colour band. The various colours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Red, as shown in Fig. 11.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help you to remember the sequence of colours. The band of the coloured components of a light beam is called its spectrum. You might not be able to see all the colours separately. Yet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting of light into its component colours is called dispersion.  Figure:Dispersion of white light by the glass prism  Figure:Different splitting angles of different colours. You have seen that white light is dispersed into its seven-colour components by a prism. Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the incident ray, as they pass through a prism. The red light bends the least while the violet the most. Thus the rays of each colour emerge along different paths and thus become distinct. It is the band of distinct colours that we see in a spectrum. Isaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain the spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of the spectrum of white light further by using another similar prism. However, he could not get any more colours. He then placed a second identical prism in an inverted position with respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 11.6.  Figure:Recombination of the spectrum of white light This allowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through the second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging from the other side of the second prism. This observation gave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven colours. Any light that gives a spectrum similar to that of sunlight is often referred to as white light.  Rainbow in the sky GOOD LUCK!! THANKU!! ",
