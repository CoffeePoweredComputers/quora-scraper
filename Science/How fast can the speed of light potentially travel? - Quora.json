            "answer_text": "The speed of light is always the same, it IS the speed of light.It is approximately 300000 km/s. But this speed is effectively reached only in vacuum. In other materials as you mention it is lower. There isn't any magic happening, the reasoning is simpler.In vacuum there are no objects in which photons (particles of light) can bump into hence they move forward at 300000 km/s.  In an actual material photons bounce off atoms which makes them change their path, a bit to the left, bit to the right, hence you get an EFFECTIVE SPEED FORWARD less than 300000 km/s. However the photons still move at 300000 km/s but the sum of all the motions forward is less than that. Hence light ALWAYS moves at the speed of light, no faster no slower. ",

            "answer_text": "No. It isn't really the speed of light. After all, light doesn't always travel at c. Better to think of c as the speed of causality, the maximum rate at which a signal from one event could influence other events. If causality is rigidly respected, then c provides a hard upper limit on everything. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope.  The speed of light is the speed of causality, how quickly things in place A can influence de things in place B, the fastest speed there is, and it's not unique to light. Gravity waves travel at c, for example.  Light does slow down in other substances, sure, but...not really. Think of light in the sun. Photons created at the core spend a very long time bouncing around before they reach the surface and zoom over to us in only eight minutes.  But, all those years they're sluggishly moving through the sun, they're still at c.  They're just taking a tremendously long path, getting absorbed and re emitted, but still always at c. light actually travels ONLY at c.  ",
