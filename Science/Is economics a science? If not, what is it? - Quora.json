            "answer_text": "Economics is a pseudoscience.  It elects not to be a science but then toys with the appearance of being a science.    For example, you have the Austrian School essentially trying to duplicate in economics the kind of logical systematization Bertrand Russell and Alfred Lord Whitehead were attempting to do for mathematics in Principia Mathematica.  Well and good except the Austrian School's initial precepts aren't as clearly thought out or as fundamental as in the Principia (which takes more than one and a half thick volumes to justify 1+1=2) and are riddled with unacknowledged value judgments.  And they ignore that Kurt Goedel's incompleteness theorem demonstrates that such a program is doomed to failure in any case. Are Austrian School economists who have earned Ph.D.s in economics not doing economics? The Austrian School's precepts underlie supply side economics, another fringe school of thought that most main stream economists deride because its \"proofs\" never hold water on close examination.  Nonetheless the Republican Party surely buys into its reduce-taxation-as-much-as-possible philosophy.  Supply side economics is ludicrous when measured against reality but still it persists as an economic doctrine.  If you read the newspapers or listen to Republican arguments, you'd think that supply side economics was perfectly respectable intellectually. There are Ph.D. level economists still chugging away at supply side arguments.  Are they not doing economics? How about monetarism, perhaps the reigning school of economic thought given its influence on academic research and in government policy.  Ever play with a Rubik's Cube?  You get one side right, then two, maybe, even three.  (Getting four right is about as difficult as getting all six right and getting only five right is impossible.)  Three sides correct.  Have you nearly solved it?     Getting three sides of a Rubik's Cube right and saying you are so close to solving the cube is like monetarists telling us they can near perfectly explain the past while consistently failing to adequately predict the future.  They have half the cube right so they must be so-o-o close, right? Except if you play with the cube you soon realize that getting three sides right is not appreciably closer to solving the cube than having every side in seeming disarray.  Proof?  Get a Rubik's cube and twist it ten times in whatever direction you please.  Look at the mess you've made of the cube.  Yet you are only ten turns away from solving it again, right?  Just undo what you did to the cube in reverse order.  But if you have three faces of the cube all one color, you are more than ten twists away from solving the cube.   Actually, it's even worse than that.  Monetarism is about the supply of money, so think what money is.  Take a minute and explain money to yourself in 25 words or less.  I think you will quickly see the problem.  Depending on how you define money, what constitutes money changes.  So people who measure money supply do so in terms of M(0), M(1), M(2), and M(3).  M(0) is the most conservative definition of money, M(3) the most expansive.  Almost all monetarists work in terms of M(0).  Virtually none work in terms of M(2) or M(3) because as a practical matter those numbers are impossible to evaluate. This last bubble, the housing crisis of 2008?  That particular crisis was caused by trading in derivatives, making it essentially a crisis in M(3).  Problems in M(1), M(2), and M(3) are essentially beyond the purvey of monetarism.  The monetarists who say they can almost perfectly explain past economic activity always explain it in terms of M(0).  Does that mean before 2008 there was never a crisis created in M(1), M(2), or M(3)?  And if it doesn't, how is it possible  those monetarists so perfectly explain the past?     A few years ago the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics was awarded for demonstrating concepts of thermodynamics apply to economic systems.  I'm sure economists were grateful because, gee, how could economics not be a science if the concepts of thermodynamics apply to it, right?   Thermodynamics.  Temperature, enthalpy, entropy.  Turn it upside down and what do you get?  Statistical mechanics.  Thermodynamics starts with huge quantities of phenomena and measures bulk properties like the aforementioned temperature.  Statistical mechanics starts with small numbers and extrapolates up to bulk properties.  They end up at the same place approaching from different directions.  If one builds up to thermodynamics from statistical dynamics, it is pretty clear probability underlies all thermodynamic properties. If thermodynamics works in economics, probability plays a bigger factor in economics than almost any economist gives credit, certainly more than an adherent to the Austrian School or a strict monetarist would.  In fact, running away from probabilistic models is what carried so many Keynesians to monetarism in the seventies and eighties in the first place. But there is a bigger problem here: probability is about distributions.  If thermodynamics and probability are important to economics being a science, then distribution is important to economics being a science.  Why then does economics make it clear that distribution is not a part of what economics is about?  If economics is a science it must in part be about distribution.  But as any economist will religiously recite, economics does not include distribution. If economics were a science, it would. Many economists, perhaps most, are involved in econometrics, which has its own problems quite beyond foundational, using mathematical technique to substitute for insight.  Think, for example, of Herbert Stein and his curve-fitting embarrassment. Mathematics is the language of science and economics bristles with mathematics.  But mathematics doesn't in and of itself make economics a science.  The problem is too often that the mathematics may be invested with meaning and emotional values beyond which it can reasonably bear.   If you go back to that last paragraph and substitute the word \"astrology\" for the word \"economics\" at every instance, you would see how much economics and astrology have in common.  Is astrology a science? If you go outside your house on a summer's day and drop a hard rubber ball from shoulder height onto a concrete surface, any physicist would tell you the ball would bounce.  If we did a similar thing in terms of economic theory, one economist would say yes, the ball would bounce, another might claim the ball would stop dead as soon as it hit the cement, a third would say the ball might not fall at all, it might simply drift away on the breeze.  Most economists would start by saying, \"On the one hand...\" Moreover, there are serious and deep problems in falsifiability in economics as it is practiced that are seldom acknowledged and never addressed.  I can certainly understand in this day and age the desire to regard economics as a science.  I can certainly understand the knee-jerk tendency to defend it as a science.  But economics as practiced and taught today is more like alchemy than chemistry. Economics is at once the most mathematical and least scientific of the social sciences--that is, unless you are counting astrology as a social science.  What I think economics most closely resembles is alchemy.  Some alchemists were clearly doing science.  Some clearly were not.  I think that is also true of economics: some economists do science, most pursue programs defined by adherence to schools of thought which are necessarily flawed and do not. And don't minimize economics refusal to consider distribution.  In a science where the laws of thermodynamics apply, doctrinally refusing to consider distribution is like trying to predict the weather without considering the effects of wind.   Can you do it?  Well, sporadically, yes.  And with caveats (on the one hand...), even more.  But is it then a science?  Is it scientific to prohibit consideration of a clearly pertinent perameter? The practitioners of economics at once eschew the practice of science but claim its mantle.  Saying economics is science because it involves a lot of mathematics is like saying a phone book is literature because it uses a lot of words. I wish economics were a science.  It would benefit us all.  But it yet is not and I can't see it becoming a science any time soon. ",

I entered physics because if you have some misunderstanding of the problem, lab apparatus, whatever \u2014 you will usually find out FAST. There is a quick-learning curve in physics. If your ego cannot handle SHARP DIRECT REFUTATION of your ideas, biases and pre-misconceptions \u2014 my advice is to stay away from physics. A lot of people say physics is \u201chard science\u201d \u2014 when what they mean is that physics is personally challenging for them. In fact, physics is the easiest science. People say biosciences are \u201csoft science\u201d \u2014 when what they mean is you can usually muddle your way through even if you don\u2019t know completely what is going on. In point of fact, it is tremendously difficult to do quality bioscience. Thus, we have need for the Cochrane Standards which try to filter a few gems from the mountain of coal.  Economics is yet again more difficult \u2014 because it can be extremely hard to falsify bad ideas. Thus \u2014 It is possible for a reasonably bright economist to be *wrong* \u2014 and go his/her entire career without ever knowing it. There do exist good economists, however, doing good research. Look at the Nobel Prize Winners or Thomas Piketty. If you actually read their work \u2014 you will find that it is complex, mathematical, and not easily-accessible to the layperson. Sadly, the noise generated by politically-motivated pseudo-economists drowns out the good work done by these few. The public forum is just jamming with muddle-headed \u201ceconomists\u201d who can very successfully cloud any issue \u2014 without making any effort to find their own mistakes -nor- taking seriously the efforts of others to do so for them. As an example, \u201cTrickle-down Economics\u201d \u2014 a truly wrong misconception that, through clever marketing to the uneducated, has won over the entire Republican branch of the american electorate.  Now the question I have is two-fold: Why is it that almost every layperson understands that they don\u2019t have the education to argue with me about physics \u2014 the easiest of all sciences?? But! \u2014 They think they understand the hardest of all sciences, economics, well enough to argue with anybody?? It is this kind of *lunacy* which is the true background for this question.  *PS \u2014 And then the lunatics go out and vote. God help us. . ",

            "answer_text": "I think the easiest way to answer this question is not to attempt to define science (which is really really hard) and then show that economics fits that definition, but to attempt to construct a definition of science that excludes only economics while keeping other sciences as 'science'. I think any such attempt will fail. As a simple example, many people seem to think that science necessarily involves experiments. It's easy to see that as a historical matter, this is false. The earliest science was done by astronomers, like Kepler, who, of course, could run no experiments on the stars, but instead just worked to keep really accurate measurements of where the stars and planets were at particular times. The idea that Copernicus/Galileo/Kepler weren't doing science when they just recorded planetary positions is laughable: their theories about the planets are, of course, at the base of the entire scientific tradition. Further, even today there are sciences (astronomy, geology, meteorology, ecology) where most of the most important hypotheses are not amenable to experiments. The Nobel Prize for Physics just went to the folks who first noticed that the Universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. This was done purely using observational (non-experimental) data. Similarly, many folks seem to think that economics isn't a science because many of its practitioners are blinded by political ideology. But, of course, scientists in all fields are blinded by personal preferences, sometimes including political ideology when their research touches on ideological topics. Another example: some claim that economists often derive things from first principles as though they were studying math rather than carrying out empirical investigations. But fields that include both individuals doing empirical work and other individuals doing thinking from first principles are common. Evolutionary biologists often use game theory to make predictive theories. Einstein imagined himself inside a beam of light in order to come up with theories of relativity and never did run any experiments to prove his theory, etc. etc. Healthy fields have theoreticians as well as applied researchers. Some suggest that economics cannot be a science because it has normative components. Actually, economists work very hard to separate the normative and positive parts of economics, with only the latter considered to be the major object of study. Unless what is meant is that all sciences smuggle in normative assumptions, in which case that's a criticism of science, not a demarcation criterion for what counts as science. Others think economics is not a science because it relies on poor assumptions, like rational behavior. There are two obvious responses: 1) economists working in areas that don't make assumptions about rational behavior are now extremely common with the rise of behavioral economics, institutional economics, etc. and 2) this confuses whether economics as a field is a science and whether economics right now is any good. Imagine declaring that Galileo was not a scientist because his theories had low predictive power! They did, indeed have low predictive power, but that's because physics and astronomy were young sciences, not because they were unscientific! To sum up: a lot of times, people mentally equate 'science' and 'physics' as though experimental physics were THE perfect, paradigmatic science. Once you've made that mistake, it's easy to argue that economics isn't scientific: it's not particularly like physics! But in fact, science is just hugely diverse, and it's very difficult to explain why economists are non-scientific if folks in fields like astronomy and evolutionary biology are in fact paradigmatically scientific.

            "answer_text": "Economics is not a science. But often matematicians come to analyze some data so you could say tat economists require scientists for some complicated analysis. Idk. why economy exists as a discipline at all. It should just be a sub part of mathematics/statistics. It would assure more competent people. My opinion is that economy is purposefully propagated as a study material, to put not so smart people into powerful positions. It\u2019s easier to control stupid people, but some basic communication skills are still required. So, a person must become a so called fah idiot or useful idiot. Smart enough to learn how to be pretentious about it, but dumb enough to never realize it\u2019s pretty useless. It\u2019s easily done with terminology. When people learn new terminology, they feel empowered. It\u2019s not necessary to actually understand it to feel smart while talking. It\u2019s like spending 3\u20135 years studying parmacy, only to work 40 years as a clerk in drug store, most likely destroying people\u2019s lives\u2026 Economics is to math what pharmacy is to chemistry. An unnecessary course of complicated nonsense just to prepare you to work in most irrelevant part of that field. To qualify, you don\u2019t need to be smart but you do need to be extremely diligent and submissive to authority. As your future job will be imposing authority, you need to be properly screened for any revolutionary ideas by our system of bored fascism. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Yes. A popular view in epistemology is that a field of study is a science if it makes \"falsifiable\" claims. A claim is falsifiable if we can use it to make concrete predictions about the world, and then observe the result of those predictions. The classic example of a falsifiable theory is the theory of gravity: it claims -- among other things -- that if we hold an object in the air near the Earth's surface and drop it in a vacuum, it will fall with an acceleration of roughly 9.8 m/s^2. We can pick up objects, drop them and measure their acceleration as they fall. Every time we do so and fail to observe a contradiction of the claim, it strengthens our trust in the theory. If, however, we find that objects stop falling at the predicted acceleration, then we have to hold the theory -- or its assumptions -- in doubt. Economics makes falsifiable claims about the world, although it's often difficult to find \"natural experiments\" where only one economic variable changes at a time. For instance, economics predicts that -- all other things being equal -- a rise in the minimum wage will lead to a rise in unemployment. If we could visit an island and, keeping all other things equal, raise the minimum wage, we could check whether unemployment went up or down as a result, so the claim is technically falsifiable. Economists can't conduct such experiments, however, so they have to wait for situations like that, or close to that, to happen naturally and then use statistical techniques to unravel the effects of the wage hike. Other examples of falsifiable claims from economics include: Increasing the money supply will increase inflation.Raising the price of a normal good will cause the quantity consumed to decrease.Capping rents will decrease the quantity of rental housing available.We can, in theory at least, construct experiments in which we can observe whether or not these claims are contradicted by reality.

            "answer_text": "I will be provocative and argue that economics is not a science. One of the fundamental premises of classical economics is that humans are economically rational, implying they will behave in a similar manner if the environment is similar. Clearly, this is a false assumption as demonstrated by Tversky and Kahneman with their Prospect Theory. Human behavior is not only irrational in many cases related to economic utility, but is highly variable. Even the great Economist, John Maynard Keynes, believed human economic behavior was driven by \"animal spirits.\" How do you model animal spirits? The great Yale Economist, Irving Fisher, and the manager of it's investment fund said just before the stock market crash and subsequent Great Depression, \"Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau. I do not feel there will be soon if ever a 50 or 60 point break from present levels, such as (bears) have predicted. I expect to see the stock market a good deal higher within a few months.\" In the more recent crisis, the longest serving Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated in a Congressional testimony (see reference link below), \"I have found a flaw,\" said Greenspan, referring to his economic philosophy. \"I don't know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact. I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests of organisations, specifically banks and others, were such that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms.\" With conclusions like that it's no wonder the everyday person has limited confidence in the long term predictive ability of economics. When I think of a science like either Physics or Chemistry, the assumption is  nature behaves rationally predictable and if I can control the environment, I will get predictable results. I seriously doubt economcis has demonstrated repeatibility. Heck, today we get arguments between different distinguished economists whether we should continue with more Keynesian stimulus and at the same time other distinguished economists argue for a completely opposite approach. Once a theory gets established in physics, other physicist continue fitting their experimental results to the established theory. Only when new experiments violate the established theory do they proceed to a new hypothesis. If economics is a science, then it is a confused science. Maybe a better term might be a chaotic science in the mathematical sense, since there are so many interdependent parts and many people would argue that human behavior is non-linear. Those who have studied emergent behavior and chaos know that only short term predictability is possible and only a fool would try to predict longer term behavior, given the current mathematical limitations, and understanding of human behavior.

I believe an appropriate 21st Century phrase for economics might be the \"delusional science,\" given that it empowers its adherents with an illusion of knowledge. http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/print/278758  As a final update I found the recent Barron's magazine article (see link below) enlightening and entertaining. http://online.barrons.com/articles/a-slippery-course-of-study-1428114145 ",

            "answer_text": "No. This is the thing nobody tells you at school or in your economics course at university. Economists like to create models, write big formulas and deal with curves and numbers that somehow \u201cprove\u201d to you that their outcomes are true. Numbers, numbers, numbers. It\u2019s called physics envy. Quantitative masturbation. I had to do this for 6 years. Masturbation, because it\u2019s not the real thing. As a youngster, you soak up everything those profs teach you as sacred words, but with the benefit of distance, and with a bit of wit, you will eventually discover that behind those assumptions and models, there is often just an opinion. In reality, economists are often ideologues. They make half-right assumptions, create arbitrary models and scenarios. However, these assumptions are often so isolated from the real world and artificially based on 10% of the world\u2019s societies that often, the resulting models are a grotesque carricature of reality. What is more: they have been proven wrong so many times that you wonder why they are still being taught. To be perfectly frank with you: economists are not the cleverest people, and you will not encounted the level of intelligence you see in pure maths or physics courses. When I was a third year BA student, we had this very slick Jewish professor from NYU whose head was stuck in Milton Friedman\u2019s arse. His course could have been renamed \u201cneoliberal predator capitalism 101\u201d. You can see his lectures online, he is quite famous. In class, I frequently disagreed with him, but he would make fun of me. He had a religious belief in the invisible hand, which is what today\u2019s econ students and profs jerk off to. I remember I asked him once: what happens if there is war? What happens if oligarchs want to reach power? What if they succeed and influence things? What happens if in your country, you have to fight Islamism? What if you\u2019re a theocracy? What if you\u2019re permanently attacked and it\u2019s not really in your control? What economic model can possibly make predictions under such conditions? His answer was always: the invisible hand. Then I asked him, what happens if wealth does not get redistributed? What happens if the government and the institution of \u201cstate\u201d becomes too weak to regulate the economy? What happens if certain individuals inherit wealth to such a degree that they control vast sections of the economy? I was, in a nutshell, asking how these economic models which they are teaching from New York to Dubai nowadays account for the POLITICAL reality of this world? He made fun of me and his answer was \u2014 well, guess what? And that was one of the celebrated professors back then. In 2014, the French economist Thomas Piketty released his widely acclaimed book \u201cCapital in the 21st century\u201d, were he \u2014 in a nutshell \u2014 criticised more or less the exact same things that I criticised as a BA student (link between wealth and power to influence the economy). And he was praised all over the world. Throughout my BA and MA, I leaned back and laughed my arse off. The other students, how they were trying so hard to excel and argued with some \u201cmodels\u201d, but had no idea how countries really make money in this world. And the math was so easy compared to anything you would do in a real science course (I had taken courses in pure mathematics before). But they had no idea that they were being indoctrinated. They had no clue how the world really works, because they BELIEVED what they were taught was objective fact. In case you wonder, I ended up as the top student with that professor. At the exam (which consisted of a series of problem solving cases in essay form), I just imagined I am the meanest sub-human cunt without a conscience and based my proposals on that assumption. A+ . I even ended up getting scholarships to do a couple of month of research at some of the best schools. What I found funny was how easy those folks were to impress if you just knew how to talk. Very little substance. Why? Because two economists can give you two totally different models that both yield \u201ccorrect\u201d results. Here\u2019s what economists do: they take a very trivial conclusion, garnish it with numbers and formulas to make themselves sound serious and scare you. Here\u2019s how you can beat most of them: just ignore the cosmetics and ask questions about what you see in the world. Don\u2019t give up or be intimidated by jargon and set phrases. You would be surprised how little substance they have to offer under scrunity. They are mostly people who look at the world from a single perspective: utility (measured in money). And most of the famous ones are bought. I believe that it is time we call economics what it is: a useful and sometimes very insightful method, but not a science. It is simply too detached from the complexity of reality and much too unreliable and arbitrary to be called a science. ",

            "answer_text": "Ah, an excellent question. There is much literature to be read on the topic, and I personally like Mankiw's view that economists can be both scientists and \"engineers.\" First, we must accept that if economics is a science, it is a social science. That means that the hard-and-fast laws of physics and chemistry will almost never be found in economics. However, if we define \"science\" as the systematic study of the world around us, in which we draw conclusions based on our observations, then economics is certainly a science. That is exactly what economists do. They collect data, run some analyses, and try to draw conclusions. Of course, some economists specialize in theoretical model building as opposed to data analysis, but this practice is being replaced more and more by data work. Now, why do economists fight so much? I think that that is a very interesting question with several dimensions of answers. First, as Paul Krugman has said, while economics is a science, economists often do not behave like scientists. The objectivity of the economist is often compromised because of his political or moral beliefs. If you're a strong liberal, you're more likely to dismiss a study that shows that taxing the rich slows economic growth. If you're a strong conservative, you're likely to scoff at studies that show that Obamacare has decreased the rate of the uninsured.  It's not really surprising that economists fight more than the natural scientists. Does the discovery of a new biochemical process speak to your moral and political world-view, the values that you were probably raised on since birth? It's unlikely, so biochemists don't have as much of a reason to fight because they can be much more objective. Does the discovery that debt levels upwards of 100% of gdp have no affect on economic growth speak to your moral and political world-view, the values that you were probably raised on since birth? It's very likely, so a lot of objectivity is lost. Also, the social sciences are so complex that when you want to explain changes in variables, so many factors affect those variables that it's difficult to say with certainty what causes those changes.

            "answer_text": "No. Economics is a narrative, a backstory much in the tradition of religion, designed to help us make sense of the world but in a contemporary medium.  Unlike the traditional \"hard sciences\", economics is the study of human behaviour and therefore on the fringes of social science.  Efforts to legitimise economics as a science have brought us to the brink of disaster in the real, scientifcally meaasurable world.   This is dangerous nonsense and needs to be stopped. To understand the relationship between the theory of econmcs and contemporary reality it is useful to look at the different economic ideas and the times that spawned them.  When one looks for it, it is simple to see that the economic zeitgeist exactly  matches and justifies the current methods used to create wealth (\"power\").  Thus, the Physiocrats saw land as the source of wealth because Aristocrats were the power, Adam Smith saw the division of labour and the marketplace as he source becasue the of the emerging industrialists, Keynes saw Government as a key actor becasue of the emergence of political-corporatism, and the advanced mathematical and statistical sciences were used to justify the bundling of securitsed mortgages when the big international corporate money really got going in the 1980s. Economics is INEXTRICABLY mixed up with political ideology, and that is why the economists will always be in disagreement between themselves, there are simply too many conflicting ideas about the world out there. No, No, No, economics is NOT a science, it is a storytelling forum normally (but not always) directed to the end of defending whatever power structure is in place at the time. ",

It is a Trojan horse sneaking in Oligarchic Economists\u2019 Ideologies through the Gates of human Self-indulgence:  Debunking Economics.  Economics is the study of oligarchic shaped economy \u2018shaped and made\u2019 through artificial scarcity.All economic activity is artificially created through willfully creating a shortage of goods and services that humans want, rather than need. http://www.quora.com.   Economic globalization is a massive expansion of this same activity but through the power of big businesses and banking. It allows plundering the state to the benefit of its oligarchs. www.who.int/trade/glossary/story.    A deep-seated principle guiding life on earth is scarcity Academia.edu - Share research. Everyone wants the\u2018best\u2019 for oneself but there is just not enough for everyone who \u2018wants\u2019 whatever it is one wants rather than needs. Today there is not enough housing, food,clothing or medical care for everyone who needs it. Therefore economy works by balancing many oligarchic groups, each with its own agenda for profit. Rules are put into place for personal gain at the expense of the governed for self-enrichment (autocratic kleptocracy) and rule of many by a few (oligarchic kleptocracy). Both are both kleptocracies. What then went wrong with the most successful political idea of the 20th century: Democracy? World News, Politics, Economics, Business & Finance/  Democracy as an idea goes back to Athens before the Roman conquest. The US started using it in the 18th century. Then, what killed democracy? Lack of education in the postwar ignorant citizens: they allowed themselves to be ruled by Kleptic Rulers. Teach people to think and interact with reality or else become victims of \u201causterity\" which is a fun word for \"if poor people pay for it then I won't have to.\"The Roman Republic [ushistory.org]    Throughout history there were people who got what they wanted by force. In modern times it is practiced by educated pickpockets who call themselves economists. Economics in One Lesson written by Henry Hazlitt misses.org and first published in 1946 was based on essay: (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ricBastiat's wikipedia \"What is Seen and What is Not Seen \"). It states the art of economics is the looking at the immediate and longer effectsof any an act of policy not only for one group but for all groups.     Policy recommendations come as advocacy of free trade http://www.trade.gov/manufacturing council, opposition to price controls, opposition to monetary inflation, and opposition to stimulative governmental spending. Brilliant economists are known to deprecate saving and recommend squandering on a national scale as the way of economic salvation.  \u201cIf you care about the future of this country ,arm yourself with knowledge and fight back against economic ignorance. We neglect economics and history at our own danger.\u201d www.ronpaul.com   The Bulgarian center-right political party GERB(to mean \u201ccoat of arms\") is not unique. Their experience in Bulgaria highlights their disillusionment after joining the European Union.Portugal, Spain and Italy have also stated their priorities are fighting crime and corruption, economically being able to preserve family as the cornerstone of society and achieving liveliness independence: http://facta.junis.ni.rs/pas/    Economies of Markets are possible through lassoing in assets by hiring cheap labor, grabbing farmland from the poor and prohibitive bank finances http://www.quora.com. Corporations control supply of finished products(Goods and Services) to households. Such economic models explain how movement of money, goods and services, is the cause of producing artificial self-serving economies seconded by kleptic economists. http://economics.about.com/od/edu.   The Democratic way is through co-operative activity for a Common Good for all citizens; not through corporations for a few.

Then they build an intellectual edifice using this foundation of sand.  Everyone looks up admiring the perfect towering edifice oblivious to the sand of flawed assumptions below. Economics is empirical, not reproducible, not testable, etc ...  It fails to honor to absolute rigors of the Scientific method.  It uses people which are by definition unique and changeable.  Even the same people over time change and hence their behavior will to.   Behavioral economics attempts to address these flawed assumptions.  Behavioral economics at least recognizes the fallacy of classical economics. Well when I went to school, I took a few economics courses instead of literature courses to satisfy my humanities requirements.  It was a great life changing event.  It became apparent why economics resides in the humanities department because it is not a \"hard\" science per se, maybe best case a \"soft\" science, Hard and soft science. So despite the ignorant claims of others economics is and will never be a hard science.  I consider economics to a be a soft pseudo science in the kindest light.  Economics  is very useful because the real world is filled with humans, goods and services.  You just have to remember it is complex, error prone,  fallible and subjective. There is no greater fool than an economist overstating his \"facts\" and \"theories\" with mountains of \"evidence\" and \"proof\".  Unfortunately many economists are just pawns of a powerful elite promoting an ideological agenda.  These economists are not doing research as they already have a predetermined result in mind.  They collect subjective data to make their case.  Just as Hitler used scientists to promote racial purity. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a science in intent but not in practicable pursuit. that is, as with any science, the intent is to attempt to ascertain and understanding of order from chaos - to ascertain the laws of nature governing the processes of nature. The problem is that it is generally not rigorously falsifiable. That is, you cannot in general test a hypothesis to the point of falsifying (invalidating) it. To be scientifically rigorous, would require a duplicate identical earth (or at identical economy) with which a single parameter can be uniquely altered so as to observe the difference in result. In this way, on can attribute any difference in observation uniquely to that parameter. But, since this is not possible to so validate as with the \u201chard sciences\u201d (which is why they are called \u201chard sciences\u201d) it is often referred to as a \u201csoft science\u201d. The further problem is that people will try to dismiss the conclusions of the science of economics they don\u2019t like because of that. Just because it cannot be rigorously tested, don\u2019t prove it is wrong. For example, people will claim that the economic limitations implied by principles of market supply and demand pricing are just \u201cphilosophy\u201d means you can just disregard them at will anytime they obstruct something you would like to believe to be true. Well, there are some things that have been so thoroughly studied and analysed, both logically and observationally, that they are held to be as incontrovertibly valid (until proven otherwise) the same as any other law of nature. Principles of market supply and demand pricing are held to be a correct predictor of observational outcomes. The principle of market supply and demand pricing is often dismissed with a false hand-waving such as \u201cwell, we didn\u2019t observe exactly the outcome predicted in instance X\u201d. But there are two problems here. One is, well, therein lies the problem - since you can\u2019t restrict or limit changes to a single parameter, you also cannot claim a failure to observe some exact outcome as proof that principles of market supply and demand don\u2019t hold or didn\u2019t hold. They may have been (and is likely the case) that there were also other countervailing factors present. A simple illustration is a plane in flight. Does that somehow prove that gravity doesn\u2019t always apply because the plane didn\u2019t fall from the sky? No. gravity still applies to that airplane, it is just that there is also a force of lift that acts in opposition to gravity. If that countervailing force were to be removed, if the wings fall off or the helicopter blades stop spinning, we all know what the outcome will be as predicted by gravity. And that\u2019s also a useful illustration. Gravity ultimately wins when you can no longer generate lift. Similarly, supply and demand ultimately wins when you run out of whatever it is that is seemingly causing supply and demand to not apply. Another example I like to illustrate this common fallacy: fill a sink half-way. Now, open the drain and turn on the faucet at the same time. What will happen? Well, the sink will probably empty (unless the drain is clogged). Does that somehow mean that the faucet doesn\u2019t fill the sink or that the faucet even causes the sink to drain? Of course not. It\u2019s just that the action of the drain more than offsets the effect of the faucet. And if an objective is to drain the sink, does that mean that we should turn on the faucet to obtain that outcome, or that turning on the faucet is not counterproductive to obtaining that outcome? No, of course not. But there are those who will try to make such an argument in matters of economics. Just because we cannot rigorously test the theory, doesn't mean that we can\u2019t know the effects and consequences. Even though we cannot perform the follow test in economics doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t know with near certitude the answer: if we could time two different cases - one with the faucet on and one with the faucet off - will there be no difference in times or will there be a difference and in which way? So which one is closer to science and which is further from science: to claim that the faucet will adversely slow the desired draining process as opposed to a faster draining time without the faucet on; or to claim we should go ahead and open the faucet too, because obviously, having the faucet on doesn\u2019t keep the sink from draining and therefore has no adverse effects on draining the sink.

There is a TON of data, but it doesn't fit into usual models. The main problem is that the politics in this field is broken in the usual way, and hasn't been fixed by Galileo style honesty, as in other fields of science. There are people who will say bullshit, and then get a ton of money from rich people to repeat this bullshit in think tanks. To make an honest economic literature requires a commitment to no-holds-barred honesty. This is made possible through online criticism of text, because it is impossible to do fraudulent work and not get called out on it on a site like this. For an example, Debangshu Mukharjee's comment on my answer to this question What do physics majors think of math majors, other science majors, and humanities majors? pointed out that Ken Rogoff's paper on debt and growth has fabricated data, and false conclusion, but is still politically propped up by idiots. This is the kind of thing you cannot tolerate if you wish to make economics a science. The other thing which would help is permission to conduct monetary experiments in counties, by allowing a certain amount of money multiplication locally, for example, by allowing everyone in Syracure NY to get an extra 1% interest on their bank account, for no reason other than to trace the perturbation in purchases. The same thing with slightly fluctuating prices at online retailers, like Amazon used to do, with prices that are allowed to fluctuate by 1% for different buyers, to get a sense of the demand stiffness.

He surveys the changes in economics over the last 25 years--the rise of experimental economics and behavioral economics--and argues that economics has become more scientific and that economists have become more aware of flaws in economic theory. But he also argues that economics is unable to make precise predictions about the effects of various changes in policy and behavior. \" Falsifiability is not the end-all-be-all criterion of whether to grant something the epistemic status usually reserved for \"clear\" science such as physics, chemistry (try falsifying this, for example: \"There is a perfect golden sphere a kilometer in diameter somewhere in the universe\"). I think another useful criterion may be how willing you are to update your probabilities in the face of new economic evidence (taking a Bayesian approach). It's hard (for me) to put economics in quite the same epistemic category as the established natural sciences (though I think it is extremely valuable, important and interesting) when Nobel-caliber practitioners can use similar tools & methods to arrive at opposing conclusions, and the profession's record of predictions/lack of is so spotty.

            "answer_text": "What many forget is that not only is science an ironically subjective term, but that there are, at the very core, TWO basic streams of science - natural and human. In rejecting economics as a science, we are often thinking about the natural sciences, which attempts to solidify our understanding of the natural world. I believe that economics is a human science, as it attempts to quantify where possible, or at the bare minimum generalize, human behaviour in the context of an economy, and in the context of financial organisation. The economy and the study of it does not exist independent of humans - we are, principally, the founders and creators of the international economy. This is one of the main reasons I consider economics a human science.  An interesting podcast by NPR (Episode 522: The Invention Of 'The Economy') attempted to show how the very concept of an economy is not only new, but is also a definitive product of attempting to understand, quantify and qualify human behaviour. The podcast suggests that the economy was not a standard concept, and yet hundreds of economists formulated their theories around this topic. People believe that the economy is something that is long-standing, but it was never made permanent and tangible until semi-recently. The value of this arduous task comes from the fact that it allows us to \"objectively\" look at the economy, which in itself is a new concept. I would also like to disagree with another answer authored by someone who believes that economics is a pseudoscience. Upon relatively extensive studying of a pseudoscience in my Theory of Knowledge class, the solidified definition of a pseudoscience (or fake science) is a science that \"claims the status of science while lacking its substance\u201d (Lagemaat, 2005). This is by no means true. Economics in many ways follows the scientific method on which we are so reliant these days to separate \"real\" science from \"fake\" science. There are observations of trends (in this case, these are observed in the economy, through quantitative data analysis). Studies may not be conducted, but other trends are also found through this analysis. Economists also hypothesise. Economists also publish their findings to a scientific community. All these traits of economics suggest that is not posing as a science, but is one itself. I therefore disagree that economics is a pseudoscience.  This is why I believe that economics is not a natural science, but a science nonetheless in the stream of human sciences. ",

Science is: Processes for creating reliable models for prediction and control of the natural world;Models that result from the application of those processes; andThe application of those models.Macro-economic effects are the consequence of many, confounding inputs, many of which are themselves difficult to predict with confidence.  Broad, general predictions can be made due, for example, to monetary policy, but counter-intuitive and surprising economic behaviors are common. Similarly, psychology is not so much of a science expressly because it fails to provide reliable models.  Psychology makes broad, general, statistical predictions.  It also provides some simplified models that do have some limited utility.  But much of psychology is guided by the need to make people feel better, independent of any formal, objective measures of success. Note that it does not necessarily matter what or how data is collected, or how systematic any associated study might be.  Alchemy was studied systematically for centuries by esteemed scientists like Isaac Newton, but is still pseudo-science, precisely because it fails to provide reliable prediction and control of the natural world.  I think that this is a particularly awful definition of science: science definition - Google Search. A key reason that Janet Yellen was chosen to be the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve was her success at prediction.  Regardless of her formal credentials, or her years of experience, or even her particular methodologies, she has remarkable demonstrated success at prediction.  Much of her investigative processes may involve intuition or 'gut feel' that cannot be described formally in a way that it could be adopted by others, but would still be science, to the degree that they provide reliable prediction and control.

            "answer_text": "Perhaps interestingly, the mathematical, and thereby rational, basis for Science as a way-to-go-about-in-this-world lies in Econometrics, a field which initially began as an exploration of empiricism in Economics. Science is simply the collection of correlations of datasets, under the assumptions of regression (nothing more, nothing less). The inferences that we draw from the correlation and significant coefficients of the regression are due to precise theorems in mathematics. Ultimately, all natural sciences are (only ?) supported by R-squares of close to 1.00 and highly significant coefficients. Infact, even causality is not a requirement for science; only precise definition of variables involved (which often passes off as causality) is required. Economics follows the standards required of any of the other sciences. The only problem is that there are far too many variables, some of them difficult to define and/or measure, in the real world to get high R-squares. Hence, several opposing economic theories can be held true at the same time, since both have the same/similar evidence, or rather, evidence of the same/similar strength, which is why economists have difficulty in coming to a consensus. I am reasonably confident that a similar lack of consensus would exist in physics had there been 1000 different, difficult to distinguish, types of quarks. To conclude, Yes, Economics is a Science.(And that's why, I would assume, that the Nobel Prize is justified) Edit 1: Several people point out the inability to conduct experiments under lab conditions as a deficiency for economics as a science. In mathematical terms, it translates to a trust in/on lab conditions to create a) exogenous independent variables (an assumption of regression for valid inference), b) large number of observations for central limit theorems to hold and c) ceteris paribus conditions. Regarding argument a): This argument is valid if there was some way to know for sure if the (lab - controlled) independent variables are indeed exogenous. However, such 'truth' is unavailable in the real world. Indeed, it is always an intuitive assumption that scientists make when they assume that some variables are exogenous. Economists make a similar kind of assumption regarding several economic variables and their exogeneity. As expected of the class of assumptions, some of them are not true. If in the course of research, when one feels that a particular assumption of exogeneity is possibly not true, the researcher tries a new line of research, and that's how science goes on. Regarding arguments b) and c): These are possible criticisms against economics. However, there are some economic questions for which large number of observations have been recorded. The probable core issue is that the time (as normally defined) taken to get many observations in economics is generally a lot and hence, several variables, which are not under study, change i.e. it is difficult to expect ceteris paribus even if the economist assumes it. The solution is to include every variable that can affect the dependent variable into the study, but as mentioned before, this would require a regression (and consequent analysis) of several hundreds, maybe thousands, of variables, which is a very difficult task for homo sapiens. Hence, economists apply intuition (and theory) and make do with available and potentially useful variables. This reduces the strength of the evidence but as mentioned before, for those of us who think that science is the only way-to-go-about-in-this-world and have an interest in economics, we might as well do something, even if it means getting slightly less strong results when compared to physics. Edit 2: It may look like I am redefining Science to suit my answer. My definition, I admit, is not one that is available in textbooks. But, in my opinion, my definition is one of the simplest ways to precisely define Science. Any other definition will require more assumptions on the world than the bare minimum ones. By the bare minimum assumptions, I am referring to the assumptions that allow for consistency in mathematics (Peano's Axioms). Hence, I request everyone to consider my definition; and after consideration, if you think it is incorrect, I request you to point me in the right direction. Edit 3: Perhaps I should provide an example to strengthen my case. Lets take Astrology. For the moment, let us assume that astrologers are able to provide precise and unambiguous definitions to the variables involved. For instance, say distances and angles of Jupiter from Earth (as explanatory variables) and outcomes of World Cup cricket matches (as dependent variables). For the moment, please also ignore the protests regarding causality that are being issued by the brain. Now, supposing an appropriate regression with the above variables gives an R-square of close to 1.00 with extremely significant slopes, mathematically, astrology has the same level of predictability as any theory in physics (Indeed, theories in Physics are backed by exactly these kinds of significant slopes and R-squares). In other words, even if we can't fathom the causal relationship, we would be wrong to ignore the results of this regression. It could be that some assumption of regression (such as exogeneity) is not really true and hence has resulted in such counter-intuitive results, in which case, it is upto to us to come up with a consensus on the issue. But under the assumptions of regression, the results do form a part of 'Science' even if they do not fit into our normal, everyday experience. Hence, defining Science as a 'collection of correlations of datasets under the assumptions of regression' is in my opinion a good definition. Thus, if astrology could be as precise, definition-wise, as other sciences, and if the results were as strong as physics, then astrology would be a science at par with physics, even if no causal mechanism is fathomable. The main issue is that astrologers don't provide precise definitions of variables. If such definitions are presented, then the regression results, if any good, will automatically lend credence to astrology with no further requirement of arguments (in which event, only a debate regarding the regression would go on for a long time till astrology becomes acceptable to society)  (A side point I wish to make is that 'Physics' or rather physicists generally stake claim when R-squares of close to 1.oo and highly significant slopes are reported. Indeed, this is how physicists would define 'physics' i.e. if some non-trivial regression failed to get an R-square very, very close to 1.00, irrespective of the significance of coefficients, physicists would not accept that regression as part of 'physics', though the regression is still a part of 'science') Also interestingly, the existence of causality is an assumption on the world, one which is entirely unnecessary for Science. Indeed, the truth value of the existence of causality cannot be known i.e. as stated before, such 'truth' is unavailable. Falsifiability: Several people point out falsifiability i.e. the possibility of finding insignificant evidence as a requirement for science. For me, it simply translates into the ability to come up with precise and unambiguous definitions for variables. However, it could be that I'm slightly wrong here and would be grateful if somebody could point out what the exact difference, results-wise, between proper definition of variables and falsifiability is. Edit 4: Perhaps, another interesting thought experiment is to imagine a world where, somehow, the best R-square possible was only 0.60 and not 1.00. This means that the very best of the physical 'laws' 'work' in the manner that we relate to only 60% of the time. Now, in such a world, our instinct to assign causal mechanisms would not work since causal mechanisms require logical absolutes/truths. However, would we be expected to sit around and do nothing in such a world? Obviously, we would make do with 0.6 and we would have a version of science in this world where the 0.6-ers are called physicists. The definition of science would still hold in this world, since this definition draws only from the consistency of mathematics. There are other solutions offered to avoid such situations such as probabilistic causation etc., but I think it is much better to dispense with the assumption of causation. It is important, hence, I reiterate. Causation is an assumption on the world and is unnecessary for science. Our consensus on the world would not change even if the assumption of causation were completely ignored in discussion, since it was never a part of the method of science.  I'm sorry for the multiple edits. If the point is still not clear, please do let me know and I'll try to clarify. ",

Of course, as others have noted, economics started out as political economy, and economists are totally bound up in political ideology. Michael is right to note that all \"scientists\" (really all people) are governed by politics, and economics as an economic discipline may well be a science. But I'd still argue that practicing economists are too far along the Phsyicist--Politician spectrum to be scientists. Proof: you can tell a lot more about a President's beliefs from the Council for Economic Advisors than from the NSF, the NIH, or even the Department of Energy. ",

            "answer_text": "If you go by the widely accepted Popperian criterion of a science as a field centered upon falsifiability, then economics, is a science (a social science), albeit an imprecise one. A statement/theory/hypothesis is falsifiable if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates the statement in question (i.e. if it can be proved false). But the problem of economics as a soft science lies in the problem of theorizing about a complex system whose details differ from country to country, and from time to time within the same country - i.e. a complex system that is dynamic and in flux. So as with Len Gould\u2019s example, why economists may produce different policy prescriptions is that they base them on different theories. Due to the complexity of economies, multiple theories may be logically valid simultaneously, but their applicability contingent on a range of factors and variables which are not considered in the model/theory, but rather universalized. This is a problem I have come to observe in the discipline. So whilst trickle down theory and tax increase to reduce the deficit may both be logically sound per se, their formulations neglect to consider under what conditions each of the prescriptions is likely to work (e.g. spending patterns of those who benefit most from tax cuts, the current level of taxes & likelihood of disincentivizing tax avoidance and evasion; domestic profitability of investment, historical responsiveness of investment to tax reductions, etc.). It is this tendency for theoretical universality that economics is prone to \u2018cycles of conventional wisdom\u2019 (as Paul Krugman puts it) - whereby a conventional theory, after a period of domination, is accused of being \u2018wrong\u2019 because it seems to no longer be applicable to new times or data; when in reality the underlying facilitating conditions have only changed. So you will find different economists holding different theories that seemingly compete with each other on a universalistic basis, but if more rigourous, more nuanced analysis is undertaken, one would find that each theory is applicable given a set of facilitating conditions. So, as Dani Rodrik & Mark Rosenzweig say, it is not a simple question of \u2018does it work?\u2019, but \u2018when does it work and when not and why?\u2019 Even though modern economics emphasizes the use of empirical observation and analysis (e.g. econometrics) to attempt to refute an economic theory such that it conforms in this sense to falsifiability, problems at the theoretical level exist and persist to make the discipline lack consensus. This is not to say that even at the empirical level there are no problems. There are limits to econometric analysis, and one has to be creative and dynamic when using it to investigate a theory\u2019s \u2018validity\u2019. For instance, an economist may simply want to test that X causes Y. Then a simple regression analysis is conducted to show this. The result is either X does cause Y, or X does not cause Y. By limiting the empirical analysis to such one-dimensional logic, the problem of theoretical universality manifests empirically. Better economists try to use different specifications, assess why certain cross-sections lie outside the relationship, if the relationship is stable over time, and what causes variations in the relationship across cross-sections and time, etc. Better economists also delve into individual cross-sections (e.g. countries) and gain knowledge of peculiar features that shape variable relationships, etc. But what is rife within the daily empirical literature is one-dimensional analyses which produce answers of yes/no to theories without conditionalities and nuance.

So, by definition, economics is a science. There is a common perception of a \"scientist\" being someone in a white coat working in a laboratory using the scientific method, something not uncommon in the natural sciences. But that doesn't mean that that's the only, or the \"real\" type of science. Arguing that economics is not a science is tantamount to arguing that all the social sciences (and perhaps the formal sciences) are not science. Unfortunately, that quickly devolves into a semantic argument, trying to say that \"science\" means something different from the common definition (including natural, social, and formal sciences). It's easy to (and most academics would) argue that economics is not a natural science, but there's more to science than natural science. ",

            "answer_text": "Economics is absolutely a scientific subject. For every action, means are used to obtain ends. Because of that fact, we have the science of scarcity of means. Unfortunately, though, it's difficult for me to say that economists in general are scientists. Some are, and some are not. If someone tells me they can create long-lasting prosperity by increasing the supply of the money unit, which is only an indexing tool we use to perform accounting, then no, that's absurd. Money is a medium of exchange, and is scarce only because those things you exchange it for are scarce. If someone's going to tell me that their quantitative model of our real economy is at an equilibrium, and the actors within it have rational expectations, and they're going to \"prove\" something with that, then no, that's absurd. In that case, they'd be better served ditching utility functions and passing all the input data through an unsupervised learning algorithm, like a neural network, and seeing the output. I'd trust random weights over biased ones. For the reason that an economist, with one political ideology, can use some data to \"prove\" one thing, and another economist, with another political ideology, can use that same data again to \"prove\" another thing, is unscientistic behavior, but we shouldn't reject economics as a science because its practitioners are as biased as the rest of us\u2014 we should seek to develop methods to reduce bias.

            "answer_text": "Economics is the dismal science because most economists use the wrong scientific method. There are people answering this question likening economics to physics. Wrong. Measuring economics, which is a study of human behavior, using a positivist theory (where everything is falsifiable) like physics, is crazy. Here\u2019s why. Positivism asserts that every single statement is falsifiable. Ok fine so let\u2019s assume that I make an assertion such as \u201chumans act\u201d. Now under a positivist theory that must be a falsifiable statement. There would, therefore, have to be an experiment to \u201ctest\u201d this. This is very laughable to normal people because the fact that \u201chumans act\u201d is a very self evident point, not to mention how would you even design an experiment to test that? Now to someone who uses the logical deductive method (the correct scientific method for economics), this is a very easy problem. I am acting by asserting that \u201chumans act\u201d. If a positivist (or any other crazy person) were to deny this they would be committing a contradiction because by denying this they would, of course, be acting.  To use a less cheeky example lets take the concept of exchange (commerce) between individuals, a very fundamental law of economics. You have two individuals, person A and person B. Person A will trade with Person B ONLY if Person A perceives that the thing he is going to give up is worth less than what he is going to receive. Person B must think likewise of the thing he is going to trade. Only if each individual thinks this will the trade be made. EXAMPLE: John has apples and Peter has wheat, and they want to trade. John must believe that the apples he is going to give away are worth less than the wheat he is going to receive and Peter must think that the wheat is going to give away is worth less than the apples he is going to receive. Each individual values the other\u2019s trade good more than he values his own. ONLY then will the trade be made. NOW, if you are a positivist (and you believe that every statement is falsifiable) then this is not necessarily true. You would have to test this phenomena in order to see if it is true or not (again how do you even test this?) and even then it would only be tentatively true because, remember, every statement no matter how obvious, is falsifiable. Again to the normal person this is ridiculous, after using a bit of logic we can clearly see and grasp that the law of exchange is a true law. Now this isn\u2019t just trivial theorizing here is what positivism implies in reality. Take for example Communism, which, by any objective standard, was a miserable failure. To a positivist, the statement I just made is, again, falsifiable, and forever will be, no matter how many times communism fails and kills people (you would think 100+ million deaths in dozens of examples would be enough to prove something). Always, the positivist will say \u201cwell if we just had of had Trotsky instead of Stalin\u201d or \u201cwell government intervention didn\u2019t work this time but that\u2019s because of excuse A or excuse B\u201d. It is evident then, that positivism, as it pertains to human action, really isn\u2019t concerned with empirical reality, rather it uses the veneer of empiricism to justify any economically dogmatic belief, however untenable (things like the minimum wage, price controls, welfare, tariffs, central banking, etc.), on the grounds that since there must be perpetual testing of an assertion (because it\u2019s falsifiable), we cannot throw out any theory or assertion. This is why one of the \u201cgreat\u201d positivist economists Paul Krugman, is able to make such blindly stupid assertions about the joys of state run healthcare such as \u201c(The VA) has been highly successful in containing costs, yet provides excellent care\u201d. After many exmaples of \u201cVA\u201d-like healthcare debacles around the world a logical person would begin to seriously question the validity of such systems. Not the positivist! \u201cThe VA (or NHS, or any socialized system) is mismanaged\u201d they say! \u201cIf we just had the right people\u2026..\u201d. Nonsense. So the correct way to look at economics then is through deductive reasoning. Through certain basic and logical laws of praxeology (the study of human action) such as the law of marginal utility, exchange, and action, etc. We can begin to deduct, from those original basic assertions, more complex conclusions such as the cause of boom and bust cycles, the cause of wealth inequality, the nature of inflation, etc. Economics as a science is far more akin to applied logic (used in computer science for example) than it is to positive sciences such as physics. The human element is what makes the difference because humans, in spite of some natural impulses, are fundamentally LOGICAL. Therefore, a scientific method based on logic is all too fitting. ",

            "answer_text": "Depending which branch of economics. Macroeconomics is certainly not a science. Th e reasons are the following:The scientific method requires,1. Observation2. Hypothesis3. Experimentation4. Acceptance or rejection of hypothesis. Macroeconomics does not lend itself to experimentation. In a proper experiment, the rest of the factors are held constant and one is changed to see the effect of it. In macroeconomics, you cannot hold the factors constant, at least not in most aspects of macroeconomics, thus, the conditions for science are not satisfied. Whatever experimentation is done, via analysis of time-series is invalid and the conclusions are false. Economists wilfully ignore this important fact that experimentation is not possible, and plunge ahead experimenting and concluding.  A school of thought tried to fix this problem by doing simulations. Those simulations are purely theoretical, the at least have constant conditions, but are based on patently oversimplistic assumptions, and even though they have been tried to become more complex by introducing heterogeneity and multiple people, it still relies heavily on huge assumptions that are patently false, hence, macroeconomics is not a science. Hence, the \"Alchemy of Finance\" produces better results for trading and investing. Another key to realize that something is not a science is if you have to papers with same factors and opposite conclusions. For instance, you have paper 1 saying if A rises, then B rises. Paper 2 concluded if A rises, then B falls. They are taken in different countries and different time periods. Still if it was a science they would reach the same conclusion, but because conditions and other factors are changing in different ways, conclusions reached can be opposite. But what else is academia to do? Study specific cases an historical precedent? They would go down in the totem pole with historians. ",

Also, if you hear someone actually use the phrase \u201ceconomic science\u201d in earnest, there\u2019s a better than even chance that person is a crank. As Paul Krugman writes in his blog (http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/does-economics-still-progress/ ):  I\u2019ve never liked the notion of talking about economic \u201cscience\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s much too raw and imperfect a discipline to be paired casually with things like chemistry or biology, and in general when someone talks about economics as a science I immediately suspect that I\u2019m hearing someone who doesn\u2019t know that models are only models.

            "answer_text": "Unquestionably Yes. The reasons we get confused about this are multitudinous. For starters, it is a difficult science as there are many factors at play, few controls, measurements are difficult and burdensome, the scope of the data is short, and the mathematical tools are very complicated. With a lot of these difficult sciences, we see people call them soft, but they are very hard, just not as certain. The second major factor working against us is the fact that it impacts all of us, so everybody has an opinion on it, expert or not. Even those with only a rudimentary high school knowledge of macroeconomics form and vote based on their ideas, no matter how poorly they understand the topic. Connected with this, we also have a large group of fake economists in major universities, where people like Charles and David Koch have dumped large amounts of money for faculty selection rights at economics departments around the nation. They fill these posts with \"Austrian economists\" that are basically just codified and more deeply held extremist high school economics with a few extra principles added in. If I were judging the status of economics as a science based on those economists and the information they put out to the world, I'd think it was about as scientific as homeopathy or bloodletting.  When we actually sit down and look at the science of economics, it is beautifully concrete and has an immense body of theory, evidence, and logic behind it.  Modern Economics is full of many interesting theories, concepts, mathematics, and with computer models and data that backs them up. It integrates physics models, complex systems theory, game theory, studies in psychology, computer modeling, information theory, and others. Out of this, it manages to produce things like modern monetary theory (MMT), rent-seeking, differential imperfect competition, Optimal Currency Area Theory, and Complex-Systems-Theory models (like Evolutionary systems), among many others.  Today the top models I've seen in the economics field are beautiful. We can accurately observe in the Complex Systems Theory models  of markets how markets can consolidate, become unresponsive, and crash to a more general, deconsolidated state, and then repeat. The Austrians, the right wing side of economics never put a cause to the \"business cycle\" they said it was implicit or built into nature, an \"it is what it is\" argument, but we can see how markets act like species and move to minimize their greatest hardship: that of competition, optimizing for their niches. How they reach local maxima of efficiency and adapting to the loss of that niche is too high and they fail to survive. We know what causes market consolidation and how to prevent it. We've learned how currency/government/market relationships function with extreme accuracy and can suggest policy that is effective. We even now understand why minimum wage increases, a price floor that, in high school economics, would cause an increase in unemployment and loss of growth, not only doesn't, but increases employment instead.  Economics is an excellent, well developed science where major gains are being made every year in our understanding. But it is contested by people spouting economics that were invalidated by our earliest computer data analysis, more than thirty years out of date, propped up by people who have much to gain, rather than on it's merit. Do not fall prey to their falsities, like Climate Science, it is real, concrete, and in wide agreement outside of the paid shills fighting deeply the obvious.  ",

Why?  Because we have no way of knowing what all the variables are.  Quite frankly, we don't know an exact value for any of them.  In fact... b) We don't know how some of the variables react.  Some models portray government spending as raising GDP, whereas others portray government spending as lowering GDP.  That's a rather slight difference there (note: I am focusing on the macroeconomic view, but the micro doesn't fair much better).  We don't know, because, quite frankly, what actually happens depends both on the situation and how people react.  Which leads me to... c) The fact that people are irrational.  If, at the start of our economic woes, no one had really stopped spending, we would be fine right now.  Instead, people panic.  Any attempts to get this most important variable to do anything predictable has failed.  Quite frankly, I would pin economics down as more a practical philosophy than a science. ",

            "answer_text": "In 1919 Eddington set out to test general relativity by measuring the deflection of light around the sun during a solar eclipse, the results generated headlines but the scientific community had its reservations about experimental accuracy. In 1922 the experiment was repeated and today it has been repeated with better equipment under better controlled conditions many times. That is how science works, the public weren\u2019t very interesting in the repeated experiments, in story telling those things don\u2019t matter. In many areas of macro economics we don\u2019t have the ability to perform repeatable experiments, we don\u2019t have large data sets and we don\u2019t have the ability to control many (if any) of the relevant confounding variables. There is only one Great Depression, there\u2019s only one savings and loan crisis and there are only a handful of modern recessions, also the circumstances around these vary wildly. Humans, particularly university professors, aren\u2019t good at acknowledging their limitations, limitations are difficult to publish. A popular pastime (also occasionally called a job) in economics departments is to write essays making assertions based on anecdotes backed up by the last set of essays based on anecdotes, assuming those are already proven facts. If this didn\u2019t go on how could we make \u2018progress\u2019, by which we mean how would we continue to employ tenured professors to make ever more complex and detailed assertions about how the world might, but probably doesn\u2019t, work. The real economy is complex and highly non linear, producing a t-stat to show that Keynesian stimulus works or estimating a Keynesian multiplier is an exercise in futility because the data is noisy and short in observation count. The result is storytelling with a scientific veneer. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was at school, the main economics textbook was called \u201cPositive Economics\u201d by Richard Lipsey. The \u201cPositive\u201d part was meant to distinguish it from \u201cnormative\u201d: it studied what is, rather than what should be. Economics would love to be a science. Economists do lots of hard mathematics, just like physicists, and they think they should get the same intellectual respect as the physicists. The problem is that physics has an experimental side and a theoretical side, and they work together. The experimental physicists have lots of kudos because they have big expensive kit to do their experiments with. So while theoretical physicists do quite often veer some way from what is practically observable (string theory?) they are anchored in reality - and in the academic pecking order, they are very much lower down the food chain than the experimentalists with their billion dollar budgets. Economics is very hard to measure. The theory depends on the existence of things called \u201crational actors\u201d, which are approximations to reality in the same way as particles are approximations to reality in physics. But while electrons and protons can be observed behaving in a way that supports the particle model well enough, no one has yet observed a rational actor. And rational actors are supposed to be people and companies. People, on the whole, aren\u2019t rational much. The assumption that they are is the foundation for most modern economics and economists continue to write papers and make predictions based on this unsupported assumption. As we say in computing, garbage in, garbage out, and I think that is the case for almost all papers based on mathematical economics published in the last thirty years. Modern economics, as taught in today\u2019s universities, is the emperor\u2019s new clothes. There is a new school of economics, post-crash economics, started by a group of students at Manchester University in 2009 who questioned what they were being taught as it had just been found badly wanting. But we fall back on the measurement problem. There is a whole branch of economics, econometrics, devoted to measuring economic factors. If the physics parallel were apt, the econometricians would have the equivalent respect (and budgets) of the experimental physicists. They would be the top dogs in the departments. But they are considered the nerdy geeks, while the theoretical economists get the top jobs and the hottest research students. However, I think there is an answer to the measurement problem. There is a huge amount of data - real-time transaction data - which the cashless society generates. It is, however, proprietary to the banks and in its raw form is personally-identifiable data subject to data protection. Appropriately anonymised, the potential for using this real-time data to support a new form of real-time econometrics could revolutionise the academic study of economics. But there are quite a few institutional hurdles to overcome before this will be possible. ",

The simplest answer I guess is that it\u2019s a science, but, as others have noticed, it is a social science, like sociology, psychology, education, and anthropology. But that\u2019s to some extent a simplistic answer, since the \u201chardness\u201d of economics is not uniform across the whole subject domain.  Some areas of economics are \u201charder\u201d science, while other parts are \u201csofter\u201d science. Some aspects of it almost becomes applied physics or engineering, namely the ways that the foundations of the economy in terms of energy and resource availability, energy supply, and technological level impact the productivity of the economy. Other aspects of economics it\u2019s very fuzzy and qualitative and ideological. This unevenness exists probably for a few reasons. 1.      First, since it\u2019s a relatively young science. All sciences have gone through a sort of arc, where they started as branches of philosophy, then became separate subjects, then went through a free for all period where the pioneers try different methodologies out and map out the basic structure of the field and the identify the problems to solve. Then things settle down and become more defined and organized and productive, massive paradigm shifts notwithstanding. 2.      Second, it is a human science, so there is all the complication of human systems being complex dynamical systems with often chaotic, unpredictable dynamics, and as well, there is the issue that humans, so far as we can see, have free will, making the system not completely deterministic. 3.      Third, there is the sweeping scope of economics. One possible definition of economics could be \u201cThe study of how humans use technology to manage limited resources and organize their activity to raise their relative standard of living.\u201d (Here technology is used in the abstract academic sense that includes tools, techniques, and processes) When you think about it this way, it touches on almost everything. It\u2019s by nature multidisciplinary \u2013 science, technology, information sciences, mathematics, sociology, psychology, education. ",

Science is a stream of hypotheses that are researched, tested, honed, and/or discarded. Wikipedia says: Science is a systematic enterprise of gathering knowledge about the world and organizing and condensing that knowledge into testable laws and theories. ...  Scientific fields are commonly divided into two major groups: natural sciences, which study natural phenomena (including biological life), and social sciences, which study human behavior and societies. These groupings are empirical sciences, which means the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions. There are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary and applied sciences, such as engineering and health science. Within these categories are specialized scientific fields that can include elements of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own terminology and body of expertise.  Mathematics, which is classified as a formal science, has both similarities and differences with the natural and social sciences. It is similar to  empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori rather than empirical methods. Formal science, which also includes statistics and logic, is vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences are essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and laws, both in discovering and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people think and act (social sciences). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science ",

You can look and survey various economic systems and policies of the past and try to draw conclusions from the results, but that's a very weak and inexact process. Sure you can draw pretty graphs with the consumption line going up and the flammistrannity line going down and they intersect where the theoretical degumption oscillates around the marginal defenestration.    And economists can convince themselves that those things would happen if people were rational beings.   Problem is, people are not always rational and don't always know what to do, or they do the unexpected.   At least one Nobel prize has been given out to economists that have said as much.  It's mildly amusing that they give out the top prize to folks that say that they are full of BS. Not to demean economists so much, they have come up with some reasonably profound general principles, like that supply is limited but wants are infinite, about as profound as the plumber's list of deep thoughts:  water runs downhill, payday is Friday, and don't lick your fingers.

            "answer_text": "This question is rather popular and, as many popular questions, has little sense. We compare two vague concepts: economics and science. Is economics a science? Depends on how you define both. Alfred Marshall, Paul Samuelson, and other economists have definitions that are not the same. You can see various definitions of economics in Definitions of economics. Science is also a matter of dispute. This time among Karl Popper, Imre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend, and Thomas Kuhn. They are interested in what really happens in science, rather than in its formal definition. And it turns out to be a discussion about scientific methods, namely, the means by which the people who we call scientists obtain insights about the world. It is more helpful to jump over the question about compatibility of economics and science, and ask the question by what means can we make our economics insights less fallible. ",

Economists make predictions about the world but they have not been able to have the same precision that scientists in the physical sciences have. Economics has theories and adversarial paradigms. The laws that economics postulate such as the law of diminishing marginal returns is not universal. However, economics is not a pseudoscience but I would be hesitant to say that it has the predictive ability of natural sciences. Look at Exploring Economics. This shows the plethora of economic paradigms that exist both in cooperation and in contrast to the mainstream economic paradigm. ",

            "answer_text": "Economics is that the branch of science under which the assembly, distribution, exchange, and consumption of products and services are studied. Adam Smith (Adom smith) is called the father of economics. He wrote a book wealth of nations (1776), which talks about the wealth of all the countries of the world. Adam Smith was a resident of Scotland. Types of economics Economics is divided into two parts - 1. Micro and 2. Macroeconomics (macro) Microeconomics: - The father of microeconomics is called Ragnar Frisch. Under micro, we talk on a very small level. Remember this way, the mobile has a micro sd card, meaning it has been shortened even earlier. That means small, small. Some examples of microeconomics ----- Per capita income (per capita income) Demand and supply Revenue Utility Price theory Demand theory etc. Macroeconomics: - The father of macroeconomics eats John Keynes. Under this, we talk on a very large scale. This is the opposite of an individual. Some examples --- National income Planning Tax Budget Banking etc. If we are only assessing the income of a person, then we are talking on a very small level, so it will be part of the micro. But when estimating the income of the entire country, that is, the national income, then it became wider. Hence it will be a part of the macro. Economy An economy is a structure under which all economic activities are conducted. Production consumption and investment are fundamental activities of the economy. The institutions of the economy are humanized. Therefore, they also develop as human beings want. Types of economy Types of economy Open Economy: - It is a control-free economy that encourages freedom competition. In the policy of globalization, all countries are adopting a free economy. Closed Economy: - It is an economy that does not carry out any kind of foreign trade with the world. This type of economic activity takes place within the border of a country. Developed Economy: - This type of economy represents a better level of economic activity and development. In this type of economy, it is difficult to determine any limit or criterion. Countries of this type of economy come in countries like the USA and Japan, whose per capita income of citizens is called a developed country on the basis of a higher and better life. Developing Economy: - In this type of economy, such countries come who are striving towards higher development from their backward system. Like India Capitalist Economy: - This type of economy works independently under the principles of market forces i.e. demand and supply, it is known as a market economy. Socialist Economy: - This type of economy represents a system based on the principles of Karlmarks. Under this, the state and community control all the means of production. Like Soviet Russia Mixed Economy: - In this type of economy there is a mixture of socialist and capitalist economies. The state has control over a significant part of the economic resources and at the same time the private sector gets the opportunity of development like India Read more ",

In some ways, their love of data defines them. Economists, on the other hand, fear data. They fear for the welfare of their beloved principles and laws of economics. They fear what data might do to their assumptions about rational agents and rational markets. Conventional methodologies in economics are being influenced by modern methodologies in data science and artificial intelligence but this is still just a sideshow in the subject. Generally, economists shun data because their discoveries of \u201cbasic principles and laws of economic exchange\u201d render the collection of evidence superfluous. And so economics is not a science. Economics is more like a topic of conversation loosely constrained by the idea that economics studies human behaviour as a relationship in the distribution of scarce resources (i.e., see Lionel Robbins).

Some say science and some say social science. Before deciding on this, we need to know what is science? And what is social science? Science: The English word science comes from the Latin word scientia, which means knowledge. Science refers to the disciplined stream of knowledge, which is acquired through observation, experiment and observation. In this sense, chemistry, physics, biology are pure natural sciences. Social Science: Sociology is the study of social action. (August comte) Social science is a branch of knowledge that deals with society and human behavior. Economics is a subject that analyzes human behavior that combines the infinite scarcity of people and the limited resources available for alternative use. (Professor L. Robbins) So economics is the social science; It is not a pure natural science like chemistry, physics, etc. If economics is a science, it is a \"dismal science.\" Thomas Carlyle, a Scottish writer and philosopher, called economics \"the dismal science\" ",

Economists (and all the rest of us) use money to measure our successes, our failures, the health of companies and the wealth of nations. Most people think they know what it is too - until you start asking the questions around it. Real money represents work done. This is a philosophically based response to the question and can be demonstrated fairly simply. Economists do not in general accept that their \u201cnot-quite-a-science\u201d is subject to the laws of physics or more specifically the laws of thermodynamics. Since work-done is defined in physics and forces that relationship, Economics can be bound to physics the same way as all real sciences are.

            "answer_text": "Economics is a social science. It is a science because it studies the forces of supply and demand that determine the prices that in turn govern how resources might be allocated to optimise the production of the goods and services that we all want / need. Just like physics, economics has elaborate mathematical models that attempt to understand systems and predict outcomes. It is a social science because, unlike physics, the agents for action are people rather than inanimate objects. This makes it behavioural / social. If people were automatons with logically predictable consistent behaviour, then economics would be like physics. Inputs into the models would be precise, the models would be in-variate and the predictions from the models should be accurate. However, the behaviour of people, individually and collectively, in the real world is far too complex and transient to allow the precise inputs and the in-variate models that would yield physics-like predictions. When I studied economics it was called \u201cPolitical Economy\u201d and for a good reason. The study of how uninhibited free markets operate in allocating resources and wealth across an economy is fascinating and fundamental. However, at the end of the day it is politics and human behaviour that determines how the economy will actually be allowed to work. There is no equivalent in physics to this over-riding social / behavioural dimension. So, which is the \u201charder\u201d science ? ",

            "answer_text": "Economics is considered a \"Social science\", together with psychology, anthropology, political science, and sociology. Humanities (such as law, archaeology, history, and linguistics) are often included. Some social scientists are \"positivists\":  they use methods similar to those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and define science in its stricter modern sense. Others are \"interpretivist\": they use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and treat science in a broader sense. Then, of course, some may consider that \"social sciences\" (specially those with a more \"interpretivist\" bias) are not really worthy of being considered \"science\". Remember that, according to Ernest Rutherford,  \"all science is either physics or stamp collecting\" ;-) ... But that discussion is clearly not the intention of my answer.    ",

Experimental studies in economics are now widespread (both lab and field experiments).  See the work of this year's Clark Medalist, Esther Duflo, for examples of field experiments in development economics.  Prominent lab experimentalists include Vernon Smith and Daniel Kahneman, who shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in 2002. ",

            "answer_text": "According to Karl Popper, the test if something is \"science\" is that it must be  falsifiable. This means there must be a way to disprove claims made about how some aspect of the universe works. The fact that economics, along with psychology and sociology, makes claims about aspects of human nature, is less a reason to disqualify it from being a science than a reason to despair that human nature is really difficult to model. All science requires that problems be modeled, or simplified, down to a few salient elements. In this light, economics is much, much more difficult to falsify than say, classical harmonics. This is also why though, game theory, networks, and heuristics (more broadly, decision sciences) are currently the most intensely researched/lauded areas in economics and the other social sciences. Providing a stochastic (probabilistic) basis for the  assumptions that economic models make about how and why humans allocate scarce resources is like finding a reason why gravity works everywhere in the universe the same way.

If economics is a science then it should follow rules and law. But in reality no rule and law work in economics. We have endless number of exception to any law. For example:- very common law of demand that states that the demand will increase if we decrease the prices. In how many cases it is applicable in real-world?? Yes in some cases it is applicable, but in most of the cases, we have to make a settlement with the exceptions. So how the law has so many exceptions, and if it has so many exceptions then it should not be a law. That\u2019s why according to me economics is not a science. Economics is the study to understand the people and their behaviour. ",

Judging by hiring, salaries, and numbers and quality of students, bestsellers by economists, new ideas, the latest crop of Nobel prizes, it's a reasonably healthy discipline -- even though its critics have been claiming for a century and half that it was moribund.

I guess English-speaking countries make a clearcut difference between humanities and science, French is more qualified about it. We define humanities as \u201cSocial and human sciences\u201d and science as \u201cHard sciences\u201d. If we define sciences as a \u201csystem of acquiring knowledge. This system uses observation and experimentation to describe and explain natural phenomena\u201d, the vast majority of research/disciplines could be defined as science. In the other hand defining science as disciplines where universal laws exist, I would be really surprised that economics could be defined as science. ",

            "answer_text": "Pragmatically, you might want to ponder the value of the question itself.  Why might one want to assert that science either is or is not a science?  It might be worth asserting that economics is not a science as a provisional belief that allows you to re-invent parts of it.  In other words, if the term \"science is functioning in your mind to keep certain presuppositions sacrosanct (like the economic man assumption, perfect rationality or the efficient markets hypothesis), then thinking of it as a non-science, focusing on the cultural constructedness of economics and its fads and fashions over time - that might be freeing for you. However, even the hardest of hard sciences contain assumptions that are untested, and fads and fashions, so a richer concept of science admits of this.  If you don't fetishize physical sciences as some kind of realm of perfect knowledge, you don't need to agonize too much over the status of economics as a science, and you can just focus on doing it better.

Typically with an experiment designed to prove a theory, controls of methods are very strict. Conditions are controlled also, so that random interference can be reduced or eliminated. The difficulty in using this process regarding economics is, it is very difficult to get an area isolated enough from outside factors or influences. And difficult to observe two environments with controlled circumstances to objectively compare results. There seem to be as many economists that favor supply side economics as demand side economics. Keynesian economics favors demand side, while Austrian or the Chicago school of economics favor supply side. If all the inputs and variables could be measured objectively, and correlations could be drawn directly, it might be a science. But so far, it is more of an art than a science. And, the two major theories might both work under different circumstances. So sometimes, supply side is best, and sometimes, demand side is better. ",

It could be a whole lot more science based and that is what we at Modern Macroeconomic Design are trying to do. We have a WhatsApp group with some leading academics in the group. It is not a chat group but a research group. There are rules about what you can say because time wasting is forbidden. It begins by providing a way to measure savings and debt in a way that is decidedly practical and useful to all participants. Money back is not the way it works. Money does not have any kind of constant value. Later it looks at everything that creates financial instabiloty and it looks at the instruments that an engineer would want to see if the systme is to be managed effectively. Other economists have only recently been doing good research in that area. The team is led by me as a past student of electronic systems management (of machines) to create effective management controls and systems. I learned economics on the job as an investment portfolio manager and put my knowledge to work in making decisions that saw my leading portfolio rise or (once) stand still every calendar year for two decades. And it outperformed most, if not all, institutional rivals based upon independently published comparisons. Am I allowed to give a blog site? It is called Macro- Economic Design because it is about the big economy and how it is, or could be, designed. ",

Much of what passes for science in economics today is oversimplified analysis of data using what is called econometrics.  Some simple econometric studies may be scientific, but many of them are merely black magic. Furthermore, many economic theories have little value in reality, where humans don't behave like the entirely rational homo economicus. In my humble opinion, the most interesting issues in economics are more philosophical in nature. ",

It isn't terribly applicable to everyday life, but it can be used to subdue a nations's economy for the benefit of people who should not have that power. It's better than astrology and pop psychology, not as good as climate modeling. ",

The term was formerly used to refer to the field of sociology, the original \"science of society\", established in the 19th century. In addition to sociology, it now encompasses a wide array of academic disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, economics, human geography, linguistics, management science, media studies, musicology, political science, psychology, welfare and nursing studies and social history. (For a more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences see: Outline of social science.) Behavioural Economics has perhaps introduced more of an experimental approach to Economists. As a sub-discipline of economics it is akin to Psychology. ",

In India (and maybe other countries too) Economics Masters is offered as an M.A (master of arts) & not M.Sc (master of science)  Apart from that simple logic of educational classification, I firmly believe that economics is not a science, if one has a traditional, strict definition of what science is. Economics is fascinating, but is based on laws and principles which are, at its core, based on human needs desires and thinking.  Lets take an example :A basic economics / commerce principle of supply and demand, is scientific, in that they are inversely proportional, one can create complex equations & algorithms based on this principle, but at its core, it exists because we(humans) exists. If humans collectively decide one day that gold is worthless, it is truly worthless. You cant eat it, use it for making usable energy etc. On the other hand, Newton's laws of motion exists irrespective of our existence  (This is a very vague, macroscopic way of describing the difference, as I see it) ",

The three categories are: natural sciences (biology, physics, etc.), social sciences (economics, sociology, etc.) and the humanities (literature, philosophy, etc.). So in general terms, it is a science, and specifically a social science. And not a natural science. By the way, English is somewhat peculiar about using the term \u201cscience\u201d to exclude something like the study of literature. In most other European languages, calling the study of literature or philosophy \u201cscience\u201d makes perfect sense to the native speakers of those languages.
