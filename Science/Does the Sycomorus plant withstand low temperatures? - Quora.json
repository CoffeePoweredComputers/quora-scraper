            "answer_text": "The Sycamore fig is originally native to East and South Africa, and was long ago brought to the Mid East where it was wildly planted , but I suspect mostly in mildly climates, like near the coasts. It has many uses, fruit, wood, shade. It may have have been widely planted and just replanted into areas it didn\u2019t always survive for many years, plus it probably recovers from the roots or major trunks. It is likely to be harmed extended periods below freezing, but may tolerate -4degC for brief periods, like a chilly morning. Best is keeping it above freezing. It grows well in Mediterranean mild climates like SoCal, as well as deserts and tropics, tolerating dry climates well.https://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/57821/#b ",
