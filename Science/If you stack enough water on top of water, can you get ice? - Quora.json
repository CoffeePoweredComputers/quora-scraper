            "answer_text": "Yes, provided it sums up to 6324 (0\u00b0C) to 22300 bar (100\u00b0C). That would be equivalent to a water depth of 63 240 m to 223 000 m. The deepest deep sea trench has some 11 037 m (Witjas depth), the deepest drilling 12 262 m (Kola Superdeep Borehole. That would not suffice. You need a pressure chamber. Another problem is that ice has a lower density to water. Any ice formed would rise to to the surface, moving itself into an area of reduced pressure and liquefy again. Thus pressing water to ice remains a lab curiosity. ",

            "answer_text": "Google water phase diagrams. Once there you will see that to get liquid water to convert to solid water at all room temperatures is not possible. Part of the reason is the backward slope of the line dividing liquid and solid water. However, at temperatures below zero degrees Celsius it is possible to convert liquid water into solid water ",
