            "answer_text": "The main idea of TBBT is to make the nerd culture cool and acceptable among people. We often have the conception that nerds are introverts, talk only about books, geeky stuffs and can't have a normal social life (which includes a partner). Sometimes these things may seem true, but the series focuses on how they tackle such socially awkward situations and gain the courage and have faith on themselves. There is nothing wrong in being a geek and they can actually come up with some solutions to everyday problems (even though it means setting Feynman's van on fire during Leonard\u2019s bachelor trip to Mexico). Jim Parson's acting is so genuine that it actually made us fall in love with the super geek Dr. Sheldon Cooper.! ",
