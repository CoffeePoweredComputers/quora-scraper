And under given conditions, usually the measured absorbance, , is proportional to (i) the concentration of the absorbing species in , and (ii) , the path length of the cell \u2026. and the constant of proportionality is  And thus we get the old \u2026the which works best for absorbance readings from \u2026  And so for a given path length,  in , (i.e. CELL dimension), a plot of  versus  should yield a STRAIGHT LINE whose slope is equal to .
