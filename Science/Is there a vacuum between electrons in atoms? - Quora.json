            "answer_text": "The simple answer is yes. The empty space within an atom is a vacuum. But the space between electrons in an atom may not be entirely empty. For one thing there are photons as well as gauge bosons constantly being exchanged within these spaces. Another thing is, it is not possible to quantify the positions of the electrons within an atom at any particular moment in time and therefore you can\u2019t really quantify the space between them since you don\u2019t really know where they are at any given moment in time.
