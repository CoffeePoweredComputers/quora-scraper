            "answer_text": "First of all, Br, and not br. As for the mass of Br-79, what can be said without looking at the available data is that it has to be very close to 79 amu, but certainly no one can guess a figure with four decimal digits as that reported for Br-81. Simply subtracting to that figure the mass of two neutrons is incorrect, because mass defect has to be taken into consideration, and that value is typical of the nucleus under consideration and depends on the interactions among the nucleons within it.
