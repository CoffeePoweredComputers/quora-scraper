            "answer_text": "I offer for your consideration the still-tentative and incomplete proposition that the meaning of the term c^2, which, when expressed in SI units is ~10^17 square meters per second per second, can be expanded from its more common usages to include, among several other meanings, just what it would appear to mean if it were standing alone, not in the context of the familiar equations. c^2 can be imagined as an acceleration of the rate at which some area is expanding. In this proposition, the area in question is that of our entire Physical Universe. Using this meaning, the proposed acceleration of expansion for our entire physical Universe would be ~10^17 square meters per second per second. This proposition assumes that the geometry of our Universe can be thought of as flat. Its size can be stated as area (meters^2). Any momentary rate at which our Universe is growing can be stated as a rate of expansion (meters^2 per second). Any increase or decrease in the rate of expansion can be stated as acceleration or deceleration of expansion (+/- meters^2 per second^2). Any change in the acceleration or deceleration of expansion can be stated as acceleration or deceleration of acceleration or deceleration (+/-/+/-meters^2 per second^3). Our entire Physical Universe is assumed to surround and to be ~10^23 times larger than that part of our Universe we can observe with our present technology. This proposition also assumes that the accelerating expansion of our Universe is metric, occurring only in the dimensions of Space itself, is roughly isotropic, occurring at the same rate in all directions and is roughly homogeneous, occurring at the same local rate at all point locations equidistant from an observer. Based on values from recent observations, the SI value for the arithmetic mean, or uniform acceleration of expansion of the observable Universe, since the beginning of the Expansionary Epoch, calculates to be about 10^19 square meters/second/ second. While this value is two orders of magnitude greater than the SI value I propose for c^2, the arithmetic mean is misleading. This is partly because it comes from adapting a simple acceleration formula for linear motion, substituting for time and distance the present most accepted values for the age (seconds) and size (meters^2) of our observable Universe. Mathematically, the aptness of this adaptation may be subject to challenge. In addition, it does not take into account those periods, during the life of the Universe, in which the rate of acceleration itself accelerated or decelerated. Maybe worst of all, it does not take into account that a very large part of the entire Universe is unobservable to us. How far, then, can we go in calculating the acceleration of the entire Universe if we use only values derived from observation? But, optimistically, let\u2019s suppose that future observations will allow us to infer the size and age of our entire Universe with some confidence and to infer the steepness and duration of all the changes in the rate of expansion that have occurred since the Universe began. Then, let\u2019s suppose that we would be able to calculate the harmonic mean acceleration of expansion of the entire Universe and that calculation (if stated in SI units) would yield a value of about 10^17 square meters/second/second or c^2. For this proposition, c^2, also applies in mathematical descriptions of important relations as a \u201cUniversal Proportionality\u201d. Such a Universal Proportionality would be a key factor in deriving our present mathematical descriptions of key relationships among Space, Time, matter, Mass, momentum and Energy. In this proposition, c^2 does not derive from these relationships, nor from the speed of light. The relationships among Space, Time, matter, Mass, momentum and Energy as well as the speed of light at any moment all derive from the acceleration of expansion at that moment. To put it another way, c^2 is a master constant in describing the observable Universe just because it derives its value from the most dynamic and fundamental property of our Universe, namely changes that occur in the rate at which our Universe is expanding. I offer for your consideration the additional and still-tentative and incomplete proposition that all the tools we use to make observations of our accelerating Universe are altered whenever the rate of acceleration itself accelerates or decelerates. In a \u201cUniversal Relativity\u201d, all the clocks run slower or faster and all the rulers get shorter or longer as some function of changes in the acceleration of expansion, such that observations made anywhere and at any time will always produce a calculated rate of accelerating expansion of 10^17 meters^2 per second^2.

            "answer_text": "[math]c^2 [/math] doesn't refer to a speed per se, and you shouldn't think of it that way. Let's go back to basic projectile physics. F = ma; this is the most well-known form of Newton's Second Law of Motion. The unit of force, given a mass of one kilogram and an acceleration of 1 m/s^2, is one Newton. Now, energy is defined as the sum of work, and work is defined (in one way) as the movement of a mass by a certain distance against a constant force. One Newton-meter of work is performed when 1kg of mass is accelerated from rest to a velocity of 1 m/s over a distance of 1m. As E=W, his is equivalent to a Joule of energy spent performing this Newton-meter of work. So, 1 Joule equals 1 kilogram times 1 meter, times one meter per second squared: [math]J=\\dfrac{kg*m^2}{s^2}[/math]. Removing units, the equation simplifies to [math]E=\\dfrac{md^2}{t^2}[/math]. So, any definition of energy must ultimately reduce to a measurement of mass times distance squared divided by time squared. Back to Einstein's equation, m is mass, plain and simple, measured in kg. So what's c^2? Well, c is a velocity, expressed as distance per unit time, specifically m/s. So, multiplying mass by velocity, we get mass times distance divided by time. Not quite there. But, (m/s)^2 = m^2/s^2. So, if we square velocity, we get E=mc^2, which expressed in units is J = kg*m^2/s^2, which is our expected \"unit of measure\" for energy. ",
