It\u2019s in the largest 10% even though it is much smaller than some larger types. Think of the Sun as a Squirrel\u2026.a lot bigger than a mouse. A squirrel is much smaller than an elephant but there are many more times mice than elephants and other larger mammals. At one time we thought our Sun average but this was only because we were unaware of the large number of blue dwarfs, etc \u2018out there\u2019. ",

Try this; Main Sequence - Universe Today Around 90 percent of stars are main sequence We believe they fuse hydrogen atoms forming core helium atoms. They range from about a tenth of a solar mass to up to 200 solar masses. Other types can have even greater variance! Though the sun is in the smaller side of the \u2018type\u2019 size range it\u2019s on the larger side of the numbers game, as there are more smaller ones. Stars have a life, then when dying or dead it seems they\u2019re accreted to the growing AGN for re-ionization. Ours is estimated at some 5\u20136Bn yrs old and is due for it\u2019s \u2018mid life\u2019 crisis any time! ",
