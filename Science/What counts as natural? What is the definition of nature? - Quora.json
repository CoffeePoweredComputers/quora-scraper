            "answer_text": "Put it in another context to clarify.  What is the 'nature' of something?   The nature of something refers to its attributes and way of expressing.  It is what arises from its behavior at any ascertained point in its potential.   The nature of something is how it acts in response to stimulus. What is human nature?  It is the most prevalent, dominating  commonality of our life forms.  It is the the characteristics that are attributable to all human beings.  Deviations are called unnatural.    The more expansive the perception of a thing, the more comprehensive its true nature becomes. Its too bad that the word 'natural' can be morphed to mimic belief systems.  It becomes a real problem when people try to claim something is natural, born of their own interpretations of information and choice of belief, and then it becomes their natural tendency to  impose those assertions upon others. But, that is the nature of ignorance. ",

            "answer_text": "It is commonly held that something which is natural has arisen without the intervention of intelligence in its production.  On the materialist view, intelligence cannot 'intervene' however since from that perspective our universe evolves without any purposeful ghosts in its physical machine - everything is necessarily natural and evolves solely according to the laws of physics. On a view where intelligence is held to be real inasmuch as it can have an effect upon the physical world it could be argued that anything which arises from the activity of intelligence is unnatural since it would not have arisen from the mindless activity of matter. Personally however, I can't see how anything can be held to be unnatural, since whatever intelligence may or may not be, it is nonetheless a natural phenomenon.   Certain intelligent activities give rise to things which are abhorrent, immoral or unethical - think destruction of the environment, pharmacological injustice, armaments industry etc. - such things can only be judged by the application of a moral perspective and this is once again, an intelligent activity. Perhaps 'unnatural' is actually better avoided as a word if it places us at one remove from our responsibilities - by using more emotive human terms, we draw attention to our own actions - most things which are held to be unnatural are in fact just human.
