            "answer_text": "Acceleration due to gravity doesn't change the mass of an object. If an object is 5kg on the earth, it will have the same value on the moon.However, if it was measured as 5kg on earth, using the same scale would give the value as 5/6kg on the moon. That's because when we weigh something, we are actually measuring the force it exerts on the scale,and then determining the mass indirectly. That can give rise to erroneous results. In short, the force exerted by an object due to its mass will be different in the moon from the earth, but the mass will remain constant. (Assuming no relativistic effects) And I don't know what 49m means. I will assume that it's metres. In that case, the height will depend on the elastic modulus and how the weight is distributed. For a perfectly rigid body, the height won't change. ",
