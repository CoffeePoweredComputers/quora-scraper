            "answer_text": "Q: Is there anything in the Earth that truly smells like nothing? Well, probably not in theory. Smell depends on the gases given off, but though nothing has zero vapour pressure most things come close. Noble gases probably don\u2019t smell because smell is a biochemical reaction and the noble gases don\u2019t react. And it depends on how sensitive our sense of smell is. There are things, say, a dog can smell but we can\u2019t. Our galaxy smells of raspberries, by the way. (Astronomers have detected ethyl formate in the Milky Way - that\u2019s the chemical that gives raspberries their smell \u2026 but you\u2019d have to sniff a lot of galactic space to notice.) ",

            "answer_text": "Is there anything in the Earth that truly smells like nothing? Most things that we smell are volatile chemicals or elements. Most minerals don\u2019t have a smell because they are not volatile or have volatiles as part of their construction. Most of our smells are associated with biological compounds, living or non-living. Salt doesn\u2019t have a smell even though it has a strong taste. Glass, and therefore sand, doesn\u2019t have a taste or smell. Heated iron does have a smell. I always liked the smell of a blacksmith shop. I think that smell has to do with the carbon in the iron that came from the coal that was used to heat it and add carbon to it; but I\u2019m not sure. If anyone knows why hot iron smells, I would like to know. ",
