            "answer_text": "A lot, of course. If all the major ice fields on land melted, sea levels would rise by approximately 75 metres. That would result in serious lost land, and since the majority of our major cities are within 75 metres of sea level, their total loss. Furthermore, a lot of the best farmland is in this zone. it would be a human disaster of massive proportions, but would still leave a very large land area for what was left of the human population. Our civilisation would be destroyed though. ",
