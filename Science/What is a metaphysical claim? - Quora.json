            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start with an example and then explain the idea of a metaphysical claim. The example Consider the claim \u201cA mind without a body is impossible\u201d. Well, it seems to make sense for in our world we find minds associated with bodies. And if we are committed to materialism\u2014the view that there is nothing but matter\u2014then that seems to imply that where there is a mind, there is a body. But a mind without a body seems logically possible. Why? Logic does not presume physics so logical possibility includes possibility in a \u2018non physical\u2019 universe. So perhaps if there were such a universe there could be a mind without a body. So that suggests we think carefully about our universe. Is it material? Well, it\u2019s considered difficult (at least) to explain how mind arises from a non mental thing like matter. Perhaps, then, our universe is not material. Perhaps what it is made of is a neutral \u2018substance\u2019\u2014neither mind nor matter specifically but possessed of the characteristics of both. Some people think this is absurd on account of the question \u201cOkay, but how do the mental and the material interact.\u201d A reasonable answer is (i) think about perception\u2014it involves a relationship between a perceiver and the perceived object which suggests that what is involved in mind is relationship (ii) therefore perhaps there is some neutral substance which is matter like in giving rise to things but in its relationships is mind like. So perhaps then mind is possible without a body. Then, on thinking about it, perhaps we have misconceived the nature of ordinary matter\u2014perhaps the relationship between particles is simultaneously \u2018force\u2019 and (very low level) mental relationship. The low level is nothing like our phenomenal consciousness but, on this view, our consciousness would be built up out of complex and layered arrangements of the elements and their processes (as in brains). So mind would be associated with bodies. We have a quandary. And the answer is not forthcoming from physics or logic or our acquaintance with consciousness. The question clearly has to do with the nature of reality\u2014of \u2018Being\u2019, which is a classical topic of metaphysics (and even though \u2018metaphysics\u2019 does not mean \u2018beyond physics\u2019 this question is seemingly rather beyond physics). We might resolve the question as follows. Mind is not just something \u2018floating out there\u2019. Think of your own mind in operation. You see a mountain and the subjective experience registers the form of the mountain. That is when something happens in your mind there is a definite form \u2018in\u2019 there. To have form may be seen as an aspect of matter. In other words, where there is mind there must be body. What is a metaphysical claim? In order to conclude that mind is not possible without a body, appeal was made neither to logic alone nor to physics. Rather, appeal was made to the nature of mind and of matter that should obtain regardless of the particular physics. The appeal is made to the essential nature of the things in themselves\u2014i.e. to the real or to their very existence (being). Which is metaphysical. A metaphysical claim about a kind of object is one for which appeal must be made to its essential nature rather than the particular nature of the kind of object in a particular world (e.g. our world).

As such, it is concerned with explaining the features of reality that exist beyond the physical world and our immediate senses. ... Second, there are many philosophical problems that are now considered to be metaphysical problems (or at least partly metaphysical problems) that are in no way related to first causes or unchanging things\u2014the problem of free will, for example, or the problem of the mental and the physical. ...
