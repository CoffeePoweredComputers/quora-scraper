            "answer_text": "Because we fail to look at the bigger picture out of our own ignorance. Being a blind spot, how can we know what we are ignorant of? Not until we learn something new or gain a new perspective will we know any better\u2026 Our world is a world of duality predicated on balance - a balancing act among opposites of all types. Charlie Lutes was a helper to many people and he used to like to say that the human is always putting things out of balance while nature is always putting it back into balance. In fact, he would add that the balancing act of cause-and-effect is actually secondary to the prime motive of nature which is that all things must grow. But be that as it may\u2026 Since balance must be achieved at all times while processes are in motion, there\u2019s no waiting around for it to happen later on. I think this is the way nature works. But this is definitely not the way the human works which is why we are a poor judge of nature. We are always putting off the balancing of causes with their effects. In fact, we run away from effects more often than not! Anyway\u2026 Because of the immediacy to which balance must be achieved at all times, in fact\u2026 Think about it\u2026 Could we really have a highway which only goes in one direction? Of course not! We have people busily going in one direction and on the opposite side of the street people are going in the opposite direction. And if I go to the market to get food, I know I have to come home to eat it after a return trip to park my car in the garage. So even from our own examples, we know there is a bidirectionality to our movement but again we make the mistake of thinking that one follows after the other not both at the same time. And this is probably where we make our mistake with electricity. You know we like to say that the glass is either half full or half empty. But there\u2019s more to it than that\u2026 If I should turn the glass upside down after first sealing the top side closed, then the top half which was empty is now at the bottom end of the glass while the bottom half which was full is now at the top half of the glass. They\u2019ve both switched sides. Compounding this shortsightedness of western civilization is that we don\u2019t like to think that other people might have something to teach us (maybe not so much about stuff so much as how to look at the same stuff in a new way). Take the symbol of the yang versus the yin of the Tao in which the white half of the circle is swirling around chasing the tail end of the dark side of the circle which is also chasing around after the tail end of the white side of the circle in a never ending tail chasing among the two halves chasing each other\u2018s tails\u2026  So in a sense, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with electrical flow in which we have two entities call them white and dark or whatever else you wish to call them - and each is chasing each other\u2018s tail in the sense that when one scoots to one side of the circuit the other scoots to the other side to take the place of the other that already scooted away to always maintain balance despite the movement of the two types of electricity. We can take this analogy a little bit further\u2026 The \u201cI Ching\u201d, also known as the Chinese Book of Changes, is composed of 64 hexagrams predicated on eight trigrams in which each trigram is predicated upon three lines and each line is either broken or solid. Two out of the eight trigrams are primary because they are purely made up of one type of line: either solid or broken whereas six are secondary due to being a mixture of both solid and broken lines. The one with three solid lines is called Chien while the three broken lines is called K\u2019un. Chien is considered to be creative energy while K\u2019un is receptive intelligence and each have their analogues in the Vedic tradition (next-door to China in India) in which creative energy is the Vedic Sat and K\u2019un is Chit as well as a third principal left out of the equation is Ananda - Bliss. What I mean to draw your attention to is our monopolistic shortsightedness in attending to energy but forgetting about intelligence. Let me give an example\u2026 When we sit in a stadium filled with lots of people watching a game such as soccer, sometimes we like to play a game with ourselves among our fellow members of the audience to amuse ourselves throughout the game by doing what\u2019s called \u201cthe wave\u201c in which we stand up and sit down in a specific timing of sequencing which lends the appearance (from a distance; let\u2019s say, the opposite side of the stadium) that a wave is actually moving sideways across and around the stadium despite the fact that nobody is moving from one side to the other - everyone is simply standing up, raising their arms, and sitting down, and lowering their arms, but in the correct sequence. We can even have a wave speed up or slow down and have multiple waves going in opposite directions at the same time crossing each other and all because we stand up and sit down at the right moment in time with respect to our neighbor on either side of us\u2026  To top this off, there\u2019s a fellow on YouTube who did some short movies and one of them demonstrates this principle very adroitly and adds how a ball can be moved sideways despite the fact that the rods underneath are only moving up and down in a specific sequence\u2026 Skip ahead to 10 minutes\u2026  I enjoy using this example to demonstrate my view of electricity in that it\u2019s not so much that energy travels down the wire so much as it is intelligence that is traveling down the wire. There is certainly energy at each point in the copper wire, but there is an intelligence traveling down the wire letting each atom of copper know when to do it\u2019s little dance of standing up and raising its arms (increasing the energy at that point in the wire) and sitting down and lowering its arms (so to speak) to give the impression that energy is moving down the wire when in fact such is not the case. Instead, energy is increasing and decreasing at each atomic point along the wire within a specific sequence to give the impression that a ripple of energy is traveling down the wire which is merely an impression born of our human brain. Our brain wants to recognize patterns and impose these patterns upon nature to help us reason our way through our observations. But we run the risk of also deriving false conclusions. Thank you Professor Laithwaite for a beautiful demonstration of this principle! So regardless of what we call these two types of electricity, at least one thing we can be certain: they complement each other in whatever they do. At least that\u2019s a beginning to our understanding while we continue to scratch our collective heads over the mystery of it all.

            "answer_text": "Freeman Dyson once remarked, \u201c\u2026Feynman told me about his \u2018Sum over Histories\u2019 version of quantum mechanics. \u2018The electron does anything it likes,\u2019 he said. \u2018It just goes in any direction at any speed, forward or backward in time, however it likes, and then you add up the amplitudes and it gives you the wave-function.\u2019 I said, \u2018You\u2019re crazy.\u2019 But he wasn\u2019t.\u201d Here\u2019s what Richard Feynman says about Electrical Theory: (By the way Feynman shared the Nobel Prize for Quantum Electrodynamics [QED] which is the complete quantum mechanical description of electromagnetism). In the Feynman Lectures we read: \u2018\u2018We ask what happens in a piece of resistance wire when it is carrying a current. Since the wire has resistance, there is an electric field along it, driving the current. Because there is a potential drop along the wire, there is also an electric field just outside the wire, parallel to the surface. There is, in addition, a magnetic field which goes around the wire because of the current. The E and B are at right angles; therefore there is a Poynting vector directed radially inward, as shown in the figure. There is a flow of energy into the wire all around. It is of course, equal to the energy being lost in the wire in the form of heat. So our \u2018\u2018crazy\u2019\u2019 theory says that the electrons are getting their energy to generate heat because of the energy flowing into the wire from the field outside. Intuition would seem to tell us that the electrons get their energy from being pushed along the wire, so the energy should be flowing down \u2014or up! along the wire. But the theory says that the electrons are really being pushed by an electric field, which has come from some charges very far away, and that the electrons get their energy for generating heat from these fields. The energy somehow flows from the distant charges into a wide area of space and then inward to the wire.\u2019\u2019 ",
