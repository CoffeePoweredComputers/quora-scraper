            "answer_text": "How can an object lose momentum, but maintain motion, Friction can slow it down. Drag can slow it down. A force can slow it down, as an object moving upward from the earth. especially if the collision stops the object? Well, if it stops the object, motion is not maintained, by definition. ",
