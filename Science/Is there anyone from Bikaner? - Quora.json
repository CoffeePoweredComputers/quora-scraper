            "answer_text": "I am not from Bikaner. I\u2019m born and brought up in Jodhpur and have lived in Jaipur, Delhi, London, and Bangalore and now have started living in Bikaner. The journey to Bikaner has been really interesting and that is the material for another answer sometime. Why Bikaner? What made me come here? We (my family and I) opening a fashion design institute in Bikaner. I am the Director of the Bikaner campus, hence cannot operate an educational institute living in any other city. This institute is an international brand name and have campuses all over India and abroad. How I am finding the city?? Every relocation has a \u201csettling down curve\u201d, which everyone has to go through. What I have learnt after living in all those cities is that one should give at least a year to understand and then judge the city. From surface level its huge difference in the weather of Bangalore (last city I lived in) and Bikaner. Though I\u2019m bred in Jodhpur still after living years in a pleasant 28 degrees all the time - sudden heat of Bikaner is definitely affecting me and my dog. Having said this, I have nothing against the weather of any city. It will take time for me to get habitual of this heat. I am still getting a hang of this city. I am a professional yoga coach too, so soon will be starting to teach here in this city too. This has always helped me making my social circle. I love meeting people and making friends and I hope this city will give me a lot of opportunity to do so. I will update this answer with some stories about Bikaner after a few months as and when I\u2019ll get time. ",
