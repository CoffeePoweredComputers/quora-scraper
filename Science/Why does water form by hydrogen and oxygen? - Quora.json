            "answer_text": "I shall also begin with a question. If you apply algebraic formula how many permutations combinations are possible? If you are a snience college student you will be able to tell. My mathematics is weak. H2 is +1 valency and O2 is -2 valency. Both are highly reactive and have great chemical affinity towards each other. So when they come together and get a spark, H2O is formed and nothing else can be formed. Not HO, not OH, not even O2H. And in common language, H2O is called water. ",

            "answer_text": "Water is not formed by hydrogen and oxygen, it is the other way, that is hydrogen and oxygen combine to form a molecule which is commonly known as water and in science known as H2O. If we take 2 atoms of hydrogen and 1 atom of oxygen, then they combine by hydrogen bond and form a molecule which we commonly know as water. ",
