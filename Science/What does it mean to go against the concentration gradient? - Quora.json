            "answer_text": "Both answers are right, so far. I would just like to show you a different point of view. It may clarify your mind about this topic. Going against the concentration gradient means that this process is going against its natural way or - in the physical-chemical point of view - against its spontaneous way. Using Kyle's \"humanized\" example: Think of you very confortable in a big house in a small town in the countryside. Then, you decide to move to Tokyo, and that means you will have to face traffic jams, cubicles as apartments, crowed streets and subways. Consequently, you will definetely not be as confortable as before. In a straightforward line of thought, why would you change your relaxing life to a stressful one? In a chemical approach, let's suppose that you just dropped a spoon of sugar in a cup of water. In the sucrose (sugar molecule) \"point of view\", why would it stay in the sugar crystal (the solid, compact, undissolved sugar - Tokyo) instead of going to the pure water (the free space for the sugar molecules - the Countryside)? If you keep watching the sugar crystals in that cup for a long time, you will see that they will dissolve gradually, populating the unsaturated zones of the liquid water, spontaneously. In Physical-Chemistry, going against the concentration gradient is an energy demanding process, since the solute molecules (sucrose) are more stable in low concentration environments, where solvent molecules (H2O) are free to \"embrace\" solutes, rather than in highly concentrated ones. If you want a more detailed approach, look for Gibbs Free Energy related to dissolution processes. I hope to have helped you! ",

            "answer_text": "To go against a concentration gradient is to go to a place of higher concentration from a place of lower concentration. As a human, you can imagine going against the concentration gradient when you travel from rural plains to a major city, because you are going to a place of higher population density - there are more people in the same amount of area. Going against the concentration gradient usually comes into play with active transport in cells. If there is double the concentration of glucose inside the cell as there is outside of the cell, but the cell needs to bring in more glucose, it expends energy to bring the glucose in against its concentration gradient.
