            "answer_text": "OK, I won\u2019t try to teach you Thermo, although I could do it better than some other answers, that are, at the most, doubtful. But this is too lengthy for Quora. The problem with temperature was that we take a long time to find out what it was exactly. Specifically, with other magnitudes such as mass and length, it is crystal clear what the zero means, the absence of the magnitude. Zero mass or zero length. But what is the absence of temperature??? It took a very long time to find out, and the explanation is in the second and third laws of Thermo, that are pretty difficult to explain here in Quora. (And please don\u2019t trust other answers that tell you that zero temperature is equivalent to zero molecular velocity; this is simply NOT true.) Once it was discovered what absence of temperature meant, it was possible to define units of temperature. They were called \u201cabsolute\u201d scales to distinguish them from the \u201crelative\u201d scales used previously. These are based on two fixed points, have negative values and not a definite minimum or zero. Absolute scales have a common zero and no negative values, so that only one fixed point is needed, to fix the size of the unit. The Kelvin is an absolute scale that has the same size as the degree Celsius (\u00baC). An absolute scale called Rankine (\u00baR) was also defined with the same size as the degree Farenheit (\u00baF). It is also absolute, and its zero coincides with 0 K, but no formal definition was never issued, so that the symbol degree \u201c\u00ba\u201d has not been omitted, and the Kelvin unit is considered the only absolute scale. Of course, depending on the value assigned to a given fixed point, infinite absolute scales are possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Temperature is a measure of kinetic energy possessed by molecules of a particular substance. At absolute zero temperature molecules stop their motion at all so they don't have any kinetic energy. this absolute zero is used as zero Kelvin in Kelvin scale.In Celsius scale the freezing/melting point of water used as the reference. when we measure the temperature of a substance in Celsius scale, we actually measure the difference between the molecular kinetic energy of water at its melting point and molecular kinetic energy of that substance. When we say something is at 0\u00b0C it doesn't mean that substance has zero average molecular kinetic energy but it means it has some average molecular kinetic energy and that is equal to that of water.This is why Kelvin scale is absolute scale. But according to the Third Law of Thermodynamics, it is impossible to reach absolute zero temperature, no matter how idealized processes are carried out in a finite number of cycles.",
