            "answer_text": "How big are the stars in the sky? Here\u2019s the Earth\u2019s size in comparison to our Sun.  For a perspective, approximately 1,000,000 Earth sized planets would fit INSIDE our Sun. And here\u2019s Earth and our Sun compared to some other planets and stars.  Note Betelgeuse, the first star and smallest start in picture #5. Betelgeuse 1.234 BILLION km in diameter. The Earth is 119.6 Million km from the sun. In other words, if the Sun was to be replaced by Betelgeuse, the Earth would be buried DEEP INSIDE Betelgeuse. Now look at picture #6. NY Canis Majoris is 1.9758 Billion km in diameter. If the Earth was in the same orbit around NY Canis Majoris, our Sun would be less than 10% of the way to NY Canis Majoris\u2019s surface. Saturn at its most distant from our Sun is 1.51 Billion Kilometers from the Sun. In other words, NY Canis Majoris is so large that Saturn would also be within NY Canis Majoris. That should give you an idea of how large stars can be. ",

            "answer_text": "NOTE: This answer refers to the apparent size of the stars in the sky, per the original question; not to their absolute size. They are points of light. No single stars except the sun is big enough/close enough to notice any size, even with a strong telescope. However, many DSOs (deep sky objects) like star clusters and nebulae, actually appear quite large in terms of arc minutes in the sky. But are so feint that without a telescope the appearance is masked and they just look like points of light too. (btw, this answer assumes you know what stars are. If not, please read this first. Star - Wikipedia.) ",

            "answer_text": "They are all different sizes, many much larger than our sun. Some that appear to be single stars are actually star clusters, nebulae, or galaxies whose nature is only distinguishable with a telescope. Planets in our solar system, though much smaller, are closer to us than stars, and so may also be mistaken for stars, but because they change their position in relation to the rest of the sky, the ancients called them something else\u2014the word \u201cplanet\u201d is derived from a Greek word meaning \u201cwanderer.\u201d ",

Answered in the way it was stated: They are practically infinitely small, since all visible stars in earth\u2019s sky (possibly excepting Betelgeuse) have no angular size and are only points of light. For Betelgeuse- see below: \u201c - \u2026 researchers, using a uniform disk model, determined that Betelgeuse had a diameterof 0.047 arcseconds, although the stellar disk was likely 17% larger due to the limb darkening, resulting in an estimate for its angular diameter of about 0.055\". - \u201cBetelgeuse - Wikipedia ",
