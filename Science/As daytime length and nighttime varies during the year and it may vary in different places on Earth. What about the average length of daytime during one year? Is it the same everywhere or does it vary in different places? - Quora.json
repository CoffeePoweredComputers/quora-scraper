            "answer_text": "I have answered this many times. The answer is very easily provable! Ignoring variation the day is considered to be 24 hours from midnight to midnight, the year to be 365 days long. Therefor in a year there are: 24 x 365 = 8760 hours. At the Equator the day - sunrise to sunset is 12 hours - again varies slightly. Which means that half the day is and half is night - sunset to sunrise. Therefore the Equator receives: 8760 \u00f7 2 = 4380 hours day and 4380 hours night. Now the poles: Sunrise at the North Pole occurs at the Northern Spring Equinox - on or about 21st March, each year and sunset occurs at the Northern Autumn Equinox. A period of 6 months. Meaning the Polar day is 6 months long and the Polar night also 6 month this long. Or the pole has a half year day and a half year night. This equals a 4380 hours day and a 4380 hours night. The same phenomena occurs at the South pole - the difference being that when it is day at the North Pole, it is night at the South Pole and vice versa. Therefore ALL parts of the Earth experience the same length of day spread over the year. Variations do in the Earths orbit etc; do cause the true value to be different. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you classify twilight! And whether the day/night divide is at the top edge of the Sun or when the middle of the Sun crosses the horizon. And whether you allow for refraction due to the atmosphere. And whether it is the local horizon or theoretical horizon that matters. If you take all of these into account the answer can be rather complicated. But we can say the average over the year is essentially 12 hours day and 12 hours night across the entire Earth. We can also say that there is more twilight at higher latitudes (both North and South) than there is at the Equator. If twilight is considered part of the day rather than part of the night, as most people would do, then the average length of daytime in New York or Melbourne is longer than that in Singapore [math]\\ddot\\smallsmile[/math] ",
