            "answer_text": "You have plenty of time to decide on a career. While you\u2019re figuring that out over the next 4\u20136 years or so, keep in mind that if you choose something you don\u2019t actually enjoy, your adult life will be miserable until you change careers. Also, people graduate from college and realize that their major is not something they want to pursue in the form of a career. There is something to be said for choosing a career that will provide a comfortable income and an opportunity to save aggressively for the expenses you\u2019ll have as you get older, especially after you have retired from your career. There are quite a few careers that are lucrative, so limiting yourself to medicine or computer science\u2014 especially at the age of 15\u2014 is ill-advised. Between now and high school graduation, explore extra-curricular activities that are in diverse disciplines. Maybe you\u2019ll like debate. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to become a politician or a lawyer. There are many careers in which being logical, being able to research facts, and being able to persuade are important. In some types of businesses, those skills are very important for marketing personnel. Marketing is a field that has a lot of monetary growth potential, if you eventually want to be in management. You might discover, around the age of 21\u201325, what personality characteristics you have that would be strengths in particular careers and what characteristics you have that suggest you should avoid certain careers. If you\u2019re a bit introverted, you would not want to become a wedding planner. If you are compassionate, you might find any of the helping careers (social worker, therapist, medical professional, etc.) a good match. People\u2019s personalities evolve between your age and their mid-20s. Don\u2019t pigeon-hole yourself with someone else\u2019s or your assumptions about your personality as it seems to be today. The best thing you can do for yourself for the next 4 years or so is to educate yourself broadly. Take advantage of elective courses. Be sure you take a course in civics. If you can, take one in psychology and/or philosophy. Do whatever you can to improve your vocabulary and ability to articulate your thoughts. Do something that involves team coordination and something else where you\u2019re 100% responsible for a substantial project\u2014 even if it\u2019s a project that you do at home. If you\u2019ve explored various disciplines or have practical experience in more than one type of field (e.g., a summer spent as a library volunteer, another summer spent working in a physical fitness center, an internship with a startup that is not in high-tech), you are going to be much more valuable to an employer. Those experiences also clarify your thinking\u2026 about a lot of things beyond career choices. Good luck. I hope you\u2019ll think of your current exploration of careers as a buffet table of all kinds of foods. Some you know you\u2019ll like, some you\u2019ll know just by looking at them that you do not even want that food on your plate. And then there are those that you will taste and think about whether they\u2019re to your liking or not. ",

            "answer_text": "You have time to learn. I suggest you consider planning to go to college at a school that lets you decide your major after your Freshman year. As a Freshman take the courses that would be needed for both a pre-med degree and a computer science or software engineering or computer engineering degree. For example, chemistry and calculus would be required for all of these in most good schools. Also take some introductory computer science courses and biology. Pre-med will require that you take biology. This will be a tough set of courses, but both of these fields require you to be tough. By the time you complete your first year, you may have a much better idea of what you like and what you are good at. If you don\u2019t like biology, forget medicine as a career. If you don\u2019t like computer science courses, forget that. If you hate the chemistry and the calculus, perhaps neither medicine nor computer science is right for you. A good school will have guidance counselors and helpful professors to help you work your way through this. Your parents have good intentions and are recommending a field that has traditionally been a good one for a person\u2019s career, but parents don\u2019t always see the future as well as their children. Ultimately you have to live your life and you have to like what you do in order to get past the rough patches. I majored in math as an undergraduate and went on to study computer science. This was in the 1960\u2019s. My math professors thought I was wasting my time on a fad (CS) and my parents thought I should become an engineer or a physicist. I went for computer science because I liked doing it and did well at it and ended up hiring out of work physicists and mathematicians to work for me in computer science jobs. Medicine will likely remain a good, solid career, but only if you actually like it and are good at it. I\u2019ve known a number of people who got into medicine because of parental pressure, ended up hating it, and eventually moved on to something else. Computer science will give you a foundation for many possible computer related careers. The field of computing is rapidly advancing, so don\u2019t limit yourself to what will get you a job today - learn the fundamentals of the field so you can move into whatever the field becomes. ",
