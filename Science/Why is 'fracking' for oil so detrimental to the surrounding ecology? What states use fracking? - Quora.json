            "answer_text": "I am going to try to get past the mythology and nonsense and get you the facts. Let\u2019s begin with how the first oil well was constructed in 1848. Simply a steam powered drilling machine constructed a round hole about 60 feet deep. This machine was targeting a layer known to have oil. The oil seeped up into the creek nearby and the men estimated the slope of the rocks where the oil came up and they drilled deep inside the ground and when they intercepted the rocks they hit oil coming out in large quantities. The hole was basically a small round hole. The amount of the oil that could come out was limited by the surface were the oil leaked out and the size of the hole. Holes were drilled all over. Very soon the pressure of oil began to drop off and the drilling moved deeper and people began to look for better ways to get the oil. By the 1860\u2019s men drilling oil wells had already begun dropping black powder bombs into the bottom of the wells to shatter up the rock and allow more oil to get out. This practice by the 1860\u2019s to 1870\u2019s found Nitroglycerin replacing black powder only because it was more powerful and dynamite was not likely damaged under water. This is written up in \u201cA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\u2019s Court\u201d by Mark Twain in the 1870\u2019s. It was a well known process by this time. His story discusses using such a bomb to open up a water well. By 1900 the blasting of oil wells was almost a universal practice. The bombs got very powerful weighing hundreds of pounds. Fancier explosives were developed in the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s. By 1960\u2019s in the \u201cAtoms for Peace\u201d program 4 natural gas wells were blasted with Atomic Bombs for fracturing the rock for collection of natural gas from \u201ctight shale\u201d.  It was very successful in getting the gas but the radioactive features made use of the gas unsafe. When the oil business moved into the area of Mobile Bay and South Louisiana in a big way in the 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s the wells they drilled became extremely long and amazingly large. A typical such well was somewhere between 5 and 7 miles long and also was 62 inches in diameter. They ran into a serious problem. The rocks were moving. The rocks were moving about 5\u2032 every decade. A big well would get pinched off in just a decade. At this time they fell back on a discovery accidentally made in Texas in the 1900\u20131920 period. One oil man was drilling deeper and deeper he thought. Then his drill bit surfaced some distance away. This technology and been studied and become directional drilling. The oil industry in Mobile Bay used this technology to punch a well down and angle it through the moving rocks so much that this slide of 5\u2032 a decade would not matter for 50 years or so. In doing so they learned that if they drilled along this slide they also got lots more gas and oil. What had happened was that they now had miles of surface area on their well. This was a bonanza. It was one of the biggest discoveries of oil and natural gas on earth. Then they started punching lots of holes along this geologic trend. Then the oil men about the same time began to experiment with a new method. They would take water under high pressure very high pressure to pry apart the rocks and make a well not only a mile long but maybe a quarter of a mile wide. This would allow the oil to flow more easily. Then they found the rocks resealed after the water so they tried adding sand and some chemicals. This relied on 3-D seismic studies of the rock and directional drilling. Today they can map out the rocks and drill very precisely were they want to go. By the 2005 time frame the basic processes for this were pretty well worked out. The chemical, sand, water mixes were pretty much figured out. I am sure there have been continual refinements. The big problem was that in order to bring the well into production they had to remove the water mixture from the well before the oil came out. There was oil in this mix now. They had to dispose of the water somewhere. Their solution was to drill a disposal well to bury this deep in the earth. These are injection wells. Today the oil or gas wells are even blasted with explosive shaped charges to guide the fracking fluids. It sort of has gone full circle. Now that you have the history and processes, here comes the problems and what has been found. The first problem was that these wells produced massive amounts of oil but fairly quickly the oil displaced the sand and the wells stopped producing and had to be fracked again. This was expensive. This problem remained until the oil industry had a major downturn about 2014. As this happened the owners of wells put in tiny restricting holes into the wells to keep the pressure up. This was simply to preserve the wells until the price came up. Instead it solved the problem with the wells dropping off and needing re-fracking. Now the wells stayed fixed. In the period of about 2008/2009 there began to be lots of reports of contamination in shallow water wells with natural gas and more.  This mostly happened in the Pennsylvania oil/gas fields.  The depth of the fracked wells was about 700 to 1900 feet deep. Now days much deeper wells are drilled. The water wells were typically less than 300 feet deep. Clearly in some locations the fracking had stressed the strata of the rock and cracked it making paths for the hydrocarbons to rise. The industry has made lots of efforts to call persons who complained liars but there is little doubt that the problems are real and the oil industry sort of quietly admitted the problem when they began supplying people trucked drinking water etc. These problems were at discrete locations. That is actually they were quite rare. These problems have appeared occasionally in other locations. Most companies have gotten the hint and are fixing their wells much better. In Arkansas in 2008 there began to appear another problem. In the region north and west of Little Rock in a natural gas development the people began to complain that there were earthquakes. Lots of earthquakes. While they were not very strong the whole place seemed to be shaking all the time. In one year there were recorded over 1,100 earthquakes and the State of Arkansas shut down further efforts and the earthquakes stopped. The industry denied any relationship but this had made it absolutely certain it was so. When you do something and get a problem and stop doing it and the problem goes away you sort of have the cause identified. As developments fanned out across the US in 2010 to 2014 these sites all began shaking with earthquakes. Typically these were minor events but they upset people and worried them. From 2009 to present there have been over 3,000 such earthquakes in oil/gas developments in Oklahoma. Similar numbers in ever such development anywhere they are done have been happening. Then the finger began to point not at the wells themselves but to the waste water disposal wells. In 2016 a massive earthquake occurred at depth and right near the site of an injection well.  This was a 5.9 earthquake site. It shook down buildings. It was bad. This is the epicenter and you can see a pad for the injection well on this property that has been closed down by this filming at the pad side. The USGS late to the game finally admitted about 2013 that this was an earthquake risk and then it began to admit that the shaking was a danger to integrity of dams and public safety. At this time the most seismically active area in the US is related to this area where this 2016 earthquake happened. (Red Marker is Earthquake epicenter.) Shortly thereafter the location of nearly all of these earthquakes was identified as being related to injection wells. These waste disposal wells were shoving underground massive quantities of water and other mess. A typical fracking well shoves underground about enough water to cover 10 acres 1 foot deep. Imagine shoving 1,000 times that underground at one well. Now here are the problems with fracking. In order to do it you must clear a site about 420 feet square and bulldoze it very flat. On about 1/2 of the area you construct a pond with walls about 15 feet high and plastic lined. (no leaks) A massive rig is moved in with 2 approximately 8,000 hp diesel engines and a tall derrick. The remainder of the space is used for parking vehicles as water must be trucked in to fill the pond. This involves several hundreds of semi truck loads coming into the site which are amazingly heavy. Once on site they unload bits, pipe, casing, fuel tanks, and much water with sand etc. The holes are drilled cased fracked and the water is removed and trucked for disposal, The rig is moved away and the production equipment such as tanks, pumps, fuels etc are set up. Pipelines are laid to connect nearby wells and carry the oil or gas to market. The damage to the environment is not minor.  Typical Fracking pads and production equipment of a producing field in Oklahoma northwest of Oklahoma City. You can see the large areas and the traces of the underground pipelines. In many areas the environment does not recover from these pad constructions for many decades. Otherwise the areas suffer during construction massive damage to roadways that were at best built for farm roads and suddenly are hauling traffic like an interstate Highway for these pads. The fracking industry has gotten much better over the years. Problems are reduced but not gone. Water consumption is another issue. The volumes of water required are simply massive. In many desert type areas this has sucked up large volumes of water for other uses. Down to the question details. Fracking was a problem early on but today most states have pretty much restricted this so that problems are getting rare now. Injection wells are seeing limits on their operations and seismic monitoring so that over injection is halted until the situation stabilizes. Fracking is used in most states. Some states prohibit it.  Many other plays have been added since 2010. Fracking is now in nearly every state except New York and Maryland. Deposits in Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota are now in massive fracking. Fracking is in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Oregon and Washington as well. Florida may have fracking but most areas in Florida are prohibited from oil/gas development. Alaska has fracking now as does much of the Coastal Waters of the US. Hawaii does not have any deposits. The map only shows some of the deposits. The Gulf of Mexico is full of this. The total number of fracked wells is probably in excess of a million. All oil and gas developments involve continual water withdrawals and typically it is salt water. It is also full of all sorts of oil related pollution. I am not trying to portray this practice as bad or good. It is very important and involves so many issues. I hope I have given you so much data on this process that now supplies more energy for the US and the world than ever thought possible. As I write this the US is at much tension with Iran. I hope it will be resolved without war. If it is, fracking will have been key to this peaceful resolve. Because it has made the US the worlds largest producer of oil and natural gas. The US is now the worlds largest exporter of natural gas and soon will be for oil as well. The safety and security of mankind depends on these energy supplies. It would be horridly unfair of me to tell you problems with this without telling you that it is also extremely important for the peace, safety and prosperity of all mankind. No process is without risk, hazard or cost. Nothing of so much gain is ever without many complications. In human affairs too many people don\u2019t tell you the whole story. They leave you in fear and dread of only the the problems but do not tell you the benefits. From these wells comes most of the food, prosperity and security of free people in this world. This is expensive, dangerous, heroic and wonderful All are true of it. The men who develop these resources are the most heroic men in all history, daily handling dangers and risks you cannot imagine. Everything in your world depends on these men. The people who sell you on solar and wind power do not tell you that their industry would not even exist without these oil and gas men. They do not tell you the hazards of their industry as well. Before a solar field is even assembled to catch the sun, mountains have been blown apart. The rocks have been drenched with acid. Much pollution has been spread on the earth. NOTHING IS CLEAN. One of the dirtiest mines on earth is a copper mine. A silver/gold mine is even worse. The rare earth for doping solar cells is beyond dirty in processing. That is why it is in China not the USA. Solar cells have silver on them. Magnets for wind power are very dirty in their manufacture, mining and refining. Even aluminum mines and such are very dirty and polluting. ",

            "answer_text": "I will answer the 2nd part of the question first. The State of Maryland where I live has banned fracking. \u201cWhile the U.S. is lagging behind in the effort to stop the ill effects of global climate crisis, states like Vermont, Washington, Maryland and New York have passed bans. Both Georgia and Florida have attempted these bans as well\u201d (dated August 25, 2019). States With Fracking Bans Are Still Building Fracking Infrastructure As to the 1st question, why is fracking oil so harmful, I would say that most of the fuss is about fracked gas. From the same article\u2026: \u201cThe fossil fuel industry claims that fracked gas is a cleaner energy source than coal, but in this assessment, it neglects to account for the emissions that come from transporting the gas. Noelle Picone, the Williams Pipeline campaign lead from the New York City chapter of the Surfrider Foundation, told Truthout that from the beginning process through transport, fracked gas is \u201c84 times more potent a climate actor than other fossil fuels.\u201d Methane emissions from fracking account for one-third of all U.S. methane emissions and more than 3 percent of the total U.S. greenhouse emissions. Community engagement coordinator for the Sane Energy Project Lee Ziesche told Truthout that from the fracking well head to the point of use, there is a 5 to 12 percent leakage of methane. Fracking also poisons the water and wildlife, and contributes to climate change. Areas with high levels of fracking have also experienced earthquakes, flooding, cancer clusters, and fires and explosions at compressor stations and on the trains and ships transporting the fracked gas. Fracked gas is \u201c84 times more potent a climate actor than other fossil fuels.\u201d More than 90 percent of the water injected underground to frack gas wells never returns to the surface, removing it from the water cycle and contributing to water scarcity. Meanwhile, as fracking has expanded, so has the volume of waste generated. Between 2010 and 2011, fracking waste went up by 70 percent in Pennsylvania. Thanks to a regulatory gap often referred to as the Halliburton Loophole, fracking is exempt from several pieces of federal regulation that protect the environment: the Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and National Environmental Policy Act, to name a few.\u201d Here is also another link that will help you understand all the problems associated with fracking oil and gas: Fracking, Oil and Gas Development | American Rivers There are a lot of people out there, like Oil & Gas lobbyists, people that work in the Big Oil & Gas industries, politicians, and people uneducated on the topic, who reject any assertion that fracking is a problem. The first 3 groups are self-serving special interest groups that want to re-write or ignore scientific reports that strive to limit their environmentally harmful industry. The last group, uneducated people, are those who either have not read or do not understand the scientific reports. ",
