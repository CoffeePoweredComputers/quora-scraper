            "answer_text": "The intuitive answer to this question seems to be \u201cyes, of course, because there is nothing between atoms.\u201d When we are at the level of space between atoms, however we are in the quantum world where the concepts from the macro world we live in don\u2019t apply. We normally think of vacuum as very low or zero air pressure. Outer space is considered a near vacuum, having about one particle per cubic centimeter. It gets down to a matter of definitions. the answer to this question all depends on what you call a vacuum. If one equates space, with vacuum, then yes there is vacuum, not only between atoms, but within atoms themselves. In a single atom, the distance between the nucleus and the electrons in the lowest orbital (not orbit, electrons do not orbit the nucleus like planets) is immense. If a nucleus were the size of a star the nearest electron would be at least as far away as Pluto. When we analyze the atoms even closer, the fact that on the quantum level the lines between a wave and a particle are not so clearly defined. Atoms consist of fluctuating energy fields. Pinning down the precise position of a particle is not possible. If Pluto was an electron and the Sun was an atomic nucleus, at any given moment it could be found almost anywhere in the solar system. Is that a vacuum, then? On the level of reality we live on, concepts like 3 dimensional objects and the space between them, make perfect sense. Vacuum, as something we experience on our level of reality, simply does not exist on the quantum level. It has a strong relationship to the concept of atmospheric pressure. Pressure is created by the presence of gas molecules that have some kinetic energy. There is no comparable force when we evaluate the space between two atoms. The primary force operating on that level is the electromagnetic force. The force of gravity between two atoms is extremely weak. The strong atomic force is within the nucleus, and does not extend long distances. In this sense of the term, I\u2019d say that vacuum is not the correct way to think about space at the atomic scale. What exists there are fluctuating energy fields where nothing is 100% certain.  Is this a vacuum?  This is the old concept of the atom. It tries to model the quantum world in terms we understand from our macro reality. This is why I prefer not to think of space as vacuum or not vacuum at this level. ",

            "answer_text": "Only very tiny traction of volume of an atom is occupied by electons and nucleus. These two itself in turn gain their majority of mass through quantum vibrations. If you consider an atom to be of size of a football field, then it's nucleus is of size of football. So yes, most of the portion of an atom is an empty space. But this empty space also has energy fields as proposed in unified field theory. So no, space inside an atom is not empty simultaneously. ",
