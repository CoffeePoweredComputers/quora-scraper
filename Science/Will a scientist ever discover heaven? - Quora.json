            "answer_text": "No, one cannot ever discover heaven, one can only gain entry into it by; In the name of Allah/ God Almighty, Most Gracious, Most Merciful 1. Any ordinary person regardless of his worldly title can be admitted into highest Jannatul-Fridaus. The condition for entry into Highest Heaven/ Jannatul-Firdaus is faith Allah/ God Almighty and Aamaale-Salihah (performance of good deeds). The Holy Quran declares \u201cThose who have Iman ( unshakable Faith in God Almighty) and do righteous deeds shall have the gardens of Firdaus in heaven\u2026\u201d (Quran, Surah Kahf, verse 107, Chpt 18:107). Now what are these righteous deeds that render a person elegible to entry into Firdaus in heaven? The Holy Quran describes these righteous deeds in the following verses. \u201c Successful are the believers, those who offer their salaah with humility and submission, and those who shun futile deeds (vices, all evil deeds), and those who discharge zakaat (obligatory charity for those with means to do so), and those who guard their private parts from immorality (practice chastity) except from their wives and slaves (the verse was revealed when people still had slaves); they are free of blame but whoever seeks beyond that, they are transgressors. And those who are considerate towards their trusts and covenants and those who strictly guard their (five daily) prayers. These are indeed the inheritors who will inherit the Firdaus wherein they will dwell forever.\u201d (Quran Surah Muminoon, Chpt 18: 1-11) Matthew 19:16-26 16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? 17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. 18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, 19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? 21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. 23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. 24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 25 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? 26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. In other words, we as human have to strive to the best of our sincere abilities to keep God\u2019s Commandments please and he The Almighty will reward us according to the extent of our sincere efforts to please in his Heavenly Abode, Garden of Aden, Jannaatul Firadaus (all is that place where no-one can discover not even scientists). Unknown to scientists, the universe that we know is the minutest and the lowest one. In the Quran Allah- God Almighty tells us that he has created 7 heavens. ",

            "answer_text": "It might disappoint you, but this is my honest answer.I do not think it will ever happen, because and this is important, because it makes no sense! Nature shows us there is a constant struggle for space, prey, or food and water in general. Then if all is nice, things change and we and all other living things struggle again. This is not a punishment, but it forces us to adapt physically, be creative and innovative. The story of paradise is not about 2 people who did wrong, it is an attempt to explain why we want a paradise and why we no longer can reach it.But try to imagine you are god. What would be the purpose of heaven? A kind of \u2018Big Brother Show\u2019 for gods? If you look at our history, it repeats itself again and again with little variations, which would not come as a surprise for an all knowing deity. For me, it would be boring!Now look at your neighbors. What happens to those who have no problems? They get fat and stupid! Their creative and mental abilities decline rapidly.You see, heaven is not a good place to be. And it is said that goes on for eternity. I assume after a few 100 years you are like a vegetable and no longer would realize it, but then you are no longer bright you!. ",
