            "answer_text": "Check out my answer at: Nathan Coppedge's answer to When will we discover/formulate a successful theory of everything?  Basically, theories of everything already exist. They're just much simpler than the scientists expect, or happen to not be mathematical. Since math was proven incoherent, I don't know why math would seem like an obvious choice anymore. Perhaps it is appealing because it is so bound up in incoherencies. A scientific theory is possible, but scientists must accept that the ultimate boundary of everything will change more than once, just as it happened with the Copernican Revolution and the discovery of other galaxies, not to mention theories of those galaxies. Scientific theories, unlike metaphysical knowledge, must be both externally and internally coherent. By assuming they refer to both an internal and an external world, they are adopting assumptions which may limit the importance of their findings. Internal coherence means the system has a logic which applies to everything. This suggests that it is concept-limited and can be expanded to lesser or greater complexity-levels. External coherence is merely its ability to represent all facts or fixed truths about the world. It might be doubted that mathematics could do this without being a universal language. Thus, the two major requirements for a grand-unified theory appear to be: Applies to everything.Universal language.Notice how the first element merely engages with everything in some way. The second element is more like omniscience. The second element implies that a standard is being applied, because otherwise knowledge becomes identical with experience. So, from a philosophical perspective you can cheat, and possibly get better results. All you need to do is: Create a coherent system that describes all truths (as I have done), or:Assume that what is meant by universal is simply the experiences everyone has. Since science is concept-limited even at the universal level, it appears there is no alternative to using some form of coherence to reach grand-unification. If math is incoherent, then math is not an option, since incoherence opposes coherence. Or, we could conclude that science must become irrational, which not many scientists would agree with.Resolving irrationality vs. rationality may be a necessary standard tool if progress is to be made while still holding the scientist accountable. Otherwise, the options are (each separately): Science is concept-limited.Omniscience.Hume's arrow.So, the real options are (referring to the reverse order of the previous four): Extreme empiricism,Extreme philosophy,Extreme creativity, andExtreme paradoxes.These don't look like great options from a scientific point of view, but from what I can tell, that's what they are, at the ultra degree of science's future. Refer to the earlier sets as well. ",
