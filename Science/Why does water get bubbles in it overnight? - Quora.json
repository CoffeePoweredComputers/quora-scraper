            "answer_text": "When the water is put into the glass, the churning action causes very small amounts of atmospheric gases, such as nitrogen and oxygen, to be suspended in the water. Because of the viscosity of the water, many of these tiny bubbles, invisible to the naked eye, do not float to the top and out into the atmosphere. Over the course of the night, these tiny bubbles, which are microscopic in size, can coalesce and attach themselves as visible bubbles on imperfections on the glass. ",
