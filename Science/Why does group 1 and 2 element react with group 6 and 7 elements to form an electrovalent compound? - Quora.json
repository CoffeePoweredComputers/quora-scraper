            "answer_text": "Group 1 and 2 elements have 1 and 2 electron respectively extra. Hence they can donate these extra electrons to becomes electrically stable/ neutral. Whereas Group 6 and 7 elements have 2 and 1 electrons short to becomes neutral. Since there are donors and acceptors and whenever they come close to each other the electrons get shared and they form some compound by exchange of electrons. For eg Na +1 with Cl -1 forms NaClMg 2ith +2 joins S -2 to form MgS ",
