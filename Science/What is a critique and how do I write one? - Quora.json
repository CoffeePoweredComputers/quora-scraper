            "answer_text": "A critique is a critical appraisal of a subject. The subject can be pretty much anything but since you\u2019re asking this in the context of writing I\u2019ll answer in the very same. In a critique, you look at a work and assess its merits from the angle you care about (which may be aesthetic, formal, logical, a combination, or otherwise). A good critique will be generous in its interpretation while noting problems in the work. Critiques that are overly flattering or overly negative about a work tend to lose weight because they come across as biased or superficial. To write a critique, first engage with the work you are critiquing. Read the piece thoroughly taking notes where you have questions or where you notice strong points. Then write about these in detail. Depending on the scope of your critique it might be prudent to see if the work has been critiqued by others (preferably after you write your initial impression so that you are not influenced too directly). After reading these other critques see how your own critique holds up. Often times other critiques would have brought up your points better or missed things. Use all this to your advantage to make your own critque better. Nuance is the key to a good critique. You want to say something fresh that will shed new light on how to look at the work. Platitudes like \u201cthe author did a very good job\u201d are a waste of time for you and your reader. You have to dig a lot deeper to explain exactly what you mean by such feelings. But as with all writing projects the sooner you get writing the better. Start with something embarrassingly rough at the beginning of the process and keep polishing it as you learn more and be willing to let go of parts you\u2019ve poured sweat over if they are not working any more.

            "answer_text": "A critique is a collection of edits, thoughts, and commets about another writer's work that you put together with the objective of helping them improve. You can critique a paragraph, a chapter, a short story, or a whole novel. Different people critique different ways. Some give overviews, giving thier thoughts on the elements of a piece - character, flow, setting, pace. Other give a straight up copy edit, inserting commas as often as they remove them. Personaly, I like to give play-by-plays as I read, making copy edits but also giving my thoughts about a piece of dialog, a plot twist, highlighting a phrase I really like. There are general rules to follow when writing critiques. Crit the work, not the person. Don\u2019t say \u201cYou suck at dialog\u201d, say \u201cThe dialog feels off here,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t think this is how a teen would speak\u201d.Point out confusing sections, and try to say why they confused you. Granted, this can be hard to pin-point and will come with practice. Examples of why things might be confusing are too many pronouns, so its hard to know who is doing what. Things happened faster than you could follow. Or you need more infomation as a reader.Tell the author what you liked. This way they can keep doing it.Frame comments as your opinion. Don't say, \u201cYou know nothing about how xx works\u201d, say \u201cIn my experience, this is how xx goes\u201d or \u201cI find your protral of xx hurtful, cuz this.\u201dExplain things, if you can, so the author know what and why you're having issues with something.Be polite.If the author asked a particular question(s), answer them.If you did this with a word processor, instead of online, save the new file with your name and \u201cedits\u201d attached to help the author keep things straight. Also turn on tracking, so the author can see what changes you made.",
