            "answer_text": "Of course. For such a crucial idea, requiring significant action, there has been a huge amount of effort expended to ensure that the evidence and the conclusions from that evidence are correct. Each component of the idea of climate change caused by humans, has often been tested by at least 3 different lives of evidence. Let\u2019s consider just global temperature measurements and the evidence in support: Borehole measurements.Satellite measurements of the temperature of the atmospheric.Analysis of world wide surface meteorogical records from both surface stations and ships.The biggest thermometer of all, the level of the Earth\u2019s oceans measured by multiple methods, including satellites.Ocean buoy networks.See for boreholes: Borehole temperatures and past climates See for satellites: Satellite temperature measurements - Wikipedia See for surface measurements: Explainer: How do scientists measure global temperature? | Carbon Brief See for satellite sea level measurements: https://www.science.org.au/curious/earth-environment/how-we-measure-global-sea-level-changes-0 See for ocean buoy networks: part of the integrated global observation strategy Other observations that are affected by temperature are also checked for consistency such as: Plant growing seasons.Melting ice in the Arctic, Antarctic, Greenland and mountain glaciers in many locations around the world.Permafrost melting near the Arctic Circle.Taking all of these things together amounts to an extremely compelling case for global warming actually happening. Global warming was first predicted as a consequence of industrial activities in 1896. That\u2019s over 130 years ago. So for that prediction to be made then, and that it would actually be happening now only by coincidence, would be extremely remarkable. That the amount of warming seen is consistent with the amount of warming predicted is even more remarkable. So here is the breakdown of cause and effect: industrial activity produces carbon dioxide. Check.The measured increase in atmospheric and ocean CO2 comes from industrial activity. Check.Atmospheric CO2 produces a greenhouse effect that increases with the amount of CO2 and the magnitude of the effect matches theoretical calculations. Check.Measurements of different kinds show an upward trend counciding with the increase in atmospheric CO2. Check.All triple checked over and over again. It\u2019s hard to get a more reliable conclusion. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, we know that abnormal emissions of greenhouse gases must cause abnormal global warming. That\u2019s why the current abnormal global warming was predicted as early as the 19th century, when the greenhouse effect was already well known. So we blow abnormal amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. We know that this must cause global warming. And this global warming does indeed occur. And there is nothing else going on on the planet that could cause this warming event. It can hardly get more evident in science. I know that many people do not believe it, but they do not know any facts. In the 1990s fossil fuel companies started a campaign against climate science and succeeded to convince half of the US population that it is a hoax. Fortunately outside of the US those people are rare. They are most abundant in countries that are heavily involved in the fossil fuel industry; beside America that is Russia and Saudi Arabia, the three hot spots of climate science denial. ",
