            "answer_text": "Several reasons. First, it has not yet been possible to come up with a prediction that can be realistically be subjected to experimental test, and that would put it on a solid footing as theory above and beyond quantum mechanics and general relativity.Because there is no single string theory - there is a multiplicity of them.Because the many string theories allow for a very wide margin of explainability - i.e. they explain too much.Because the expected experimental signs of supersymmetry have yet to show up.Because it has not yet been possible even to write down fundamental equations for the theories that everybody agrees on.Because of the landscape problem - i.e. just about anything goes in string theory.Because it creates conundrums of its own - e.g. why most of the dimensions in the world we live in are tightly curled up and, so far, impervious to empirical detection?And all this after 40+ years of intense work by the best minds in the theoretical physics world. It might indeed be the case that string theory is the way to go, that we just need more time. However, with every passing year and nothing much really happening, as far as the physics of string theory is concerned, more and more are coming to the conclusion that string theory might be a dead end, at least as far as physics is concerned. The fact that some in the string theory community have adopted a non-compromising, stubborn position, to the extent that they are pooh-poohing the lack of empirical verification, in particular, and important aspects of the scientific method, in general, is not helping. String theory remains not even wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "If by \u201cless popular\u201d you mean that scientists aren\u2019t paying much attention to it, you\u2019d be right. There isn\u2019t an obvious way to prove ST, and some parts just don\u2019t seem to make sense at all (mathematically). Other areas just have better explanations, and by occam\u2019s razor, are ignored. Also, with the numerous variations and components including cosmic strings, 5 superstrings, and the possibly 26 spacetime dimensions, there is no way to tackle the verification/refutation of most of its ideas. However by \u201cpopularity\u201d you mean from the general public, I believe this theory has gained much more popularity due to the internet and pop-science celebrities, youtube channels, and website articles. The allure of the \u201ctheory of everything\u201d and the mindblowing idea that everything is a string attracts even people who were previously not interested in physics. ",
