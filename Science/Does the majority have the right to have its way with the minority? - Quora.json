            "answer_text": "We hold the truth that we are all created equal. You have no right to dominate other equals. If you want to dominate others you would have to make yourself superior, non-equal. After all, governments are instituted among men to secure Creator-endowed rights. The social compact theory of government says we give up some rights when we enter society. Yet twenty-nine years after the Constitution was written, this theory was refuted by Thomas Jefferson when he warned about this emerging dangerous theory. \u201cthe idea is quite unfounded that on entering into society we give up any natural rights.\u201d \u2013 letter to F. W. Gilmer 1816. Four thousand years ago we received instructions. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wealth, or anything else that is thy neighbors. 2150 years ago historian Polybius wrote The Histories Of the Roman Republic 220-146 BC, Book 6, section 9: \"But when a new generation arises and the democracy falls into the hands of the grandchildren of its founders, they have become so accustomed to freedom and equality that they no longer value them, and begin to aim at pre-eminence; and it is chiefly those of ample fortune who fall into this error. So when they begin to lust for power and cannot attain it through themselves or their own good qualities, they ruin their estates, tempting and corrupting the people in every possible way. And hence when by their foolish thirst for reputation they have created among the masses an appetite for gifts and the habit of receiving them, democracy in its turn is abolished and changes into a rule of force and violence. For the people, having grown accustomed to feed at the expense of others and to depend for their livelihood on the property of others, as soon as they find a leader who is enterprising but is excluded from the houses of office by his penury, institute the rule of violence; and now uniting their forces massacre, banish, and plunder, until they degenerate again into perfect savages and find once more a master and monarch.\" Notice his warning that democracy always changes into a rule of force and violence. Note his warning that democracies are \u201calways followed by a dictatorship\u201d. And 2000 years ago Plutarch said \"It is truly said that the first destroyer of the liberties of a people is he who gave them bounties and largesse. \" In 1770, Alexander Tyler, a Scottish history professor at the University of Edinburgh, in his book Cycles of Democracy, had this comparison with the fall of the Athenian Republic some 2,000 years earlier: \u201cA democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always vote for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that a democracy always collapses over a loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship.\" Alexander Hamilton: \" Real Liberty is never found in despotism or in the extremes of Democracy.\" James Madison, 1787, Federalist Paper #10: \"Democracy is the most vile form of government ... democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention: have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property: and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths. ... Theoretical politicians who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would at the same time be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions\u201dOf course democracies are \u201cspectacles of turbulence and contention.\u201d They are only for those who would take the risk of loosing their rights in exchange for the chance to dominate others. Patrick Henry: \"Show me that age and country where the rights and liberties of the people were placed on the sole chance of their rulers being good men without a consequent loss of liberty! I say that the loss of that dearest privilege has ever followed, with absolute certainty, every such mad attempt.\" Fisher Ames, who was the author of the words of the First Amendment, said: \"A democracy is a volcano which conceals the fiery materials of its own destruction. These will produce an eruption and carry desolation in their way.\" John Adams, 1815: \"Democracy ... while it lasts is more bloody than either [aristocracy or monarchy]. Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There is never a democracy that did not commit suicide.\"John Marshall, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court:\"Between a balanced Republic and a democracy, the difference is like that between order and chaos.\" \u201cA simple democracy is the devil's own government.\"[1],[2][1]. This must have been a popular saying. This quote is often attributed to several American patriots. Most often to Benjamin Rush, or Jedidiah Morse (the \"father of American Geography\"), but it was actually written by a Presbyterian pastor. L.H. Butterfield, ed., The Letters of Benjamin Rush, vol. 1 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1951), 454, quoting John Joachim Zubly, Presbyterian pastor and delegate to Congress, in a letter to David Ramsay in March or April 1788. [2]. William Elder, Questions of the Day, (Philadelphia: Henry Baird publisher, 1871) page 175, attributes the quote to Thomas Jefferson. ",

            "answer_text": "The traditional argument for this is that for the majority to not have its way is to value the individuals who make up the minority more than the individuals who make up the majority. If everyone's vote counts the same, the side with the majority of votes wins. Majoritarianism is thus defended by an appeal to equality and equal respect and concern, which are cornerstones of contemporary liberal thought.  There are problems with this, in my view particularly when it comes to persistent minorities. I think persistent minorities have a good claim to not be being treated with equal respect. Imagine there are 3 friends who each day decide to go for tea or coffee. 2 like tea, 1 coffee. Under a majoritarian system, they'd go for tea all the time. I think a solution that would treat all with equal respect and concern would be to go for tea 2/3 of the time.  There are formal voting systems that are non majoritarian that try to instantiate this idea. For example, lottery voting. See for example this PhD thesis by Dr Ben Saunders:http://www.academia.edu/148977/Democracy_as_Fairness (Declaration of interest: I was briefly taught by Saunders at university, and find his ideas on democracy very persuasive) ",

            "answer_text": "Does it have the right to have its way? Well that depends on the democratic system and the voting methods. In the USA and the UK, there have been several elections where the losing party/president actually got more votes, but the voting system still meant they lose. So you need to look at different voting systems in different countries to see how the checks and balance work. In principle there are dangers and clearly a majority with too much power can run amok and terrible crimes have been committed in the name of the majority. BUT, let\u2019s reverse the question. Does the minority have the right to have its way with the majority? This would be a description that would fit many dictatorships and tyrants and there are very few (if any) examples of this working in a free society. So while in theory, the answer might be \u2018no\u2019, in practise, it generally provides better outcomes than the alternatives. ",

            "answer_text": "The rationale behind majority rule is absolute power. As the saying goes, absolute power corrupts absolutely. In some political systems majority rule is seen as a bad thing since the majority can be wrong. It is easy for majority rule to descend into mob rule and then chaos. Respect for the dignity of minorities is actually respect for civilization. In the USA there are several checks and balances to help minimze what is called \"Tyranny of the majority\". ",
