            "answer_text": "Let x be the atomic mass of the 2nd isotope The isotopes occur in the proportion: Cu-63 with atomic mass 62.9296 amu: 69.15% Cu-x: 100\u201369.15= 30.85% Using this information average atomic mass= 63.546 amu since average atomic mass = (relative abundance of each isotope* relative isotopic mass of each)/100 Therefore, 63.546=((62.9296*69.15)+(x*30.85))\u00f7100 63.546=43.5158184+0.3085x 0.3085x= 63.546-43.5158184 x= 20.0301816\u00f70.3085 x=64.9276 amu Therefore, the atomic mass of the second isotope of Cu is 64.9276 amu ",
