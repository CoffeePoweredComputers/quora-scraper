            "answer_text": "For learning mathematics for a secondary school going student he should first complete up with NCERT. One should first make base and that base will be made from NCERT. After completing up NCERT you can start up with R.D.SHARMA it will help one understand the concepts better. After completing these two you can purchase U-LIKE and can solve the sample papers and model test papers given in it. Once my Mathematics teacher told me that NCERT is a base and beginners level game then stepping a foot forward R.D.SHARMA is an expert level game where you can understand the game better and then after all this there's U-LIKE in which you can show your skills and can polish them for the final level that is your exam. It is sufficient in my opinion. Hope this helps you as well. ",
