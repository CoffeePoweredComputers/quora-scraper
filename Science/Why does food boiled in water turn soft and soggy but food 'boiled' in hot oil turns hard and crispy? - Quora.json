            "answer_text": "When you boil something in water , the temperature is around 100\u2070C. Water in the item you are boiling and the main body of water are both at 100\u2070C. Carbohydrate and protein structures which hold the water are being hydrolyzed. Item will become soft or soggy. When you put something in hot oil, the temperature is generally over 180\u2070C. This causes a lot of water in your item to become steam and escape as bubbles. You see bubbles forming when you deep fry anything and the amount of these bubbles reduces over time . Carbohydrates and proteins in your product being fried become crisp because they have lost a lot of their water. These carbohydrates and proteins also undergo a lot of other chemical changes at that temperature. ",

            "answer_text": "Think of it this way\u2026 Crispy is another way of saying dehydrated. When you are boiling something, the water that is in the food doesn\u2019t have any way to leave. It can\u2019t vaporize because the water can\u2019t get above boiling. When you are frying, and the oil is hotter than the boiling point of water, it converts the water in the food to steam and forces it out. (The crazy bubbling when you deep fry is the steam leaving.) If your oil is hot enough, then the water leaving the product is vigorous enough that it prevents the oil from rushing into the food and causing it to being greasy. Since most of the water from the surface layers has been driven out by the heat, it\u2019s crispy. ",
