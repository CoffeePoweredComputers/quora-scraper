            "answer_text": "Tunneling is a quantum mechanical effect. A tunneling current occurs when particles move through a barrier that they classically shouldn't be able to move through. This phenomenon is said to be faster than light. For detailed explanation I would recommend you to watch the video \u201cis quantum tunneling faster than light\u201d on you tube by a channel named \u2018PBS space time\u2019. ",
