            "answer_text": "Japan is a paradox, They have some interesting spins on the old technologies, such as new consoles, music toilets, and holograms, However, recently they have been very slow to embrace changes, for example, most Japanese companies seriously lag in the digital technologies, SNS, and app market, with a severe lack of programmers as well. Additionally most Japanese companies still require job applications to be filled-in by pen, and don\u2019t support the digital CV format that we are used to in the west. Japan started to technologically develop once the US has opened it\u2019s market to it, So Japan could flood the US market with cheaply made Swiss watch imitations, cheap cars, and utensils, kind of what China is doing currently. However, it was Japanese personal choice to invest their earnings into the development of new technologies. So kudos to them. ",
