            "answer_text": "Well I think the main reason is because it takes a lot of changes to make it physically happen while a nomadic lifestyle and the option to isolate yourself with clothing has made evolution to hibernation unlikely. However after agriculture made us sedentary there are definitely some beginnings of human adaptation towards hibernation it just hasnt taken long enough to really take form. Since we came out of Africa, humans as a species are more adapted to subtropical savanna climates where hibernation is not needed since food and predators were much more available year round. So when humans wandered to Colder climates in Europe, Asia and (much later North America) there was little time to really adapt to these climates. Though Neantherthals and Denisovan humans have spend quit a lot of time in cold climates (arctic tundras). They still didn\u2019t adapt hibernation but did adapt to the cold by have rubust bigger build (more energy sufficient) and big noses for better heating air for the lungs. The thing is that for hibernation to evolve you need to have a season with very little food, with a season full abundance, and also a safe place to rest for a long time. Then it takes a lot of mutations to really evolve a mechanism. IT requires a mechanism for food storage (well humans are quite unique among primates to store that much fat, but as you see we cannot do it while staying healty) Then need to adjust metabolism that it will tunes down metabolism to so you can live on reserves only and also save a lot of energy while finding a way that you cannot be eaten by predators or freeze to death. Dont forget that Hypothermia is very deadly when body temperature drops below 33 Celsius. A lot of change is needed to counter that. And only dropping to 33 C in an environment below 0 doesn save a lot of energy. But since humans always were very nomadic ever since they were on the savannah they could travel to or along with the food supply. This takes some energy, but not a lot, humans are extraordinary concerning energy consumptions while going on foot. We are one of the most energy efficient travelers in the animal world. Neantherthals and the modern reindeer hurders do the same. But there are instances in human history where people did do a very simplified version of hibernation. Agriculture made humans sedentary, they developed a system of producing a lot within one season and store it safely in a confined space called houses. This has led several populations in France (even in the 19th century!!) and Russia to take on a form that resembles some form of hibernation that if had taken long enough would have had big evolutionary changes. Quite Interesting - Hibernation There were more interesting things about these Frenchmen they often walked on stilts because of the swampy nature of the terrain.  ",

            "answer_text": "Welll\u2026 I am not an authority so hopefully someone more knowledgeable will answer. But I\u2019ll give it a guess. Here is the answer for why animals hibernate in general. \u201cHibernation is an adaptation that helps many animalsconserve energy by remaining inactive, greatly slowing their metabolism and reducing their body temperature for days, weeks or even months at a time. Typically, animals hibernate in order to survive long periods when food is scarce.\u201d Humans took a more active role, and our activities plus our adaptation/evolution followed suit. As stated, animals hibernate to conserve energy. Humans instead took to gaining more energy. Being the wandering animals that we are, we never took to staying in one place for a food source. We traveled around and when we couldn\u2019t find food in our typical hunting grounds, we moved to new ones. But even though we never evolved/adapted to hibernate, our bodies DID change to conserve energy when food was scarce, as well as help us move around over long distances. Enter, the bodies production of myostatin. Myostatin is the chemical/enzyme in our bodies that breaks down primarily unused muscle, among other things. Because muscle burns through the most energy in our bodies, gaining the ability to lose what is not needed greatly helped our bodies conserve energy, and is what kept us alive as a species while we traveled around in search of food, while creatures like bears hibernated. Also, a sleeping bear makes much easier prey than an alert bear. Sleeping for months at a time would make humans easy prey for the animals that did not sleep, especially considering we lacked the size, claws, and teeth of other animals. While humans cannot go months without eating, with the introduction of myostatin into our systems we gained the ability to go for around a month or so without eating, and we retained our ability to be awake and alert most of the time rather than easy sleeping prey. So that is my best guess, maybe someone else can provide a more scientifically accurate answer. ",
