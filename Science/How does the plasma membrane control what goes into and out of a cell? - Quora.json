            "answer_text": "The plasma membrane contains multiple proteins that are responsible for the transport of molecules across the membrane. For example, there are glucose transporters that will move glucose across based on the glucose concentration. Some transporters will move a molecule against its concentration (from low to high) and this requires energy such as an ATP molecule. These proteins are necessary because of the hydrophobicity of the lipid bilayer. Gasses and lipid-soluble molecules do not need protein transporters. ",
