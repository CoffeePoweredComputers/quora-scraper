We haven\u2019t gained more knowledge, we just have easier access. \u201cInformation is like garbage, you had better know what you\u2019re going to do with it before you collect it.\u201d Attributed to Mark Twain. If you buy the more than 100 hammers (gained more), available at the big fix-it stores, doesn\u2019t guarantee you will hit a nail better. They have specific reasons for being different. Learning and modeling the thought process can be helpful. Learning what not to do is also helpful. Learning what has worked somewhere else can be helpful. But this means an investment in time. Or communicating with others trying to solve the same problem. ",

If your question doesn\u2019t clearly indicate that this is indeed the case and not a matter of who has more bling then what could possibly? Technological advancement comes from demand that had always depended on short-term wants of the customer. It seems so hard to believe that people actually make the world the way it is that they will blame the illuminati, the politicians, religions, anyone at all but themselves and thus voluntarily give up control over their life/their power to choose. People put themselves into a circle and fail to recognize it so guess what happens if no one wants to stop for a minute to think and be rational - mistakes get repeated. ",

Moreover, valueable knowledge is hidden from modern societies. Like there is a plan to make modern generations copycat robots rather than free thinkers. ",
