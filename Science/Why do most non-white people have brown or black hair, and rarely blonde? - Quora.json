            "answer_text": "There is a thing in genetics called gene linkage. Often, two traits are close together on a chromosome and are thus linked. Skin color, hair color and eye color are controlled by a whole mess of genes, some of which are linked, some not. Thanks for the threat to downvote; it is rather cute, like a three year old stamping her foot and being peevish. People are going to take this question as bigotry or bias, so grow up and get used to people writing to you like this. Plus, studying a Biology course, even in high school, will teach you these things, but that does not make you an idiot, just unlearned. Some blonde people can get very dark in the sun; how many photos do you see of \"hot\" blonde women in bikinis? (I hate finding images and posting them here, so will not do it.) Many of them are darker than many \"dark skinned\" people. So, hereditarily dark skinned people are quite often blonde. Now, so called \"dark\" people, like Indians (from India), though actually Caucasians, and often called \"Indo-Aryans\", have become over the ages rather dark with straight dark hair. This is not due to diet or environment, as a change in either will not change their appearance; it is due to genetics. Likely, the first human colonists in India adapted to a hot and sunny near the tropics, and thus the people of India are now mostly dark with dark hair. Sub-Saharan Africans are generally dark with dark hair because of the environment; a blonde with light skin would quickly perish, and blonde hair and light skin are a particular adaptation to a particular place. Now, we have determined that diet and environment do not have anything to do with skin color, as you can take a light skinned blonde and put him/her in a place where dark people live, and feed this person the same diet the dark people eat, and there will be no change. And the same with a reciprocal translocation; the dark people would stay dark. Even the sun is not going to do much, just make the dark person pale in an area where she can't get much, and in a high sun area, burn the light skinned person to death. These types of adaptations do not take place in a few generations (Lamarck), but take a long time being operated upon by Natural Selection (Darwin). So, no, it is about genetics, not diet, environment, or sun. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a question that can be answered in many ways by many more people who have studied the field of genetics. I am not claiming I am an expert, but I do have some knowledge on the subject. Its mainly due to gene pools. There are some people who are on the darker side but can still have blonde or red hair. Common traits like hair color can be sorted out by region of origin, this being based on historical traits of peoples of certain regions. Now you need to keep in mind, before the modern age of airplanes, trains, and automobiles, many people travelled by foot or horse or some other simple form of transportation. This made traveling to different regions difficult. Which lead to people of each region mainly having children with people from the same region. This kept those physical traits from those regions somewhat contained with in that area. For example, many persons from South American regions tend to have darker, thicker hair with a more coffee skin tone; persons from the regions in Africa tend to have dark, thick, coarse hair with darker skin; persons from Europe tend to have lighter color hair with lighter skin. Flash forward to the modern age of transportation via planes, trains, and automobiles, it made the mixing of persons from different regions with different genetic traits much easier. This allows genetic traits typically seen before in a person from a specific region, to be seen in another person from a different region due to this genetic mixing. As time moves forward, and more people with different traits mix, and  time there will be many more persons with darker skin and lighter hair. I hope this helps and I wasn't too confusing explaining this! ",
