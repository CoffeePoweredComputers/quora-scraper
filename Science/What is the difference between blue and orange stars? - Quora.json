            "answer_text": "Blue stars are more massive, fusion takes place more frequently, and its mass (hydrogen, for our simple purposes) is consumed more quickly. They die faster. Red or orange stars are low mass and fuse slowly and live longer. The conditions? The parent cloud of gas must be more dense and have greater quantities of hydrogen for big blue stars, and the opposite for low mass stars. That is the essence of it. Additionally, high mass stars can collapse into a black hole or go supernova and blow outer layers into interstellar space, spreading gas and newly nucleosynthesized heavy elements across the near galaxy to seed for future stars. We are the result of supernovae: complex molecules like magnesium are needed for complex life. Stars died to make you. ",

            "answer_text": "Stellar evolution (aging) is quite complex, but in just about every star's life there's a stable 'main sequence' phase. For stars in this phase (the Sun is in it too for at least several billions of years) there's a simple rule: their mass determines their (color) temperature. Red stars are small, lightweight (not massive), not very luminous and can be in the main sequence phase for trillions years. Orange and yellow stars are about 3-30 times as heavy, are much more luminous and have a shorter main sequence lifespan (tens of billions or several billions of years). White stars are more massive and much more luminous again and their stable 'main sequence' phase is again much shorter, etc.. And yes: the color is linked to the temperature of the photosphere (visible 'surface/edge') of the star. A red star may have a photospheric temperature of just 3000K while a bluish star (which from a short distance just looks a very bright and cold white) may be up to tens of thousands of Kelvins hot (and much more luminous). We're talking about a continuum here ( Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram ) along which stars are classified using letters and numbers ( Stellar classification ) but the general story is: red is tiny and colder and blue is more massive and hotter.
