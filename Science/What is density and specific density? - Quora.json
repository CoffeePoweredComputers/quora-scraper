            "answer_text": "Density is defined as mass per unit volume.; it has the SI unit of kilogram per cubic meter (kg/m\u00b3) and the cgs unit of gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm\u00b3). Density is mass divided by volume. The term 'specific density' does not seem to exist. Relative density - also known as 'specific gravity' is the ratio of the density of a material to the density of a reference material. Usually the reference material is water. Specific gravity is a relative quantity with no units. To find density, we measure the mass of the material and divide it by the volume it occupies. And then, since the density of water is 1 gm/cm\u00b3 the ratio of the density of the material to that of water is 1:XX. (Density of water is 1 gm/cm\u00b3 at 4\u00b0C) For example - density of gold is 19.32 g/cm\u00b3 and so the specific gravity is 19.32 ",
