            "answer_text": "(A2A - thanks for asking) Politics and Political Science are related. It\u2019s perhaps easiest to think about politics as one of the things that political science studies while the results of political science research (both good research and bad) are sometimes used in political contexts. It is also possible to think of them in terms of the practical (politics) versus the theoretical (political science). I rather like Bismark\u2019s description of politics being \u201cthe art of the possible, the attainable\u2014the art of the next best,\u201d while much work in political science begins with assumptions of an ideal. In this conception political science might be thought of as the \u201ccould be\u201d or \u201cshould be\u201d and politics as the \u201cis.\u201d At its core, political science tries to describe a small-r reality while politics tries to shape that small-r reality.

            "answer_text": "Politics and political science are both human activities. While politics is the process by which influence is used to organize groups, communities and societies, political science is the systematic examination, theorizing and testing of theories about how influence is distributed and used in groups, communities, and societies. As human activities, both politics and political science involve practitioners, political activists and scientists, in the exercise of influence on behalf of their preferred courses of social action, whether building societies or constructing an understanding of how societies are built. Both are learning processes which means that both involve a good deal of trial and error. The difference between politics and political science is that politics may involve the use of violence, force or manipulation, while science is inherently based on reasonable attempts at persuasion and legitimate authority.
