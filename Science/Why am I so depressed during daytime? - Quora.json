            "answer_text": "I have bi-polar disorder, but most of my life has been lived on the depressed side, which seems to be my baseline or normal level of functioning. I have more severe episodes of depression, with the severe anxiety and suicidal ideations, but we won't talk about that now. My typical day is much like yours. I have low energy and irritability until sunset, then I start to come alive. Before I go on, I like to add that this is not a mere inconvenience, it's a torture. I have my darkest, most morbid suicidal thoughts during morning hours, and the hotter and brighter it is outside, the worse I feel. Does Sundowning in Alzheimer's patients provide a clue? Have you heard of Alzheimer's disease? Alzheimers Well, these patients experience something called sundowning. Their mood and behavior changes dramatically just before early evening, and the fading daylight is thought to be the trigger. No, I'm not suggesting you have Alzheimer's, but sundowning or sundowners syndrome sounds like what you're describing in reverse--They feel better during the day and worse at night. Alzheimers patients also come alive after sunset, but not in a positive way. Their symptoms may be manageable throughout the day, but then evening comes and they become more confused, angry and agitated. What's fascinating is that this behavior subsides about one hour before daylight. Also interesting is that some patients experience these symptom--depression, irritability, acting out--during the early morning hours. What is common to all patients is that the mood and behavior is effected by the transition from light to darkness or darkness to light.[1] Although researchers don't understand the exact causes, \u201cscientists think that changes in the brain of someone with dementia might affect their inner \u201cbody clock.\u201d The area of the brain that signals when you\u2019re awake or asleep breaks down in people with Alzheimer\u2019s. That could cause sundowning.\u201d[2] I have no right to believe this because I am not a doctor or researcher, but I think a very similar thing is occurring in depression -- breakdown in the internal body clock that signals the body when to sleep and when to awaken. Morning depression. Your internal body clock or circadian rhythms affects energy, thinking, alertness and mood. \u201cWhen these rhythms are disrupted, your body starts to make hormones at the wrong time of day. This can have a negative effect on your physical health and emotional well-being. For instance, when your body makes melatonin during the day, you may feel very tired and irritable\u201d.[3] From personal experience, I can tell you that maintaining nocturnal hours aggravates my bi-polar condition. I have worked three jobs that were graveyard shifts and all three times I had a manic episode. I also have problems with depression when my work schedule is erratic-- working mornings for two days, then suddenly switching to nights, for example. My mood is most manageable when I go to bed before midnight and awaken by eight am. If I sleep later than eight am, I will feel depressed and sluggish until evening. Keeping a regular routine, eating at the same time , waking and sleeping at the same time, and avoiding things that interfere with sleep is also recommend for alzheimers patients prone to sundowning. It goes without saying that any treatment of depression begins with your doctor. If you are having trouble sleeping during the night, you should discuss this with your doctor.

Before, I offer some suggestions, it would have definitely helped, if there was more information about you, such as: Your Age?Type of Diet?
