            "answer_text": "\"I do not think that word means what you think it means\"-Inigo Montoya Your question is similar to \"what kind of sports car should I buy that doesn't obey latitude and longitude?\" Latitude and longitude are ways of expressing locations on the Earth.  Relativity is our method of locating points in space and time and measuring distances between them. To do this we have a fancy 4-dimensional version of the Pythagorean theorem. The points in spacetime are called \"events\" and the distances called \"intervals\" and our fancy distance formula called a \"metric.\" As nature would have it, in and around matter and energy, we need to be careful on how we measure distances in space and time, because our metric is no longer uniform, meaning the relationships among the sides of triangles and of circumferences and diameters will depend on where we want to draw them. So for instance, you could have one clock moving through 1 second of time while some other clock will move through 1.7 seconds of time at some other location. This amusing state of affairs is called gravity. Let's apply this to Superman. Suppose, in order to get a better view of the horizon, Superman, being Superman, floats up into the air and remains suspended in mid-air for a time. Does he \"obey\" or defy gravity? Neither. Objects fall, say a rock at Superman's position, because the rock's wristwatch ticks a little more quickly compared to the wristwatch on the ground. The wristwatches are measuring out the distances along their worldlines (trajectories through spacetime) and because they not on the same path they will eventually meet up - meaning the rock and ground will move inexorably closer together.  For superman to remain at a fixed position above the ground means that his worldline and the worldline of the ground have to be parallel in such a way as to preserve their spatial separation. If Superman uses his powers, say to interact with the Earth's magnetic field or use some other means to force his path through spacetime to match the ground, this is not defying gravity any more than sitting on the roof of a building; Superman is simply sitting on a perch that is invisible. Superman could alter space and time around him so that no force is needed and just floats at a constant distance. But altering space and time is the very definition of gravity.  Some might argue that quantum mechanical systems don't obey gravity, or rather that quantum mechanics defies general relativity as currently formulated in 2015, but, metaphorically speaking, this more our hopefully temporary ignorance of how to draw up pythagorean theorems at the level quantum level of description, assuming this can be done at all.

            "answer_text": "Everything physical is affected by gravity, being as (in General Relativity), gravity is interpreted as curvature of space-time itself. So even things like light that have no mass are affected by this curvature. Obviously some things float in air though, like hydrogen and helium. Incidentally, if you do attempt to manufacture your own hydrogen, don't forget that while hot it absolutely won't be contained by a normal balloon, and if you set light to it in the expectation of creating a nice little flame, it'll more likely explode and shatter your apparatus, leaving you wondering if you've gone deaf and still have a face. Speaking from experience. ",
