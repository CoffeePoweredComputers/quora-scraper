            "answer_text": "The general formula relating moles (n), mass in grams (m), and molar mass in g/mol (M) is: n = m/M It can be rearranged to calculate mass when you have moles and molar mass. m = n \u00d7 M First calculate the molar mass (M) of CO2. M C=12 g/mol, M O=16 g/mol M CO2 = 12 g/mol + 2(16 g/mol) = 44 g/mol To calculate the mass of a given number of moles of a substance, multiply given moles by the molar mass of the substance. (m = n \u00d7 M) 1.5 mol CO2 = (44 g CO2/1 mol CO2) = 66 g CO2 Answer: There are 66 g CO2 in 1.5 mol CO2. ",
