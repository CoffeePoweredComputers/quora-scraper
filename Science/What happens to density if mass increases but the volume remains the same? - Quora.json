[math]\u03c1 = m / v[/math] By simply observing the above equation, we see that for a constant [math]v[/math], [math]\u03c1[/math] increases as [math]m[/math] increases. For example, let [math]v = 2[/math] and the initial mass be [math]m = 4[/math]. Then the initial density is [math]\u03c1 = 2[/math]. Now take the final mass to be [math]m = 8[/math], then the final density increase to [math]\u03c1 = 4[/math]. ",

            "answer_text": "Density = mass/ volume So here is the formula of density and how it is related to mass and volume. Density directly proportional to mass and inversely proportional to volume, if you increase the mass density increases and vice versa, if you increase the volume density decreases and vice versa. Here something for you What is black hole I know you aware of that lets make the black hole. Suppose you holding an football in your hand and you start increasing it masses but making volume same it not changes and you start increasing it mass till the mass of football become equal to mass of earth congratulations now you having a black hole like in your hand.
