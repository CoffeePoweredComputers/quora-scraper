            "answer_text": "Yes, I am afraid so. But do not worry, you will live thousands of lifetimes before that happens. The apparent life of the Universe wholly depends upon the power of the explosion of the Big Bang, but the Universe will expand approximately 120 to 150 billion years before the expansion energy is used up, and the Universe collapses like a black hole into the future Singularity.
