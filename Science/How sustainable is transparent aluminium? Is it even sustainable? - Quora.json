            "answer_text": "Aluminum itself will never be transparent because (basically) metals aren\u2019t, even when very thin (think of gold leaf). You might be thinking of Aluminium oxynitride - Wikipedia , which is made of very-common non-toxic elements and so is arguably sustainable \u2014 but is extremely hard and has a very high melting point, so can\u2019t easily be machined, cast, recycled, etc. Recycling glass, steel, copper, aluminum, and thermoplastics like polyethylene is trivial in comparison.
