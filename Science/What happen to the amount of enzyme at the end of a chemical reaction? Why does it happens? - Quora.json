            "answer_text": "Nothing. And \u201cnothing\u201d happens because enzymes are catalysts. Catalysts, by definition, are \u201cthings\u201d that improve the rate of a chemical reaction without having been changed at the end the a reaction. Of course they are changed during the steps in the chemical reaction, but at the end, the catalyst has been reverted to the initial state. That means that a catalyst (including enzymes) are not used up by the chemical reaction they catalyze. ",
