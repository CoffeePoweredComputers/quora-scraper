            "answer_text": "I'd like to put a different spin on the answers already provided to what is perhaps the single most important question we face in addressing climate change.  There are millions of people who are concerned about climate change but don't know what to do, and millions of people limiting their actions to purely symbolic measures that aren't being leveraged into climate progress. If we could actually mobilize these millions in ways that make a difference, we'd be a lot more effective!   It's good to point to various technologies that need to be advanced to address climate change, or the value of getting educated on the topic, or the value of joining great groups like the Citizens Climate Lobby.  But there is no \"right answer,\" and no \"one-size-fits-all answer\" to the question. The two key questions for a person to ask themselves are: 1.  Why is it worth it for me to get involved?2.  What are my options for getting involved?   The answer to #2 may well depend on #1, in the sense that one's motivation for being involved could suggest certain pathways for involvement.  And there are MANY reasons different people decide they want to get involved, and MANY potential pathways for getting involved.   But Question #2 is also an independent question that would benefit from some strategic thinking.  What are your skills sets?  Your resources?  Your time availability?  Your age?  The Effective Altruism movement, for example, would suggest making as much money as possible so you can support the climate change cause, rather than getting \"down and dirty\" into the issue.  Might make sense for some, but not for others.   I would argue that the question is not \"where can I most simply volunteer some time?\" but which \"chess piece\" on the Climate Chess gameboard am I as a specific individual in the best position to influence, since there are many potential pieces that can advance the larger objective of winning at Climate Chess.  From activism to technology innovation to education to volunteering your time to develop websites or videos, and many many more. I can't answer which is right for the person asking the question, but I would suggest you might find our exploration of Climate Chess pieces in the Climate Web interesting, and here's a direct link:  The Climate Web  I would also point you to the Climate Web as a place to explore as much of the climate change issue as you might want.  Whether the science, the economics, the communication, the activism, etc.  You can find hundreds of organizations active in different aspects of the issue.  You might start with Climate Web Lite, but there's plenty to explore. Main doorway is simply at Page on theclimateweb.org  If you're trying to figure out how to get involved, please visit the Climate Web and give us feedback on how we can best organize it to support precisely your kind of search!  That's one thing we built it for, and after about 15,000 hours of work there's A LOT there.  But it can certainly be improved, and probably a lot.  You can contact me at mark@climatographer.com if you have ideas. ",

            "answer_text": "What can you actually do about climate change? Raise awareness. When you hear your friends saying silly things like climate change isn\u2019t real (yes, there are still people out there saying such nonsense. Probably dozens.), ask them what makes them think it isn\u2019t real. Show them pictures of street flooding in Norfolk, Virginia (where I am from). Streets here didn\u2019t use to flood like that, but as the oceans have risen, due to the warming of the water, streets flood more often. Also, be sure to discount anyone who says things like \u201cMiami will be under water in 20 years\u201d. That\u2019s not true and it doesn\u2019t help the argument. Miami will be dealing with flooding issues like Norfolk, but the city will not be under water. I like to ask a leading question such as \u201cWhat would it take to convince you that this is real? Obviously something convinced that it isn\u2019t, so what would it take to convince you that it is?\u201d Most of the time they have no idea how to answer that. Some times they will say things like they need \u201cconclusive proof\u201d. Well, they aren\u2019t going to get that. Nothing can be proven. \u201cProve to me that you are John Smith\u201d. They can show me evidence, but they can\u2019t prove it. Just like they also can\u2019t \u201cconclusively prove\u201d that climate change isn\u2019t real, so it isn\u2019t a matter of proof. Once you have convinced your friends, then start convincing your elected officials. We can\u2019t even begin to have discussions regarding what to do about climate change, when some politicians won\u2019t even acknowledge it is a problem. Tell them they will not get your vote if they continue that kind of nonsense. Finally, do what you can personally. Replace gas driven things with electric. Yes, electric things come with their own set of problems, but they are still better than the gas versions. Reduce energy usage where you can. Strive for electricity produced with renewable sources.

However, renewables will not be able to supply 2\u00bd x the energy we use now, by 2050 when there will be 10 billion of us fighting for an equitable share of available energy. The developing world fighting to hang onto its standard of living and the rest fighting to get up there with us. Only one technology has a fighting chance. It is that of the Integral Fast reactor (IFR). This is not pie-in-the-sky technology. One such reactor generated electricity for 30 years, before it was de-funded in 1994. It used legacy nuclear waste, such as plutonium, as fuel and we have enough of that on the planet to supply all of our energy needs for centuries - at least until fusion becomes a reality. All of our energy means electricity and process heat, plus carbon-neutral liquid fuels for transport and carbon-neutral feedstock for fertilisers to feed the world. That's energy security for many generations of our families to come. It also demonstrated inherent safety, whereby the reactor shut itself down according to the laws of physics, without human intervention. It did this under the different experimental accident conditions that occurred at TMI and Fukushima. The minuscule waste stream remaining decays to background radiation levels in only 300 years - easily, cheaply and safely stored until it's as safe as the ground beneath your feet. There are some really great videos out there with detailed interviews of the people who worked on this reactor - search for \"integral fast reactor\". ",

            "answer_text": "Well if I have to point out a single thing we all should change I\u2019d say stop overpopulation. The fact is most of the stress over the planet is because we as humans are too many. I\u2019m not talking about spooky population control but rather population SELF CONTROL. 10 billion people eat a lot of food, which needs a lot of land, taken from forests and grasslands, fish can\u2019t handle and populations collapse, hundreds of species of plants and animals worldwide are becoming extinct per year, we pollute the air from our energy needs and dump CO2 into the atmosphere and the whole Earth system degrades. In the past people never thought about limiting themselves on the number of kids because the kids died all the time from infections, illnesses, plain hunger and other things. Now most people survive because of advances in crop growing and medicine (antibiotics, vaccines) so world population exploded in the last century . If we could get the number down to 1 billion people (about the world population 100 years ago, and the present-day population of India) then there would be resources for everybody, and together with the technology we have now, there would be abundance for everybody and zero poverty. So if people want to gift their grandchildren a nice world they should limit their children to one. Doing that, in two generations, the global population would be under control, and in three generations there would be abundance for all, probably before if we count with technology keeping its pace. It\u2019s incredible how we boast about been an intelligent species yet collectively we still behave like insects, where population explodes only to meet a population limiting (or population decimating) event. And those events exist. Plagues, superbugs, or simply climate sensitivity (been so many means that if an extreme climate event produces, say, failing crops in India or China, potentially hundreds of million people could die, and we wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about it without risking starving ourselves) Of course the economical models of growth and the governments who follow those models insist in having more children to sustain the \u201ceconomy of the rich\u201d so once again, we show off our insect mentality putting the survival of the species at risk only for the short term benefit of a few.

What is the per capita carbon footprint per country?What is their forest coverage?and many other data points.You will be surprised on many fronts. You will see that people in their daily lives have a higher carbon footprint than per capita acceptable limits. While doing that, figure out what are the lowest hanging fruits. Find out how they can be plucked. Start working towards it. We definitely need activism, thats how most of the revolutions start. Activists in this area are achieving milestones by threatening the future of some stubborn corporates and governments.  In my opinion, activism should start in your neighborhood. It is much easier to put sense into common people than corporates and governments. What our planet needs right now is immediate change along side long term plans. What we seem to concentrate only is on the long term plans. There is a huge activism opportunity in the \"right now\" space. Go for it. ",

It will become obvious to you who is working along lines that excite you and that you can contribute to. Contribute, go to their meetings, march in their demonstrations, contact Congressman when your organization lets you know of an issue to focus on, and so on. Write about the issues. Talk to your friends and neighbors, or to schoolchildren, or to other groups who can help out. Read Rules for Radicals.
