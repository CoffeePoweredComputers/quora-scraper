            "answer_text": "It is behaves differently for different systems. For aliphatic systems with no conjugation, it behaves as an electron withdrawing group due to -I effect. For aliphatic systems with conjugation, it behaves as an electron withdrawing group by -I effect and an electron donating group by mesomeric effect. For aromatic systems, When it is in ortho position, it nehaves as an electron withdrawing group by -I effect and an electron donating group due to mesomeric effect. When it is in meta position, it behaves as an electron withdrawing group by -I effect. Since the distance has increased as compared to ortho, its effect decreases. When it is in para position, it behaves as an electron donating group by mesomeric effect. Since the distance has increased further, the electron withdrawing nature by -I effect is negligible. I hope it helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Hydroxyl groups are both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing. If resonance stabilization is not available, it's election withdrawing. This is shown by its effect on aromatic rings, which varies depending on its relationship to the site of reaction. When it's ortho or para, it is electron donating, but if meta it is electron withdrawing because it can't interact with the reaction site by resonance. ",
