            "answer_text": "An oxygen atom weighs 16 amu, and a hydrogen atom weighs 1 amu. In their diatomic forms, which is how we commonly encounter them, an oxygen molecule weighs 32 and a hydrogen molecule weighs 2. So oxygen is 16 times heavier than hydrogen. You may be thinking of the way that we determine the relative masses- by comparing effusion rates. At the same temperature, hydrogen gas will effuse through a pinhole 4 times faster than oxygen gas. To find the relative masses from this, we use Graham\u2019s Law of Effusion: [math]\\frac{Rate_1}{Rate_2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{M_2}{M_1}}[/math] (One reason that helium balloons deflate annoyingly quickly compared to air-filled balloons.) This means that since the ratio of the rates is 4:1, as measured by the experiment, the ratio of the masses must be 1:16. ",

            "answer_text": "Your premise is erroneous! But you can get the right answer by electrolying water and collecting the gases emerging at the anode and cathode and applying the equation of state: PV = nRT, where the letters have their usual significance. Bear in mind that n = m/M where m is the mass of gas and M is its molecular weight. Electrolysis of water leads to: 2H2O = 2H2 + O2 The answer for the ratio of the mass of oxygen to hydrogen collected will theoretically be 2x16/2x2 or 8. The question, however, seeks to compare the masses of the same no of each of the gaseous molecules. Because the electrolysis produces twice as many hydrogen molecules as oxygen, the the ratio of the two masses with an equal number of molecules will be 2x16/1x2, ie 16. No adjustment is made for the presence of a low level of other oxygen isotopes, but that\u2019s a bit of fine tuning you can do. Thus from application of the equation of state you should get a result close to 16, not 4. ",
