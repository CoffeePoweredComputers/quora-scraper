            "answer_text": "A 2 part question which can easily be answered by dividing the Cosmos and universe into 2 separate entities: Cosmos - this is the summation of all the (+/-) Binary Universes & the Nothingness that created them. And since Nothingness means no matter & no energy then it is infinite in Time and Space, and has always existed. And thus it is important to distinguish between a universe (finite) and the Cosmos (infinite). Or you could say that a universe is a part of the Cosmos, but the Cosmos is not a part of the universe.Universe - all universes must be (+/-) Binary Universe Systems, or for every universe created it must be balanced with an anti-universe. And proof of the anti-universe is Dark Matter/Energy.Dark Matter/Dark Energy - is simply anti-matter that originally evolved from anti-waves during the Big Separation where a wave and its anti-wave partner separated from Nothingness. And Dark Energy emanates from Dark Matter like Regular Energy emanates from Regular Matter. See below: Also by separating Cosmos from Universe many other questions can now be answered which are not constrained by the 3 dimensions of Space and one dimension of Time we live in. So let your imagination soar, expand, and forget about what the old curmudgeons of classical, canonical, cosmology have imprinted in your mind. The Cosmos of Nothingness is ready to offer all sorts of answers, for example: To answer the question, what lies just outside of the confines of our universe. Then, just plain Nothingness. No matter, no energy, and no Higgs Field. Simply, empty space. Or the absence of Somethingness.Also, since the Cosmos is infinite in Space and Time, then this would allow for many other (+/-) Binary Universes to be created as suggested by M Theory.By distinguishing between universe and Cosmos, the question, is our universe infinite? Can be answered with a \u201cno\u201d. Only the Cosmos is infinite. All universes that have a beginning must also have an ending.And by differentiating universe from Cosmos, the Cosmos could have different laws of physics allowing for a (+) wave and (-) anti-wave partner to form from Nothingness. The closest to that in our universe is what\u2019s called pair production of a (+) particle and (-) anti-particle from a neutral boson in a physics lab.Also with (+/-) Binary Universe System, and similar to a (+/-) battery, a voltage/potential difference is set up which could explain all the energy in the universe. And when all the stars burn out and energy runs out, then the Heat Death of the Universe could occur, similar to a dead battery. And this would satisfy the Zero Net Energy theory of the Cosmos.If everything starts out at 0,0,0,0 in the Space/Time Continuum, then this serves as a common origin for all explanations. And no need for any conflicting tales and fantasies concerning gods and givens.Thus no need for any branes, quantum foam, vacuum quantum energy, collisions of other universes, hyper-universes, or singularities. Anytime something is introduced it must be accompanied with a valid origin. Otherwise circular logic and meaningless tautologies arise from anyone who can make up anything, and often just to sell a book.Cosmos of Nothingness = zero, is simply the most logical starting point for everything, including the beginning of our (+/-) Binary Universe System and countless others.And no need to introduce a-priori knowledge concerning the laws of thermodynamics. These laws cannot be used as valid arguments to explain things before the laws were created. Remember, they did not exist before the Big Bang which created them.And finally, all laws of physics must succumb to the greatest law of all, the Law of Entropy and Decay which marks the end of our universe. And the beginning of a new one. And no recycling of any previous energy is needed, just a new beginning from point 0,0,0,0 in the Cosmos of Nothingness - the birthplace of countless other (+/-) Binary Universe Systems.And with the introduction of the Cosmos of Nothingness, then all sorts of things are possible which include the Nothingness that is the birthplace of countless other (+/-) Binary Universe Systems which are also finite. And since the Space/Time Continuum of the Cosmos is infinite, thus no starting materials such as gods or givens are needed for the formation of anything, just Nothingness starting at 0,0,0,0, giving rise to a (+) universe of regular matter and a (-) anti-universe of dark matter. Or, Cosmos of Nothingness = vastness of Time x Randomness = creation of a wave + anti-wave x Entropy = formation of a universe + anti-universe = an eventual heat death = Black Hole + White Hole annihilation = a return into Nothingness.  All of the above is so simple, but often rejected because of its simplicity. And with no partial differential equations, triple integrals, and complex mathematical computations as proof, then rejected by the elite cosmologists. However it has been said that a diagram is worth a thousand equations, just ask the ghost of Richard Feynman. And in the words of the greatest thinker and creator of thought experiments:  ",

            "answer_text": "Q: If energy cannot be created, how was the universe made? A: We don\u2019t know. Q: Was there energy before the Big Bang? A: We don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t even know if there was a \u201cbefore\u201d the Big Bang, or whether the term \u201cbefore the Big Bang\u201d makes as little sense as \u201cnorth of the North Pole\u201d.  You see, the big problem is that we\u2019re inside the universe. We don\u2019t have a top-down view. We look at the Big Bang from the inside and backwards in time. To further complicate matters, there are several horizons between us and the Bang, the last one being the Planck epoch at the very earliest moment of the universe. At that epoch, the conditions of the universe were so extreme that we don\u2019t have the physics to describe what happened. So we can\u2019t \u2013 at the moment, at least \u2013 explain how the universe came to be or how the energy got there.  We can speculate, though. There are lots of speculations that proposes that there were universes before this, including Predecessor Black Holes and Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, both of which suggest that this universe got its energy from an earlier universe. And there is also the Zero Energy Universe hypothesis. It suggests that the total sum of energy and gravity in the universe is zero: if you take all energy and matter in the universe and sum it to one column, and then all gravitational potential in the other column, they may cancel out one another, leaving you with the tidy sum of zero. There are even some evidence in the large scale structure of the universe which support this wild idea. Although this model doesn\u2019t tell us how the universe came to be, it does explain that it could come from nothing. In fact, it would still be nothing, only very unevenly distributed. ",
