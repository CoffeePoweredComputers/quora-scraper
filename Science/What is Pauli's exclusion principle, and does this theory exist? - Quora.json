            "answer_text": "The Pauli exclusion principle states no two electrons (or other fermions) can have the identical quantum mechanical state in the same atom or molecule. In other words, no pair of electrons in an atom can have the same electronic quantum numbers n (principal quantum number), l (azimuthal quantum number), [math]m_l [/math](magnetic quantum number), [math]m_s[/math] (spin quantum number). Yes, this theory exists and has multiple consequences. ChemistryThe Pauli exclusion principle is used to determine the electron shell structure of atoms.Electrons which are in the same orbital have identical first three quantum number. For example, the 2 electrons in the shell of a helium atom are in the 1s subshell with n = 1, l = 0, and [math]m_l[/math]= 0. Their spin moments cannot be identical, so one is [math]m_s[/math] = -1/2 and the other is [math]m_s[/math]= +1/2.As a consequence, the 1s subshell can only have two electrons, which have opposite spins. Hydrogen is depicted as having a 1s subshell with 1 \"up\" electron ([math]1s^1[/math]). A helium atom has 1 \"up\" and 1 \"down\" electron ([math]1s^2[/math]) Stability of MatterThe consequence of the Pauli principle here is that electrons of the same spin are kept apart by a repulsive exchange interaction, which is a short-range effect, acting simultaneously with the long-range electrostatic or Coulombic force. This effect is partly responsible for the everyday observation in the macroscopic world that two solid objects cannot be in the same place at the same time. AstrophysicsAstronomy provides a demonstration of the effect of the Pauli principle, in the form of white dwarf and neutron stars. In both bodies, atomic structure is disrupted by extreme pressure, but the stars are held in hydrostatic equilibrium by degeneracy pressure (Fermi pressure). ",

            "answer_text": "Yes . This theory does exist The Pauli exclusion principle states that two or more identical fermions (e.g electron) cannot occupy the same Quantum state within a Quantum system simultaneously. In the case of electron in atoms, it can be stated as follows: it is impossible for two electrons of a poly-electron atom to have the same values of the four quantum number; n, the principal quantum number, \u2113, the Azimuthal quantum number, m, the magnetic quantum number, and s, the spin quantum number. e.g., if two electrons reside in the same orbital, then their n, \u2113, and m, values are the same, therefore their s, must be different, and thus the electrons must have opposite half-integer spin projections of 1/2 and \u22121/2.
