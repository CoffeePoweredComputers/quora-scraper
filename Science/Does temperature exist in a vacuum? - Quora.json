            "answer_text": "Temperature is the measure of degree of hotness of amy material. In an elaborated way you can say that it is the measure of degree of spontaneity or vibration of the molecules of the material. When we increase the temperature of a material, it is by exchange heat into the material which results in greater vibrations of the molecules of that material. Now since there is no material (molecules or atoms) present in vacuum, therefore it cannot hold the heat and let the infrared rays pass freely through it which are responsible for heat exchange from stars to planets and so. But if we want to measure the temperature using conventional mercury thermometers (if applicable or valid to be used at such high temperatures) it can show us the temperature because of the heat captured by its bulb, or if using modern infrared thermometer, it reads the temperature of a solid surface and if something is in range it can show the temperature of that as that body too hold the heat. But if you asking about temperature of vacuum, it is not any material so it doesn't have temperature. But still temperature exists in vacuum because we measure that of some body there for example the satellite. ",
