            "answer_text": "What is average density? Short answer: The average density (symbol \u03c1 (rho)) [math]=[/math] mass divided by volume, which says nothing about any \u201cdensity distribution\u201d within the volume. Say e.g., we have a one kg (1 000 g) mass in one cubic decimeter, made up of 1 000 cm[math]^3[/math] cubes of varying mass \u2014 some [math]>[/math] 1 g, some [math]<[/math] 1 g, and some [math]=[/math] 1 g mass. The average density of the box [math]=[/math] 1 000 (g) / 1 000 (cm[math]^3[/math]) [math]=[/math] 1 g/cm[math]^3[/math], just as if it was a homogeneous block of a substance of that density. Wikipedia article Density says: The density, or more precisely, the volumetric mass density, of a substance is its mass per unit volume, The symbol most often used for density is \u03c1 (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter D can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume: [math]{\\displaystyle \\rho ={\\frac {m}{V}},}[/math] where \u03c1 is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume, although this is scientifically inaccurate \u2014 this quantity is more specifically called specific weight. Picky, picky \u2026 One extreme \u201caverage density\u201d is that of the whole Universe \u2014 if we accept published scientific estimates[math]^{[1]}[/math] of total mass ([math]\\approx[/math] 10[math]^{53}[/math]kg) and volume (4[math]\u00d7[/math]10[math]^{80}[/math]m[math]^3[/math]), the term \u201caverage density\u201d takes on a whole new meaning: Average Universe density \u03c1[math]_{Univ}[/math] [math]\u2248[/math] 10[math]^{53}[/math]/4[math]\u00d7[/math]10[math]^{80}\u2248[/math] 2.5[math]\u00d7[/math]10[math]^{-28}[/math]kg/m[math]^3[/math]. This \u201caverage density\u201d is a much better vacuum than any ever \u2014 actually, impossible to ever be \u2014 produced in Earth based scientific labs! The theoretical \u201cunified atomic mass\u201d (unit u (or Da), roughly the mass of one proton) is 1.6605[math]\u00d7[/math]10[math]^{-27}[/math]kg . Calculating a rough total number of protons in the Universe, 10[math]^{53}[/math]kg/1.6605[math]\u00d7[/math]10[math]^{-27}[/math]kg [math]\u2248[/math] 6\u00d710[math]^{79}[/math], \u201cpretty close\u201d to the often cited value 10[math]^{80}[/math] (one estimate of N[math]_{Edd}[/math], Eddington\u2019s number).[math]^{[2]}[/math] This means that the \u201caverage particle density\u201d of the \u201cobservable Universe\u201d is a mind-bogglingly dilute 6[math]\u00d7[/math]10[math]^{79}[/math]/4[math]\u00d7[/math]10[math]^{80}[/math]m[math]^3\u2248[/math] 1.67 protons per cubic meter!  Disclaimer: My results (based on Wikipedia inputs) deviate considerably from those published in Wikipedia \u2026 One of us is wrong, but I don\u2019t know what kind of math the Wikipedia scientists used (I notice that the author figured the Universe volume based on a Universe radius [math]\u2248[/math] 46.5 Gly, which would explain some of the density discrepancies (e.g., it is clear that the NASA/WMAP cosmologists (astrophysicists?) have used a Universe radius [math]\u2248[/math] 13.8 Gly)[math]^{[4]}[/math] \u2014 I have double-checked my own numbers, but cannot see my error(s) \u2026 If someone could find them \u2014 and correct me \u2014 would be Great! Footnotes [1] Universe mass and volume source: Wikipedia, Observable Universe. The volume cited \u2014 4[math]\u00d7[/math]10[math]^{80}[/math]m[math]^3[/math]\u2014 tells me that they have used a Universe radius of around 46.5 billion lightyears. [2] Fun scientific trivia: According to Wikipedia, Eddington once claimed (in a lecture, presumably tongue-in-cheek): I believe there are 15 747 724 136 275 002 577 605 653 961 181 555 468 044 717 914 527 116 709 366 231 425 076 185 631 031 296 protons in the universe and the same number of electrons. The value 10[math]^{80}[/math]is more than six times larger \u2026 [3] I find it interesting that the \u201ccritical\u201d Universe density \u2014 which in theory tells us if the Universe \u201ccurvature\u201d is negative, \u201cflat\u201d (i.e., critical density = actual density), or positive \u2014 can be calculated based only on the \u201cHubble parameter,\u201d current \u201cbest value\u201d H[math]_0[/math]= 70 km/s/Mpc and Newton\u2019s constant! The formula is \u03c1[math]_{Crit}[/math] [math]=[/math] 3H[math]_0^2[/math]/(8\u03c0G), and if we plug in the numbers we get \u03c1[math]_{Crit}[/math] [math]\u2248[/math] 9.2042[math]\u00d7[/math]10[math]^{-27}[/math] kg/m[math]^3[/math] \u2014 so in this crude calculation, the estimated Universe density is about 37 times lower than the critical density, which would mean that the Universe curvature is negative (whatever that might mean to the price of rice in China) \u2014 something is off here \u2026 [4] The map.gsfc.nasa.gov page Content of the Universe publishes yet another set of numbers (dates all the way back to January 2013, in \u201cmodern precision cosmology\u201d terms, extremely outdated, but still): WMAP determined that the universe is flat, from which it follows that the mean energy density in the universe is equal to the critical density (within a 0.5% margin of error). This is equivalent to a mass density of 9.9[math]\u00d7[/math]10[math]^{-27}[/math] kg/m[math]^3[/math], which is equivalent to only 5.9 protons per cubic meter. According to these numbers, the NASA/WMAP scientists live in a Universe where its radius (13.8 Gly) corresponds to its age (13.8 Gy). ",
