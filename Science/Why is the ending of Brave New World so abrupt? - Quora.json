            "answer_text": "Is it that abrupt? Let me set the scene. Brave New World, above all, is a dystopian novel. It tells a story of a future filled with promiscuous sex, drug-soaked happiness and a rigid social structure based on arbitrary characteristics. Sounds pretty bad right? John is a \"savage,\" one of the few holdovers from times forgone. He sees things in a simpler, purer--more human--way. John is what humanity should be like. Goodness turns pure in his veins. He wants meaningful relationships and full awareness of his life rather than the soma stupor everyone else resides in.  At the end, he tries to run away from the horrific society that killed his mother with its degenerateness. He tried to find solace in self-flagellation. His self-harm was a way to purify his soul. His attempts at \"staying good\" failed once society found him. He fell into sinful ways: taking soma and screwing lots of women (perhaps even men?). What does John's downfall mean? If we look at him as a good force and the new society as a degenerate force, then we can see what it all means. The amoral, debased society won while goodness failed. Humanity and goodness wither in face of mass depravity. The only solution? Death. John killed himself because a good person cannot live surrounded by lascivious sin.  In dystopian fiction, either the dystopia wins, or he wins. Never both. In this case, the dystopia defeated the moral hero. I see it as the only logical ending. John couldn't have convinced the society to accept his ways, so he had to die. _____N.B. I'm not using sin the religious sense here. I'm using sin to demonstrate the amorality of the society in Brave New World. ",

            "answer_text": "The ending of Brave New World is anything but abrupt. If you wish to see what an abrupt ending looks like, read 1984. After the wild orgy in which John takes part as well, we cannot help but feel pity on John. He has failed himself and his morality. Though he is a hero far from being perfect, but we do want him to succeed in his mission by resisting all the temptations and choosing a life of meaning over worldly desires. But, he fails. We can sense the ending subconsciously after he breaks down after realizing what he has done. We know that it\u2019s just a page left to be read and nothing dramatic would happen now. Though we sense the ending but we do not know it yet. We wish that the John pledges something to come back stronger than ever triumphing his evils. But we are also aware of the fact that we are being needlessly optimistic and nothing of that sort is going to happen. We can only hope. WARNING : SPOILERS. I simply loved the way Huxley depicted the death of John. It is the single most wonderful depiction of death I\u2019ve read. The best part about it is that it never explicitly tells you that the John has committed suicide. Different people realize his death at different points of time. Some as soon as the feet were seen dangling down, some when his feet turn around and some never at all. Those who don\u2019t, wonder what the hell just happened and turn to google for an explanation. But for those who do, those epic final lines symbolizing directions prove to be a brutal punch straight in the face. This is why the ending feels abrupt, though it is not. We do not want this particular ending to take place despite knowing that it will. ",
