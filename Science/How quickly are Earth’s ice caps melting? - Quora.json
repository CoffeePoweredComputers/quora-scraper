            "answer_text": "Very quickly. That\u2019s why James Anderson is saying that the arctic caps could be ice free in summer 2022. If you look at 5 year old sea ice, which is much more difficult to melt, you see that it declined by more than 90% in the 30 years from 1986 to 2016. That\u2019s a rate of 9% from the starting amount every 3 years.  Since there was only around 10% old ice left in 2016, this will be gone within a year or two at a 9% declining rate per year and possibly result in an ice-free arctic in 2022. Why is 5 year old sea ice so important? \u201c\u2026 not all ice is created equal. It used to be that ice that had been around for more than five years was much slower to melt. These maps show the decline of ice aged 5 and up in September when ice extent is at its minimum. Older Arctic ice should be thicker and thus less likely to melt during the warm summer months. Younger ice breaks up more easily and allows more heat to escape from the ocean to the atmosphere, leading to higher ocean temperatures during the summer.\u201d Source: The Arctic\u2019s ice age problem Once older sea ice is gone, the remaining young ice will disappear exponentially faster. If the ice-free arctic doesn\u2019t come in 2022, then definitely in the coming decade. The problem with that is that it will increase global temperatures even more since ice reflects 50% of incoming sunlight while ocean surface only reflects 6%. Antarctica isn\u2019t doing much better. While sea in East Antarctica has increased by a very small percentage throughout the last decades, the total ice mass has drastically decreased.  The problem is, once the old sea ice is gone and only the young ice is left, we will possibly see a sea level rise double as fast, which will flood the homes of more than 600 million people more and more. That\u2019s why people say we only have 12 years time until the world will completely change, but it might already happen much sooner. ",

            "answer_text": "I was asked by Lara to answer this but I see that John Flavin has given an excellent answer as has Donald Fone . I have also responded to Tony Sanders\u2019 answer here as well bringing to his attention the fact that there appears to be fraudulent behaviour on the part of those institutions we should all be able to trust and that, for many, many years, there has been nothing but failed predictions by those persons who express alarm concerning climatic trends and are the recipients of taxpayer and consumer benefits that flow from doing so. Bizarrely, it is likely we are heading into a cooling period, not an ever warmer globe. See:  GSM - Modern Grand Solar Minimum Documentary published on Mar 16, 2017 This documentary suggests the world is heading not to a warming event but a freezing one! This is a good comprehensive documentary which points out how fast this change is likely to occur.  As a final comment, there is not just one influence that affects the climate here on earth. It is known that the sun plays a major role in this but there are many other influences as well. For example, the earth is in an elliptical orbit. During the Northern winter is it the closest it has been to the sun for around 40,000 years. Given that radiation is a function of the square of the distance, this means that the earth is receiving around 6% more radiation than it was 40,000 years ago when it is this close to the sun. This graph shows the relationship between solar radiation and temperatures here on earth.  There appears to be a good correlation in this. (But always be cautious of jumping too quickly to absolute conclusion because correlation does not necessarily mean causation.) Clouds have a significant effect on the temperatures being experienced here on earth because they tend to reflect the sun\u2019s heat but will also delay the exit of heat from the earth. Here is a graph that shows a good correlation between Cosmic Rays and cloud cover. When the sun\u2019s magnetic field decreases due to what is called a solar minimum, cloud cover increases and the earth becomes cooler.  For the last 8 years, winters in the Northern Hemisphere have become increasingly colder and more severe. (Note, by definition, climate is the average of weather over 30 years. So 8 years does not a \u201cclimate\u201d make but it\u2019s on the way to being so.) I hope you have found this interesting. ",
