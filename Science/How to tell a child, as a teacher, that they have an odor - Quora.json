            "answer_text": "Well, this is from someone who was that kid - absolutely DON'T go to the parents about it. Either they're unaware of the problem and so could then have the problem themselves and you'll only offend them and, depending on the intelligence of the parents - bring a world of trouble down on the kid and yourself. Or they could be like my parents - aware of this issue and using it to keep the kid down. I was not allowed to practice normal hygiene because my mother said only \u201csluts who were trying to get boys attention behaved like that.\u201d i was allowed daily showers but that wasn't enough, we lived in a subtropical climate. A parent doing similar will just punish the kid for exposing their abuse. (Like, you're supposed to stink but not around anyone who could call out your parents!?) I was an adult before someone told me, bluntly and disgustedly and I was devastated. Looking back, people had tried to hint to me before, but I didn't understand - having been trained to not notice the smell as different. So please DO let the child know that you've noticed an odor, they might not be too upset, but if they're sensitive like I was they'll be crushed. So just accept that, and that they're going to hate you for this wound for a bit, but better that now then letting them go on in that state. They'll be grateful one day and will probably never forget you. Just be as kind as you can and make sure they know HEAPS of kids go through this - dont call it a \u201cproblem\u201d (exaggerate here, because you dont want defences going up which will make them not listen to the hygeine advice) and then straight away have the hygiene advice ready. Say lots of people dont get taught this at home, it's quite common. And then just explain everything quickly - regular bathing, hair washing, teeth brushing, deodorant etc. Be very basic, like say \u201cgenerally the advice is to shower daily, put deodorant on every day, wash hair every 2\u20133 days and brush teeth at least twice a day\u201d or whatever your local customs are, make it a quick list so they absorb the information without lingering too long on what they don't know and thus reinforcing the shame. Make sure they know that not everyone knows this - that they're not strange. You could have a small bag of supplies ready, that could be a huge help, but they might not be able to bring it home if their parents are like mine. If parents like that smell a clean fragrance on their child they could inflict further punishment and take it off them. If they say they're not allowed to use that much water (not sure where you're from, and local water access/costs) maybe have some alternatives to showering in mind, like having a \u201cbits-n-pits\u201d wash in the sink. Lol I'm not sure what you're allowed to say in that regard. Also be prepared that the parents may still come after you, be ready to stand your ground and explain why its important for their child to know this stuff. If they dont practice it at home, they'll be all sorts of furious at your \u201cinterference\u201d and \u201ccriticism\u201d. Get your principal/another teacher to have your back Thank you for wanting to do this for the child - you are doing a really kind thing. I am now so paranoid about odors of any kind and have never got over the humiliation and deep down feeling of being nothing more than trash. You could be preventing this! ",

            "answer_text": "This is always a sensitive topic\u2026more so if the child is a teen where appearance and \u2018self-presentation' is at the top of the social/peer critique list. For the record, it may NOT be a case of the child being neglected or the child/parents not understanding proper hygiene. Those cases tend to be fairly evident: dirty clothes, re-worn clothes, dirty hair and nails, etc\u2026 For many children, especially those starting or in puberty, it can actually be a medical, hormonal or chemical balance issue. This is the case with our 15 year old daughter. The year before she entered puberty, we noticed she seemed to have unusually strong body odor. She showers every day\u2026sometimes twice a day. She always has clean clothes and uses deodorant, but she would still start to have a noticeable body odor a few hours later. Although no one at her middle school ever said anything to her or us, we knew they had to notice. I would pick her up after school and the minute she got in the car I would need to roll the windows down it was so strong! We gently tried EVERY remedy available to us at home. We made sure she was washing properly and tried various combinations of deodorants, body washes, natural/holistic remedies\u2026anything we researched, we tried, but nothing really helped. As she approached entering high school, where peer critique and bullying is even worse and boys/dating would enter the picture, we were really worried for her. High school boys (and girls!) can be extremely cruel, both intentionally AND unintentionally. She is a special needs child, extremely sensitive and suffers from anxiety. Although her body is that of a normal 15 year old young woman, her mind is a few years behind. She is used to people being kind to her and she's a beautiful girl, so she garners a lot of attention from boys. Again, we were really worried about what would happen when she entered high school. We consulted her pediatrician and he immediately set us up with an endocrinologist. It turns out that like myself, she suffers from polycystic ovarian syndrome. Her hormone levels, particularly her testosterone levels (yes\u2026women have it, too!), were way out of balance. Her body was producing too much of some hormones and not enough of others. There are medications, like some birth control pills, that help with that. Many medications have purposes beyond their advertised one and while some may disapprove of putting their daughters on birth control (though I don't know why!), this was a medicine that could help her balance her hormones and in turn, help the body odor problem. So we tried it and it worked! It didn't \u2018cure' the odor problem completely, but it helped enough that in combination with careful hygiene, she could make it through a hot day of school without it being too noticeable. My point here is that the child you are trying to help may have a medical issue, not a hygiene or family neglect issue. But how do you approach the family directly? As others have written, that can be very tricky. I would start by NOT singling out the child. Get permission to send home a letter to ALL the children's parents. Explain gently that with it being summertime and with so many people closed up in a room, there have been some issues with strong odors. Ask that each parent discuss proper hygiene with their child, as sometimes children need reminders. Then offer to be of assistance if anyone has concerns for their child or needs help. If possible and guidelines allow for it, require the letter to be signed and returned so that you know the specific child you are trying to help has indeed given the letter to their parents. Perhaps the child's parents simply aren't aware of what is going on because they are use to how their child smells. For those that ARE aware, perhaps this will motivate them to help their child, so they as parents, aren't singled out for what most would consider an embarrassing situation. Hopefully this first step will do the trick. If not, my second step would be to privately talk to the child. If it's a case of the family not being able to afford soap or deodorant, maybe you or the school can help by giving out small bags of essential hygiene products. Then the child could take it home and say \u2018hey\u2026they were giving these out to everyone today\u2019 and the parents wouldn't feel like they were being singled out for charity or pitied. However, the trickiest position you might find yourself in is if the parents (for whatever reason) don't want their child to change the current situation. At that point, perhaps a one on one meeting with you and a guidance counselor or school nurse would be necessary. The bottom line is this problem does need to be addressed for the child's sake. The older he/she gets, the worse the bullying and picking on will get and those situations almost always end badly for the poor child. You will also have to accept that nothing you try may help. If the parents aren't willing to parent properly and help their child, you may not get anywhere. Kudos to you for stepping up and trying!! I deeply admire teachers who truly care for their students beyond the lesson plan. Good luck!! ",

            "answer_text": "So, I can tell you as a mental health professional that this has been one of the most challenging subjects with which to approach someone. There are many ways to do it and the best way depends a great deal on many factors; the age & gender of the child, the nature and strength of your relationship with the child, how often you have observed the odor and your sense about the source of it. Breath, foot and armpits that are not fresh can be a lil less daunting than odor emanating from the middle grounds. One approach for a child 8 or older is to give them a book on personal hygiene. There are many that are written for children\u2019s reading levels. American Girl has a nice one. I\u2019ve added a pic of it below. You can take the child aside and say something like \u201cSweetheart, you are getting to that age where it\u2019s really important to learn how to take care of yourself. This book covers most, if not all that you need to know to make sure you are fresh and clean when you leave the house.\u201d You can offer a gift that contains a hygiene kit with a toothbrush, toothpaste, natural salts deodorant, a fragrant body wash and matching body spray (I.e. Bath & Body Works Warm Vanila Sugar). You can normalize it for her and say, \u201cMore people than you might think, face hygiene challenges at some time in their life.\u201d I actually had an 8 year old with whom I had a similar conversation. Her teeth were thick with plaque and red from candy in the mornings. I asked her if she brushed her teeth in the morning. Her family was poor and she told me that her brother would take her toothbrush to use it. I put together a hygiene kit for her and told her to hide it in the house where her brother wouldn\u2019t find it. It might be a good idea to inform your Principal about your plan, if you choose to go this route, in case you or your principal gets approached by an angry parent who objects to your gifts. If that should happen, I\u2019d just apologize & say \u2018we wanted to help without causing your daughter undue embarrassment\u2019.  ",

            "answer_text": "I would say you don\u2019t, not if all you have about it is what\u2019s in your question. Especially if the kid is young, like too young to have reliable autonomy regarding hygiene. As is, there are too many variables that are beyond your knowledge or comprehension. Besides, poor hygiene in itself isn\u2019t particularly interfering with education and learning abilities, so in my view this would be an inconvenience at most. I don\u2019t mean that you should just shrug it off and turn a blind eye, especially if you suspect some form of neglect, voluntary or not. I had a kindergarten student that smelled of urine. His clothes smelled even though he would not soil himself during school time. So I talked to his parent, privately and without the kid. I tried to keep it professional, straightforward and non judgmental : \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that X\u2019s clothes regularly smell of urine. There have been no \u201caccidents\u201d at school, he is able to use the toilet all by himself. But accidents can still happen at home and he might be too shy to tell right away, thank you for being vigilant and making sure to dress him in a clean outfit in the morning.\u201d The same mindful yet direct communication with the legal guardian can be applied to your situation. Then if the problem persists or if other significant clues hinted toward a difficult situation at home, I would recommend the involvement of a social worker to assist the parents and accompany the family through that process, in concertation with the school administration. Once a support network is in place, leave it to the social workers and the family to sort out. Hygiene issues can stem from a variety of situations from parental difficulties to poor living conditions, unpaid utility bills, to abuse or neglect. We cannot presume without actual involvement in the family\u2019s life and we cannot offer advice on problems we don\u2019t know. Ultimately, once steps have been taken to ensure the that the family is receiving help and the child\u2019s welfare is monitored appropriately, our responsibility is to provide them an education in the same conditions as all other students.

            "answer_text": "You didn\u2019t mention the age range of the child. That\u2019s quite an important factor. At a certain age, as a teacher, I think it would be possible to lightly handle this successfully. You need to do it in a way that prevents the child from feeling singled out and/or humiliated. Please remember, though, that what smells \u2018appropriate\u2019 is entirely subjective. You may have an issue where it isn\u2019t an issue for other people. As a general rule of thumb, though, it\u2019s no bad thing to engender an interest in personal grooming and hygiene with children. So\u2026 How to do it? I think you incorporate a short spate of lessons into the general or, even, science curriculum. Treat body odors as a science lesson. Talk about soaps and body washes and antiperspirants etc. in an environmental context. Try get hold of a load of free samples and offer them to the class for judgement. Talk about the ingredients. Talk about their rating for being ecologically friendly. Talk about \u2018scent notes\u2019. Talk about how the same scent can smell differently when it reacts with an individuals genetic makeup. Get the whole class fascinated in the science and evolution of human smells! When I was little - I used to love smelling things. I\u2019d find people\u2019s perfumes, lotions and after shaves and I\u2019d open them up and smell them. Sometimes I\u2019d mix things together, much to the chagrin of my family, to make new and improved smells. Curiously, however, I did go through a phase (when I hit puberty) of finding the new smell of my armpits really intriguing. I could have benefited, hugely, from an exhaustive lesson on why girls start to smell a bit funky at a certain age and why that level of advertising of the ripeness isn\u2019t such a great idea in modern society (it can be very counterproductive). So - that\u2019s how I would tackle the situation. You don\u2019t really have a right to impose your ideas about grooming/hygiene on another individual - however unpleasant you might find theirs. You can, as a teacher, come at it from every direction. That\u2019s kind of the role of a teacher :) . Get the whole class, including \u2018the child\u2019, interested in the whole topic. ",

            "answer_text": "I will tell you the same thing I told the teachers, friends, school counselors, Princials, family members etc. who told me our daughter stinks. PLEASE tell her your self. When we aquired our daughter at the age of 14 [foster care] she had terrible hygiene. She never brushed her teeth, wouldn\u2019t put on deodarant, we had to force her to shower [through lack of privileges]. I started watching her her do the deodarant and teeth as often as I could, but wasn\u2019t always possible. Then I kept getting calls and emails about the odor \u201cplease discuss hygiene with your daughter\u201d \u201cPlease make sure your daughter is wearing clean clothes\u201d they would list how to how have good hygiene, like they were talking to me , like I had no idea how what hygiene was and that I had no idea she stunk. I would be very frustrated and respond as such. I would tell them I am FULLY aware she stinks, I KNOW how to have good hygiene , do not lecture me ,you have no idea how hard we\u2019ve tried. I told them I have talked to her repeatedly , this time I will not because you need do it. She needs more than just me telling her. Just her parents telling her wasn\u2019t motivating enough. She needed a little humility to realize she needed to take steps to be cleaner. Finally after they started telling her themselves , as well as my friends [who are like aunties] and her friends, she now really works on herself. We still struggle with regular teeth brushing, but it\u2019s now at least once a day, daily showers , deodarant 2x a day, doesn\u2019t rewear her clothes. I hate to say, but a little embarrassment goes a long way. As a school bus driver I find this works in general, slightly embarass a kid that won\u2019t stop being terrible on the bus and he tends to stop. Some might think it\u2019s heartless or cruel, I see it more as tough love. It would have been a worse situation to just keep on letting her stink. ",

            "answer_text": "What we have had to do at School is this: we have clean clothes ready for the child and then one of us \u201caccidentally\u201d spills something on this child. We then take the Child and have him/ her change and \u201c clean \u201d them up throughly. We put their clothes in the washer & dryer and send them home in their clean clothes. This usually has to happen 4\u20135 times and then the majority of parents send their child to School having bathed and with clean clothes. To talk to a child I have done the following: I sit the child down and plainly say, \u201c I need to talk to you about hygiene. If they are old enough to know what that means, good, if not, then you explain in simple terms, its washing each day , why, etc. You then have to ask the hard question: \u201c can you shower at-home,?\u201d You will get all kinds of answers. Keep your voice and body language as neutral as possible. If the child cannot shower at home then you let them know you have some items if they need them. Be prepared with items, wash cloths, soap, whatever they need. Offer to be there early so they can clean up before school, offer to wash their clothes if its needed. Do your best to provide whatever they need. It such a hard conversation to have but most children have more self awareness then what we give them credit for. And chances are if you have noticed, so have others including other kids. I have also talked to Parents about their Child's hygiene It was a hard conversation because some parents became ( understandably so) extremely defensive. I reassure them that some children don't like to bathe, some have just picked bathtime as their favorite battleground and on rare occasions it was because the family was in shelters or homeless. I wish you the best of luck and I thank you for looking out for you Students. ",

If someone has an odor that offends us, it is not their responsibility to us to smell the way we want them too.. If we are offended by an odor it is not our right to \u201ccorrect\u201d the person of someone else. That being said, if a child has an odor and it is effecting personal interactions in class, 2 things: Is the odor because of a lack of knowledge with personal hygiene. If so, without singling out individuals, you can do a class module on hygiene. Make it fun top it off with gift bags of age appropriate pampering hygienic bliss. You can do this for very little by visiting a dollar store and creating scent filled sample size wonder. For teenagers or older kids add a couple of lottery baskets \u201cBigger Better Bling\". If you discuss this plan ahead of time with your school counselor and principal there should be no problem with approval on how to tactfully Help your entire class rather than single out one individual. Secondly, If there is a health concern?? For instance Diabetes-can smell sickly sweet Anemia and mineral deficiencies-smell like Cat Pee. \u2026Thats right the tell tell cat pee smell that many children get teased or blamed for poor hygiene is actually Ammonia byproduct from protein and mineral deficiency common to busy working households living on quick fry high calorie low nutrient food. Without access to fresh foods this is common and oddly overlooked. So if its Ammonia understand people don't always have the resources they need to be healthy, How can you help? If the health concern is more serious, like possible diabetes, notify the school nurse and discuss concerns with the parents. Hope this is helpful.

            "answer_text": "I think this really depends on the age and maturity of the child. If the child is younger than 8 or so, I'd either mention it nicely to the parent if I have a good rapport with them, or I'd refer it to the nurse. They generally do wellness checks on the students, so that can easily be mentioned. If the child is upper elementary or middle school, I would work some personal hygiene lessons into class. I always called this \u201cAdulting 101\" with the older kids. I would focus a weekly \u201clife hack\" that ranged anywhere from personal hygiene to manners to managing money. It only took 5-15 minutes or so each week. There are always funny but informative videos you can find on sensitive topics. If that didn't work, I'd ask the child how things were going at home and proceed from there. Sometimes they will tell you the problem without you actually having to bring it up (parent working a lot, water got turned off, having to move between households, etc.). High schoolers are easier. If the kid is on a sports team, you could talk to the coach (without naming names) and ask them to remind the kids about hygiene. You can also just make a general PSA to remind everyone that soap, water, and deodorant are their friends and Axe isn't a substitute. Humor is helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "At my school, we are lucky enough to have a full-time nurse. She has made it her mission to deal with this issue which is very common among growing children, and like others below, does not necessarily stem from neglect on the part of the parent. Every year at the beginning of the school year, we have an assembly for the freshmen class and every child gets a bag with the basics: deoderant, toothbrush, toothpaste, a package of disposable razors, and a pack of moist towelletes. The nurse shows them what everything is for and the bag goes to their locker. They can refill it themselves or they can come in and ask for more. If I have this particular concern, I send the nurse an email, and then she finds the kid. If you\u2019re not lucky enough to have this level of resources, then I would work with your colleagues to designate someone who is comfortable having those conversations and either do it assembly style the way we do, or be discrete and have one-on-one sessions. An answerer below said she worries it can be a very hard blow for a kid to hear this. I think that\u2019s why the right messenger matters. I\u2019m really great at communicating with kids, but not about stuff like this. When I worked at a school that didn\u2019t have a nurse, I had one female colleague and one male colleague. He or she would take the student to their classroom and fold the odor issue into a host of hygiene issues that everyone worries about. This approach softened the blow. ",

Don\u2019t put the child in the position of knowing they smell bad and having to continue sitting there with other children.

Let the child know you\u2019ll begin washing and drying their clothing while they shower, and the following day they can shower again and have their original clean clothing to put back on. It works beautifully. I\u2019ve helped children with this once using a nursing room shower, and another time, the gym shower. The children LOVED showering! We provided nice soap, a scrubber, shampoo and rinse, deodorant, comb and brush, tooth brush and tooth paste. They never resisted being able to clean up, instead, they often took a full period cleaning and grooming themselves. It was such a gift to everyone.

Is this odour from what the child is eating or is it from a lack of cleanliness or proper hygiene? The age of the child makes a big difference. If it is a small child and you think that it is a problem, you could very gently speak to the parent privately so that they can try to rectify the situation. You have to be careful not to embarrass them. Let them know that this kind of thing happens so that they don\u2019t feel like they are the only one who has been told this. If we are talking about an older child or a preteen, children this age don\u2019t always realize when they are giving off an odour. It could be that they now need deodorant which they had never used before. It is possible that they are not showering enough or brushing their teeth regularly. Ideally, this child will probably take hearing this better from a teacher who is the same sex as them or from a teacher that they have a close relationship with. It should not be made to sound like it is an extremely big deal as this could cause further embarrassment. Just let them know that this is not uncommon as children are getting older and their bodies are changing. A caring teacher will be much kinder than a bully who makes fun of them for it if the issue is not addressed. ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t believe the below answer from a MALE councellor who suggests talking to the kid,, and blaming someone else for telling at the same time. Are you sure councelling is what you are supposed to be doing.?? I don\u2019t think there could be anything worse for a young girl, than to be embarrassed by an older man, telling her she stinks. Why not also tell her you think she\u2019s stupid and won\u2019t amount to anything in life. That\u2019s another thing teachers and school councellors are pretty good at - and usually wrong. The answer is obvious. The FEMALE teacher should call the girl\u2019s mother and have a chat. Yes,, a CHAT. You don\u2019t call the mother and TELL HER what\u2019s wrong with her child. If fact you don\u2019t call the mother and TELL her anything. For some reason, teachers always think they are right, and can\u2019t fail.. Well, I can tell you absolute certainty teachers are wrong - A LOT. Have a friendly chat with the mother, and bring up the problem - in a nice way. You have no idea if this is a medical problem, a hygiene problem, or a household problem. You obviously don\u2019t know. And don\u2019t judge and DON\u2019T go the teacher\u2019s lounged later and gossip about the kid - like teachers do. Maybe the mother will understand and correct the problem by speaking to her child. If you MUST talk to the kid, be understanding and bring it up in compassionate way. I know teachers love humiliating kids, but seriously, don\u2019t. Be nice to a young girl with a problem. That is all. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a tough position to be in. When I was a young teen I had horrible BO and there were plenty of well meaning adults who tried to let me know. I\u2019d recommend taking some additional detail about the situation . Are they about the age where they have hit puberty? Is the BO after recess/PE? Are they coming to school with BO and unwashed clothes? These details could provide more info on if this is a normal puberty issue, a hygiene issue, or a resource access issue. From there, just try to do it where the student\u2019s peers will not hear or see and try to bring it up as \u201cI noticed this and this is not a negative thing about you, but it can you and others. If so, have you tried xyz?\u201d Just be prepared that the kid will still be embarrassed and may not react favorably. Chances are, if you\u2019ve noticed, so have they. My final piece of advice is if your relationship with the kid is distant or not positive, you are not the person to tell them. Maybe they have a better relationship with another teacher you can talk to. I found that the teachers I liked least were more likely to mention my body oder and it was never well received. When a teacher I was close to finally mentioned it, I\u2019d heard at least a dozen times before that. ",

Don\u2019t wait for the student to come to you, they almost certainly won\u2019t and they need an adult to collaborate with so they can fix the situation. If they get upset when you talk to them, act surprised and say \u201cthis is pretty normal for your age, it\u2019s really no big deal, but we do want to fix it if we can.\u201d Most students take this information much better than you might think. Then comes the big three questions: Are you showering everyday?Do you wear deodorant everyday?Are you wearing fresh clothes everyday (including hoodies)?There might be an issue of poverty, such as an inability to do these three things or something like cat pee or cigarettes in the house. If that\u2019s the case, talk to the school counselor or social worker and see what options you have. If it\u2019s one of the three big things, stress you them that these three things have to happen everyday with no exceptions or they will definitely smell, and this is just part of growing up.

            "answer_text": "It depends on the age of the child. Middle school for example you have the class puberty talk and let everyone know that they all should start wearing deodorant. Elementary school you ask the child about their hygiene practices and supplies. Based on their responses you either teach self care lessons on hygiene or reach out to the family with community resources saying something along the lines of, I was talking to your child today and they mentioned that you could benefit from some of these resources. If the child responds that they do not have access to hygiene equipment it may also be worth looking into a cps report to make sure the child is not being neglected. If you have had a conversation with the child and they have access and are regularly washing it may be a dietary or cultural thing that you are not used to. (Such as eating lots of curry or using oils for skin and hair maintenance.) in these instances you should not try to change these behaviors because of the smell, but instead take it as a learning opportunity.

Perhaps set aside some time to teach the class about hygiene and laundry and housekeeping and hope it enlightens he who needs it and helps them all. I understand you have so much to do as is and we as parents should do our part but in this case flexibility and perspective is key. You are a teacher to enlighten and help a childs evolution and this is what one of your children need and from my perspective on society all could benefit from. Maybe ten minutes at the end of each day of a self- care month and go over handwashing, teeth brushing, laundry, hair washing, showers, dishes ie how often and how then discuss the why. Clean self and surroundings and let them teach you the benefits. It may not be what you expected but there is a lovely video Im sure you can find of a teacher who lined chairs in rows and taped two balloons together to the backs then demonstrated proper wiping techniques using the balloons in place of the bottom and realize your not alone. A brilliant teacher teaches what her students need to learn not just what they are told to teach. I also read of a teacher who had a box and she had her children drop notes in the box and she learned the most amazing things wo shaming anyone like who needed a hug, who was lonely at lunch etc. This may help you learn this child knows they smell but simply needs soap in their home. Best wishes, I applaud your caring heart. ",

Then when they come & still smell bad, you ask, did you not like my gift? You may find out that the family does not have running water or other issues. But that is the way I would approach it. If you try to do it in a nice way first. Then if you have found that they have running water & still doesn\u2019t change their hygiene, then say it to them. Tell them that you are concerned that other kids may pick on them because they have body odor. I have a 14 year old grandson that smells like a man who worked out side all day. We have given him body wash & deodorant but I think it\u2019s the age where he just doesn\u2019t care.

If they smell the same thing, have a private chat with the child about basic hygiene (awkward, but ask the nurse for tips). Then suggest they ask their parents for deodorant, because all the other kids are using it as well (that\u2019s tricky, as parents can be stupid about implied criticism and where they find it). They could be rough-and-tumble kids who sweat more than normal - which is rough for everybody, but nothing that can be controlled. If you\u2019re the only one who detects an odor, then human reproduction is telling you that person isn\u2019t genetically compatible. It\u2019s complex and kind of fascinating. On an informal study, we had two male lifeguards working at my facility. One kid was simply rank to me, even after his shower, while another boy had little \u201caroma\u201d. For another guard, it was just the opposite. The guard I couldn\u2019t smell would remind her of rotten onions, while the boy I was off-put by didn\u2019t smell to her.

If it's another type of odor saying something could embarrass them. A couple of years ago I lived with my boyfriend and his family, his mother had 8 or 9 dogs large dogs in the house as well as a few cars causing the house to smell horrible any fabrics in the house picked up the smell as well.

Doing a class presentation could make that child the target of mockery since many would guess who it is directed at (if you can smell the kid, so can the other children). I don't recommend it. Have you tried asking other teachers what they would do in your place? Can you ask a social worker or maybe even the school principal? As one person said in her response, the child could be hurt.

If the child is a teenager, it might be an idea for the whole class to have one or two sessions on personal hygiene. Something similar might be carried with a class of younger children, pitched at the right level for the age group. However, before taking any action I would mention the problem to your head teacher and ask for some advice. If the problem persists, and you happen to meet the child\u2019s parents, probably at a parents\u2019 evening, you might find an opportunity to gently enquire as to how often the child takes a shower or a bath\u2014but tread carefully!

I imagine there were a couple of kids in the class who had this problem and the teacher didn\u2019t want to single them out or embarrass them, so she spoke to the whole class about it together. I think it might have been part of a PSHE lesson. The gist was, you\u2019re starting to get into puberty and so are going to need to take personal hygiene more seriously and maybe wear some deodorant. I like that approach because body odour is something that everyone is going to have to deal with at some point in their lives, and 10 year olds don\u2019t really see it as an issue or something they need to control. Her using it as a teaching moment didn\u2019t shame anyone or turn it into a personal affront; it was presented as something that everyone should start thinking about doing. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for your request that I share my opinion on this topic. I will share with you from my personal experiences. (it\u2019s long, as usual) At one time I was an interpreter for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, and also an Instructional Assistant for these same children, k-12 -depending on the needs of year. I spent the majority of my years in one elementary school class enrolled with 12\u201314 children k-6 students. We had a very small, almost skeletal boy, who I will name Carl. Carl was born with severe deafness. Perhaps their frustration or being too young or for whatever reason, his parents abandoned/safe surrendered him as a weeks old infant. From the time he was born until the age of 7.5 years he went from foster home to foster home several times per year. He came to our classroom only knowing \u201ccommand\u201d signs: \u2018toilet\u2019, \u2018eat\u2019, \u2018drink\u2019, bed\u2019, \u2018sit\u2019 etc., a total of about 30 words. He never received hearing aides. He had never attended school for more than 2\u20133 weeks per year since kindergarten. He was considered \u201cwild\u201d; one remark in his file said he was a child of \u201clow intelligence with a feral upbringing\u201d. He was the poster boy for being a \u201cborn loser\u2019 because no one in his 7.5 years had ever loved him or bothered to learn how to communicate with him. He came to us with scars all over his body from abuses he had suffered at the hands of \u201ccare givers\u201d. So yes, when he was dropped off into our class, he had no idea who we were or why he was suddenly in a room full of strangers, adults and children, and he reacted as any frightened child would. We were fortunate that we were able to reach him, help him feel safe, and we increased his vocabulary by almost 80\u2013100 words per day until he caught up to his age level. He was BRILLIANT! As in most classrooms we had \u201cgroup\u201d learning depending on the level and understanding the children were put into the group that could best help them progress to the next level. We had one Deaf Educator, and two Instructional Aides. \u2192 Carl and I were the first to make a trusted connection, so most of the groups he was assigned to were mine. When Carl came to my first group of the day, you could literally smell him before he got to the table, a combination or cigarette smoke, alcohol, urine, filthy clothes, and \u2018sour\u2019. His skin was dry and he would try to lick himself to relieve the itch and sometimes pain. He wasn\u2019t nurtured in his new home and rarely had clean clothes, and his hygiene was also absent. \u2192 NONE of the situations that Carl had to endure were his fault or responsibility. The care he had received his entire life was that of an unwanted dog. To speak to the \u201ccare givers\u201d about any subject Carl was involved in was like trying to converse with a log. They were there to \u201cput a roof over his head and keep him alive, after that [their] responsibility ended.\u201d I was known in our classroom as the \u2018organizer\u2019, the \u2018clean freak\u2019, and everyone knew I brushed and flossed my teeth, and washed my hands often enough that my first year in that classroom all the kids got together and bought me a new toothbrush, floss, and a small bottle of Purell for Christmas! In order to allow Carl to feel safe, and for the other children to not make fun of him, I made it a habit that when everyone came to my group throughout the day, I would hand out baby wipes and have all of us, myself included, wash our face, hands, and put healing lotion on our hands and arms. It took less than 3 minutes, and after the first week they didn\u2019t even wait for instructions, they just began the routine. This seemed to help his situation without causing him to feel embarrassed over things he had never learned how to do on his own and no one had done for him in the past. No one questioned it because it seemed like something I would do because of my personality. The entire class was also given a small 10 minute \u2018hygiene minute\u2019 every day for about a month; teaching us all the importance of basic hygiene, brushing teeth, taking a shower, how to wash hands often and well, how to use the toilet properly, when and how to ask parents for deodorant or new socks, -we\u2019re talking B A S I C things that needed to be taught. The other children had no clue this was directed primarily to Carl because we taught it to everyone like we did other total class subjects. \u201cMatthew, have you ever forgotten to take a shower? How did you feel once you remembered? \u201cLisa, do you brush your teeth as many times as Ms. Brown? (everyone laughed at that one and she said \u201cNO ONE brushes their teeth as much as Ms. Brown!\u201d) \u201cJust mercy! I got home last night and I had stinky feet! (more laughter) Carl, how do you get rid of stinky feet?\u201d \u2026and so on. After a while he caught on and began washing and trying to come in clean clothes, although he certainly did not get help from home. He even approached us from time to time when he spilled during lunch, \u201cHow do I get this out of my shirt before I go back to class?\u201d \u2192 All of this to say if you have a child with poor hygiene chances are it is not his or her fault in any way, and kindness and compassion is the only way to resolve the issue. If you can find a way to include everyone in on the lesson it will cause less embarrassment for the single child. If you cannot, add this to the list of \u2018extra\u2019 things you will now get to do. This child is being neglected and if you notice, you can do something that can change their life for the better. I am happy to report that while Carl was with us those couple of years he grew tremendously in mind and spirit, had friends, trusted a few more adults, and his behaviours settled in to average for his age within a month or so. When he left us he cried because he had felt love and compassion. He had become so much more of his true self. All he needed was someone to patiently teach him. Be kind and compassionate. ",

Don\u2019t give a reason why. Be sure the style and everything will look nice to the child not nice to you and how you would want them to dress. Pay special attention to what they\u2019re into and what they\u2019re interested in as far as characters or any motifs that may be on the clothing. As a good teacher who cares pay special attention to whether or not this child is being bullied or teased. If they need washing or deodorant speak to them very privately and very gently in a way that doesn\u2019t embarrass them and perhaps even say, when I was your age I had exactly the same thing. Normalize it - tell them that they\u2019re one of your favorite students and you only want to help them. And that you\u2019ll do everything you can. ",

If the parents resist or seem abusive, call CPS and let them deal with it. If they are receptive, keep reading! Their kid may simply rinse off rather than soaping up the critical areas, or may have inherently stinky feet or other issues. Explain to the parents that at times the odor can be severe, and can not only become a distraction for other kids, but a concern for bullying. Suggest they talk to their kid about the proper way to shower, and why (how fast odor causing bacteria replicate, how to get rid of the bacteria). If these options don\u2019t work, try a bubble bath with deodorant liquid bath soap. Sitting and soaking in a bubble bath for 20 minutes will help. Ask them to provide the proper tools, such as deodorant bar soap in a bath net, deodorant liquid bath soap and a washcloth, deodorant, sweat block cream for feet, a change of socks mid-day, etc. The odor issue may not go away 100%, but it should improve.

There were lots of dogs that peed all over his clothes (both clean and dirty), and they often didn't have running water for bathing. I don't know all the details, but it sounded like a hoarding situation to me. We finally found a solution that worked for him/us. As soon as he got to school he would shower in the boy's locker room. While he was showering we would speed wash and dry his clothes in the home-ec room. He knew he smelled, but there wasn't much he could do about it at home. Everyone was happier when he was able to clean up at school. ",

You will likely have to involve parents or guardians as a next step. Having you address it now will help the child in the future. ",

Have you ever watched on youtube the programs about hoarding? I saw one where the children of the home knew they smelled funny but they didn\u2019t know what to do about it. Perhaps there is a reason for the odor that the child has no control over. There are agencies that deal with home health issues and I would guess this fits into that category. ",

Truth be told, I can\u2019t say the dorm students smelled any better than the townies, [or faculty, for that matter!!!] but there was one town girl brought to the attention of staff meeting that the coach was told to make her take a shower at school at least once a week after P.E., even though she was from a very fundamentalist family opposed to taking clothes off.
