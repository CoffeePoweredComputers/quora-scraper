            "answer_text": "Here's something really cool about water -  Notice that tiny crack in the middle? That is the only part of light spectrum which water doesn't absorb. Water is strongly absorbing at most of the wavelengths in theelectromagnetic spectrum, but it has a narrow window of transparency which includes the visible spectrum. If you're having trouble imagining all this 'spectrum absorption', hold up your hand like this:  Can you see anything through it? That is because your flesh absorbs all the visible light and doesn't let any light which your eyes can detect, through it. However light of certain wavelengths can pass right through your flesh. X-rays are an example. Take a look at this photo: The X-rays (which are nothing but light) have passed through the flesh. Similarly water only lets a narrow band of light through and absorbs the rest.  What a coincidence, it seems to gives credence to Sam's theory However, water doesn't absorb, in the wavelength range of visible light, because there is no physical mechanism which produces transitions in that region - it is too energetic for the vibrations of the water molecule and below the energies needed to cause electronic transitions. (In short, due to science, water doesn't absorb light in that narrow window.) So I guess this is what must have happened. 1. Sun emits light of all possible wavelength.2. Water has a loophole which lets a small window of spectrum through. Due to science.3. Some organism living under water, might have evolved a rudimentary 'light-spectrum-detector' aka 'eyes'. It would have taken some genetic mutation to make it happen.4. As Sam mentioned, it gave that organism an advantage over other 'blind' organisms, who relied on sound or other less effective mediums.5. That particular genetic trait was the strongest and survived.6. Those organisms went to land and some evolved into humans.7. One of them asked this question. So if water didn't have that loophole (if water wasn't transparent), there wouldn't have been any point in having eyes. We would instead be talking about 'Why is a lion's roar audible?' This reminds me of the 'Why is ice is lighter than water?' question. If it weren't, then all the water bodies would freeze up and there would be no life on planet earth. Edit:To further support the evolution aspect, we humans can see only a small part of all the light. VIBGYOR are the colours which we can observe.That happened because life originated under water and this could be a proof for that. Had life originated under mercury or some other liquid, we would have evolved to 'see' different colours.Those colours would have corresponded with the 'loophole' or 'crack' which mercury or any other liquid has. The colours which they let through.Most importantly, mercury would have looked transparent to us. Some birds like the Eagle and the Owl can see more colours. They have now evolved to see infrared and ultraviolet colours which we cannot see. Interestingly, these animals are some of the most recent in the evolutionary chain. ",
