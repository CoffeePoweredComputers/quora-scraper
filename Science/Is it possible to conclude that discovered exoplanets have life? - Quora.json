            "answer_text": "Based on the limited data we\u2019ve gathered about the many exoplanets and their star systems\u2026no way. At least, there\u2019s no kind of life that we know of that can survive on those worlds.  Space telescopes like the now-offline Kepler and its successor TESS have found hundreds of exoplanets. That\u2019s awesome and fascinating. But these incredible probes are limited in what data they can gather from basically small amounts of light from a distant star as it is sometimes blocked by the exoplanet. Without trying to sound more knowledgeable about it than I am, TESS and Kepler gather data using five methods, as NASA notes them: Wobbles. Exoplanets, especially the large ones, cause stars to orbit off-kilter due to gravity. That wobbling changes the color of light from the star.Shadows. As an exoplanet crosses a star, the telescope can see the shadow of the transiting body, dimming the star\u2019s light a bit.A photo. A few exoplanets can be identified by a photo. Cover up the star and the glare is removed, revealing the planet\u2019s reflected light.Gravity. Light from the star might be bent by a nearby exoplanet.Micro-wobbles. Similar to wobbles that change a star\u2019s color of light, micro-wobbling measures how an exoplanet affects the star\u2019s position relative to other stars.While these methods can help tell us a lot about an exoplanet\u2019s size and distance, and even the planet\u2019s likely composition or habitability (for Earthly life) based on the size and detectable chemicals (spectroscopy), none of these tools can tell us whether life exists on an exoplanet. Keep in mind the scale of this. Exoplanets are trillions of miles/kilometers away. The planet Mars, also being studied, is only a few million miles away. We have several probes on the Martian surface and have yet to detect whether any life had lived or is living there. So you\u2019re asking a lot from a pair of telescopes. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIs it possible to conclude that discovered exoplanets have life?\u201d Using words to talk about science involves definitions of those words. Simply being a planet doesn\u2019t mean that planet contains life. We still don\u2019t know if other planets in our solar system might contain life. However, the discovery that other solar systems do have planets is a strong indication that \u2018somewhere\u2019, we\u2019ll eventually find other Earth-like planets which do have life. The bad part is that, because such planets are countless light-years away, we might never get close enough to those planets to prove it. Without proof, we can\u2019t \u2018conclude\u2019 that discovered exoplanets have life. We can conclude there is an extreme likelihood exoplanets somewhere will have life. However, the mere existence of exoplanets isn\u2019t proof. ",
