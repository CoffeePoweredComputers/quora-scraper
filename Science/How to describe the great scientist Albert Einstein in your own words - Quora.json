            "answer_text": "Dear Pravin, Good question because in recent years I am concerned with the nature of concept of Einstein, called STC - that is Space=Time Continuum. According to Einstein Space and Time form a fabric like structure that is having lenght and breadth. This concept is being debated heavily among physicists and mathematicians - notably Henri Poincare, Philipp Lenard. Though the discussion is going for more than 100 years still it is not clear if it is *real* or *imaginary*? In May 2021, a conf. will be held in Albena, BULGARIA and organizers have called for papers on the nature of STC. I got interested in STC 13 years ago in conf. in Mumbai, India - when I witnessed the failure of a a relativitist - world-wide famous - in convincing a layman in the audience. Since then I am opposing Einstein\u2019s STC and strongly feel that the discovery of Gravitationa Waves by the LIGO teacm (whichhas been rewarded with the NOBEL prize in Physics in 2017) the discovery is on a shaky footing. From these expereiences, gathered over 13 experience I have more respect for Newton than Einstein. Newton is like the great-great-grabnd-father of our family. Every person feels/ uses directly or indirectly his force of gravity every momnent throughout our life. On the other hand, Einstein is a stranger from out side and he says there is no force of gravity - planets orbit around the Sun not because of gravi. force but because of curvature of STC.Actually Space and Time both are non-sensible, Einstein also knows this and till then he is pushing the idea of STC. So I think Einstein\u2019s STC is not only awesome but unbelievable. I have expressed this opinion in a European journal on Space Research - mainly for public - in April 2017. If you mention your email id in your comment on my opinion, I can send you copy of my letter to the editor. Feel free to share my above detailed opinion with any interested person from from SSC level to retired people like me. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you describe the great scientist Albert Einstein in your own words? I think Albert Einstein was a totally awesome dude. He had a wild haircut, he came up with a novel and better description of gravity than the phenomenal Sir Isaac Newton, and there\u2019s a rumor he might have slept with Marilyn Monroe. Speaking of Einstein and Monroe\u2026 Check this out.  Lastly, I am certain that Albert Einstein never tried to trick anyone into doing his homework assignments, never. Cheers. ",
