            "answer_text": "It's quite simple, the Stars haven't gone anywhere, but it's the excess urban lighting that is washing out the stars. Probably 15-20 years ago when you were younger you would have probably muttered at some point of time,  wow look at all those stars. If you live today in a city, you would just not see half of it or know it per se. In astronomy it's called light pollution, the sky is washed out by the lighting instead of seeing thousand of stars and constellation patterns you are reduced to dippers and Orion. There are some general rules of thumb and it comes by observing the colour of the sky during the day: What color is your sky during the day? If it is deep blue, then you should see lots of stars at night even in a large city. If your daytime sky is very light blue though, or worse, pale grey, white, brown, or orange, then you have a problem. City light polution will light up this haze at night and make it impossible to see any stars. Haze isn't due to weather alone, it can come from air polution, pollen, or dust. If these conditions are common or persistent in your area, then seeing stars might take patience. Try a night after a day with an unusually blue sky. Try just after a rain storm has cleaned the air. Try when the wind comes from a different direction, maybe bringing clearer air. Here is a comparison between what we call as a dark sky and light sky:   There are some solutions, you can use a telescope with a large aperture, even that would not help you much, however if you are looking say to observe a meteor shower, I suggest you drive a couple of hours out of the city to observe. International Dark Sky Association: Page on darksky.org runs a save our stars program.  The International Dark-Sky Association for founded in 1988 for the purpose of raising awareness of the growing impact of light pollution. Education is our primary mission and we work to create materials for use by members, educators and the general public to inform communities and elected officials of the negative impact of light pollution and the solutions. We provide these materials at no charge to anyone that joins with us to help raise awareness and bring about change. ",

            "answer_text": "Light pollution ! You\u2019ve probably heard people complaining about air pollution and land fills. But what exactly is light pollution ? With the advance of science and technology, we humans tend to require more and more light, even at night. The light from certain light sources spread out and obscure the sky, making dimmer stars less visible in the haze. You probably live in a city. Common sources of light pollution are street lights and vehicle headlights. Centuries ago, we didn\u2019t have as much light pollution as we have now. That could be the reason why ancient astronomers viewed more stars and categorized them in constellations that we barely recognize now with our naked eyes. So remember to turn off your lights when you don\u2019t really need it and don\u2019t forget to look up at sky and get amazed ! ",
