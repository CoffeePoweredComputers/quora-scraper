            "answer_text": "You dip into the solution a green solutable-brand paper or generic equivalent. The solute clings to the paper and the paper is inserted into a special colorimeter. Readings are taken in triucate and results reported in \u201c\"name of solute\u201d. There is also solvatable paper that works the same way to identify your solvent. Slaps own forehead. Nope, those haventbeen invented yet. I guess we have to write down the solute and solvent in the lab book and then later look up what solid or lesser volume liquid we used as solute. It's impossible to just write down the solvent you use to dissolve said solute, so keep a voice recorder handy so you can remember which solvent you used. Exits stage left weeping for the world, looking a lot like Milo in Bloom County. One girl claps and quickly stops when no one joins. Solutable paper, by the way, can be divided into several sections for multiple solutes, but can never be re-used.and solventable paper can be re-used up to once or three times. Solventable paper is can be in 3 sections for up to a blend of 3 solvents for you. If the colorimeter breaks down, just compare the color to the really big chart they give you with hundreds of thousands of solvents and solutes all identified by a special color like red 99 or red98. The human eye should quickly and easily do this without a colorimeter. I have returned for the update, and this time they clap. I stop weeping as I realize it's pointless. So, just trying badly to be funny, but in seriousness I don't understand the question. The solute is usually the solid or liquid of interest or that will be used as a reactant. The solvent does not usually participate in your subsequent reactions. Does that help? Also, if you had an unknown solution, you could first run a GC-MS to identify and quantify the solvent and possibly the solute if it's a liquid. To identify solid diluted, evaporate the liquid solvent on a watch glass. Dry the remaining solid in an oven at 40\u201360C for an hour and measure it by NMR, FT-IR, melting point, and LC-MS. ",

            "answer_text": "The true answer to this question is to know your substances well, so you can easily identify a solute form a solvent. But I\u2019m assuming you might be asking how can we differentiate a solute from a solvent. A solvent dissolves other substances, while a solute dissolves in other substances. The easiest way to tell occurs when a solid or gas dissolves in another in a liquid. The solid or the gas would be the solute and become the aqueous state, while the liquid is the solvent. If a liquid were to dissolve in another liquid, we would just say that they are miscible; i.e, they are able to mix with each other and do not form separate layers (like oil on water). If we really have to label one as the solvent and one as the solute, the solvent would be the one with the larger quantity. ",
