            "answer_text": "Answers so far have focused on the science of Star Trek, and it is definitely important, but that isn\u2019t why Star Trek wouldn\u2019t exist. Science problems could eventually be overcome or rendered obsolete (why send humans to space instead of autonomous vehicles that report data back?). The problem with Star Trek is ultimately we have no idea on how to create and maintain a post-materialism society. Even Star Trek, in our wildest dreams couldn\u2019t create it. They have unlimited power and can replicate / create anything they want. To be fair replication only came to be in TNG, but even in the original series there is no \u2018need\u2019. The modern Star Trek movies had to jettison many of these Star Trek staples just to make interesting stories. There are all sorts of problems with Star Trek in terms of the \u2018universe\u2019: Who determines who gets to fly around space?What does everyone else not on a spaceship do?Who gets to be farmers? (do you even need farmers? replicate it! at this point we can really fight about if organic is better or not)Who builds the Space Ships?Who gets to program holo-deck programs all day?Who gets to play on holo-decks all day?Star Trek has explored these problems many times over, ultimately creating enough friction to make an episode out of it. But if everyone could do what they wanted, and had everything they need, how to \u2018science\u2019 through space would be the least of most people\u2019s desires. We can barely get people to go to work now doing jobs they don\u2019t really want to do for money so they can survive. If that requirement was gone do you really think someone, anyone would still do all the jobs no one wants to do? Maybe a few people, but not enough to hold up human progress. Humanity at large would stall. Forget if the science of Star Trek is possible or not, no one would bother figuring it out. Everyone would eat, sleep, and play on the holo-deck all day. This might be a bit pessimistic view of Humanity, and hey, maybe Aliens showing up and \u2018uplifting\u2019 us into a whole new community would change enough minds to inspire us to finally turn off the TV and go to work but I doubt it. On the other hand, maybe after a generation or two everyone will be bored of traveling the world and sitting on beaches, playing video games, and watching TV all day that we decide to go travel space and finally figure it out.

            "answer_text": "Unlikely. Just a little thought renders the question of debateable sincerity. While many things in Star Trek will be possible and a few have already happened, there are some that are just so unlikely or impossible that the answer to the original post has to be no. Warp Drive. \u201cFolding space\u201d? Uh huh. I\u2019m not sure that real world engineering (in any realistically foreseeable future) would support what Warp Cores are purported to be able to facilitate. Not forgetting all that relativity business. Better luck using Space Magic, errr, I meant Star Wars hyperdrive.Beaming. Teleporting? Oh come on. So in no particular order\u2026Cloning abuse.Hardware or a \u2018beaming station\u2019 is only needed at one end.Data. No, not the character, data. In order to accurately reproduce a sentient lifeform you\u2019d need to be be able to record, store and transmit the precise state of more than 7 x 10 to the 27 (*thumps editor limitation*) particles. Thinking about it, a lot, more. What does one mean by \u201cstate\u201d? This would include octillions (or more) of data entries for each particle. And each entry isn\u2019t a few bits. What is the particle? What is it\u2019s charge? Mass? Energy level? Motion? Direction? Velocity? It is difficult to understand how much data that is. Or to put it mildly\u2026. Basically, the bandwidth requirements of \u201cbeaming\u201d would be prohibitive. And if you could reliably transmat people across large distances (and with relay stations very large distances) you\u2019d put all but long-haul starship manufacturers out of business. The unions would hate that. ",
