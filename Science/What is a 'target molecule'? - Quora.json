            "answer_text": "That depends on what you\u2019re doing. If you\u2019re a systhesis chemist, then the target is the molecule you are trying to create and you\u2019re trying to use different reactions to get to your target. If you\u2019re doing Mass spec then the molecules are being targeted by the ionization source. If you\u2019re doing biochemistry (developing drug therapies , for example) then certain molecules in the cell identify the cell as bad (sick or cancerous) and companies try to create drugs that react preferentially with that molecule and by association, with that cell. That molecule is the \u2018target\u2019 molecule. It\u2019s the target the drug uses to know which cells to react with. ",

            "answer_text": "The target molecule is the molecule under investigation. For example in this case, it would mean the molecule you are looking for to help you make a diagnosis. The reporter molecules would bind to the the target molecules (if present) and would help you detect its presence. It's like fishing for the target molecule where the reporter is like the bait and the target molecule is like fish. ",
