            "answer_text": "Yes, you\u2019d have to make your journey somewhere between the Arctic and Antarctic circles, or else you lose the Sun due to seasons rather than nightfall! So I suspect the optimal flight plan would be to fly just below (say) the Arctic Circle. This is 9,900 miles long whereas the equator is 24,000 miles long, so a speed of 412 mph would keep the Sun above the horizon at all times. And 412 mph would make it easier to refuel in the air. I doubt that it could be contemplated at 1,000 mph! ",

            "answer_text": "Seems rather simple. All you have to do is move at the same speed that the Earth is rotating. Note, this is easier done near the poles than it is at the equator. For a plane traveling along the equator perpetually they would have to be going about 1000 mph. ",
