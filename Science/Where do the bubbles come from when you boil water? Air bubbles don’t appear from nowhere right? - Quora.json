            "answer_text": "First, there is almost universal confusion as to exactly what the expression \u201cboiling water\u201d actually entails\u2026and air is not involved in boiling, except to a very minor extent in its very early stages. The bubbles are 99% steam, tending to 100% after about a minute. What \u201cboiling\u201d is NOT is a homogeneous physical state for which all the water molecules in the pot are exactly at the same temperature. Most are at a temperature less than the normal boiling point of water (sides and top surface) while the layer at the bottom, can be ((must be) ABOVE the normal boiling point of water, for the boiling process to ensue. Boiling is a process, not a state of matter. The entirety of the pot of water is NOT uniformly heated to 100 C, at which point it \u201cexplodes\u201d into a state of active boiling. Steady boiling always involves nucleation sites. Most cookware has plenty of these, which consists of small micro-cracks or crevasses on the bottom of the pot. A problem arises in the laboratory where the glassware used for boiling (mainly organic) is or may be very smooth. In this case, porous \u201cboiling chips\u201d are used to smooth out the boiling process, that otherwise might occur explosively from the superheated liquid at some temperature above the \u201cexpected\u201d boiling point. So, following the process as we boil water in a pot heated from a flame below, as the bottom layer approaches boiling, tiny bubbles attached to nucleation sites are observed on the bottom. If there is dissolved air or any other gases, this could actually occur even before the temperature reaches exactly 100 C. Soon, under continued heating, the temperature in the bottom few millimeters of the pot will exceed 100 C and many more nucleation sites will be observed. They are held tight initially by surface tension forces. A bubble attached to the bottom \u201cgrows\u201d when there is superheated liquid all around it. The deeper the superheated liquid layer, the faster and larger the bubble can grow. Eventually, a situation is reached when the buoyancy forces of the growing bubble, exceed the surface tension forces, and the bubble detached and rises through the liquid above. Initially, it actually shrinks in size as it rises, since its surrounded by sub-cooled liquid. However, as more and more bubbles grow and become detached from the bottom, the \u201cmixing effect\u201d increases causing all portions of the pot, except the sides to approach 100 C. As heating proceed from thttom, more and more nucleation sites become active. Unless the flame wraps around the side of the pot, the boiling will be observed to occur mosty from a central location. I hope the above adds some clarity with respect to your understanding as to what boiling is, and how it oc i ",

            "answer_text": "The other (so far) 2 answers are correct, but omit a fact that may confuse the person who asked the question. Water vapour - water in gaseous form - is completely transparent. When you boil water in a kettle, or in a saucepan, the white stuff which comes out and is usually called steam isn\u2019t water in gaseous form. When the water vapour gas hits the cool air in the room, it condenses back into lots of tiny droplets of water. Its the same stuff as fog or clouds are made of, and isn\u2019t water vapour.  You can see this in this image. There isn\u2019t any white \u201csteam\u201d right at the spout, because its still water vapour at that point. After it has traveled an inch or so from the spout it has cooled enough for the water to condense back into a cloud of very small water droplets. Which hopefully explains why the bubbles in boiling water are transparent, and don\u2019t look like the steam we are used to seeing and think of (incorrectly) as water vapour. ",
