            "answer_text": "The ouroboros cycle is a collection of 4 SCP-001 proposals that together form a sort of cycle. Written by djkaktus, it tells of the foundations greatest weapon and it\u2019s eventual downfall at the hands of the chaos insurgency. If you have no read it you should do so, it can describe the entire SCP universe to you very easily.  But if you don\u2019t want to take the time to read it I guess I can explain further. But you really should read it. Here goes. The first one we hear about in the oro cycle is the children, they are a group of children (duh) that possess the ability to reduce anything to nothingness by just having the user picture that object in their mind. When it is first revealed to the administrator (at the time Fredrick Williams) it was to be fired by O5\u20131 at the hideout of a GOI that consisted of reality warpers call the \u201cKingdom of Abbadon\u201d. Instead of the kingdom\u2019s hideout with a flash of light the administrator had been reduced to nothing by O5\u20131 the next part is hazy but it shows that O5\u20131 and a handful of other people left to form the chaos insurgency. I am only going to say the first part because you need to read it if you want to become \u201cSCP big brain\u201d. ",

At the risk of maledicta, the old word, \u201cReshith\u201d (the begining) or more favorably in the original Bible, having a B for the first letter, BEreshith, can conjure up the beginning from the end. Hmmm, Other terminology archetype, prima orda, principalita, and so on provide the same idea that everything from nothing is an endless loop no matter how everything gets deleted. It is like a propensity, like a pregnant explosion. Thus, you have nothing/everything is an Ouroboros cycle. It just might come out a little different way each time. ",
