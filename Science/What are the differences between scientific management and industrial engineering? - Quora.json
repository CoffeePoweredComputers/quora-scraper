            "answer_text": "The introduction to the wiki on scientific management answered it fairly well: Scientific management is a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflows. Its main objective is improving economic efficiency, especially labor productivity. It was one of the earliest attempts to apply science to the engineering of processes and to management. Although scientific management as a distinct theory or school of thought was obsolete by the 1930s, most of its themes are still important parts of industrial engineering and management today. These include: analysis; synthesis; logic; rationality; empiricism; work ethic;efficiency and elimination of waste;standardization of best practices;the transformation of craft production into mass production;knowledge transfer between workers and from workers into tools, processes, and documentation.Industrial engineering also grew to absorb the quality control side that developed later, from men like Deming and Juran. Lean Manufacturing grew from the \u201cefficiency\u201d side, it seeks to reduce waste by eliminating non-value added activities, to reduce WIP (which can cause all sorts of issues), and even declutter the workspace (5S)Six-Sigma seeks to improve quality by reducing variation. It is a logical extension of SPC, which itself dates back before WW2.Systems engineering is considered part of Industrial engineering, as shown by the first google result that came up: Industrial and Systems Engineering - Georgia Tech College of Engineering So, the direct answer to the question is modern industrial engineering evolved from scientific management. The differences are simply the natural consequence of over a century of progress in that field. ",
