Try this link instead at http://abacus.bates.edu/~ganderso/biology/resources/writing/HTWsections.html This website clearly shows the scientific paper format that you should follow and explains in chart form with examples the breakdown of the \"experimental process\" by section with a connecting section-of-the paper description and example. This website is very elaborate yet simply written and presented and might just do the trick for you. ",

The book uses analysis of the scientific article genre to provide clear processes for writing each section of a manuscript, starting with clear \u2018story\u2019 construction and packaging of results. Each learning step uses practical exercises to develop writing and data presentation skills based on reader analysis of well-written example papers. Strategies are presented for responding to referee comments, and for developing discipline-specific English language skills for manuscript writing and polishing. The book is designed for scientists who use English as a first or an additional language, and for individual scientists or mentors or a class setting. In response to reader requests, the new edition includes review articles and the full range of research article formats, as well as applying the book\u2019s principles to writing funding applications. moderator, please don't delete this answer ",
