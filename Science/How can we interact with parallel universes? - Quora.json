            "answer_text": "We can\u2019t interact with parallel universes. The idea behind parallel universes comes from two directions. One is the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics which holds that every time a quantum choice is made, such as an electron choosing to have spin up or spin down, the universe splits and in one universe the electron is spin up and in the other it is spin down. There would be two you\u2019s then and two me\u2019s, one in each universe. Actually, because there are 10^80 particles in the universe and a substantial fraction of them will be making quantum choices at any instant in time, there would be trillions and trillions of new you\u2019s and new me\u2019s forming every second. And then in the next second each one of those trillions and trillions of new you\u2019s and new me\u2019s will each split into trillions and trillions of new universes, and then in the next second\u2026 well you get the picture. While there are an uncountable number of you\u2019s and me\u2019s out there, one key tenant of the Many Worlds Interpretation is that the split is total, eternal, and irreversible. Contact between the various universes is prohibited by the math (the set of all possible universes is a \u201cHilbert Space\u201d) that predicts and permits them. The other direction parallel universes come into play is from the inflationary multiverse theory. This theory holds that after the random fluctuation in the cosmic vacuum energy that created a big bang and got it all going the universe expanded at faster than the speed of light for a time period before local pocket or bubble universes condensed out of the expanding totality. (We live in one of the bubbles.) The models developed to support this theory (and there are over 190 inflation models put forth so far) all share the characteristic that once inflation starts, you can\u2019t stop it. It goes on forever. And bubble universes form forever, one after another. This means that there are an infinite number of bubble universes out there. Any time you have an infinite number of anythings, anything that can happen will happen and will happen an infinite number of times. So in the inflationary multiverse there are an infinite number of you\u2019s and an infinite number of me\u2019s. An infinitely numerous subset of these are just like you and me are in this bubble universe and are reading Quora right now. One might argue that these are not \u201cparallel\u201d universes but are \u201cduplicate\u201d universes. They would have/will have evolved with the same exact pattern of particle interactions throughout their history as our universe has experienced. But due to random changes in some of the particle interactions in some of the bubble universes there will be an infinitely numerous subset of bubble universes in which you are President of the United States and I am a clown performing at a children\u2019s birthday party. In another infinitely numerous subset of these infinite bubble universes, Adolph Hitler was a stand-up comedian that fought for Jewish rights, and in another infinitely numerous subset of universes Mother Teresa was a serial killer. And as with the Many Worlds Interpretation, the very physics that predicts the multiverse also prohibits us from ever communicating with other bubbles. We don\u2019t share time or space with any of them and can\u2019t ever. Both of these theories depend on infinity as a real physical phenomenon. Before the last quarter of the 20th Century, infinity in a physics theory meant some core idea had been missed, or the math was incorrect, or that nature would prohibit an outcome (such as an object with mass traveling at the speed of light). That changed with the Many Worlds Interpretation and the inflationary multiverse and infinity as a cornerstone of a world view became okay. Legendary physicist Bernard Carr has dismissed the inflationary multiverse as viable because it depends on infinity, as have many other leading physicists. (I don\u2019t know his position on the Many Worlds Interpretation, but I suspect he would not be happy with it.) Unfortunately, one of the implications of these theories, now popular in some academic circles and in the popular press, is that they render human life random and meaningless. To me, both of these parallel universe theories produce such weird outcomes that they stretch credulity. MIT physicist Max Tegmark has said we should believe anything consistent with the mathematical theories that predict them and not reject any idea because it is just so weird. I am not sure he is right. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no known or theoretical way. And we don\u2019t even know if they exist. There are several definitions of \u2018parallel universes\u2019, the two main ones are: The \u2018Many-Worlds\u2019 theory that says that every second there are 10^200 \u2018decisions\u2019 in the universe, and each \u2018decision\u2019 creates its own universe/world/world-line, and we can BY DEFINITION not cross over from one to another. Eternal Inflation - this is where infinite \u2018bubble universes\u2019 like ours, form at a rate of 10^10^36 (a one with a trillion trillion trillion zeros) per second, and have done so forever, and will continue forever.
