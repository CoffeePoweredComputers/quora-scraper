            "answer_text": "This will be a short answer but it is something I noticed about my answers and wonder if this is true for anyone else. My answers are by revelation or inspiration. At the time I decide to answer a question I know what I want to say. I have an analytical mind. Made my living that way. But when looking back through my answers I find if I had to answer those questions again I really doubt I could come up with a similar answer. By saying my answers are by revelation don't mean to sound spooky. Most of my answers bomb. I'm a bottom dweller. So revelation is a bad choice of words but at the time not counting the answers I researched, what I wrote originally and then looking back I develop writer's block. Just wondering if anyone else notices this about their writing. ",

All you have to do is just express yourself. Simple !! Whenever you write something, make sure it is the best among the thread ! *at least you should feel that after reading your own answer*  If I feel my words would add value to the question/quora, I just answer it ! A bit of research ! A pinch of creativity ! A touch of humor ! A collage of thoughts ! Handful of time ! & Spine full of patience !! (*_*) *ufff* :P is all you need for a perfect answer ! :)  Thanks for your time :) Image Source : Google P.S : Thanks for the A2A User-12701371950577750298 ",
