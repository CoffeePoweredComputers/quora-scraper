            "answer_text": "What would convince you that the Bible is God\u2019s word? How about statistically rigorously tested and peer-reviewed evidence that the Bible prophesies events thousands of years in the future? In 1997, The Bible Code, a bestselling book by Michael Drosnin, an American journalist, made exactly that claim. Its cover features a Torah scroll with circled sequences of letters spelling out the Hebrew words for \u201cYitzhak Rabin\u201d (Israeli prime minister assassinated in 1995 after signing the Oslo Accords) and \u201cassassin who will assassinate\u201d. The author claimed to have warned Rabin of his 1995 assassination, the Gulf War, and the 1994 collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter. Drosnin even appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show, CNN, Time magazine[1] and the NYT[2]. Millions of people saw it as the mathematical proof that the Bible was the word of God.  The book was inspired by a curious paper published three years before in the prestigious journal Statistical Science. A group of researchers at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem conducted a computer experiment called the \"Great rabbis experiment\" to test the existence of \u201cTorah codes\u201d \u2013 sequences in the Bible with hidden messages about future events. The three researchers came from different fields: Eliyahu Rips was a well-respected mathematician, Yoav Rosenberg a graduate student in computer science and Doron Witztum held a master\u2019s degree in physics. They were looking at \u201cequidistant letter sequences\u201d (ELS), or string of text obtained by plucking characters from the Torah at regular intervals (say every 50 or 100 characters).  Image: various words relating to the assassination of Martin Luther King written as ELSs (e.g., MLKING, TENN, GUN) in Moby Dick. [3] They chose thirty-two notable rabbis from modern Jewish history and their birth and death dates. They searched the book of Genesis for ELSs spelling out rabbis names and dates and computed how close the rabbis appeared to their own dates compared to the others\u2019. They found something astonishing: the correct association had a very high score compared to a million other random combinations! The possibility that such a coding scheme could have occurred by chance (p-value) was 1 in 50,000![4] As a control, they tried the same procedure on War and Peace, the book of Isaiah and a scrambled version of Genesis and didn\u2019t find the same result. The association had no better score than random. Something was special about the Book of Genesis: \u201cWe conclude that the proximity of ELSs with related meanings in the Book of Genesis is not due to chance\u201d.[5] The findings implied that the Torah can somehow predict the future, a hint that God exists. The editor and reviewers at the journal Statistical Science were naturally baffled. The authors tried to replicate the paper on another list of rabbis and repeated the same experiment on another text. Yet, the second list of rabbis still worked and another text didn\u2019t. The reviewers just couldn\u2019t find any flaws. How eerie! The publication of the paper didn\u2019t mean that the reviewers and editor endorsed the results but they wanted it to go public and be challenged by other statisticians. Despite its strange results, the paper didn\u2019t draw a lot of public attention until The Bible Code was published. The publication of the book finally drew the attention of the mathematical world. The Jewish community were divided over how to respond to it. Some thought the promotion of the codes made Orthodox Judaism a joke, surely God wouldn\u2019t play such childish code word games. Other embraced the codes as a means of drawing unobservant Jews back into the faith. Many were skeptical of the findings. The three authors denied the conclusion of the book that the Torah can be used to predict future events. But the challenge remained: how to debunk the paper? It took five years of testing for statisticians to finally detect the flaws in the original paper. Brendan McKay, an Australian computer scientist, Dror Bar-Natan and Gil Kalai, two Israeli mathematicians then at Hebrew University and Israeli psychologist Maya Bar-Hillel, made a critical observation that medieval rabbis did not have only one official name.[6] If George W. Bush was a rabbi, he might appear as GW, GWB, Bush II, Bush-43, Dubya or Bush Jr. Similarly, a date can be September 8, 2019 or 8th of September 2019 or 09/08/2019 or 8 Sept 2019 etc. This ambiguity creates wiggle room for the code hunters. With a different choice about the names of the rabbis, date formats and a different choice of rabbis, the Torah no longer seemed to detect the birth and death dates of the rabbis as well as War and Peace! Then, McKay and co. sought to produce the most accurate list of rabbis\u2019 names they could, using their own consultant. With this list, they found no statistical evidence of codes in any text.[7] Similarly, other versions of the Torah also have no effects. In response to Drosnin\u2019s challenge to find the assassination of a prime minister encrypted in Moby Dick, McKay quickly found ELSs in Moby Dick referring to the assassination of JFK, Indira Gandhi, Leon Trotsky and Drosnin himself![8][9] While McKay et. al. did not accuse the original authors of fraud, they speculated on how the data-tuning took place and concluded that the wiggle room was enough to permit the authors to corrupt the results. Rips, one of the original authors, was so enraged by the rebuttal that he hired a lawyer and threatened to sue the journal for libel and demanded a chance to respond to the critique in the same issue. However, no publication in a peer reviewed scientific journal has appeared refuting McKay\u2019s paper. Bar-Hillel and Margali were much less charitable than the diplomatic McKay. In a typically candid Israeli fashion, they concluded: \u201cFar from being the discovery of the millenium, however, the codes may well be the folly, if not the hoax, of the decade.\u201d[10] Footnotes[1] DECIPHERING GOD'S PLAN[2] Book on a Bible Code Tempts Hollywood but Not Academics[3] http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/Maya.html[4] Cracking God's Code[5] Bible code - Wikipedia[6] Solving the Bible Code Puzzle[7] The Torah Codes, Cracked[8] The Bible Code: Enigmas for Dummies[9] The Demise of Drosnin[10] http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/Maya.html",

            "answer_text": "Meet the Bogdanoff brothers, fraternal twins raised in France.  Those two \u2026 aliens used to host French scientific popularization shows in the \u201970s.  One of their shows, Temps X, is almost legendary. They became TV stars quickly. Their mysterious demeanor was part of their success; we can still see them on various occasions on TV, advertising the books they published. Those books are about science, of course. But what is the value of those books? Well, let\u2019s go return to the past for a moment\u2026 Back in the \u201990s they pretty much disappeared for ten years to prepare PhDs on mathematics and theoretical physics. They did not have any known previous training in those fields and even so ten years was easily longer than the standard duration for a science PhD. But they got it, they became doctors in science and this had to mean their work was serious, wasn\u2019t it? Well \u2026 NO. Igor failed the first time and both got the lowest merit for their theses, a sign they were considered mediocre. But where the scandal begins is that they used their PhDs to push their far-fetched speculations on science and started suing scientists who denounced them. Investigations were made and they revealed that their mentoring during the preparation of their thesis was doubtful and that their admission was fraudulent. The CNRS stated that their work had no scientific value at all and that they lacked even basic knowledge of mathematics and physics, according to the examiner\u2019s report. However their PhDs weren\u2019t cancelled, so they are still doctors. But they are definitely not scientists in a proper way. They published nothing and never got research posts. Well, in fact they were published in Annals of Physics and Classical and Quantum Gravity, which are pretty respected scientific journals, but their work has since been withdrawn by the publishers, who even apologized for having let such worthless articles be published. Unsurprisingly their mainstream books are scientifically mediocre as well, with a lot of inaccurate statements. However, they are quite successful because of their sensational narrative and semblance of scientific accuracy. For the same reasons they have maintained a good public image in the mainstream media despite having no scientific legitimacy and having proved to be toxic and vicious persons in the different affairs they were involved in for twenty years. Bogdanov affair - Wikipedia The Bogdanoff Affair So if you ever see two strange guys telling you some bullshit on Einstein\u2019s life and preaching that the big bang is pure information and the proof of the existence of the divine by quantic magic, you know who you are facing.
