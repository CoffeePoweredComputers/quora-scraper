            "answer_text": "Over the years I have experienced that when you drink cold water you end up more thirsty then when you drink hot or normal temperature water. I thought this was happening just with me. So, inorder to confirm that I was simply thirsty and it's not the cold water I started observing people around me. One such time on numerous occasions I saw my father giving me the same results as I had with the cold water. So, coming to your questions in my opinion no the ice will end up leaving you more thirsty then you already were than water. ",
