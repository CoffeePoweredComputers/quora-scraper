            "answer_text": "So, you know the freezing point of water? How water is supposed to freeze at 0 degrees C? Right, So, that holds true when water is at sea level Below sea level (near the dead sea) water will freeze at a higher temperature By the same token, freezing water at higher altitudes will be more difficult because water needs to be chilled past 0 degrees C From this, it is easier to understand that a freezing point is a function of pressure T=f(p) where at any given pressure, a different freezing point as a temperature will be given At higher p, there will be a higher temperature Are you with me thus far? So, if water is compressed, it is literally getting pressure added. With more pressure, what would happen to that freezing point? The freezing point (as pressure increases) would get higher and higher , so that it would be higher than room temperature. Potentially, the freezing point could get to 40 degrees Celsius, in a room that is 30 degrees Celsius. As such, the water would freeze; the water would move to a solid state. As liquid water is compressed, it will turn into a solid. ",

            "answer_text": "If water is compressed some very strange stuff happens. Suffice it to say, it doesn't stay water after a certain point. The intense temperatures created by the compression will cause the water to break apart, eventually no longer even having oxygen atoms due to nuclear reactions. Because we're talking about an externally applied pressure, the Chandrasekhar limit doesn't apply, so there is a point at which electrons and protons combine (when the electron degeneracy pressure is overcome) and a mass of neutrons remains. Neutrons themselves also have a degeneracy pressure (though we don't have good models to predict the exact pressure that has to be overcome). From here, we don't know what happens with as much certainty, but the formation of quark matter has been predicted. Eventually, we reach a singularity. We can think of this as all the matter we had before being compressed into an infinitesimal volume with infinite density and our applied pressure ceases to mean anything. If we started with enough water, this would behave much like any other black hole, though micro black holes are hypothesized to have some special properties. Thanks for asking tanmay ",
