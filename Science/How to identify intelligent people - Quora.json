            "answer_text": "A \u201cgenius\u201d is the person who keeps quiet and is only vocal at the moments it means most. They give succinct statements that hit every key note of that particular topic. They have good vernacular (vocab) and use every context clue to come to a precise conclusion. Most genius\u2019 don\u2019t care what other people think because they know that they are their own worst enemy. Genius\u2019 often stay in their heads and debate about various topics. That one kid who was always bullied and overlooked back in high school is probably a genius. And the smarter you are the less connected or concerned you are about \u201ccliches\u201d or the latest \u201cfashion trend\u201d. Not all but a lot of them don\u2019t have a high EQ (emotional intelligence) so they don\u2019t have the best conversational skills until they get comfortable with you. Higher intellectuals see patterns in society and how things work. This gives them an advantage because they can predict and understand human behavior. They are highly unorganized and yet still know where everything is. Case in point their memory is keen and they forget about little and discard what\u2019s not worth noting. Addictive personality disorder is common with people of high intelligence because they are in need of a constant reward. Their brain is running at a higher speed so they need more to keep their apparatus in check. A genius might not come off a genius at all because they know that they obtain higher intelligence but are not worried about bragging about it for personal gain. Their senses are always on point and you will most likely never catch them off guard. They are fully aware of everyone and everything around them at all times. You will see them look at every face in a room in a matter of seconds to identify threats or just the get a feeling of the vibe. Intelligence comes at a price, it can lead to depression and anxiety because you realize the magnitude of what is going on and just how much you can\u2019t really affect it in an adverse way. They are often suicidal although they will not admit it, it often comes into their head because of hopelessness and loneliness. Intelligence can be the biggest gift yet the biggest downfall at the same time. Ying and yang are constantly at work and they realize this with every passing moment. They try to neutralize the effect before the cause or expecting the consequences before the mistake. And this can either bite them in the ass or help them out. This causes anxiety and they often worry about the things they have least control over and are the least possible outcomes. They often wear nice attire which is ironic because even though they don\u2019t care about their appearance they still care about how they present themselves to new people who may be important. They also have a gift of putting themselves in others shoes which makes them more humble and aware of others situations. They are often unusually calm people and are very generous. Being a night owl is also common with people of higher intelligence because their brains stimulus. They see the world in a different light and often think about the cosmos and wonder about the mysterious \u201cunknown\u201d. A genius understands that the amount of information they know, is just as important as the amount they don\u2019t know. I hope this helps with your question and lmk if anything else comes into mind!

            "answer_text": "They listen and observe a lot more than they speak and act. A lot of their energy is used up thinking and so they often do not have enough to spare for continuous work. And so, they often sit passively and quietly until they feel that action is necessary.They have a passive and somewhat effortless authority about them. They will not give orders or be rude, nor offensive to establish dominance within a social group. But when you speak to someone who is intelligent, you will have no choice but to tailor your conversations and behaviours around them, otherwise you will feel very out of your element.They work efficiently and not endlessly. Intelligent people are more able to construct workable systems and routines that efficiently and innovatively give them the same results as someone whom would be working all day and every day.The constant need for intellectual stimulation means that most of their hobbies will either be creative, or things that allow to continuously learn new skills. Reading is a clear indicator.They are extremely patient. Their intelligence allows them to not fall under pressure as easily, withstand long periods of low activity, and can last longer in otherwise very mentally exhausting situations than someone whom is perhaps not as intelligent.Very resourceful. They are able to produce shockingly adequate results with less time, money, and overall energy exertion. A lot of intelligent people actually become lazy for this reason.Can pick up talents very easily. Their ability to observe, analyse, break down into steps, and apply means that they can learn very quickly any skill required. Intelligent people can ironically feel impatient in this regard. For if they cannot learn a skill straight away, they often fear that they will not know how to deal with the environment adequately and so will not go there.Extremely socially influential. In groups, the intelligent person is usually the very quiet one whom seldom gives their own opinion, or contributes to conversations. However, when asked for input, they usually say something that cuts to the heart of the matter and changes everyone's perspective.Very morally disciplined people. I say perhaps stubborn. But intelligent need a moralistic and philosophical structure to which to function in. Intelligent people do not see the world in terms of what work there is to do or what money there is to be made, because the intelligent person often fears that he will crack under the pressure of his own conscious activity. To compensate, you will find intelligent people always contemplating new philosophical or abstract moral concepts to build and live by. They live inside their heads and so I guess they need their interior structure up to scratch.Intelligent people are often mistaken for being insane and mentally challenged. Some even go as far as to use high intelligence as a diagnostic symptom of a personality disorders or learning disability.Often tired all of the time despite doing what looks like no work.Their work ethic is different. Intelligent people work less, they don't have the energy otherwise. So they are often quite good delegators, with efficient planning skills.Very calm in crisis.Skilled debators. The secret to intelligent debating is being able to articulate your own perspective accurately rather than to argue aggressively.Able to talk themselves in and out of any situation.Are not threatened by social groups. Their skill in conversation and analysing social environments means they are able to talk to many different kinds of people and gain their respect.",
