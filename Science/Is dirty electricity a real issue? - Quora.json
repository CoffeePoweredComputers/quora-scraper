            "answer_text": "I hate that term. Electricity is electricity. \u201cDirty electricity\u201d is a reference to how the electricity was generated. Was it generated using a \u201cclean process,\u201d or a \u201cdirty process.\u201d It\u2019s a valid point - you can\u2019t pat yourself on the back for using electricity if all of your electricity comes from dirty sources. Those sources might be dirtier than the gasoline engine you\u2019re trying to avoid using. But that phrase makes it sound like the electricity is to blame, and that\u2019s bogus. To parse these things mentally, work your way up the chain. You\u2019re using electricity, but where that that come from? It didn\u2019t just magically appear on the wire. It might have been solar, or wind, or nuclear, or coal, or hydro. No telling. But that is where your answer lies, and then you can talk about the evils of coal instead of the evils of (dirty) electricity. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "There are multiple way of answering this; the term is too amorphous so I will take the first two to come to mind. Some eco-minded people want to know the \u201chistory\u201d of the power and undoubtedly will follow this back to what serves their own agenda. For example, electric-powered cars sound like we are \u201csaving the planet\u201d but in fact, every time you convert energy to another form, you are WASTING some aspect of it because the conversion goes into some form you do not want, and there is a cost for that. Unless we have a \u201cMr Fusion\u201d mini-thermonuclear reactor behind every \u201cbattery filling station\u201d the dirty not so secret information is that all that is happening is we are moving energy around, and in the process creating waste heat making the cost of that energy even higher. Electric cars are not \u201crenewable energy\u201d devices at all. Ignore self-serving politicians and ask an engineer\u2026 The other interpretation is that electricity wants to be \u201cclean\u201d and \u201csmooth\u201d but often has \u201cnoise\u201d in it. This can be overcome with surge-suppressors and UPS units to ensure you don\u2019t disrupt or even damage sensitive electronics we have pervasively in our lives. Fortunately, this is an inherently efficient process. No one is worrying about surge suppressor strips overheating. ",

            "answer_text": "The easiest way to answer this is to analyze the whole system. Electricity is actually a way to transport and use energy. All forms of electrical generation are much less \u2018dirty\u2019 than if the energy was produced \u2018on the spot\u2019. A portable generator is much more \u2018dirty\u2019 per unit of energy produced than any coal plant. Similarly, cars are \u2018cleaner\u2019 than say push lawn mowers-simply because the larger units likely have some form of pollution control. Back in the 1970s and 80s there was a movement to go \u2018green\u2019 by using wood burning stoves. The resulting smog in large cities actually caused bans on wood burning is some cases. Similar reasoning can be followed for nearly any form of energy (yes even solar and wind-just try to make a solar cell at home). As the amount of energy available for useful work by each person is almost a measure of technology advancement, I would argue that central generation is the only way today\u2019s cities could exist. Just consider the problems created by short outages and you are likely to agree. ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of good answers below. I will add, that harmonic distortion and noise is such an issue there are companies out there making devices to clean up the power. The issue is twofold, if you loads cause the noise then you are not getting all the power you could be getting if you are limited by power company infrastructure. And you might be getting surcharges from the power company as well. In some cases the cleaning up equipment pays for itself in a year or two. This is generally not the fault of the power company. It is dirty loads such as variable frequency drives and other newer devices that chop up and re-constitute the energy. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course when the energy we use for power comes from dirty (i.e. polluting) sources that is an issue. When you say electricity that is broad enough to encompass a large portion of our activities. The temptation to get really specific and shave every last bit off home use is OK, but lower priority. An all of the above strategy is necessary to combat climate change, but the source of our problems (and a portion of our energy) is fossil fuels. Air pollution is a big killer besides (nearly 80,000 in the U.S. each year). ",

            "answer_text": "Correct me if I am wrong, but I think dirty in electricity is more to do with the quality of the electricity than to do with how it is generated, If the electric supply is properly stabilized and with a pf of close to unity we call it clean electricity, similarly we use the term clean earth which is used in data centers for grounding. And we also have dirty earth where all the rest of the less sensitive appliances and electrical fixtures are grounded. ",
