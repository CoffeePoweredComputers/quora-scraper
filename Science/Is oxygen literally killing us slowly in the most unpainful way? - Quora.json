            "answer_text": "Well, technically, YES. Oxygen, as you know, causes the oxidation of substances. So, when we breathe in Oxygen, the Oxidation takes place in the atoms of our cells. Also, when we breathe in Oxygen, the Oxygen incompletely reacts with Hydrogen to form the extremely reactive hydroxide ions. This is the reason why we have antioxidants. Antioxidants prevent the oxidation of body cells by reacting with the Hydroxide ion before it reacts with the body cells. But the production of such antioxidants does not always meet the requirements, and this is when the Hydroxide ions, which are left out, start reacting with the body cells. This reduces the life span of humans. Then, you may wonder \u201cWhy we need oxygen in the first place?\u201d . The answer is that we need energy. We eat food to get energy. But food doesn\u2019t get converted into energy on its own. The Oxygen atoms help breakdown food to release energy. Also, Respiration is defined as the breakdown of food (glucose) into energy in the presence of Oxygen. C6H12O6 + 6O2 \u2192 6CO2 + 6H2O + 38ATP It must be kept in mind that this reaction does not occur in a single step, but by a series of steps. The ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is the energy. Notice that there is \u201ctriphosphate\u201d which means that a phosphate group was added. This shows us that the above chemical reaction does not occur in a single step. Thank you for reading.

            "answer_text": "Yes. And No. according to evolution theory and what we have learned about the life forms we call extremophiles, oxygen is toxic to life very quickly. These beings ( fossilized remains in some cases, directly observed in other) use other chemicals to transfer ans obtain energy. They live,or are presumed to have lived under conditions of what we today consider extreme circumstances. Many science fiction books have been written from this viewpoint,that an oxygen atmosphere must necessarily be toxic to all inhabitant. We used to believe that the presence of oxygen was the only way to define life - that the definition of life must include the use of oxygen in some way. The discovery of Extremphiles opened up some possibilities we had not thought of before. Now we know that creatures larger and more complex than archaea ( a kind of single celled critter) are possible, So we have to re-think the whole idea of where life is possible. As for us, the oxygen breathers, it has been a two-edged sword. Without oxygen, we wouldn't survive longer than a few minutes, but it is gradually causing the chemicals in our own bodies to turn against us, and not painlessly, eithrt. Most of the \u201cdiseases of old age\u201d , caused ny oxygen attacking tissues, have some amount of pain inbvolved with them, ",
