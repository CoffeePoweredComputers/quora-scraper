            "answer_text": "This answer is at odds with both Jay Wacker's answer and that of Joshua Engel because the answer is based on the new physics of the Gestalt Aether Theory. Firstly Gestalt Aether Theory differs from traditional quantum mechanics and from Standard Theory in that it gives a definite rationale for both the structure of the photon and the underlying reason for that particular photon structure. The Gestalt Aether Theory model of the photon is as follows: Since the electron is a unit of electrical energy, what could be more probable than that it regulates its energy by emitting or absorbing pulses of electrical energy? These pulses of energy might take the form of bands of energy that become electrically polarised. This model of the photon has to be considered very, very carefully. Not only is the fact that the tiny electron with a classical radius of [math]10^{-13}[/math] cm has to produce an incredible range of photons, trillions and trillions of possible energies, frequencies and wavelengths under consideration but also the fact that quantum mechanics treats each of these trillions and trillions of frequencies, wavelengths and energies as individual wave-particles. Is it really possible for an electron that has a (classical) radius of [math]10^{-13}[/math] cm to perform such magic as to manufacture trillions and trillions of photons of different energies, wave-lengths and frequencies and to store all of these within the infinitesimal space available to it and to bring it out when needed? Which theory is more realistic Gestalt Aether Theory or quantum mechanics? Gestalt Aether Theory takes the more modern approach of dividing up the cake: constructing the photon out of bursts or pulses of electrical energy from the electron, this has the happy result of allowing an electron to easily and without effort to emit or absorb trillions and trillions of photon combinations, each with its own unique frequency, wavelength and energy. This process is analogous to modern computing where information is broken into manageable bits. To understand how the electron emits bursts or pulses of electrical energy to construct a photon see the image below:  Returning to the earlier explanations that were given stating that the size of 500 nm for a typical wave-length of a photon makes it practically impossible for it to be absorbed individually by an electron. Note that this photon ( according to Gestalt Aether Theory) has been emitted by an electron, the pulses of energy emitted and eventually bound into place by the dipole structure  are small in comparison with the size of the electron ( as they logically should be) therefore the wave-length here is merely a reflection of the periodicity at which the photon is emitted( a natural corollary of the dipole structure) and is not an indication of size. It can therefore be stated with reasonable confidence that if the electron can emit such a photon it can absorb it with equal facility. The photon can home in on an individual electron requiring its particular energy and be cleanly absorbed, and then almost immediately re-emitted with ( in the case of reflection) no loss of energy. What about the electron? Well it is circling the nucleus which has a comparatively massive size, so an electron recoiling off the nucleus after absorbing a photon would be more or less like a billiard ball reflecting off the cushions of a billiard board the result is that the photon is emitted at the same angle of as the incident photon but in an opposite direction. Obviously a single electron emitting a photon would not result in what is observed, namely the continuous emission of photons over looong periods of time. Therefore it is reasonable to suppose that the electron oscillates at the frequency of the incoming line of photons, if this frequency is 500 Thz then the electron will be oscillating at 500 Thz and emitting photons at the same angle and plane as the absorbed photons but in the opposite direction. Notice how beautifully this fits with all observed and experimental data. Also note that an ordinary smart phone processes data at the rate of Gigabits per second. Why then is it so difficult to accept that an electron of infinitesimal size cannot oscillate at several Terahertz, surely at that size it would be more natural than not for it to do so when irradiated? Hope this helps upvote if you like. Thanks Footnote: The claim is that: It's only when you get a surface that you get reflection. The light from each photon can still potentially reflect at all angles from each atom on the surface, and the photon can actually interact with any of the atoms with a certain probability. Since the atoms are all arranged in a particular pattern, a flat plane, most of the possible paths end up canceling each other out. Only one path is reinforced: the one by which the angle of reflection is the angle of incidence. But consider this, if a mirror using reflected light is used during the photoelectric effect, there is no difference than if the light was emitted directly by a source a light bulb for instance. How does the reflected electromagnetic wave account for this? ",

            "answer_text": "A photon is one of the models of light physicists (read: Einstein) proposed to explain certain phenomena shown by light. Photons cannot interact with themselves, or other photons, but can interact with other particles, the most common interactions of which are the ones with leptons like an electron. Photon theory says that when a photon interacts with a particle, it is wholly assimilated, which means the electron and photon become one bound state, the bound state now possessing both the photon and the electron. Reflection is a phenomenon where an OPAQUE object reverses the component of a photon's velocity along the normal to the plane of reflection. This is not a very sound defenition, but is a simple one for understanding. So now, what this means is, by conservation of momentum, when the photon is reemmitted, it should get reflected, because since the body is opaque, it can't go through, and it's normal velocity is reversed. It is almost exactly like an impulse during an elastic collission. This is not necessarily how light really works. Considering you asked for a photon specifically, this is the best answer I can muster. ",
