            "answer_text": "This question seems very difficult but answer is pretty simple. I know it\u2019s not that simple as it looks in writing , however it's not that difficult too. To find a way to deal with this first you have to understand how much you matter to yourself, also to your very few close people in your life, like family and unconditional friends. We seek to be understood , it's very basic and common need of everyone, but it's hard fact that it's impossible to be understood by everyone. This everyone is society. It's good for us to understand this ground reality that in your worst and ugliest situation it's only you or if you are lucky your few people are going to stand by and it takes time for us to understand this ,but it's the sooner the better.Once we know this it makes our life much easier. You need to only impress yourself and if you like yourself for all reasons , I meant for good, bad and ugly. You don't need anyone\u2019s approval for anything, but you need only yours and that is absolute freedom.Everybody likes to be liked, it shouldn't be at cost of your peace and comfort with yourself. You be yourself and people will like you for real and even if they don't , please don't let it come in your way ever. Criticism is not a negative word , you know people criticise big leaders. Who selflessly working for others benefit.From this criticism if you can pick something to work on , fair enough else you should use your both ears at same time or may be none. You just research about any political leader from past you will see a list of controversies. Few are facts , more are opinion. When they don't leave people who have already left this world , how they can miss criticising anybody else.Some people , not some actually majority of our society they do criticism whole heartedly and as full time job. You can not stop them , but what you can do is take this criticism also positively. Just focus on your aspirations, your goals, your idea of life and every possible thing. Half problem is solved here or I would say most of it. Realise your value it's above everything. It's a very good saying that the way you looks at yourself everybody looks at you.Always keep yourself high. I would like to write a Poem for you, it's by Rabindranath Tagore. Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high. Where the knowledge is free. Where the world had not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls. Where words come out from the depth of truth where tireless striving strectches It's arms towards perfection. where the Clear stream of reason has not lost its way. Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit. Where the mind is led forward by thee. Into ever-widening thought and action. Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake. Any tough situations in life has no power on us but we give the power by reacting on it, if you choose not to react, you win. I will just conclude this with first line of this poem, which I like the most. Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high. \u2026\u2026 you can conquer the World. Thank you so much for your question. ",

            "answer_text": "Logic is always the best medicine in cases like that. Why ? Think of the mechanism of social critisicm. One person makes some comments about another based on some criteria,whether true or false,and the point from which one understands that one\u2019s opinion mutters is the reaction of the person being critisised-obviously a negative one. This reaction gives him/her the satisfaction of achieving one\u2019s true goal,being to hurt/negatevely affect the other person and also motivates them to continue releating this behaviour again and again. Why ? It is fun(!). To them that\u2019s what this behaviour begets. Noone is hurmed physically,so what\u2019s the problem ? Psycologically though\u2026..See in most cases what \u201cinspires\u201d critics to critisise is not the need to get you back in line ,but to make you feel bad for yourself just because you make them-through your actions,concerning self-improvement and success-feel bad for themselfs,because their progress is not of equal size. So why bother ?In fact your reaction is equal to their victory. By reacting,even by thinking of it,you give others the right to set limits to your life standards and values. But remember:do not turn into a jerk/selfish person in order to avoid getting hurt. Always use your logic. Sometimes your critics are right. Avoid being arrogant or having trouble accepting your mistakes. Self acceptance is the key to that. So keep these two rules in mind(judging the truthfullness of a critisism and understanding the mechanism of negative critisism) and think only those. Avoid putting too much feeling to it because that\u2019s what \u201cspreads the fire\u201d. The others will \u201cattack\u201d you just for defending yourself. Moreover it will cloud your judgement. That simple-not easy though,even I cannot always follow these rules when I lose patience. Best of luck! ",
