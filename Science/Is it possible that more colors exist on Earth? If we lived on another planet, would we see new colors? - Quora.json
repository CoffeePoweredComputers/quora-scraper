            "answer_text": "\u201cIs it possible that more colors exist on Earth? If we lived on another planet, would we see new colors?\u201d The existence of colours isn\u2019t a limitation of the particular planet it is a limitation of the vision equipment. Because we are descended from mammal-reptiles that only came out at night we are still regaining our colour vision. Nocturnal animals don\u2019t need colour vision so over a huge expanse of time they lose it. Once the dinosaur kingdom collapsed many of the small nocturnal animals started to adapt to a daylight existence once more and then while evolving and diversifying started to regain colour vision over the following millions of years. Currently the human race has about 75-80% of the colour vision of birds, who descended from dinosaurs and as a consequence never lost theirs. There are colours on flowers that we can\u2019t see but birds can, birds can see some of the near infra red spectrum and possibly a little of the ultra violet but we can\u2019t see any of that of course. So seeing colour depends very much on what kind of colour receptors you have in your eyes, we have yet to see all of the colours available on Earth never mind about what other planets might have, but it is doubtful that any planet in the solar system has any colour not already available on Earth.

            "answer_text": "These are two questions. The fisrt question, is it possible that more colors exist on Earth, is not specific about more than what. If it helps, humans can see only the \u2018visible\u2019 colors, some animals can see ultraviolet and/or infrared. The second question, Would we see new colors if we lived on another planet. If we move to another planet, say Mars, we still see the same colors (and still no infrared or ultraviolet). So no. If we evolved on another planet, we may need to see other colors to survive, and we could have evolved vision in different ranges. But we would probably not evolve into humans, so \u2018we\u2019 wouldn\u2019t be \u2018us\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "The number of colors is determined by the range of human eyesight, and our ability to discriminate different colors over continuous range of colors. They say we can distinguish about 100 red-green variations and 100 yellow-blue variations, and 1000 brightness levels. That\u2019s 10,000,000 different colors. However the colors we can distinguish may be different depending on conditions. So maybe we don\u2019t know how many colors we can perceive. But it\u2019s not a limit of earth. It\u2019s a limit of human capability. ",
