            "answer_text": "Original Question: ONLY Abrahamic people: is there any proof of the existence of Moses or Abraham? If you\u2019re trying to limit answers from people who follow one of the Abrahamic religions, you\u2019ll inevitably get biased answers based on their beliefs. Are you trying to get confirmation of your own views this way, ignoring all other perspectives? There is no evidence, none at all, for either of these biblical characters. They\u2019re both entirely mythical and written into fictional stories which were compiled, in part from much older myths from other cultures, by unknown scribes during the time of the Babylonian Exile in the 6th century BCE. Along with other books, several of which have been incorporated into the Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers & Deuteronomy), they were most likely written as a means of giving the Judahite people in lifelong exile in Babylon, and probably in danger of forgetting their cultural and religious heritage, a sense of common origin, a hoped-for destiny and return to their homeland, and a series of theological customs and laws. The story of Exodus, in particular, is probably the most researched of all Old Testament stories, yet in the 150 or more years this story has been studied, not one single bit of credible evidence to support any part of the story as written, has ever been found. Not one. The Bible is not a history book in any shape or form; it\u2019s just a collection of the myths and legends of the people of the times in which the various books were written (between the late 8th century BCE and the early 2nd century CE) which represented their then naive and scientifically ignorant theological beliefs.

            "answer_text": "Moses was a real person. This Jewish tradition has been handed down for over 3,300 years by the entire Jewish nation, and accepted by Christians and Muslims as well. Moses is mentioned many times in the Torah and Rabbinic literature. He is also mentioned by ancient non-Jewish writers going back over 2,300 years, including Hecataeus, Strabo, Alexander Polyhistor, Manetho, Apion, Chaeremon, Tacitus, and Porphyry. Non-religious ancient Jewish sources mention him too, such as Artapanus, Eupolemus, Josephus and Philo. Abraham too, was a historical person, as recorded in the Book of Genesis (ch.11-25). The gravesite of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives (Genesis 49:29-32) is located in Hebron and has been known and attested to for many centuries. He is revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The Jewish people have attested to his existence for 3800 years, and his name is mentioned by several ancient non-Jewish historians as far back as 2,300 years ago. These include Berosus, Alexander Polyhistor, Melo, Eupolemus, Artapanus, Hecateus, and Nicolaus Damascenus. Link: Archaeology ",
