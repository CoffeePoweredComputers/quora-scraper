            "answer_text": "When potato rot, the rotted part becomes watery, soft, and it stinks. It makes all other potatoes in the bag wet and stinky. So you need to go through the hole bag, and find that one rotten potato. As long as a potato is firm, is good to eat regardless of color. Bruesed potatoes develop dark spots, they are OK. Cooked potatoes are good for a couple of day in the fridge. They start to smell when they go bad, but I would not rely on the smell. You can re-cook them when in doubt. ",

            "answer_text": "You can know if the potato is fresh or not by it,s smell because fresh potatoes have an earthy, starchy scent. When they start to go bad, this scent changes, becoming bitter and moldy. Sometimes potatoes will look acceptable on the outside but have turned rotten on the inside. If you come across a potato in the market that looks good but smells wrong, do not purchase it.   I hope this information is help full to you\u2026 ",
