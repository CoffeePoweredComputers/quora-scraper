            "answer_text": "Relativistic mass is NOT real. Relativistic mass may have a use, and we\u2019ll get to this later, but first let\u2019s review what relativistic mass. The understanding of relativistic mass can be approached from either total energy or 3-momentum, it does matter which so we\u2019ll use the momentum. In a Newtonian universe the momentum of a particle is given by [math]\\vec{p}=m \\cdot \\vec{v}[/math], however, subsequent science demanded our universe be described by a 4-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime. Translating the Newtonian momentum to our spacetime the 3-momentum is given by [math]\\vec{p}=m \\cdot \\vec{v} \\cdot \\dfrac{dt}{d\\tau} \\tag*{}[/math] Rearranging terms we have [math]\\vec{p}=\\left (m \\cdot \\dfrac{dt}{d\\tau}  \\right ) \\cdot \\vec{v} \\tag*{}[/math] where we can now define the relativistic mass, [math]\\mathfrak{m}[/math], [math]\\mathfrak{m}=m \\cdot \\dfrac{dt}{d\\tau} \\tag*{}[/math] This algebraic substitution allows us to write the 3-momentum in a way that resembles the Newtonian momentum, [math]\\vec{p}=\\mathfrak{m} \\cdot \\vec{v}[/math], and this is the use of the relativistic mass, but it is just an arbitrary artifact of the algebra. Technical NotesSome of you may be wondering about the scaling by [math]dt/{d\\tau}[/math] and why it is objects behave as if their mass increases with speed, so this section is added to address those topics. The denominator in the term [math]dt/{d\\tau}[/math] is the proper time, [math]\\tau[/math]. It is a real quantity that measures the length along the worldline of every observer. Imagine the universe where every particle and person carries a clock with them, all clocks are identical, and all tick away at the same rate (affine parametrization), but they\u2019re all moving in different directions through spacetime. Image from: Einstein's Pathway  The term in the numerator of is the differential of the coordinate time. Coordinate doesn\u2019t exist and is the projection or shadow length of the spacetime distance along one worldline onto a different worldline. In the image above we have worldline distances marked off, [math]\\Delta \\tau_A[/math] and [math]\\Delta \\tau_B[/math]. The projection of [math]\\Delta \\tau_A=1[/math] light-second onto the observer\u2019s worldline is [math]\\Delta t[/math] which is called the coordinate time and it has an arclength of 2 light-seconds along worldline B. The ratio, [math]dt/{d\\tau}[/math] , then scales vectors along one worldline onto another worldline. This is what was done with the momentum and what leads to a definition of relativistic mass: Relativistic Mass: The mass of an object scaled the ratio of length along the worldline of the mass an projected onto the worldline of the observer, to the length along the observer\u2019s worldline. Some of you may recognize this ratio as the Lorentz factor, [math]\\gamma[/math], and it is in fact the definition of the Lorentz factor. For example, the Lorentz factor in the Schwarzschild geometry for stationary shell observers would be [math]\\gamma \\equiv \\dfrac{dt}{d\\tau}=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{1-2m/r}} \\tag*{}[/math] or for moving observers in the Minkowski geometry [math]\\gamma \\equiv \\dfrac{dt}{d\\tau}=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2}} \\tag*{}[/math] The behavior of moving objects makes the object appear that its mass is increasing as it is being accelerated by some force, say by a charged particle in an accelerator or hypothetically by a rocket undergoing eternal 1g acceleration. Where does the apparent mass increase come from? Time dilation. As the objects experience a constant proper acceleration their worldlines diverge from the observer\u2019s worldline and it simply takes longer and longer to observer the effect of the acceleration. Let\u2019s look at an example\u2026 Let\u2019s take a rocket ship with a proper or 4-acceleration of 1g. To make the point abundantly clear lets take it the rocket\u2019s 4-acceleration has been and always be [math]A^\\mu=1g[/math]. We\u2019ll select a reference frame initially at rest with the rocket. The coordinate speed of the rocket as a function of the coordinate time is given by (see [1]) [math]v(t)=\\dfrac{g \\cdot \\Delta t}{\\sqrt{ 1+\\left (\\dfrac{g \\cdot \\Delta t}{c}  \\right )^2}} \\tag*{}[/math] where we can solve for the coordinate time to yield [math]\\Delta t=\\dfrac{1}{g \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{v^2}-\\dfrac{1}{c^2}}} \\tag*{}[/math] where we can see that in the limit that [math]v\\rightarrow c[/math] the coordinate time, that is, the time recorded by the moving clock projected onto the observer\u2019s worldline is infinite in extent. This is why an object cannot be accelerated to the speed of light: It would an infinite amount of time to observe the increase in speed. [1] Hyperbolic motion (relativity) - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Well, there are two answers, one physical and one ideological. Physically the problem is that trying to define relativistic mass in a general way is not a problem with a unique answer, and sometimes gives inconsistent results. So the relativistic mass calculated in some circumstances has to be treated very carefully if you are trying to determine how gravity is affected etc. We end up with odd concepts such as tangential mass, which can be problematic. Given how easily the concept can lead to confusion, some physicists (especially particle physicists) have championed the idea that the term \u2018mass\u2019 should mean only \u2018rest mass\u2019, and the whole issue avoided. Rest mass is a relativistic invariant, and this seems to these physicists to be a strong enough reason to define it in this way. There are good arguments that build on these views. And therein is the \u2018political\u2019 element of this. The fact is that the \u2018only rest mass is mass\u2019 idea is itself subject to misunderstandings and misconceptions. The rest mass is a property of a system, and within that system what is considered rest mass outside of it will appear to be relativistic mass. For instance the rest mass of globular clusters in astronomy is the sum of the relativistic masses of the orbiting stars within the cluster. And the rest mass of a proton is ten times the rest mass of the quarks it is \u2018made of\u2019 (because protons are complex and have vast amounts of stored energy, none of which is rest mass if you are looking at that level). Rest/proper lengths are also invariant but few people advocate using the term \u2018length\u2019 to refer only to proper length. I frequently have people assert that the statement that total energy, using relativistic mass, can be stated as [math]E = m_{rel} c^2[/math] should be replaced by the \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201ccomplete\u201d expression [math]E^2 = (m_0 c^2)^2 + (pc)^2[/math]. But these two equations are mathematically identical, there is no mathematical or physical preference for one over the other, unless you have already decided to banish relativistic mass. So there is a certain ideological element to the attempted banishment of relativistic mass. As such there is also an element of zealotry about the promotion of the idea. There is real merit in advocating caution in the use of concepts such as mass, which in fact turn out to not port very well into realms such as particle physics or even general relativity. But you should not let anyone tell you that relativistic mass is a bad concept. It is just a concept that is useful in some circumstances, not in others. Like any other physics concept. ",
