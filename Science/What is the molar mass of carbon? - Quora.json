            "answer_text": "Atoms are too small to allow meaningful measurement of chemical substances. To work with meaningful amounts of substances, scientists group them into units called moles. A mole is defined as the number of carbon atoms in 12 grams of the isotope carbon-12, which is roughly 6.022 x 10*23 atoms. This number is called Avogadro's number or Avogadro's constant. It is used as the number of atoms for any substance, and the mass of 1 mole of a substance is its molar mass. ",

            "answer_text": "Your exact question would be \"what is the atomic mass of carbon\". But if you don't care about this problem, you can still seem they're one (atomic mass = molar mass) And your question's answer is about 12 (g/mol). There is still many measurement units for this quantity but I often use this unit because it must be simple. But measurement units may not be important in atomic/molar mass so that you can skip it You can easily find the answer by looking up Periodic Table. All is in that ",
