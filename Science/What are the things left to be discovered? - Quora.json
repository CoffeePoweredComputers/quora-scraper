            "answer_text": "Here are the things that make me wonder: Old age medicine/elixir for life. Researches are being made in this front. One I believe is genetics approach examining why we get old genetically, other would be physiology approach, what changes in our body over time. Overcoming death is the top priority for the humans.Life in another planet. (Might happen within this decade). What a deep implications would this have? Can we talk philosophy, religion and society with beings from another planet?Dark Matter Particle. Modification of current particle theory. One of the biggest concern in current physicsLuminal traveling (making interstellar travel possible): It takes awful lot of time to get to Alpha centaurai ~60 years to the nearest star. There has got to be a better way.Singularity in AI. (When AI becomes more intelligent than humans, and overtake them.) Dreadful, but also exciting prospect.Simulating a human brain. Nature of consciousness. Making a computer alive? Can you simulate me, my consciousness? What does that really mean?Traveling alive across the event horizon of a black hole. Every public lecture in astronomy, there is question about black hole and traveling beyond the horizon \u2014 alive.A never ending source of happiness, and a meaningful life to live. The perfect solutions to existential questions. Like John Lennon said when his teacher asked,\u201dWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d, \u2014\u201dI want to be happy.\u201d If only there is a simple answer that we could all understand and overcome our existential crisis from time to time.Beautiful mathematical theorem. Proof of Riemann conjecture, proof of Collatz conjecture and others Unsolved Problems.A 100% efficient system, everlasting, and requiring no energy input. All the engineers, who tried to prove second law of thermodynamics was wrong. What a marvel that would be.Creating a fair and better society. Are there system better than capitalism? If we had to to it again, in a controlled manner, what path of history would we choose? How can we avoid big conflicts and violence so commonly afflicting the human history?",
