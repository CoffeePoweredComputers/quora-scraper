            "answer_text": "That is not true. Astrophysicists are advancing their observations in space whereas Geologists are doing their justice towards their field. Sunken ships, alienated lands and ancient scriptures are the things generally found deep down underwater.We find flora and fauna. Fossils of many extent species.Down there lies the verdict on evolution! Whereas we find asteroids , new planets and celestial radiations. We know a lot of history! But there are different versions to it. With each new discovery of ancient articles or cities, either new versions come up or an older unclear version is verified. But space is infinite! New objects can be found. Life is sought millions of light-years away. Whatever we find is intriguing to a new extent.   Secrets Of Ancient Underwater City Pavlopetri Revealed -\nTravel Back In Time And See What The City Looked Like!    Once a long time ago, this unique place was inhabited by an advanced civilization. Then, something happened and the city vanished consumed by the sea.Some say this is the world's oldest city and the underwater ruins are remains of the legendary city of Atlantis.The city of Pavlopetri, underwater off the coast of southern Laconia in Greece, is about 5000 years old.This underwater site is unique.  Unknown World Of Volcanic Underwater Activity At Loki\u2019s Castle In The Arctic Ocean   At Loki\u2019s Castle in the Arctic Ocean, researchers from the University of Bergen (UiB), Norway have discovered a so far unknown world of volcanic activity underwater.These discoveries are incredibly interesting as they represent a part of the Norwegian nature that is under-explored. They represent a part of nature where conditions are extreme and where we expect to find a lot of new and exciting biology,\u201d UiB spokesman Dag Rune Olsen said.  Enigmatic Ancient Underwater Ruins  These ancient underwater remains serve as a reminder of how vulnerable we are and how fast Mother Nature can end our existence.To date, it is estimated that we have explored only 3 to 5 percent of the ocean floor. With so much territory still left to explore, we can only imagine the discoveries yet to come! Here are just a few examples of remarkable ancient underwater discoveries. Edit 1: I missed a part of the question the first time.Why? We cannot predict many things in space. We cannot predict when a star might collapse. We cannot predict when the satellites would catch an undecipherable signal . We cannot even predict if external life forms would invade the earth. We don't know if wormholes exist. Not knowing something or not understanding it would only entice us. That is our nature ",

            "answer_text": "That's easy: space is mostly empty and transparent, so we can see things distant. We can do all kinds of analysis like spectography (sp), etc. The initial cost of these things were in the reach of the private citizen. Many other sciences developed centuries ago from these observations. The solid Earth is opaque. It requires more analysis, and that requires more spending. We have more different harder analyses to confirm theories about the Earth's core. Empirical observation of it, the bottom of oceans, is harder. Additionally, the money for such observations is carefully considered.  In the case of the oceans the Navy wants to protect its assets. Much of the spending on seismic research is done for nuclear treaty verification. Many early ideas were wrong. They had less information to go on. I could say lots more but I have to run. ",
