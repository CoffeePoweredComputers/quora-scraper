            "answer_text": "It is too early in life for you to choose a career. Please keep in mind career is AFTER you have done something, not what you plan to do. What you are anxious about is which profession you should go into. Anxiety will always make you take a wrong decision. Take it easy, go step by step - first choose your basic education (graduation onwards) wisely. You have to chose what basic education you should take to become competent for a profession. For that, you will have to look at yourself, your likes and dislikes, and most of all what you are good / bad at. Only you know that; others know nothing about it - even your parentsIf you are not proficient in Maths, there are a lot of choices which are not meant for you: Engineering, Physics, Economics, Statistics etc. If you hate the sight of injuries and blood, medical studies is not the line to take. If you are not able to relate to business and industry, Commerce is not for you. Conversely, if you like the idea of teaching, just about ANY line is good. Or if you are really persevering in research, a PhD in Engineering, Physics, Biological Sciences etc. is the direction to take. Doing Arts is a good choice if you want to target getting into Civil Services etc.Don\u2019t let anyone try to convince you that success is guaranteed by doing MBA after a graduation in any subject. The only job you will ever get by that is in low-level Sales or Marketing. For deserving anything serious, you will have to get work experience of a few years before doing MBA - you will not understand anything taught in MBA otherwiseYour choice of profession will change many times between now and when it is the time to choose a professionSuccess shouldn\u2019t be the goal of life. Whatever you do, put in your best - you are bound to succeed. Don\u2019t take shortcuts - it never pays!Don\u2019t try to do what you love to do (people taking this route fail most often) - love whatever you doDON\u2019T chase money. If it is ordained for you, it will come. What matters is a balanced life, a balance between professional achievement and personal / family needs. If you chase money, you will realize after a very long time what you have lost in the bargain. And it will be too late then!",

            "answer_text": "You have to connect your passion with your abilities and then connect with the opportunities to decide about your career destination. If you are a happy go lucky person, not so studious, yet very creative and passionate about new concepts, ideas and research, extrovert and fond of communicating with people - then for you my prescription would be humanities - English, Psychology, Philosophy, Political Studies, Mass Communication, Journalism, Social Studies. If you are not interested in Science subjects, but very much creative and wants to earn good packages after Graduation, not so studious but passionate about creating something new and interested about art and design, my suggestion for you would be Designing - Fashion Designing, Product Designing, Interior Designing, Automobile and Transport Designing, Lifestyle and Accessories, Industrial Designing, Visual Communicstion and Graphic Designing, Gaming and Animstion designing etc. If you are not good in Science subjects, specially in Mathematics, then dont break your head for Medical or Engineering. If you are passionate about IT sector, but not good in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics, then dont go for 3rd category Engineering Colleges. Instead go for Graphic Designing and Visual Communication or Gaming and Animation or something like UX designing which will make you land into IT companies with very good pay packages. If you are fond if Commerce as a subject and coming from.a Corporate or Business background, then go for BCOM or BBA or BBA plus LLB. For hospitality industries, go for BHM i.e. Bachelor in Hotel Management or Hospitality Management. Otherwise if you are studious and sincere and hardworking, and a very good and Meritorious student with patience, then go for the traditional CA, Cost Accountancy, Engineering and Medical. For Humanities, Management, Design and Law subjects, you can go for Karnavati University at Gandhinagar Gujarat which is trending to be one of the best University interms of infrastructure, Faculty resources and Placements. There are many other career options. You dont have to necessarily pursue with Science or Commerce subjects to prove yourself superior in the society. These days, most of the opportunities are in Humanities where you can have a free space of mind to feel education from.within and can use your creativity and communication skill to excel in the much preferred Media and Entertainment Industry. Listen to your heart, speak to your mind, think about your abilities and connect with the opportunities. This is the best way to decide about your career. ",

            "answer_text": "HOW TO CHOOSE CAREER AFTER EDUCATION/ GRADUATION words- 939 reading time-3 min 35 sec DON'T BE PANIC Well, This a stage of life where some fresh students having a big dream in life come after college and face the real world, and they have no idea what to do and how to do next? Hey, welcome to my blog, like you, I was searching for a good carer after my study had completed. See, this is an age of innovation new up-gradation and also an age that mankind was searching for many years. Now, 80 thousand students are passing out every year. But the regret sight is 70% of students have not that much capacity or potential to be at a good job or a good career. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OLD AND NEW AGE when someone going online and searching for what is the best smartphone in the price range of 10000, he gets confused. which handset should he buy? Like that, when you are searching for a good salary option, you are getting confused. When our parents are studying in theiryoung age, there were not so many career options that are now available in the market. They have to choose a job for a career, or there are such limited options. Almost it can be a teacher or a CA or could be in any government or private sector job as well. But now if you go to finding a job in the market, there are vast options in every field.   FOLLOW YOUR PASSION Alright, some students settle down their careers very soon, and some students get a job or starting a business later in life. It totally depends upon what is your belief system is and what you want to be. I will say if you won't get a job to follow your passion. Passion has such energy that you can travel to your destination. I will want to say some students have nothing in their life. They are like 5th class students what they told to do. They do that, but if you are reading this, I will say you are not between them. Nowadays, every work has significant scope for success. When someone asks the very successful person in the world, if you have 100 hours to invest in some work and works are you are very good at something or average at somethingand bad at something, Which one will you prefer and how much time will you give to which work? what do you think which had to get more hours? Let's see what your opinion is .please comment below. They all say they will give 100% hours in which they are good at. cream of the story is whatever your parents and society are telling you to do, don't listen to them. Choose your career according to your passion. It can be getting a good job. which you are good at, it can be photography, YouTube, blogging, network marketing, or it can be some other business. ACTIVE AND PASSIVE SIGHT OF MONEY Listen, there can be two types of income nowadays. It can be active or passive income. If you working actively in some work and revenue is producing that is active work and If you create a business model once it will pay you life long and after your death also that is a passive income source. YOUR STRATEGY IS YOUR POWER So if you are a student of average and have no passion and happy with the 9 to 5 job you should be at a job .there will be not as many problems and it will be secure for you. but if you have a big idea and you are passionate about your dreams. You should be a businessman. Your proper guide is on this site, this guide will help you for success, how you can be an expert in the business. Once I was in network marketing. And almost I have all the ideas of all formats. Read more here https://www.no1gentlemanlifes.com/2019/07/how-to-choose-career-after-education.html ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Bippul, I do understand that making the right career choice is often overwhelming. Particularly these days when we keep on reading about so many different kinds of courses as well as careers, it makes it all the more confusing. Moreover, there is a lot of free advice available from everyone - peers, friends, relatives, acquaintances to add to that confusion. \uf04a All of us always desire to have the best in life. Being best in terms of salary, company profile, job role and other perks is what success means to us. However, in my opinion, a career is something where you are making a choice for entire life so a career is best if you feel happy doing it. Going to the office or workplace every day does not make you feel burdened or heavy in any way. Therefore it is important to discover your talents, personality type, strengths and aptitude. Getting a psychometric assessment done for yourself will be greatly helpful. A career that is in sync to these will be the best career option for you as you won\u2019t have to struggle to excel. For example, Sachin Tendulkar may be a star cricketer but if you put him into singing he may struggle. Besides while making a career choice you also need to consider your life\u2019s goals like whether money is important to you or fame or Prestige. Some of us want a career that pays us well but should not bind us in terms of schedule and time which means Freedom is important. For a few a career is good that also allows them to have some leisure time at the end of the day. For some, a career is best that allows them to be of service to others. So you see each one of us have different goals in life and it is very important that whichever career we choose should be in sync to these goals so that we remain happy or content doing it. Last but not least your strong or favourite subjects also play a role in determining your career domain. Hope this helps \uf04a #Latityude #SonilaMishra ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, deciding a career depends on the stream you studied from. Like-- career options for science students are different than students of commerce. For eg. Being a humanity student, you cannot choose medical and being science student, you cannot choose to be a C.A. Secondly, you need to look into your interests and choices as well.. Search up for the choices you have regarding the career according to your subject and see what interests you the most. Thirdly, choose to do what you enjoy the most. for eg. if biology is fun to study, then you should not go for engineering. Because that will bore you and you will find it difficult to study, learn or understand. opt for something related to what you like or love to do. It will make the work easy and life full of joy instead of stress and anxiety. It will also make you the best in that field.. Fourthly, see what is best for you or what will be best for you in your future. Else follow your heart and passion as well as listen to the advise your mind gives you. Even if you choose a field, it has many more option/opportunities in them. for eg. medical is divided into hundreds of branches further. so choose wisely. that\u2019s it. If you are passionate about something, you will for sure achieve it. Do not hesitate to grab any opportunities your life throws at you. Remember, risk takers are build up to be achievers. hope my answer was of any help to you. May life comes to you with ease, joy and glory. Have a good day. ",

Being a average student who recently finished 12th, I landed into the most vex part of my school life \u201cwhich career path i should choose\u201d as i was never a person who wanted to pursue engineering so I started my search on Google regarding career options, looking out for entrance exams etc. Believe me I was totally exhausted in this process some suggestions were to pursue bsc, some suggested to prepare for engineering exams and what not. I was not convinced by any career path and the situation for me in this interval of time was that if anyone asked me what am I gonna do after 12th I would just burst out of anger on him/her and belonging to a orthodox family suggestions of my progenitor were only engineering or govenment exams and because of all these exhortations ,I became numb and my mind was completely blank . But then I decided to have a self talk and I suggest this self talk to everyone who is confused about career path. Just ask what will be the job you wanna pursue, a job in which even if any problem happens you will solve out without panic and anxiety. Think of the job which suits you in which you wanna gain knowledge more and more and after landing to your answer google up exams related to that job, universities that provide courses regarding it, don't just opt for a field which your friends are pursuing have a self talk \u2026.you will definitely get your answer. All the best!!!!! :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Once the celebration or the brooding subsides , the question that haunts the parents and students is what next? Those who are interested in medical or engineering or CA will already be taking steps in that direction. For the others , here are a few suggestions 1. Forcing a decision on the kid can be a disaster.Equally disastrous will be leaving the kid alone to make the decision. 2. Parents must provide the kid with information about various courses, their requirements, content as well as future prospects. 3. Humanities and pure sciences is NOT the correct choice for those who are not extremely talented in this http://field.An average student of a engineering, commerce or technical degree has better career prospects. In humanities the job opportunities are extremely limited and competition is very high. 4. Along with graduation, equal focus must be given on skill training. In all probability, that additional certification or skill and not your degree will get you a job. 5.Choosing a degree course on the basis of Civil Services exam syllabus is a complete waste. Look at the data, most people who qualify have degrees that have nothing to do with UPSC syllabus. 6. Don't choose on the basis of what you like, choose on the basis of what you are good at and what the market needs. There is a difference between hobbies/interests and profession. For those who couldn't pass , believe me in the long run the failure will have an impact only if you let it psychologically affect you. Else a year or two , here and there is absolutely insignificant. Be happy and conquer the world. All the best. ",

Choosing a career path might be a little tricky sometimes! I was stuck in a similar warp where I couldn't decide whether to opt for science or commerce. Numbers were something that never excited me much and I had a good knowledge of all my science subjects. The teachers in our education system are not programmed to shape a pupils career. We are taught a plethora of things which usually is not applied in the real world. I had two options where I was inclined more to choose science. However, back in those days you never had anyone to guide you through your career. You have career consultants and all but no one prepares you on what will you be doing when you land that dream job. There are a couple of websites like OnTheJob who gave me legit insight into what happens behind the scenes. Masterclass also helps you curate your options. I hope you get clarity on your career and fly out with passing colors. ",

            "answer_text": "It is important to understand that choosing a career is a continuous procedure and a student must choose a career at every step of the way. Whether you are deciding a stream in class 11, whether you are contemplating what course to pursue in college, whether you are deciding to pursue a post graduate degree, or whether the student is planning on what career profile to get into. Therefore, one can follow the following steps to choose a career: In the first instance, evaluate your capabilities. \u00b7 What are you good at? \u00b7 What are your strengths? \u00b7 What is your aptitude? \u00b7 What is it that you do that doesn\u2019t require unnecessary additional effort and you succeed in or perform that task quite naturally with much ease? If you are not quite sure of your inherent strengths & capabilities, then it is very important that you take an aptitude test and personality test to know your true potential. Secondly, draw a flow chart of your academic qualifications and compare it with the options available with you in the market. Thirdly, match / connect your capabilities with your academic status. A person can choose from a myriad of careers related to his/her stream. But not all of these careers will be the best fit career for an individual. This is because each career option requires different aptitude and personality combinations. That is why, it is important to connect one\u2019s own capabilities with ones academic qualifications. This can be a little tricky as even though one may be able to figure out one\u2019s aptitude and personality through psychometric tests like aptitude testing and personality assessment, however, it becomes quite a task to match ones strength with the requirements of the hundreds of career options available in the market. Hope this clear your doubts. ",

Otherwise some students these days just go the one of the three undergraduate degrees regardless of their likes and dislikes. Anyways, there are many conventional methods like aptitude tests and counselling that students refer to these days but before you go for all that I would request you to sit with yourself and find out your passions and interests in life. Think and finalize your goals like what you want to become- a professional, a business person or into academia, till what level you wish to pursue your education- Bachelors, Masters or PhD, MBA, Professional courses like MBBS, CA, CFA, Engineering, etc, where do you dream to study- which country or rather, which university, where do see yourself in the next 10 years- do you see yourself working in a corporate company, or travelling the world while working, doing a business and so on, what kind of a life you want- rich, middle class, upper middle class, famous, intellectual, devotional and spiritual, a volunteer for society, etc (You can choose more than one options bdw :p) And don\u2019t worry, since you are discussing with yourself, no fear of judgments. Once you have answers to all these questions, you can probably make better a choice. After that shortlist some career paths and your major from design, literature, arts, commerce, different sciences, finance and many more. Then, finally, discuss with your family and get their suggestions and views, because after all you don\u2019t study alone, your family is by your side in every pain and gain throughout. So consider their approval and thought. Hope I was able to help. All the best. ",

I would suggest this to every class12th student that firstly u should explore yourself and know wht your interest is,wht your passion is and wht u want to eo with your life after that prioritize your life. This thing has to be done in 10th class only as in 11th students have to choose the stream. So depending upon your intrest choose the stream in 10th and then dedicate yourselves to that stream,explore the possible career options related to the stream and then u can sort out the options depending upon your personnal interests and trust me if u listen to yourself and work according to that u will be unbeatable in the market. Dont go with the decision of your family as its you who has to face the consequences or the benefits. So do whatever your heart says,choose a career u r interested in not your parents. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "This is the question of almost every student of classes 10th \u201312th. Since there are a number of options so students get confused. I suggest you to first evaluate yourself, observe your attitude your aspirations and think what you want to do. Try to look inside yourself. Think what kind of work gives you maximum satisfaction and then decide your goal and then work accordingly. As you have not mentioned your subject combination which is a limitation for me to advise you more accurately. I don't know whether you're a student of humanities or commerce or science. If you are a student of science even then I need to know your subject combination. Anyway let me try to help you. If you are a student of science having a combination of PCM then you must go for engineering from a good institute. Suppose in future if you want to switch to administrative job you can go there as well or if you want a career in teaching even that option will remain open as after B. Tech you can go for MS. If you have a combination of PCB then you should and must prepare for NEET and other MBBS entrance exams. If you are a student having the background of commerce then you have an option for Chartered Accountancy, Cost Accountancy, Company Secretary, MBA(finance) and obviously B. Com then M. Com, then B. Ed and PhD. If you have a background of humanities then too you may go for teaching, welfare officer (for the graduates and post graduates of Sociology) etc. So first think and then decide. I suggest you if you have any such questions in future then please mention your subjects so that you may get more relevant answers. Thanks! ",

Join for Computer Science course. MBBS at the end will put you on field and you start earning. Engineering seems difficult to get job for some. But when you complete your graduation you will be that confidence to choose the field you like and you will be having experience in life to take up any profession unless you like to hustle in life besides sit back and chill at home. About other course(s), i think you won\u2019t be able to get much experience than these two gives Also if you are sensitive to your relative\u2019s comments then even these courses will help you to be in good side :) ",

For this first, you need to determine what your strength and weakness are, don\u2019t just choose a course just because everyone is asking you; make sure it interests you. Also, one should always choose a course over the college brand because ending with a course which doesn\u2019t interest you at a famous college won\u2019t solve the purpose. ",

I guess the best way to take a decision is to close your eyes and imagine what you truly want to be. Think what you enjoy doing. Think the interests and passions that you went to when you were bored. Did you play outdoor games a lot or scribbled on notebooks when you were younger? Do you enjoy dancing or like working on computers? Whenever we think of career, we think of jobs that involves mental capacity. But there are many careers that can be followed with mind and passion. I know it is easily said than one. If you are looking for a more practical way, then, I recommend speaking to a education and career consultant. He or she will be able to add more clarity and also approach the topic in a rational manner. I know a website where you can speak with career and education consultants through chat and email.
