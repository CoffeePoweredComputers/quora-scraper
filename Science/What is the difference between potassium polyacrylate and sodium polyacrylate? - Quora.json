Here are the differences; Usages potassium polyacrylate: water retaining agent for plants sodium polyacrylate: absorbent material of diaper, sanitary napkins, etc. Process of absorbing potassium polyacrylate: white powder => transparent water gel sodium polyacrylate: white powder => white water gel => transparent water gel Decomposition time potassium polyacrylate: more than two weeks sodium polyacrylate: in one week Decomposition product potassium polyacrylate: K+, carbon dioxide, water, etc. sodium polyacrylate: Na+, carbon dioxide, water, etc. Price potassium polyacrylate: high sodium polyacrylate: low Update It\u2019s unwise to use Sodium polyacrylate as water retaining agent. It\u2019s no working and would cause salinization of soil. details: The Safety of sodium polyacrylate for human & environmental impact Citations: Potassium polyacrylate VS Sodium polyacrylate ",

            "answer_text": "In terms of what they are good for, there is no real difference between sodium and potassium polyacrylate (or, for that matter, lithium polyacrylate). These materials are used for their super absorbancy properties (SAP) soaking up 200\u2013300 times their own weight. They are used in potting soils (helps to retain moisture), baby diapers, etc. The reason there are difference forms (well different salts as, otherwise, they are identical) is due to how they are manufactured.
