            "answer_text": "..L.D.Phillips, Professional Educatorhas answered that science has the ability to be self-correcting and the bible doesn't.That is almost rightThe truth is that the bible is dynamic, the Protestant Evangelical church resists change and the Roman Catholic church changes so slowly it may as well not bother..Frank Langben has answered thatthe bible says the new heaven/earth will not occur until after Jesus returns.That is 100% correct and 100% wrong at the same time.God The Father creates past, present & future simultaneouslyTime is static and human life-forms are moving forward through it..Ilpo Surokivi, Bachelor degree Theology has answered thatthere will be no new heaven/earthGod will simply renew the existing heaven/earthThat is total kakThe No1 problem with the Christian religion is that Christians will not accept that the plain words of the bible mean exactly what they say. They have to \u2018interpret\u2019 everything into monstrous contortionsNow we have a \u2018theologian\u2019 holding onto the mind-set of a religionistIt's pitiful..\u2019The galaxies are not moving through space, they are moving in space, because space is also moving. In other words, the universe has no centre; everything is moving away from everything else. ..If you imagine a grid of space with a galaxy every million light years or so, after enough time passes this grid will stretch out so that the galaxies are spread to every two million light years, and so on, possibly into infinity.\u2019What does it mean when they say the universe is expanding?..The question was :- \u2019Since the universe is expanding and the Bible says God is creating a new heaven and new earth, is science and the Bible agreeing?\u2019..The writer of the question thinks that the entire universe comprises our world and its related Heavenand/or he imagines that Lord Jesus cannot end our world without ending the entire universeWhat the bible actually says is \u2026....Joel 2:31 ...'The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come.'..Luke 21:25-26 ...'And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men's hearts failing them for fear, and looking after those things which are coming on the earth; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.'..Revelation 6:12-13 ...'And I beheld when He had opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood. And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.'..Question\u2019Are all of the points of light in the night sky, other than the moon, planets, and artificial satellites, that we call stars also suns?\u2019..Answer\u2019The Sun is a perfectly ordinary star -- a great, glowing ball of gas. In its core, it fuses hydrogen into helium, as all stars do for the majority of their lives, in order to generate enough pressure to avoid collapsing under its own gravity. In that sense, I think the answer to the question is Yes..A subtler aspect of this question might be whether other stars are suns in that they have planets of their own. In that case, the answer is No, not quite.Planets are very common around other stars, orbiting as many as 30% of stars similar to the Sun. However, there are plenty of stars for which we have no evidence of orbiting planets.\u2019What is the difference between a \"star\" and a \"sun\"? (Beginner)..\u2018Our Sun is a bright, hot ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar system.Our Sun is an average sized star. There are bigger stars, and there are smaller stars.\u2019How Does Our Sun Compare With Other Stars?..\u2018The Sun is just one of about 200 billion stars (or perhaps more) just in the Milky Way galaxy alone.So far, astronomers have found more than 500 solar systems and are discovering new ones every year. Given how many they have found in our own neighborhood of the Milky Way galaxy, scientists estimate that there may be tens of billions of solar systems in our galaxy, perhaps even as many as 100 billion.\u2019https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-space/solar-systems-in-galaxy.html..\u2019According to the best estimates of astronomers there are at least one hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe.\u2019How do we know how many galaxies are in our universe?..\u2018From the full suite of observations available, we get our Universe. 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang, it\u2019s now 46.1 billion light years in radius. That\u2019s the limit of what\u2019s observable. Any farther than that, and even something moving at the speed of light since the moment of the hot Big Bang will not have had sufficient time to reach us. As time goes on, the age and the size of the Universe will increase, but there will always be a limit to what we can observe...Observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Planck satellite are where we get the best data. They tell us that if the Universe does curve back in on itself and close, the part we can see is so indistinguishable from \u201cuncurved\u201d that it must be at least 250 times the radius of the observable part...This means the unobservable Universe, assuming there\u2019s no topological weirdness, must be at least 23 trillion light years in diameter, and contain a volume of space that\u2019s over 15 million times as large as the volume we can observe. If we\u2019re willing to speculate, however, we can argue quite compellingly that the unobservable Universe should be significantly even bigger than that.\u2019Ask Ethan: How Large Is The Entire, Unobservable Universe?..The universe God has created is larger than the human brain can conceiveIt is the belief of the Christian church that it has all been created for humanityAs humans are unable to see most of it, with the most powerful telescopes they can inventit follows that the only way they can make use of it is to move off planet Earth and get out into it..That being the caseone would expect the Christian religion to be all about developing space technology and looking to the future. In fact the church is all about holding to the perceptions, attitudes and beliefs of those who walked the Earth two thousand years agoWhich is 4 times further back than the medieval period..The 40 commandments that Jesus gave at the Sermon On The Mount (Mathew chapters 5-7)are the only way that humans can stay sane in a highly technological worldwhere all humans work for the Governmentwhile their every word and action is tracked and monitored by software and robots..This is the only way that sufficient resources can be made available to explore the universeand it is the impetus that will propel humanity out into the universewhere individuals will have the power of gods.It is humanity\u2019s future. It will happen...John 14:12-14 King James Version (KJV)\u2018Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.\u2019..After humanity has got off its ass and got out into the universethere will be few tears shed when this galaxy\u2019s sun goes black and Planet Earth is goneYour world is about to become a hell-hole for humanityand that must be soor they will not move themselves off it..Blog :-https://www.quora.com/profile/William-Milverton/blogs..

            "answer_text": "If it does (and that\u2019s a stretch) it has no significance. The Bible mentions Romans. We\u2019re pretty sure Romans did exist in Biblical times. But that does not mean the Bible is a primary resource for archaeologists. Similarly the Bible is not an authority on cosmology even if one passage in one translation can (with a huge amount of wishful thinking) be interpreted as a vague agreement with an oversimplification of current science. Before the Big Bang Theory was hypothesised, how many biblical scholars were proposing that cosmology? None (as far as I know). Even Abbe Lema\u00eetre based it on science, not the Bible. If the Steady State Theory had won out, there would no doubt be some convoluted explanation of how that agrees with some other Biblical phrase, or even the same one. Actually it does match SST better than BBT - the \u201ccreating new earth\u201d could be creating new matter. So, it looks like the Bible agrees with a failed cosmology. Which is pretty much in line with its reliability on archaeology. ",
