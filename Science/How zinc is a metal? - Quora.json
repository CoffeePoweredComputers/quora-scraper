            "answer_text": "The reason why this question is not getting answers is because of its obvious nature. Zinc is a metal. There is no need to question its existence, and looking at any periodic table will tell you that it is a transition metal. Furthermore, it behaves like metals. It looks like a metal, feels like a metal perhaps even tastes like a metal. It reacts like a metal, it forms compounds typical of a metal. Perhaps, asking a more difficult question like 'Would ununoctium behave more like a metal or a non-metal?' would have attracted significant interest, because it so so new and exotic. However, zinc has been studied for centuries if not thousands of years. The first alloys were zinc alloys (does 'brass' ring a bell? pun intended). I mean, look at it:  Look at how it is shining! Reaction of a metal with an acid liberates hydrogen gas, which is typical for a metal like Zinc:  Needless to say anything else? ",
