            "answer_text": "Using our own solar system as a guide, it appears that stars, at least normal ones on the main sequence, are denser than some gas giant planets: Sun: 1.41 grams/cm3 Jupiter 1.33 \u201c \u201c Saturn 0.687 \u201c \u201c Other main sequence stars are thought to be of about the same density as our Sun. Of course there are more massive planets than Jupiter, but it seems that these are not normally larger than about 1 &1/2 times Jupiter\u2019s radius. That means that that the largest normal planets, with about 3.4 times the mass of Jupiter could have have the same density as it does. More massive than that, and they would probably be denser than their stars. That shouldn\u2019t be a problem for them, though. Recall that Earth is nearly four times as dense a the Sun. ",

            "answer_text": "It varies\u2026 Jupiter isn\u2019t as dense as our Sun, but it\u2019s denser than Sirius A. Generally, the larger the star, the less dense it is; gas giants also seem to vary quite a bit. Saturn is less dense than water - it would float if you could find a bathtub big enough, but it\u2019s far denser than the star Rigel. ",
