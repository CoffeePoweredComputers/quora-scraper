            "answer_text": "We aren\u2019t. The so-called \u201cMethuselah star\u201d is a very old star. Recently, some astronomers performed a computation from observational data on the star and came up with a range of possible ages. If the star is as old as the oldest age in the range, then it\u2019s older than the estimated age of the universe. But, if it\u2019s close to the age of the most likely age in the range, then it\u2019s just a first generation star. Nothing surprising about it. Sure. It\u2019s a bit amusing that the formulas give a possible age older than the universe, but it\u2019s not actually meaningful. There\u2019s simply no reason to think that interpretation is true. ",
