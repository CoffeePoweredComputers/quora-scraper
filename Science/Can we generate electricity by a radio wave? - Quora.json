            "answer_text": "You\u2019re already doing it if you listen to a radio station with a crystal radio. But there is barely enough power there to drive the movements of the speaker cone or analogous device in your headphones. My guess is that it\u2019s far more economically feasible to harvest the energy of the sun with photovoltaic cells than to use the movements of speaker coils to power nano-scale generators of electricity. If you were too close to a source of high voltage electricity, then you might do the Tesla trick and have lightbulbs in your house that would give off life without a visible source of power. What else would you need to make life perfect? A more useful, but inconstant, thing you could do would be to set up a tall antenna and insulate it well from the ground. Then run a wire from the antenna to a rechargeable battery, put in a voltage regulator, and pull electricity from passing clouds with a charge relative to earth. This is basically Ben Franklin\u2019s experiment with the kite, the wire and a Leyden jar - Wikipedia. The only problem I can see with this is the same thing that made Ben\u2019s experiment life-threatening. You might call down a lightning strike on your own person or house. I once was fooling around and made a \u201cpassing charge\u201d detector. It moved the needle of a junked voltage meter by amplifying the charge detected from things like thunderstorm clouds in the distance. I doubt that the electric potential at the top of, e.g., the Eiffel Tower is ever zero for very long. It might be dangerous if people all over the earth started to discharge all the clouds passing overhead. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was working at a 50,000 Watt AM radio station, I lived about a block from the transmitter. I ran a wire from the peak of the roof to the basement, (single story house), and in the basement I built a crystal set, and was able to pick off 70 Volts from the crystal detector. (It was strong enough to drive a speaker loud enough to be heard all over the house!) (Sorry for the rough drawing)   OK, that 70 Volts wasn\u2019t really GOOD for anything, but it was converting the signal from that transmitter about a mile away into enough electricity that it could \u201cbite\u201d you.

            "answer_text": "Radio waves can be used for transmitting energy over distance. It is not harnessing as one has to provide energy in the transmitting side. Very directional microwave antennas can transmit energy from solar panels in space into earth. What can\u2019t be done is harnessing existing radio waves on the ground. There is too little energy in them to produce any useful amount and in the rare locations where the radio waves are strong it is dangerous to live. ",

Also, we don\u2019t always one energy form into another energy directly, sometimes they go through intermediate processes. ",
