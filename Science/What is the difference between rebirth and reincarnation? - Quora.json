            "answer_text": "In a nutshell, the differences are that - Reincarnation is the continuation of the individual\u2019s person / essence / soul, living in one human body after another. This is sometimes called transmigration (movement) of the soul. Rebirth is the continuation of an individual\u2019s behaviours and karmic tendencies only - after death. It is not the continuation of the person. Rebirth, is the belief in the continuity of karmic tendencies from one life to another. Buddhism teaches that life continues after death. Rebirth in a future existence is not the continuation of a past personality. It is seen as a fresh start. All animals, plants, people and even stars continue in the eternal cycle of birth and death. Rebirth allows the individual no choice over their next life. It is entirely determined by the state of their karmic lessons. They return again to 'sow what they reaped' in their previous lives. Reincarnation allows free choice in that the individual is helped to choose who their next parents will be. They are chosen with a view to presenting the individual with the opportunities needed to learn spiritual lessons and improve their karma. So although rebirth and reincarnation both have the same goal of learning lessons, rebirth is automatically dictated by an individual's previous actions and reincarnation is the voluntary choice to return and improve. Repeated reincarnations can ultimately lead to the purity of mind and soul that no longer requires further lives to be lived as humans. However, once a great master has attained this elevated state, they often continue to return in order to free sentient beings from suffering on the earth plane. This selfless continuation may be as a very quiet and humble person or as a prominent world leader - both are able to affect great changes in large numbers of people. ",

            "answer_text": "While Talking about Reincarnation and I use that word, Rebirth also sounds the same\u2026here is why. Rebirth in a future existence is not the continuation of a past personality. In reincarnation, no one has the past personality. It is a new one. I think the problem people have is understanding that there are Human Life which is a fresh one and the soul which is the old one. How you divide the words is your to do. Whatever you want to name - my soul has the past personality but I do not. (that can be argued upon by my parents and friends who are in Heaven) The catch is what soul does, we do not know. It is a monitor of life. Some times, strong Souls can inject personality to the Human Life. So, it is a complicated process that we Human Beings do not understand. Why Soul and Human Life? Over millions of years, Soul grows stronger and holds all the data like a large companies computer database. The small Human just does local stuff with nurture managed from the parents and locals, to get the job done. This is to reduce the level of activities between Heaven and Earth. The catch is one can have the past personality in the future as both Living system and soul combine themselves over time. In fact, you can not get Moksha without the complete connection. And you can not have Moksha for at least Six Billion years\u2026because your smartphone is not at the same level as those super computers in the mean time. Do not waste your money on it unless to are looking for a Imbecile position. Bottom Line is Be Good\u2026Love and Prosper.
