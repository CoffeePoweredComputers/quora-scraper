            "answer_text": "An atom is the Greek definition. The smallest way an Element can be divided without it no longer being an Element. The Greek word atom means indivisible, which is why you see the word also in computer science, referring to the smallest division of a program instruction. The Greek proof of atom proves molecules not atoms but that is because they did not understand elements. Elements are formed from a combination of atomic particles. Since the science of this is complex, I will just describe the simplest Hydrogen atom, where the Hydrogen molecule is two of them joined together. The Hydrogen atom is one electron and one proton, where the electron has most of the non-inertial energy and the proton has the inertial energy (also known as rest mass, because mass is equivalent to energy). In other words the electron can be said to be moving and the proton can be said to be the lowest possible energy state of that electron. Note already how I am confusing you because I am saying that the \u201cposition\" of the \u201cparticle\" with the greatest inertial mass (rest mass) - the proton \u2014 is equivalent to an energy \u201cstate\". But you did ask the question, and I know that you don't want either the mathematical explanation of the Physics professor or the dumbed down explanation of the Physics teacher. Now for how the photon is part of this. The electrons in atoms have energy states. You can call this energy \u201cquantum energy\" because the value of energy is an integer multiple of a fixed quantity of energy. You can call this energy \u201crelative\" because all non-inertial energy is relative to something else, OTHER than the energy of a photon (or of the other particles equivalent to photons in that they TRANSFER (although if you know the math the better word is mediate or transit) energy. You can call this energy \u201ckinetic\" because the electrons are \u201cmoving\" and because it is convenient to treat electrons as moving with kinetic energy, when we say that they have quantum energy. You can call this energy \u201cwave energy\" because it is convenient to treat the \u201corbits\" of these \u201cmoving electrons\" as standing waves, and because there are two types of math used to describe the energy of the electron and the energy of the photon. Wave and Particle. But the (by now) very simple way to explain the photon follows on from this. A photon is just the smallest possible way to divide the energy of that electron. And this energy is what is TRANSITED or MEDIATED between two electrons, even when they are in the same atom. Yes, you heard that right. A photon transits between two electrons in different atoms, separated by a relative distance of about 300000000 metres, and the relative time for the TRANSIT is about one second. That is because the photon represents a loss of energy (and hopefully by now you can see that all energy, other than inertial) is relative to something else) of the first electron and a gain of energy of the second electron. Note to PhD in Physics getting very upset with me for not mentioning how there is a lot more to this, or anything else I have left out. Yes I know. I think he gets the general idea. So in summary the atom is where the photon usually comes from, or usually goes to, when energy is transferred from one atom to another. But photons involve the acceleration of electrons. By acceleration I mean either going faster or slower, and hopefully by now you can see that faster or slower don't mean what you used to think they meant. If we accelerate electrons in a vacuum, the photons are x-rays. Very high frequency \u201cwaves\" If we accelerate electrons in the metal skin of a radio transmitter, the photons are radio waves. Low to very low frequency \u201cwaves\". If we accelerate the electrons in the atom by the atom having a temperature higher than absolute zero, the photons are infrared radiation. If we accelerate the electrons so that the radiation of the \u201cwave\" or \u201cparticle\" is visible, we call this light. To see photons up close and personal at a wide range of frequencies, rub your feet on the carpet and then touch the metal doorknob. The spark will generate photons that can be seen, that can be detected by the very small circuits in your smartphone (which is why they have to be designed to ignore them), and that can be felt \u2014 because photons transfer energy from the knob to your hand. The main thing to understand, in my very difficult to understand answer, to your question, which is a lot better than many people who have just \u201cheard of\u201d photons or atoms would think, is that photons, just like the \u201cwaves\" we can say that light, radio, and x-rays are also, do not really exist. Unlike the atom, that the Greeks proved existed as part of the molecule. Hopefully the other answers to your question, in combination to my more \u201catypical\" one, will help you understand and encourage you to continue your studies in mathematics. Because you really need to know the math to really understand the Physics. ",

            "answer_text": "Atom is a basic unit of matter, although not the most fundamental one. The ancients Greeks and Indians conceived the idea of atom which means indivisible. They and until almost the end of the 19th century people assumed atom to be the most fundamental and an indivisible element of the matter. Today we know atom as the most fundamental unit which preserves the properties of a certain element of the Periodic Table. But it\u2019s NOT indivisible anymore. It IS divisible and it has inner structure. Atom like any other materialistic particle can never reach the speed of light. Photon is the most basic unit of real energy (electromagnetic energy). Photon always remains at the speed of light typical to any given medium as long as the photon exists in that medium. A photon cannot exist naturally in rest or in any speed other than the speed of the light typical to any given medium. ",
