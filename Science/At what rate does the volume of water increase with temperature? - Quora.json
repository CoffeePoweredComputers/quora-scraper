            "answer_text": "  What this says is, for every change in temperature in degC, the volume will change by approximately 0.000214 m^3 for every m^3 of volume. It may change a tiny amount at lower or higher temperature (between 0 and 100C) but this number was measured with the water around 20degC. So, if I have water and a rise in temperature of, say, +30C, then the volume will change by +30(0.000214 m^3/m^3)=+0.0036 m^3/m^3. So for 1000 m^3 of water, the volume change for a temperature rise of +30C will be 1000 m^3 x +0.0036 m^3/m^3= +3.6 m^3. The table above was lifted from EngineeringToolBox.com.
