The so-called \u201cnew\u201d organ, the mesentery (aka omentum), has been known for centuries. It was one of the very first things identified in the abdomen by the first anatomists who did human dissections, in fact. But we had not previously defined the mesentary as an organ before, which is what we have now decided to do. ",

Few people realize that their skin is an organ as well. Nothing has really changed, no mutant superpowers, just another trick question for license exams for medical professionals and a new Final Jeopardy question. ",
