First of all we all got to know who is selling land on moon.. moon is not a private property of any body ..what do you think who is selling land on moon ? United States? Cause they were the first one how landed on moon in 1969. No.. no one gives this right to United States.. then who is selling land on moon .. In 1967 there was an agreement which is signed by more than 100 countries now , outer space treaty. Article II of treaty States\"outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies,is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty,by means of use of occupation ,or by any other means\" But then a man comes in 1980 ,Dennis hope. who think ,no nation can claim but why can't he claim moon as is own property.(he isn't a nation) he send a letter to United States for this but United States Never replied. Then he started lunar embassy which is nothing but fraud... From last 40 years he is selling land on moon, Mars and Venus.anyone can buy a deed to land on the moon right now. The Lunar Registry (\"Earth's leading lunar real-estate agency\") sells such deeds on its website for about $20 an acre. Doyle says that some kind of lunar governing body is necessary to recognize and enforce property rights, but no such body exists. Now you all know who is selling moon's land.. But does moon has atmosphere or water? Lunar water is water that is present on the Moon. Liquid water cannot persist at the Moon's surface, and water vapor is decomposed by sunlight, with hydrogen quickly lost to outer space.Just as the discovery of water on the moon transformed our textbook knowledge of Earth's nearest celestial neighbor, recent studies confirm that our moon does indeed Have an atmosphere consisting of some unusual gases, including sodium and potassium, which are not found in the atmospheres of Earth, Mars or Venus. Now the question comes why do shah rukh Khan buys land on moon? Shah Rukh Khan revealed that an Australian women buys a piece of land on the moon for the actor every year. She has bought several acres of land on the arid landscape over the year and the actor receives certificates for it every year from the Lunar Republic Society. CHAYAN KURRA. Did you know why there in some countries there is right hand drive and in some left and drive? Chayan Kurra's answer to Why do foreign countries have left hand drive while India has right hand drive?
