            "answer_text": "It lets you draw pretty shapes! Eh, drawing structures can actually be a bit of a pain(especially for any biological molecules, even the smallest). But yes, you will be very happy in an orgo course if you like this, since your notes will be like 80-90% structures! It really is interesting in a way - you learn all sorts of cool ways organic molecules interact. And how to think through reaction mechanisms that just \u201cmake sense\u201d when you finally really get the idea of nucleophiles and electrophiles. You learn to understand all sorts of biology if your class has a teeny bit of biochemistry like mine. Understanding biology is my favorite thing! And really, it's pretty darn fascinating to understand just how much sense it actually makes. You learn why certain things are explosive. That's always fun! You even learn a bit about making meth!(that was literally an exam question for the second exam, no joke.) So you can always go Breaking Bad if you have to! It's pretty intellectually stimulating in a way that general chemistry simply never was. The only chemistry class where I could say \u201cI like learning about this\u201d. This is what my orgo professor put on the last page of our final, which sums it up really, really well. Anyone who's taken orgo would understand.  Best chart ever! :) if that doesn't make it seem fun, what will? ",

            "answer_text": "Well it depends on the person eventually. I personally enjoy organic chemistry because of it's unpredictable and elusive nature. As many chemists say 'Its not the same on paper and in the lab'. You might be able chalk out the most 'beautiful' synthetic route on paper, but that stubborn thing sometimes just doesn't work in the lab. Then you rethink, rewrite and retry and in that journey you may end up hitting a jackpot by unraveling a totally unknown transformation. Especially for doctoral students, Organic chemistry never fails to surprise them. The road is rarely the same as it appears on the map of organic synthesis It can be gruelling and intense both physically and mentally, but for a chemist it's always a valuable learning experience to be able to understand how things work at a molecular level. The Nobel laureate Akira Suzuki never imagined that the chemistry he developed would be an integral part of a plethora of medicinally important compounds (especially anaesthetics). (Note: my answer is biased towards synthetic organic chemistry) ",
