            "answer_text": "You can work in quality control, quality assurance, product development, research and development, food safety, food security (different from safety in that you must find ways to assure a constant supply of food in areas where they are the regularly see famine). You can work in post-harvest storage, post-harvest drying. Also can work with minimizing food waste, and find ways to use the inevitable food waste. A food science degree makes you a scientists first and foremost - not a nutritionist, not an engineer, not a dietician. Consequently, any scientist position in a food industry is open to you. As you can see it does get quite diverse. But it will not allow you to design processes (that's for engineers), or be a major player in health concerns (reserved to nutritionists), nor will you be trained to help people with particular diets or weight loss plans (reserved for dieticians). However, you would be well suited to develop the latest greatest food product. To research a new way of measuring or processing food. Research technologies and methods for reducing food waste in poor countries. Many food scientists I know did a double major with nutrition. It is not necessary, but they felt it kept more doors open. I personally did not enjoy the nutrition aspects, but others love it. A double major is difficult, so choose wisely should you decide on that route. ",
