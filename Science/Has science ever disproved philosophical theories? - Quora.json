            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t much in philosophy that can be disproved. Some ideas are no longer popular or haven\u2019t been found to useful or maybe seem hard to reconcile with other things we have learned. Scientists no longer accept mind-body dualism, an idea that had been popular among philosophers for many centuries. The philosopher Descartes is famous for this idea. He did develop logical arguments though the idea probably goes back to Plato and Aristotle.[1] [2] [3]  The exact formulation of this idea has varied over time, but the usual version is that mind and matter are fundamentally different from each other. The mind is somehow immaterial though it may interact with the matter in our body or maybe act in parallel with the matter in our body. Neuroscience and behavioral science hasn\u2019t produced evidence for an immaterial mind. Our thoughts, feelings, dreams, and desires seem to be the product of our brains. There aren\u2019t any experiments showing that we must accept the existence of an immaterial mind. My belief in God is nothing more than neurons firing and releasing neurotransmitters through various regions of the cerebral cortex. In fact, the neurophysiology of religious experience is a perfectly ordinary subdiscipline.[4] [5]Here\u2019s a picture of brain regions activated by prayer.[6]  I understand that most academic philosophers today are now monists; they accept that the mind and body are the same substance and that our mental life is the activity of our brains. Of course, there\u2019s no such thing as proof in philosophy. Some academic philosophers and many ordinary people remain convinced that mind and matter are entirely different substances and that our everyday conscious experience can\u2019t be reduced to the electrical and chemical activity of cells in our heads. This guy, who is pretty smart, thinks that it makes sense to distinguish between mind and body:[7] [8]  Footnotes[1] Dualism \u2013 My MOOC experiences[2] Dualism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)[3] Dualism versus Materialism[4] Association of posterior EEG alpha with prioritization of religion or spirituality: a replication and extension at 20-year follow-up[5] The neurophysiological correlates of religious chanting[6] How Does Neuroscience Explain Spiritual and Religious Experiences?[7] Which of these do you agree with? -  ppt download[8] Dualism & Reductionism: David Chalmers\u2019s \u201cFacing Up to the Problem of Consciousness\u201d",

            "answer_text": "The most well preserved ancient theories in philosophy are found in the complete works of Aristotle. In all his works on nature, he considers himself to be doing both science and philosophy. There was no distinction at that point in time. You can see him trying to logically deduce causes from observable phenomena, which is one of the core methods in the empirical sciences. These conclusions are continually revisable because we are continually making new observations, and finding new ways to make new observations, which fit or do not fit our causal explanations. So while the reasoning and logic has essentially stayed the same, I would be surprised to find a single theory in Aristotle\u2019s natural philosophy that has not been sufficiently \u201cdisproved\u201d. Throughout the history of natural philosophy since Aristotle, you will find the same pattern of theories being revised or disproved by new observations, especially when we get new technologies which open up the sorts of observations we can make, such as the telescope for astronomy and microscope for biology. In physics, Newton considered himself first and foremost a natural philosopher. It took another natural philosopher, Einstein, to \u201cdisprove\u201d in scientific terms, Newton\u2019s theories. The distinctions between natural philosophy and science are so fuzzy that the question amounts to \u201chas science ever disproved a scientific theory?\u201d, or the equivalent, \u201chas natural philosophy ever disproved a theory in natural philosophy?\u201d, or any combination thereof which may sound slightly more meaningful, but essentially mean the same thing. There is really no useful distinction to be made between natural philosophy and science in terms of getting the work done with which they both aim to get done. They aim for the same target: explanation of natural observable phenomena. They use the same methods: observation and inference. ",

Contrary to what Einstein thought, God does indeed play with dice. The subatomic realm is irreducibly probabilistic. There\u2019s also this proves determinism on certain common understandings of determinism. That\u2019s just to start. Things that seem utterly inconceivable to people in one situation at a particular time turn out to be true, and sometimes come to be seen as obvious to people later. Lots of people still find quantum Mechanics to be deeply mysterious however. ",

It was in the 19th century that the concept of \"science\" received its modern shape with new titles emerging such as biology and physics.

So much for any sector of the economy being able to self-police its own ethical questions.

The fundamental tenet of falsification, one of the most popular philosophies is that scientific theory cannot be proven, because it is induced from data. But the most important theories of the 20th century can be derived from fundamental principle, Hume\u2019s principle of uniformity in nature, that the fundamental behaviours of matter are always and everywhere the same. Without this principle, there is no science because if the behaviour of matter could change observation would be meaningless. Einstein showed that relativity follows, not from data, but from the way in which we define distances. Von Neumann showed that quantum mechanics follows from the general property that we can give a probabilistic prediction for a measurement result. These theories do indeed disprove the fundamental tenets of falsification. ",

That is why philosophical theories are often rejected by engineers and philosophers can reject technical theories. The downside is that philosophers and engineers don't really like each other, even though scientists, researchers are more advanced engineers, who also have some philosophy in mind. ",
