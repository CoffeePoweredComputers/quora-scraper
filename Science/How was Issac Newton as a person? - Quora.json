            "answer_text": "Hello Vishal, I think no one can answer your question for two reasons. i) Today, there is NO one knows him personally to answer your question. ii) When two or more persons are there who know a particular person, then each one will have his / her opinion. You cannot take any answer as authentic one. But, in my opinion, he was a great, honest thinker. This is evident in the fact that he was not fully satisfied with his famous laws of motion - stated when he was in mid-40s. Tweenty years later (in mid-60s) he made some statements which contradicted his own statements in his laws of motion. Therefore Anthony P. French (famous for his famous book Newtonian Mechanics) wrote a letter to the edito of Am. J. Phys. (January 1984), title: Did Newton forget his own laws of motion? However, I did not agree with Prof. French, because my own research in physics education. In my opinion, Newton did exceptional introspection of laws and realized a lacuna in them. I have expressed the disagreement with Prof. A.P. French in a letter to the editor of School Science Review, UK, # 368, March 2018. Title of my letter is: Motion: natural and artificial. Therefore, in my opinion, Newton was the greatest honest, ardent thinker. In fact, personally I have greatest respect for Newton. ",
