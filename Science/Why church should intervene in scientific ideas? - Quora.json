            "answer_text": "It shouldn\u2019t, and vice versa. Granted, some bigger churches like the Catholic church have made great efforts to adopt principles in science and has gone as far as having a branch devoted to the possibility of extraterrestrial life and has started changing their viewpoint on homosexuality, but there is still that line that divides faith and science. Science also has no place in faith as science relies wholly on physical evidence and concrete proof for anything to exist. There have been scientific theories that align with creationism, but that still is totally dependent of physical evidence. Because science will never be able to fully prove where the very first atoms and molecules came from and religion will never be able to fully prove there is an intelligent creator, there will only be conflict between them. Science and faith should be mingled, but ultimately separate as they are very different and often contrary to one and other. ",

            "answer_text": "Why church should intervene in scientific ideas? There is a problem with the assumption behind this question and dozens of others like it. It is the long outdated idea that science is confined to one country, or a small number of countries with more or less common cultures. Churches might intervene in science in the USA but scientists doing similar work in Germany, Japan, China, India or several other countries may never hear of it and may ignore it if they do. India and China have pumping out science graduates by the tens of thousands every year and their names have been appearing on scientific papers for at least 20 years now. I was not surprised at the CRISPR baby from China, what was a surprise is that China apparently had regulations against such practice. ",
