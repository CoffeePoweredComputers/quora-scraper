            "answer_text": "18th group elements, the noble gases like radon, xenon etc already have filled shells, that is , they\u2019ve already achieved what\u2019s called the octet configuration. Ultimately they are stable, and do not have to worry about gaining or losing their electrons, hence their electron affinity. ",
