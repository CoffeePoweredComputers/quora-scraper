            "answer_text": "If human nature was better, we could achieve communism without even calling it communism. First distinguish state communism, which has tended toward brutal, near genocidal dictatorship (in the cases of Stalin and Mao for example), and non-state communism. The latter I\u2019d call a system of communitarian social ethics with overly social utopian economic principles found in Fourie especially. \u201cCommunism, utopian and Scientific is a good exposition of these sources. The ethic of such non-state communism is very close to the ethic believed to exist in early Chirstian communities where private property was shared and equality striven for, especially for women. This is why there is such a literature of Christian socialism such as found in Catholic social theory, and later, liberation theology. Marc\u2019s writings in the 1844 manuscripts lay out some of the ideas involved, before he decided on state communism and his statist and deterministic socioeconomic views. If only the anarchist Bakunin had beat him out at the First International for leadership of the communist party. ",

            "answer_text": "Theoretically, communism is a classless system where essentially everything including all means production belongs to the public, a complete inverse to complete capitalism, the entire economy is controlled by privately-owned companies (who were often monopolies). (definition based off of Karl Marx theories) However, Karl Marx\u2019s theoretical communism has never successfully been implemented in society, because there is no \u201cblueprint\u201d for a successful working communist society. As Thomas Hobbes (an Enlightenment philosopher from Britain) believes, \u201call humans are naturally greedy and evil\u201d. Humans are not great at sharing. Communism is solely based on sharing. You see, it\u2019s not exactly ideal. BUT if human behavior was different, and humans were less greedy (as not as stupid as some previous communist leaders have been), a Marxist communistic society could be successful. Yake Sakura ",

            "answer_text": "It would depend upon how different and in what ways. If people did not fall so easily into behaving greedily or in self-serving ways, perhaps Communism might work. If people did not need to be mobilized to act in the interests of their communities, perhaps communism might work. If human leaders did not allow power to corrupt their decision-making processes with power seeking, perhaps Communism might work. If large nations could organize themselves without strong central governments, communism, as we have seen it implemented, would not even be necessary as a democratic socialism would accomplish everything communism promises to deliver.

Would probably require a world without evolution.We are all addicted to work to the point that we are willing to compete for the toughest jobs, or obsessed with minimalist consumption, or both.We are all addicted to volunteer work/charity.Unfortunately it's difficult to get the later two without the second. If the world didn't have the laws of conservation of mass and energy, things might be different, but in this universe, communism is screwed. ",

I cease to be amazed at all the convoluted logic contortions that the leftists put us through to try to justify socialism and communism and make excuses for why they have not worked out well. Why keep trying to make them work? The world appears to have settled on various forms of capitalism as the one that works and produces wealth. If we need to raise taxes and to provide for those who cannot provide for themselves, we simply need to vote and then do it if we have the votes. ",

The difference is that communists think government leaders are better, while capitalists think corporate leaders are better. Both of them are wrong. Life\u2019s more complicated than that. And if you think I\u2019m wrong about the capitalists, then you know nothing of the drive to monopoly. They always cover up that one as much as they can, but it\u2019s the central goal of all capitalists \u2014 to kill or eat the competition until there is no competition left. Contrary to the propaganda, capitalism destroys competition. That\u2019s the point. ",
