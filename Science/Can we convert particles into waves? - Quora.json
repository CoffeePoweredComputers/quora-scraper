            "answer_text": "Yes, of course! Just stop looking at them. When de\u2019Broglie gave his famous equation describing a particle's wave nature \u03bb=hp\u03bb=hp Where \u03bb\u03bb is the wavelength of the \u201cParticle-Wave\u201d, (h) is the Planck's constant and (p) is the momentum of the particle. It baffled the whole Physics community and the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics brought some mind boggling phenomenon to our knowledge . This is one of those. Let\u2019s see what it means: You have an Electron gun  Let\u2019s say it ejects a stream of electrons. And you set up a board with 2 narrow slits and let the electrons pass through it. Then you can observe where the electron is by placing a Fluorescent screen, which lights up at a place where electron hit\u2019s it. What will be the observed pattern? Like this:  After all electrons are particles and they will travel in the straight line, RIGHT?  It will look something like this:  Why? Because they were behaving like waves when you were not observing them, remember the Young's Double slit experiment and the fringe pattern observed on the screen which established the wave nature of the light?   This experiment similarly, explains the wave nature of electrons. However, if you observe each electron individually, it will still behave like the particle. It will still strike the screen at one single place, the fring pattern will develop over time, like this:  But wait there is more.This phenomenon is not only observed in a stream of electrons, as you might think that they must collide( interfere ) with each other to form this pattern. Even if your electron gun emits 1 electron at a time, it\u2019s \u201cMatter-wave\u201d will interfere with itself.As if single electron is going through both slits!!! (Please don\u2019t be confused, Electron as a particle will pass through only one slit, its Wave function however will pass through both)  But as soon as you try to observe this electron, its wave function will collapse and it will start behaving like a particle. Particle into Wave is Easy, RIGHT? ",

A matter posses both particle and wave nature simultaneously. However, only one nature is prominently expressed in a given time which depends on its interaction with surrounding\u200b at that moment. In macroscopic level generally matter express its particle characteristics and in sub atomic level wave nature is prominent. The best examples are : Photons which sometimes behaves as wave and another moment as particles.Similarly, electrons posses both particle and wave nature.So, these doesn't change nature but, a particular nature is prominently displayed due to its interaction with surrounding. During photoelectric emission photons and electrons shows particle nature and during radiation they display wave nature. For any further doubts, details or suggestions comments are heartily welcomed.

            "answer_text": "I don't know why you want to convert particles into waves , because they already are waves , What?!! Yeah you read it right , they are already waves . But didn't I mention that they are particles ? Yes , you sure did and I didn't disagree to that statement , all I am telling is that being a particle does not make it not wave or being a wave does not make it not particle . That was really really confusing . I would have been amazed if you weren't because greatest physicists ever to have been born couldn't digest it themselves !! How we mere mortals listening to another of us believe such nonsense when giants like Planck had a hard time accepting the fact provided as a spoon feeding through physics derivations by other physics giants who themselves could not believe what they saw!! So how I would like to explain you this mysterious problem is by taking a simple but mind blowing experiment , I hope you know about Young's double slit experiment , if you don't, you still have nothing to worry about , this experiment shows that if a monochromatic beam of light is incident on two slits ( close to size of wavelength of light) then they form an interference pattern on the screen behind them , simply put if a single colour light is incident on two small holes then you'll observe some sort of stripe pattern on a screen behind them . This result proves that light is a wave . Yeah , remember that , it proves it .  (Here your S1 is the light source and S2 is the cardboard with holes in it) Source : wikipedia.org Now the interesting experiment at last , this was conducted after proving the statement I told you but this is an undeniable evidence of the proof , now what scientists did is they placed the same apparatus as Young's double slit but our beam is not light , guess what, they are particles !! You might know them very well , they are electrons . Now if I ask you the result beforehand , you are sure that there should be two spots on the screen , each of them indicating the hole position from where they came in , that's what the scientists wanted to see and believe but no !! This is what they saw  Source : Hot Questions - Stack Exchange The photos show the progress as each of the electrons passed one by one . These pictures have more to them , but for this answer it is enough to show that electrons have wave nature as well!! ( If you haven't figured out , that is the same pattern you got for light for proving it a wave). And another interesting experiment to note is the one which earned Einstein noble prize ( it is not relativity !) , the experiment is photoelectric effect , it has too much theory for an average non physics student to understand , but what this experiment proves is , yeah you guessed it right and remember as well that this experiment proves that light is having particle nature!!! I know , this is extremely bizzare and irritating experience to have for a seemingly simple question , but some things turn out that way , we can't help it . After seeing the evidence of particles being waves and waves being particles scientists agreed to a fact that there is no absolute particle and no absolute wave , and everything is both , this state of existence is called superposition , and mind you , you might come across people telling about substances being particles and waves at the same time as an explanation for superposition which is entirely wrong!! No , they aren't both at the same time , they are just in a different state which we have not experienced in our daily lives and hence cannot imagine , properly putting, the terms wave and particle are actually ambiguous terms as there is no such thing as a wave and particle in real world !! There is only superposition that's all . You can imagine superposition as something which makes the substance behave as a particle when it is required and as a wave when it is required , but again , it is not both particle and wave at the same time. Hope I was successful in showing you a clearer picture of reality as seen by physics , if you have any doubts please put a comment. Thanks for asking. ",
