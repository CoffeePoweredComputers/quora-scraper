            "answer_text": "The problem with this question is that [math]E=mc^2[/math] (where m is the inertial mass of the object and E its so-called rest energy) is not really a \"law\". A law of physics connects two (or more) quantities that can be independently measured, thus the law can be tested by experiment. In contrast, this particular formula simply expresses the recognition that rest mass is a form of energy. The two quantities E and m are not independently measured: they describe the same thing. The formula doesn't describe a process whereby mass is turned into energy; the formula simply says that mass is energy and vice versa. That said, there are processes that turn energy (as we usually think of energy) into measurable inertial mass. For instance, at least in principle, when you heat an object, you can measure the increase in its mass due to the extra thermal energy added to, and stored within the object. Measuring how much extra force is needed to accelerate the heated object at a given rate amounts to measuring the increase in its inertial mass. If we find that this increase is not consistent with the thermal energy added to the object, we would have observed a violation. ",

            "answer_text": "To summarize, there is no evidence that this relation is ever violated. To give a really good answer it is necessary to clearly define what we mean by mass and energy.  I'll try to use as little math as possible.   In classical physics the mass of an object is identical to its rest mass.Also, in classical physics, there is no concept of converting mass to energy.Mass and energy are conserved separately. Einstein's work corrects this. In special relativity, the mass increases when it is moving in relation to the reference frame in which it is measured.  It is this concept of mass that we will use.   This measures the inertia of the object.  (In general relativity the inertial and gravitational masses are taken to be equivalent; there is a large body of experimental evidence that this is the case) OK then, now that we have the ground rules, let's take an example so that we can see how it works out in practice. Let's assume that an object is free from any field potentials (we'll discuss that in a minute). Also that it is moving at constant velocity in our frame of reference. A. The mass of the object is essentially composed of two parts then:1. the rest mass2. the increase in mass due to motion. B. The energy of a object is composed of 1. the energy that would be produced if the mass of the object at rest were totally converted to energy.2. the kinetic energy (energy of motion). Note that B.1. was unknown in classical physics. In each case, the constant of proportionality is [math] c^{2}[/math].  The total relativistic mass is the sum of the A.1 and A.2.  The total energy, the sum of B.1 and B.2 is the total relativistic energy.  In relativity, the conservation of mass and the conservation of energy are essentially the same thing.  (This bears on Harman Kahlon's post--I'll get to that in a minute). There's ample experimental evidence of converting mass (A.1) to energy (B.1), atomic energy, particle physics etc. ====== This will probably satisfy most people,and you may want to stop reading at this point, but I need to add on a couple of additional points to be strictly accurate. :) First off, if the object is subject to a force field so that it has potential energy, special relativity demands that the potential energy will also show up as additional inertial mass. Secondly, Harman Kahlon's post is best understood in four dimensional Minkowski space (with signature +---).  This gets a little technical. The four momentum is given by [math] p^{2}c^{2} = E^{2} - m_{0}^{2}c^{4}[/math]. (This is a rearrangement of Harman Kahlon's  equation, if I have not screwed up the Latex :) ). So that the energy composes the time-component of the four momentum.  The three space-components of the four momentum are the classical momentum.  In this formulation the conservation of mass, the conservation of energy--and-- the conservation of momentum are all results of one equation!   Note that in point of nomenclature, m_{0} is the rest mass, not the total relativistic mass. ",
