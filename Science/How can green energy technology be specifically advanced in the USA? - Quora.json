            "answer_text": "Going green is like Medicare for all. There was a survey taken of medical providers ask about if all their payments were at the Medicare rate what would happen. They did not find any that would stay open. Years ago I listened to a plastic surgeon talking about Medicare rates. He stated that one day he was in surgery repairing an auto accident victim\u2019s face for 13 hours which is the most profitable of all the things he does but because it was medicare it did not cover the office expenses for that day. If every house had enough solar to generate all the energy they needed in a year there would not be enough ratepayers to keep the utilities in business. Grid-tied solar which is the most cost-effective solar installation relies on the grid to be their backup generator and battery. The grid allows for winter months shortfalls to be paid off by summer overproduction for a grid-connection fee. In reality, all the grid-tied solar in California that I know is heavily subsidized by the ratepayers that do not have solar. That subsidy is way more than the 30% tax credit. My utility has been exploring how much grid-tied systems are costing them and one conclusion is they should be charging $20 a month for each 1kW nameplate DC. That would bring my bill back to levels before solar. Buried in the electric rates is a utility operation cost. If you produce your own energy you are not covering the utility operations cost. Without the utility, my solar would have cost me 8 times what it did. If it would have cost 10% more I probably would not have installed it. The more green energy that is installed the harder it is to keep cheap baseload energy online. Germany has shut down it nukes plants because coal-fired plants can track the energy demand changes better. In effect, the more solar they install the more coal they burn. The true cost of running a utility is greater than 5 times the cost of energy. There are times I sell energy for > 37 cents that the utility could replace for < 3 cents. Even with estimates that my solar cost 4 times as much as if it were installed on a solar farm, I do not see how solar farms can be competitive even if they had a free battery backup to make up for when the sun does not shine.  Had They Bet On Nuclear, Not Renewables, Germany & California Would Already Have 100% Clean Power There is also an estimate that it takes more diesel fuel and electrical energy to grow corn and crate ethanal than the energy the ethanol will produce.

            "answer_text": "I have spent many years on this exactly question. For most of the last 35 years I spent all my time advancing efficiency, because wind and solar were not cost-effective in most places until recently. Wind and utility scale solar have become cos-effective in most places in the last ten years. Most of that is due to falling costs, and most of the costs have fallen the most in the last two to four years. Everywhere in the U.S. and probably in most of the world can now build new wind and new utility scale solar that produces power for less money, including capital costs, than most existing coal and natural gas and nuclear plants, excluding capital costs. So to answer your question, you need to learn quite a lot. Which of these technologies is best to promote where you live? How are they being promoted now? Who is resisting. What are the barriers? In most cases the action is at the state legislative and regulatory level, although some cities are getting pretty smart. For efficiency, the fastest and most powerful way to speed up efficiency is to give the utilities a contractual commitment to share a small fraction of verified net savings with them, by allowing them to recover additional money. Efficiency saves so much money that the small fraction of savings is often viewed only as a fraction of program cost, which makes it seem like a lot of money. The exact amount needed is different in every state. In Ohio, where I live, we give the utilities 13% of verified net savings, but we pay them in net present dollars the year after the program action. That means they only get 5 - 6% of the actual dollars saved over the life of the installed measures. Still, that can be 25% or more of the program budget. It isn\u2019t like holding up protest signs at shareholder meetings. It takes some work, some time, some organizing and some commitment. But it is a lot more effective than anything else, especially because an incentive based on verified savings presumes the creation of a verification protocol, which all utilities ought to have anyways. And by doing this the utility has a solid vested interest in making the programs work well. Having the utilities on the side of clean energy is pretty much mandatory. Thinking about how it should work is real critical work. Renewables are easier to promote in some ways. That\u2019s because independent companies are eager to make profits. The Republicans have developed a strong link with the fossil and nuclear industries and in many states are opposing renewables for a variety of reasons that ignore the incredible economic benefits of building wind and utility scale solar in rural communities. Nonetheless, it is important to teach people about these benefits. Tax revenues for schools and local road maintenance can rise by leaps and bounds with some wind and solar development. Properly handled, wind and solar developments provide a hedge for farmers against bad crop years. This is easier with wind than with the conventional approach to utility scale solar because the wind leaves 95% of the land untouched, while utility scale solar occupies most of the land. Dual uses are being experimented with, but different regions will find different solutions, and joint ownership of solar land leases seems to me to be an important tool for building community support. I could write a lot more about this, but I gotta go, and I think that this makes the general principles clear enough. Find out what is working and make it work faster, where you live. Cities are not the best place to develop cheap renewables. Many people will want rooftop solar, which is not the cheapest alternative, because it is still cheaper than what they have. Cities are excellent places to develop efficiency. We have an incredible opportunity to restore the world to economic health using wind and solar and efficiency, and the early adapters are going to win the most. It will soon be obvious to everyone where this is going. Our job is to make that happen faster. ",

            "answer_text": "Green energy comes from natural sources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, plants, algae and geothermal heat. These energy resources are renewable, meaning they're naturally replenished. In contrast, fossil fuels are a finite resource that take millions of years to develop and will continue to diminish with use. Alternative energy is any energy source that does not use fossil fuels (coal, gasoline and natural gas). Renewable energy comes from natural sources that don't run out. ... The alternative energies that are already being used are solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, tidal, biomass and hydrogen.

            "answer_text": "If you ask me, US has some of the best green energy technologies. The issue in USA is politics and its effect on the funding of actual implementation of such solutions. At a time where countries are fast tracking funding to build more PV, wind-turbines and hydro-power dams, USA is going 3 steps forward 2 steps back when it comes to green energy. I am not saying there are no good examples. I think certain state level governments are world-class in funding renewable energies but overall across the country politics is hindering progress. I am also not blaming Trump or the Republicans either. I think this issue works both ways since Democrats have also been guilty of hindering such progress for the sake of putting Republicans down. If you search infrastructure funding in the USA, you will see the history of US politics hindering such developments all the ways since probably the 1970s. The Green Deal is a good idea in principle but only time will tell since the devil is in the details. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all we need a consensus for Sustsinable economy via green energy etc. However the fossil fuel co have Billions of their future revenue in the ground. This vested interest or investment is their economic security. So this grip on policy is a real limiting factor. Being realistic after many years as part of change to renewable energy. The positive trend making it possible to transform our energy systems is that many banks and investment groups are pulling back on underwriting funding to the shale oil and gas sector. This is despite record resource volumes and is due to low margins and huge investment and debt levels needed to sustain continued shale development at the bncurrent levels. This is Inconvient Truth that is lost on us due to increased production and the Hubris that results. Trust this helpful. ",
