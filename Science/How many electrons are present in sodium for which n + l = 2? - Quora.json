            "answer_text": "n is the principal quantum number and it tells the size of the orbital.n=1,2,3,4,\u2026l the azimuthal quantum number and it tells the shape of the orbital.0 for s, 1 for p, 2 for d etc.Electronic configuration of sodium is 1(s2),2(s2) 2(p6),3(d1).n+l=2,therefore n=1, not possible as l=0 is the only value, 1+0 not equal to 2.If n=2,l=0,1. l should be equal to 0 for n+l to be 2. In that case number of electrons is 2+2=4.If n=3,l=0, which is not possible to get n+l as 2.Therefore only choice is n=2 and l=0.Therefore numbers of electrons in sodium when n+l=2 is 4.",
