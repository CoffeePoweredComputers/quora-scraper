Proxima Centauri (Latin proxima, meaning \"next to\" or \"nearest to\")[12] is a red dwarf about 4.24 light-years from the Sun, inside the G-cloud, in the constellation of Centaurus.[13][14] It was discovered in 1915 by the Scottish astronomer Robert Innes, the Director of the Union Observatory in South Africa, and is the nearest known star to the Sun,[11] although it is too faint to be seen with the naked eye, with an apparent magnitude of 11.05. Its distance to the second- and third-nearest stars, which form the bright binary Alpha Centauri, is 0.237 \u00b1 0.011 ly (15,000 \u00b1 700 AU).[15] Proxima Centauri is very likely part of a triple star systemwith Alpha Centauri A and B, but its orbital period may be greater than 500,000 years.From Wikipedia.

Most recently, a planet has been found orbiting it in the star's habitable zone, but it's chances of having life are slim. It is very close to Proxima, which has frequent solar flares that are pretty dangerous to life. The distance is between 4 and 5 million miles, whish is about 20 times the distance between Earth and the Moon. The planet, called Proxima b, orbits the star every 11 days. But Proxima actually orbits a pair of large, bright stars called Alpha Centauri A and B, completing a circuit every 550,000 years or so. Physically, Proxima is one and one half the size of the planet Jupiter, but it's mass is about 128 times Jupiter. ",
