            "answer_text": "\u201cHow do you know?\u201d One of my favourite principles is one of the simplest: don\u2019t take anyone\u2019s word for it. This was a lot more revolutionary than it sounds. Up until a few hundred years ago, people would learn science from the classics, on the assumption that Plato (et al) knew what he was talking about. I mean, doctors were bleeding people to make them better for two thousand years, believing it helped cure conditions because they\u2019d been taught it did. It wasn\u2019t until people with modern scientific principles behind them came along as asked \u201chang on, how do we know it works?\u201d that we discovered that actually, it does not work. Not only that, but it\u2019s actively harmful. Don\u2019t take anyone\u2019s word for it. So one of my favourite elements of science is that you can go check everyone\u2019s working. If a claim is made, you can go look. And sometimes claims are overblown or even wrong - but the great thing here is that there are plenty of people standing ready to beat up bad studies. It doesn\u2019t mean you need to blindly accept all science (science reporting in the media is especially awful most of the time), but you can be confident that someone somewhere it checking the working. And if you\u2019re ever interesting in anything, you\u2019ve probably got access to more detail that you could ever want. The newer the finding, the more likely it is to be overturned - and most new findings are, thanks to this principle! But as a theory or concept becomes more well established, it means that more people have confirmed it, and no-one has come up with any serious problems, and you can be confident it\u2019s probably pretty much right (even if you expect a lot of updating, refining, and even the occasional massive shift in understanding). So when people say \u201cthe earth orbits the sun\u201d, you don\u2019t necessarily need to know how to prove that - as long as someone within the modern principles of science showed this fact as true, you can have a decent level of confidence it\u2019s true. But even if you doubt it - well, you can say \u201cshow me your working\u201d and check it for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Another principle is called falsifiability. Can the hypothesis be proven false, if indeed it is. If I hypothesize that helium is more dense than air at sea level, which we know is false, but suppose we didn\u2019t. Another scientist (using experimentation, see answer above) could *prove* that my hypothesis is false by releasing a helium filled balloon in the atmosphere at sea level and if it rises, that will prove that helium is indeed less dense than air and my hypothesis is false. My hypothesis is false, but it is scientific because it can be proven to be true, or false. Now suppose I hypothesize that God helped me pass my last science exam. Is it possible? Perhaps. But can you, or anyone including another scientist, prove that God did - or did not - help you with the exam? Maybe you just studied better than you\u2019d thought, or maybe the test had very simple questions. Or maybe a spiritual Supreme Being did help you pass the exam. Can I or anyone prove that He didn\u2019t? We can demonstrate that it is far more likely that you just knew the material (look up \u201cOccam\u2019s Razor\u201d), but we can\u2019t disprove your theory that God helped you pass \u2026.. nor can you prove that He did. Suppose I find an apple laying on the ground beneath my apple tree. You\u2019d probably suspect that it just fell from the tree. But maybe an elf put it there, or maybe a martian. I might believe with all my heart that the elf or martian put it there, but can I prove it? No, of course not. Can you prove that an elf or martian did not put it there? No, of course not. We can be reasonably sure that the apple fell though, because never in history has it been proven that an elf or a martian has put an apple under a tree to fool us. Therefore, God\u2019s intervention in your exam, or in anything else in the natural world, is not a subject for science. Nor is the existence of elves or martians, or ghosts or leprechauns or fairies. No one can prove that these things do *not* exist. The hypothesis is, therefore, neither empirically provable nor falsifiable. So the existence of God, elves, martians, etc. are mythology, and beyond the realm of science, whether or not they exist.
