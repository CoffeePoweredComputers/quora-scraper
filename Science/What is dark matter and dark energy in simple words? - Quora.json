            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my rule of thumb for physics: the longer an idea is around, the more our ability to explain it in simple language increases. For example, there was a time when General Relativity was cutting edge stuff and you could only read about it in scientific journals, but these days Quora is filled with people writing explanations using bread-making and rubber sheets with bowling balls as analogies to help explain it. Dark energy has not been around long enough for a decent explanation that satisfies theoretical physicists to be made, let alone one which will satisfy the average person. My best stab is as follows: The universe is expanding. Every single point is moving away from every other point over time. To understand how that can be so, imagine the surface of a partially inflated balloon, which we now mark with dots using a pen. If we inflate the balloon more, the distance between all the dots increases. The dots only know about things on the surface of the balloon, so to an individual dot, it just looks like all the nearby dots are rushing away, and the more distant dots are rushing away even faster. In the real universe, these dots are galaxies. Now, you might expect that at some point the balloon will be fully inflated, and that as that point is approached, the expansion will slow down (in the real universe, gravity ought to be slowing down the expansion). Imagine your surprise if you discovered that the more the balloon was inflated, the faster its rate of inflation got. Weird huh? You\u2019d have to have a think about it, and conclude that the balloon-skin has some strange property that you\u2019ve never seen before. Perhaps as it stretches, that starts some kind of chemical reaction that heats the air inside the balloon and slackens the balloon skin? Or maybe it\u2019s something else - perhaps there\u2019s a limited supply of air in the room, and as you pump it into the balloon the external pressure drops? Whatever it is, it\u2019s not something you included in your simple model of how a balloon works. All you have is your measurement that the expansion is accelerating over time, and a bunch of highly speculative theories that you don\u2019t yet have the means to test. \u2018Mysterious Something\u2019 is not a good name for the effect, so you decide to call it \u2018Dark Energy\u2019 after noting that the acceleration requires some additional energy source that you can\u2019t detect. (this is pretty much where we\u2019re up to with Dark Energy. The universe is expanding, and the expansion is getting quicker. We don\u2019t know for sure why that\u2019s happening.) Okay, so much for Dark Energy. Let\u2019s talk about Dark Matter, which has been around a lot longer as a theory and we\u2019re fairly confident we understand: Matter is just \u2018stuff\u2019. Specifically, stuff with mass, meaning it gets attracted by gravity and exerts a gravitational pull on other stuff. \u2018Stuff\u2019 is a pretty broad category. It contains coffee mugs, air, black holes, water, planets, paper-clips\u2026 all these things have mass. Clearly though, all these things have very different properties \u2014 they behave in quite different ways when you do stuff with them. Just try throwing a coffee mug and a paperclip on the ground; you\u2019ll see what I mean. A lot of these properties are complicated and to do with chemistry or the science of materials, but some are quite fundamental things to do with physics \u2014 for example, the fact that all of them respond to gravity (because they have mass). Most of the stuff we\u2019re familiar with has another fundamental property, that it responds to the electromagnetic force. \u201cNo they don\u2019t!\u201d I hear you exclaim, \u201cI can\u2019t attract a coffee mug with a magnet!\u201d. You\u2019re right, of course, but you need to look a little closer. The atoms in the coffee mug are made from positive protons and negative electrons, and they are bound together by the attraction of opposite charges. The next atom over doesn\u2019t get any closer, because the electrons push each other away. So when you drop your coffee mug on the ground, the reason it stops abruptly and destructively is because the atoms in the floor didn\u2019t budge when they came into contact with the atoms in the mug. The local repulsion of a bunch of atoms overcame the gravitational attraction of the entire Earth. Right, so what happens if we suggest that there\u2019s other types of stuff out there which don\u2019t respond to the electromagnetic force? Well, firstly it means that gravity is now the most important thing in their lives. They don\u2019t form atoms, so you won\u2019t get complicated structures, just simple particles with mass that respond to gravity and nothing else. More dramatically, these are invisible, because it turns out that light is an oscillating electromagnetic wave. Coffee mugs are opaque because the wave interacts with electrons in the atoms and doesn\u2019t keep going. Even air isn\u2019t completely transparent \u2014 if it didn\u2019t interact with light, the sky wouldn\u2019t appear blue. So this type of matter \u2014 stuff \u2014 is genuinely dark. Or, in fact, invisible. So does anything like this actually exist? Well, yes. We\u2019ve detected particles called neutrinos which act exactly like this. But there doesn\u2019t just have to be one type of stuff like that, there could be a whole bunch of different particles which act just as I\u2019ve said. Finally, observations of the actual universe tell us that there\u2019s a lot more stuff out there than we can actually see, and simulations show that to form galaxies at all we need significant amounts of invisible stuff to hold them together. What I want to convince you of is that there\u2019s nothing strange about dark matter; it\u2019s just a different type of stuff that outnumbers \u2018everyday\u2019 stuff by a factor of four, but can\u2019t clump together to form atoms or planets.

            "answer_text": "Dark matter is a hypothetical type of matter distinct from baryonic matter (ordinary matter such as protons and neutrons), neutrinos and dark energy. The existence of dark matter would explain a number of otherwise puzzling astronomical observations. The name refers to the fact that it does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation, such as light, and is thus invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Although dark matter has not been directly observed, its existence and properties are inferred from its gravitational effects such as the motions of visible matter, gravitational lensing, its influence on the universe's large-scale structure, on galaxies, and its effects in the cosmic microwave background. The standard model of cosmology indicates that the total mass\u2013energy of the universe contains 4.9% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter and 68.3% dark energy. Thus, dark matter constitutes 84.5% of total mass, while dark energy plus dark matter constitute 95.1% of total mass\u2013energy content. The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is also unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10% of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe. The most widely accepted hypothesis on the form for dark matter is that it is composed of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that interact only through gravity and the weak force. The dark matter hypothesis plays a central role in current modeling of cosmic structure formation and galaxy formation and evolution and on explanations of the anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). All these lines of evidence suggest that galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the universe as a whole contain far more matter than that which is observable via electromagnetic signals. Many experiments to detect proposed dark matter particles through non-gravitational means are under way; however, no dark matter particle has been conclusively identified. Although the existence of dark matter is generally accepted by most of the astronomical community, a minority of astronomers, motivated by the lack of conclusive identification of dark matter, argue for various modifications of the standard laws of general relativity, such as MOND, TeVeS, and conformal gravity that attempt to account for the observations without invoking additional matter. In physical cosmology and astronomy, dark energy is an unknown form of energy which is hypothesized to permeate all of space, tending to accelerate the expansion of the universe. Dark energy is the most accepted hypothesis to explain the observations since the 1990s indicating that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. Assuming that the standard model of cosmology is correct, the best current measurements indicate that dark energy contributes 68.3% of the total energy in the present-day observable universe. The mass\u2013energy of dark matter and ordinary (baryonic)matter contribute 26.8% and 4.9%, respectively, and other components such as neutrinos and photons contribute a very small amount. The density of dark energy (~ 7 \u00d7 10 \u221230 g/cm 3 ) is very low, much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies. However, it comes to dominate the mass\u2013energy of the universe because it is uniform across space. Two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant, representing a constant energy density filling space homogeneously, and scalar fields such as quintessence or moduli, dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space. Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually also included in the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to the zero-point radiation of space i.e. the vacuum energy. Scalar fields that change in space can be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant because the change may be extremely slow. High-precision measurements of the expansion of the universe are required to understand how the expansion rate changes over time and space. In general relativity, the evolution of the expansion rate is estimated from the curvature of the universe and the cosmological equation of state (the relationship between temperature, pressure, and combined matter, energy, and vacuum energy density for any region of space). Measuring the equation of state for dark energy is one of the biggest efforts in observational cosmology today. Adding the cosmological constant to cosmology's standard FLRW metric leads to the Lambda-CDM model, which has been referred to as the \"standard model of cosmology\" because of its precise agreement with observations.
