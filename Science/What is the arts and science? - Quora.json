            "answer_text": "Art and Science characterize our species. (There is some representation of behavior in other species that resembles that of human artists and scientists) These activities reflect the actions of distinctive constellations of cognitive abilities with privileged relationships (connectedness) within themselves as distinguishable parts of a whole. Of course there is significant overlap in the many processes of perception, integration, and expression that are more-or-less prioritized in their participation in their respective functions. I recently worked with an interdisciplinary research team to characterize how art and science complement each other in higher education pedagogy. We presented and discussed the work at a conference of college educators. This is our brief introduction before conference participants discussed the topic. I left the footnotes and references as they were but I\u2019m not sure if they will translate on the Quora platform. ART[i] emphasizes an individual\u2019s unique sensitivity[ii], creativity, and powers of representation.[iii] As a field, art emphasizes intuition and the sensual, and is subject to all those weaknesses of one\u2019s senses: (a) being notoriously vulnerable to illusion, confusion, and bias and (b) being of uncertain origin: that is, corresponding to systematic flaws of perception or something of purely internal origin such as imagery imposed on scotoma, visual migraine, or vivid memories evoked by ambiguous stimuli.[iv] Non-conscious knowledge (latent learning, intuition) is highly valued and is often recognized by spontaneity and impulsiveness. Reality-testing of artists emphasizes CORRESPONDENCE between an idea or contents of one\u2019s mind and an external representation. COHERENCE is the complementary form of reality-testing in which the validity of one\u2019s ideas or actions is corroborated by how well they \u201cfit in\u201d with other ideas of that individual or the ideas of others. The validity of an artist\u2019s actions or production may be provided by other people\u2019s applause or silence as representative of their shared but ineffable feelings. Art \u201cmakes a stimulus special\u201d (Dissanayake 1992[v]) and functions best by identifying and representing the \u201cessence\u201d of a constellation of ideas\u2014a selective attention to a key fragment that evokes a larger phenomenon, a focal idea that can be the attractor for many related ideas\u2014the \u201cseed\u201d around which a constellation of related ideas forms.[vi] In this it resembles ecphory: a phenomenon of memory in which an experience acts as a trigger to evoke a much larger constellation of ideas (Proustian memory). Artists learn from their experiences and deliberately or not, teach others (by examples or role-modeling, or transmitting information). The art of teaching, then, is manifest in the all-important, in-the-moment decisions effective teachers make as they intuitively, creatively, sensitively respond to students\u2019 facial expressions, posture, or comments/questions; as well as the sensations, they recognize in themselves as they seek correspondence between their students\u2019 experiences and their intentions as teachers. Teachers that do this are perceived as authentic and that authenticity both inspires students and encourages them to trust the disciplinary content. SCIENCE tells the best story it can with the best facts it has. (\u201cbest\u201d is an aesthetic decision, one of the more obvious ways art enters science). Confidence in any story (theory) about the external world is highly influenced by the integration of personally held beliefs and the beliefs of others (peers and mentors). Thus coherence\u2014the fitting together of beliefs\u2014is a privileged aspect of reality-testing in science. The contribution of consensus to coherence also results in a relative invulnerability of shared beliefs to individual differences and encourages an emphasis on objectivity and quantifiable content.[vii] Both ART and SCIENCE, then, utilize cognitive processes of AFFECT[viii] and REASON with varying authority and influence, each backed by differing proportions of the two major modes of reality-testing: CORRESPONDENCE and COHERENCE, working in lock-step to provide us with more-or-less confidence in the validity of a belief. The importance of individuality in how these processes develop and are applied is celebrated by the resurgence of interest in the phenomenology of teaching and learning. PHENOMENOLOGY emphasizes the idea that one\u2019s acquisition and creative deployment of new knowledge such as course content emerges from that individual\u2019s uniqueness. There is also a growing literature on the reliance of scientists on creative intuition, and of artists on orderly organization. In haunting resonance, William James (1911) observed, \u201c\u2026percepts [emphasizing correspondence] and concepts [emphasizing coherence] interpenetrate and melt together, impregnate and fertilize each other. Neither, taken alone, knows reality in its completeness\u2026. The world we practically live in is one in which it is impossible (except by theoretic retrospection) to disentangle the contributions of intellect from those of sense.\u201d [bracketed phrases added by authors] The science of teaching can be seen, for example, in the all-important systematic processes of preparation in which effective teachers find coherence between their intentions and an evidence-based pedagogical framework for teaching. For example, they likely think about such things as their goals and objectives, ways to overcome student difficulties, and how to align assessment with instruction. ART and SCIENCE. ... In the broad sense we intend, the processes [of art and science] are far more than relatively integrated centers of neural activity: they involve sensory input and action systems as well as extensive feedback and error-detection systems, much of which involves the body as the means of expression as well as experience (embodied and situated cognition)[ix]. Increasing the integration of cognitive abilities of students in the classroom also increases the prospect of an enduring transformative learning experience in which \u201cstudents move from knowing course content to realizing such knowledge in a manner that transforms worldviews far beyond the college and university classroom. (Greenberg et al. 2016).[x] We can capitalize on an insight of evolutionary biology which helps us conceptualize art and science as cognitive traits that participate in the adaptive function of whole individuals. To paraphrase Levins and Lewontin (1985)[xi], \u201cParts and wholes \u2026 evolve in consequence of their relationship, and the relationship itself evolves. These are the properties of things that we call dialectical: that one thing cannot exist without the other, that one acquires its properties from its relation to the other, that the properties of both evolve as a consequence of their interpenetration.\u201d[xii]  [i] ART DEFINED at least in part as GOING BEYOND the immediate practical meeting of a survival need, makes the extra effort -- time or energy (or some other currency) -- seem expendable or available in surplus. BUT in fact, it may by its uniqueness recruit a larger meaning for the act or tool or other \u201cartistic\u201d expression \u2013it communicates to deeper levels, penetrates to deeper layers of consciousness \u2013thereby facilitating a larger meaning. It may be better remembered, or remembered with more precision or accuracy by communicating an affective quality such as the feelings of the artist reflected in his enlarged commitment. It\u2019s one thing for a Paleolithic man to share a view of a woman or women with his cave-mates, another to invest precious time in shaping a Venus of Willendorf. [ii] \u201cartists are the antennae of the race\u201d\u2014Ezra Pound. Their sensations and perceptions selectively attend to important stimuli that many other people miss. [iii] \"All good art is abstract,\" Susanne Langer (1957:69); \u201c. . . every art purporting to represent involves a process of reduction. . .. This reduction is the beginning of art. . . . [it is] no less necessary when the painter is aiming at unlikeness than when he aims at life-likeness.\" -- Andre Malraux, The Voices of Silence 1953:275. [iv] e.g. scintillating scotoma (visual migraine); Charles Bonnet Syndrome: imagery affected by scotoma [v] Dissanayake, Ellen. (1992) Homo Aestheticus: Where Art Comes From and Why. New York: Free Press. Chap. 4. [vi] This is \u201credintegration\u201d \u2013the gathering (release from non-conscious resources) of ideas that participate in the concept\u2014the drawing together of related ideas of which we were not previously (consciously) aware. [vii] \u201cphysics envy\u201d term used by Joel E. Cohen (19721) Science Vol 172:674-675 in his review of Mathematics as Metaphor: Dynamical System Theory in Biology. Vol.1, Stability Theory and Its Applications. By Robert Rosen. Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1970. (\u201cPhysics-envy is the curse of biology. When somebody else has done the dirty, tedious work of showing that a mathematically formulated physical principle leads to predictions correct to a specified number of decimal places in the boring world of Euclidean 3-space with Cartesian coordinates, theoreticians and textbook writers can axiomatize, generalize, and dazzle your eyes with the most coordinate-free, cosmically invariant representations you please. The areas of learning Rosen has united by these formal analogies are provinces of Atlantis, and the deed and lot numbers of the foundations on which his analogies rest are recorded nowhere.\u201d) [viii] \u201cEmotions are not innately programmed into our brains, but, in fact, are cognitive states resulting from the gathering of information (Joseph LeDoux and Richard Brown, \"A Higher-Order Theory of Emotional Consciousness\" PNAS 2017): \"We argue that conscious experiences, regardless of their content, arise from one system in the brain,\" explains LeDoux, a professor in New York University's Center for Neural Science. \"Specifically, the differences between emotional and non-emotional states are the kinds of inputs that are processed by a general cortical network of cognition, a network essential for conscious experiences.\" As a result, LeDoux and Brown observe, \"the brain mechanisms that give rise to conscious emotional feelings are not fundamentally different from those that give rise to perceptual conscious experiences.\" \u201cExisting work posits that emotions are innately programmed in the brain's subcortical circuits. As a result, emotions are often treated as different from cognitive states of consciousness, such as those related to the perception of external stimuli. In other words, emotions aren't a response to what our brain takes in from our observations, but, rather, are intrinsic to our makeup. However, after taking into account existing scholarship on both cognition and emotion, LeDoux and Brown see a quite different architecture for emotions -- one more centered on process than on composition. They conclude that emotions are \"higher-order states\" embedded in cortical circuits. Therefore, unlike present theories, they see emotional states as similar to other states of consciousness.\u201d [ix] Embodied cognition: \"By using the term embodied we mean to highlight two points: first that cognition depends upon the kinds of experience that come from having a body with various sensorimotor capacities, and second, that these individual sensorimotor capacities are themselves embedded in a more encompassing biological, psychological and cultural context.\" \u2014 Eleanor Rosch, Evan Thompson, Francisco J. Varela: The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience pages 172\u2013173. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition; situated cognition \u201c\u2026draws a variety of perspectives, from an anthropological study of human behavior within communities of practice to the ecological psychology of the perception-action cycle and intentional dynamics\u2026\u201d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated_cognition. [x] The \u201cTransformative Learning Experience\u201d resonates with Feuerstein\u2019s idea of Structural Cognitive Modifiability: \u201cchanging cognitive structures [change also] the total universe of behaviors to which the part belongs\u2026. The individual has been changed, and once modified as a result of the intervention, a process of \u201cself-perpetuation\u201d is generated, whereby the individual continues to modify him or herself, and thus projects into the future the acquired changes.\u201d (Feuerstein 1997) [xi] Levins, Richard and Richard Lewontin (1985) The Dialectical Biologist. Harvard University Press (p.3): \u201cScientists act within a social context and from a philosophical perspective that is inherently political. Whether they realize it or not, scientists always choose sides. The Dialectical Biologist explores this political nature of scientific inquiry, advancing its argument within the framework of Marxist dialectic. These essays stress the concepts of continual change and co-determination between organism and environment, part and whole, structure and process, science and politics. Throughout, this book questions our accepted definitions and biases, showing the self-reflective nature of scientific activity within society.\u201d [xii] This interplay of parts in this evolutionary view was foreshadowed by William James: \"The intellectual life of man consists almost wholly in his substitution of a conceptual order for the perceptual order in which his experience originally comes.\u2026 Percepts and concepts interpenetrate and melt together, impregnate and fertilize each other. Neither, taken alone, knows reality in its completeness\u2026. The world we practically live in is one in which it is impossible (except by theoretic retrospection) to disentangle the contributions of intellect from those of sense. \u2013William James, Some Problems of Philosophy. (1911: 51,52). ",

            "answer_text": "Science is a tool and Art is an expression. Science is a tool used to study nature, contrary to popular belief its not an authority or an entity , which has an opinion. Its a method or a tool which ensures the findings are verifiable, reproducible and able to make predictions(which again can be confirmed), all this by independent people, without any preconceptions. Art on the other hand is an expression to  portray your thoughts in any form. The implications or the outcomes of science can be said to be Art, for example a car, a building, even a painting,even poems( in terms of how linguistics works). All study subjects under science are not art in there own terms(since they are mere tools). But the outcomes can be art like a beautiful mathematical equation. Its like asking the difference between a hammer/chisel and a statue. :) ",
