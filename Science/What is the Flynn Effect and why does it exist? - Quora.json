            "answer_text": "Several studies have confirmed a slight reversal of the famous Flynn-Effect. In the 1980s James R. Flynn discovered that throughout the 20th century IQ scores had been increasing by about 3 points per decade. This effect might have been due to increasingly stimulating environments for toddlers and little children. However, more and more studies tend to find a reversal of the Flynn-Effect (e.g. here). There are many interesting hypotheses about its causes and I would like to add my own. IQ is correlated with the personality trait \u201copenness\u201d. Markus Jokela (2012) has found in a study that Higher levels of openness to experience in both sexes and higher levels of conscientiousness in women were associated with lower fertility [...] This has been true before the 60s, but the effect has become stronger since the availability of the contraception pill. High openness correlates with being on the fast end of the life-history spectrum (openness to action) as well as the slow end (openness to ideas). It is the latter that should be highest correlated to IQ. I have argued that the slow end of the life history spectrum is populated with \u201chunter-gatherer\u201d types, who (historically) had fewer children than \u201cfarmer\u201d or \u201cpastoralist\u201d types.  The reversal of the Flynn-Effect could, therefore, be explained by lower fertility among high IQ hunter-gatherer types. As hunter-gatherers are collective breeders, hunter-gatherer types might find it harder to raise children in a world with little support for child-rearing than farmer types. Birth control allows them to make voluntary decisions about having children. Being more conscientious would reinforce the choice to have few/no offspring as this would entail an additional burden in child-rearing. If my hypothesis is correct it would follow that it is, in particular, hunter-gatherer type women who suffer from post-partum depression due to lack of social support. Apart from reduced fertility, there may be additional factors that reduce trait openness in the gene-pool. One of them is a higher incidence of autism among hunter-gatherer types. Hunter-gatherer types have highly reactive amygdalas and are therefore less resilient than other types. They were not born for highly competitive and socially stressful environments. Schools and stressful modern work environments might, therefore, be additional factors that might lead to high IQ hunter-gatherers not succeed in life due to increased mental problems such as social anxiety and depression.

            "answer_text": "The Flynn Effect deals with the issue of how the general IQ scores of a population change over time. Below are three graphs indicating possible trends and fluctuations of IQ scores over time. Click on the image which most accurately portrays how you think IQ scores have changed with time?  Introduction In his study of IQ tests scores for different populations over the past sixty years, James R. Flynn discovered that IQ scores increased from one generation to the next for all of the countries for which data existed (Flynn, 1994). This interesting phenomena has been called \"the Flynn Effect.\" Many of the questions about why this effect occurs have not yet been answered by researchers. This site attempts to explain the issues involved in a way that will better help you to understand the Flynn Effect. It also provides references for further inquiry.  How large are the IQ gains? Research shows that IQ gains have been mixed for different countries. In general, countries have seen generational increases between 5 and 25 points. The largest gains appear to occur on tests that measure fluid intelligence (Gf) rather than crystallized intelligence (Gc). Fluid Intelligence Tests like the Ravens, the Norwegian matrices, the Belgian Shapes test, the Jenkins test, and the Horn test are examples of tests that attempt to measure fluid intelligence. These tests try to emphasize problem solving and minimize a reliance on specific skills or familiarity with words and symbols. These tests on average have shown an increase of about 15 points or one standard deviation per generation notes that it is these types of tests (i.e., \"culturally reduced\") on which we would not expect to see score increases if the cause of the increases was due to educational factors. Crystallized Intelligence Tests like the Wechsler-Binet and purely verbal tests measure crystallized intelligence in addition to fluid intelligence. Some questions on these tests measure problem solving abilities but others measure learned information such as vocabulary and math skills. The IQ gains for these tests have been more moderate, with an average of about 9 points per generation. Where is the IQ test data from? The countries from which data has been gathered to research the increase of IQ scores over time are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, Denmark, East Germany, France, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United States of America, and West Germany. What are possible causes for the Flynn Effect? What do intelligence tests really test? To what extent do they measure learning vs. raw intelligence vs. some other factor that is correlated with intelligence? The answers to these questions are still being researched by scholars around the world. Flynn originally offered three categories of potential explanations: Artifacts (e.g., of sampling, improvement in early childhood education), Test Sophistication, and Actual Intelligence Increases. Deary (2001) discusses the weaknesses of the possible explanations, illustrating the complexity of the Flynn Effect. Flynn's Hypothesis \"The hypothesis that best fits the results is that IQ tests do not measure intelligence but rather correlate with a weak causal link to intelligence.\" (Flynn, 1987). Based on the presence of the effect on nonverbal tests such as the Raven's Matrices, Flynn believes that the increase is actually an increase in abstract problem solving rather than intelligence. Flynn (1994, 1999) favors environmental explanations for the increase in test scores. Education a cause of IQ gains? In many countries the level of education of the general public is increasing. People are spending a larger amount of their time learning and being examined in formal educational settings. In some cases IQ gains are highly correlated to increased years spent in formal education. Again, several scholars point at the increase in culture-free tests as evidence against an educational cause. The Brand hypothesis: Societal changes causing IQ gains? Brand suggested that societal changes that teach testing with \"time limits\" could be a cause of IQ gains. The idea behind this hypothesis is that people in our society have learned to work better within a limited time frame. This societal trend allows later generations to score better on timed tests because they make intelligent guesses and don't waste time trying to get every test item correct. Although this hypothesis seemed promising, there has been research that contradicts its fundamental assumptions (Flynn, 1994) Better nutrition a cause of IQ gains? It has also been hypothesized that IQ gains are the results of better world wide nutrition. The idea behind this hypothesis is that better nourished brains would allow subjects to perform better on IQ tests as well as in everyday activities. Experimental data trying to prove this theory are also mixed leading one to believe that nutrition, though a possible contributing cause, cannot account entirely for the massive gains in IQ measured around the world (Flynn, 1994). IQ tests be routinely restandardized? Because populations experience IQ gains over time, IQ tests must be constantly restandardized so that subjects are not scored against inaccurate norms. Using obsolete IQ norms can cause problems especially when comparing scores between different groups and populations. Flynn documents an example where scores from a group of Chinese Americans were being compared to an earlier generation of white Americans. This simple mistake caused the researchers to believe that they were working with \"an elite IQ group\" when in actuality they were working with a group of high achievers with comparable IQs to their peers (Flynn, 1991). In another case documented by Flynn, IQ scores were compared against obsolete norms to incorrectly show large increases in IQ between children adopted into \"good\" homes and their biological mothers (Flynn, 1984).  A widely held hypothesis is that people lose fluid intelligence as they age. This phenomena is caused by comparing the IQ tests of elderly people with today's young people. However, when compared to the IQ scores of youth in their own era (a half a century before) the IQ losses with age are minimal (Raven, 1992, pp. G22-G26). In a final example, Flynn explains that the WISC, an intelligence test used widely in the United States, was not restandardized for 25 years between 1947 and 1972. This comparison of IQ scores to obsolete norms caused the number of children who were officially classified as mentally retarded to drop from 8.8 million in 1947 to 2.6 million in 1972 (Flynn, 1985). A note of caution: The Flynn Effect illustrates the difficulty of comparing test results over time, but it says little about the validity of the tests within a given time period (Flynn talks about the validity \"within generations\").
