            "answer_text": "Excellent question, because: If you can determine the frequency of gravity waves, then you simply produce an anti-frequency gravity wave to that gravity wave, and then you will have discovered anti-gravity. According to Alan Guth, it was gravity acting against repulsive gravity that supplied the power for the Big Bang. And in the diagram below, why not just reverse the spin of the gravitons to act against one another, and voila, anti-gravity:  The principle is similar to noise cancellation headphones. Discover a sound wave and produce an anti-sound wave and you get a Null Point. And in the case of gravity, produce an anti-gravity wave and you get Levitation. So why hasn\u2019t there been any research into what could be the greatest discovery ever? Well\u2026., the scientific elite, including the late/great professor Feynman, say that producing anti-gravity is impossible. And since most scientists are followers of the \u201crock-stars\u201d of the notable scientific community, they simply follow the leader and are content with obeying the Law of Gravity. But yet the purpose of a visionary is to challenge the status quo and break the laws\u2026, especially gravity. And needless to say whoever discovers anti-gravity would become the most famous and wealthiest person in the entire universe. But maybe more advanced alien civilizations have already accomplished this (what they consider to be a most basic exercise in physics) rather simple task. In fact, around the time of Jesus (2,000 years ago), aliens could\u2019ve visited earth and placed anti-gravity devices into the sandals of Jesus, allowing him to walk on water and appear to be a God. But what would be their motive? The motive could have been to slow down the rapid advances in science at that time because aliens felt threatened by an attack from the Earth People. In other words, have the Earthlings indulge in religion and worship a God associated with Jesus, rather than allocating time and resources in the exploration of science. This would definitely slow down advances in space travel and weapons systems that might threaten alien civilizations. And it worked! It has been said that if weren\u2019t for religion, we could\u2019ve put a man on the moon a thousand years ago. And just think of all that talent and brilliant ideas that were suppressed because it conflicted with religious beliefs. But religion does not conflict with the motives of aliens. And so long as Earthlings remain on earth, reject science, and worship a God\u2026.., they feel safe. Conclusion: aliens \u2026.., they could actually be real. And with all sorts of advanced technology, including anti-gravity secrets that they need to protect for fear that Earth People could use this information against them in some type of invasion. In other words, take away their science and replace it with religion. And threats from other advanced cultures of the universe could be eliminated. Very clever\u2026\u2026\u2026, these aliens. ",

            "answer_text": "The frequency of gravitational waves, like the frequency of electromagnetic waves, is determined by the frequency of the oscillations in the source. For example, with the appropriate choice of gauge, the gravitational radiation far from a non-relativistic source localized near the origin is described to leading order by the well-known quadrupole formula: [math]h_{ij}(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\approx \\frac{2G}{c^4 r} \\ddot{Q}_{ij}(t_r)[/math] where [math]Q[/math] is the energy density quadrupole moment, and [math]t_r[/math] is the retarded time, as in electrodynamics. The quantity [math]h_{ij}[/math] is a perturbation to the background flat  metric [math]\\eta_{ij}[/math] and represents the field of gravitational radiation. So it is easy to see that if the source oscillates with a frequency [math]f[/math] in such a way that its quadrupole moment has nonzero second derivative, then it will emit gravitational radiation with frequency [math]f[/math]. (Note: Compare this with the formula from electrodynamics, [math]\\mathbf{A} \\approx \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi r} \\dot{\\mathbf{p}}(t_r)[/math].) ",
