            "answer_text": "In the early 19th cent. Joseph Fourier first hypothesized the greenhouse theory of warming, but he knew nothing about quantum theory or Planck\u2019s Radiation Law of 1900, which torpedoed his theory. After lying on the cutting room floor for decades, the leftist environmentalists centered in the U.N. got the bright idea that they could win their war on the fossil fuel industry by framing CO2 emissions as causing evil, but not with physics, just a giant beehive of tampered global temperature data that only they were in charge of, founding the IPCC octopus of kept scientists, academics, journalists, and politicians, which soon gained a monopoly, coopting every scientific org. Even after spending millions, they could only demonstrate teeny amounts of global warming, 0.1C/decade, which is within experimental error and might as well be 0C/decade, yet from day one they jumped to predict climate Armageddon if the fossil fuel industry wasn\u2019t dismantled immediately and a global Marxist government erected to run everything, and flooded the media with one failed alarmist prediction after another to keep people scared based on extreme weather events that they deliberately confused with a permanent long-lasting climate change, of course cherry-picking examples that support their big goal of shutting down the oil industry like Joe Biden recently admitted. TL Winslow's answer to How dangerous is climate alarmism when it displaces common sense approaches? https://electroverse.net/us-just-set-its-coldest-temperature-ever-recorded-this-early/ John Walker's answer to What are some other pieces of evidence for global warming aside from the rise concentration of carbon dioxide? Meanwhile the U.N. IPCC became like a Communist Party dedicated not to finding the truth, but to the political cause of proving that CO2 is evil for their ulterior purposes and not tolerating boat-rockers. Now that their Armageddon seems as far away as ever, the octopus has grown so big that it\u2019s just nakedly trying to grab power, especially in the U.S. with its Green New Deal, and real scientists who question whether CO2 can even melt an ice cube like moi are labeled climate deniers and marginalized to blogs like this one. Even a child who will work for them without question gets a big stage like the U.N. Gen. Assembly, while every thinking scientist questioning them has to fight systematic ostracism and suppression, and better find a way to support themselves outside of science. Still, I believe that the truth will win in the end. DR TIM BALL MUST READ : Environmentalism \u2013 Evidence Suggests It Was Always And Only About Achieving World Government Climatology: Why is Climate Change Politicized? Here\u2019s the proof that CO2 can\u2019t melt an ice cube with its radiation because the photons are too weak: TL Winslow's answer to What proof do we have that CO2 is a greenhouse gas? How do we know it has caused global warming? Here\u2019s the history of the global warming movement in great detail, giving equal time to all sides. Of course the IPCC doesn\u2019t want you to read it, so why not do it anyway for yourself while you still can? TLW's Climatescope\u2122, by T.L. Winslow (TLW), \"The Historyscoper\"\u2122 ",

            "answer_text": "What!? We\u2019ve been doing major work on climate for two centuries now. Coincidentally, the unscientific but usually reliable at long-range weather forecasting Farmers' Almanac started 202 years ago as well. And why wouldn\u2019t we be doing the research? When it comes to the realities of life on Earth, climate stands as one of the constant and concerning realities of life here, affecting everything from crop timing and crop yields to wedding planning. We would have been better off had politicians decided to ignore Al Gore\u2019s version of climate change. The parameters put on the enormous flow of funding to research Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming all but assured the results would be an indictment of industrialism. But, at least, it was in the form of an actual scientific claim. Never mind that the claim was that science up to that point had been wrong in important respects, we proceeded to give it a lot of actual investigation (not to mention a lot of meetings of lots of important people at resort spots all around the world). You may recall that that claim fell apart in 2004 in a rapid-fire exchange of \u201coh shit, oh shit\u201d emails flying between climate centers as the predicted rise in temperature not only failed to materialize to the predicted degree, it failed to materialize to any degree. Of 42 predictive models, all were wrong. Consequently, we haven\u2019t seen predictive models or hypotheses or any other real scientific claim since then. We\u2019re being treated to a PR regalia. CAGW became AGW became \u201cglobal warming\u201d became \u201cclimate change,\u201d growing more and more diffuse as it became about globalist politics and not science. One of the reasons climate is concerning is that we are in not one but two ice ages. Both poles are ice covered. The Pleistocene ice age started ~27 mya when the South American plate separated from the Antarctic plate, and the Quaternary ice age started 2.58 mya in the northern hemisphere. We will be in these ice ages for millions of years to come. Hello, Al! An ice age is a great time to be figuring out how to get some warming, not fret about it. Those pre-ice-age epochs of our Cenozoic era that were 4 and 6 degrees C warmer than now, were much nicer! \u2026worldwide Mediterranean climates. Interglacials, like our present Holocene, instead feature notoriously fickle and shitty weather. This interglacial will end before long, perhaps with this solar minimum, perhaps with the one that follows. Here\u2019s the climate roller coaster we\u2019re on and where it will shortly deposit us:  Are you ready for 4 and 8 degrees C colder and ice sheets a mile deep over Chicago, New York and Paris? See what I mean about climate being concerning? We need to get science in the front of the bus and the politicians moved to the back. ",
