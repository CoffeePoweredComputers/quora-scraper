            "answer_text": "Well Eddie, I really don\u2019t know, but let\u2019s guesstimate here. On average as seafood, a six pound whole squid sells for ~ $40.00. In the giant squid genus, Architeuthis the male can easily weigh 440 lbs. while the female can reach a ton, which is 2000 lbs. So, with all this in mind and a bit of math factoring, I\u2019d say a male squid would cost ya $2933.33, while a one ton female would be a whopping $133,333.33. Of course this is not including the labor that went into the process of deep sea fishing for the cephalopod and hauling it back to shore. ",

Plus the price of the upkeep. I'm guessing you'd need at least 1/3 of the world's oceans to make a suitable home. Then the feed? You'd need to buy a few whales, sharks and dolphins to keep your dear Architeuthis happy and well fed. Then you'd have to find a way to feed it. Maybe you might lose your life to the Teuthis\u2019 huge building sized beak! Lol ",
