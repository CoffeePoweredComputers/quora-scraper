            "answer_text": "The LIGO ( Laser Interferometry Gravitational-Wave Observatory ) is the best detector of gravitational waves our scientists (Kip Thorne and others) have developed. Gravitational waves causes contraction and expansion of space and this change in spatial dimension is what measured in the observatory.  Imagine a buoy floating in the ocean. When a disturbance pass by, the buoy goes up and down on the surface of the water. Gravitational waves are similar, except that the disturbance is of space-time. This mean, all dimension of space should contract, expand, contract, expand periodically. Such variations are extremely small, orders in magnitude smaller than a proton. The detectors are LIGO are capable of detecting changes in length of about 10E-18 mtrs, which should provide us satisfactory results. So, how does it work?    Image from Einstein's gravitational waves found at last - article from Nature Publishing Group : science journals, jobs, and information  It's an L shaped tube with mirrors at the two end stations. Each length of the tube is approx 4 km long. A laser light is shot towards the mirrors at both ends. A detector is situated at the corner station to capture the reflected beam. The pattern of laser light which is received is recorded continuously.  When a gravitational wave passes through, one arm of the tube is  elongated, and the perpendicular arm will be compressed. The elongation/compression of the arm will shift the mirror slightly, which is reflected in the patterns recorded by the detectors. The detector is so sensitive, that traffic at a distance of 10 km can also affect the pattern which is recorded by the detector. Thus, two such instruments are kept at two ends of the United States - one at Hanford nuclear complex in Washington and the other in Louisiana - 3000 miles away. If a pattern recorded in one place exactly matches the other, then it can be confirmed that the variation is due to disturbance of space-time by a gravitational wave.    Gravitational Wave signals recorded by the twin LIGO stations at Hanford and Luisiania. Image from Einstein's gravitational waves found at last - article from Nature Publishing Group : science journals, jobs, and information  The idea is simple, pretty much analogous to a floating buoy. The sensitivity and precision required to execute is perhaps the pinnacle of advanced technology in recent times. The discovery of gravitational waves by the LIGO team on 11th Feb 2016 marks a major achievement in our endeavour to understand our reality. It may turn out we're not that very different from a simple buoy in an infinitely vast ocean!  ",

            "answer_text": "GRAVITY WAVES There is a lot to be said here to show that gravity waves *do not* exist. Even though what are thought and said to be gravity waves have been reported detected by the LIGO. I believe they are mistaken. Gravity works in real time. So gravity waves can not really be detected. They say the \u2018predicted\u2019 Gravity Waves have been found. But remember what Thomas Jefferson said. If you read the newspaper you will be less informed than if you had not read the newspaper. And also what Mulder said \u201cTrust no one.\u201d :) Admitted that slight increases and decreases in gravity strength may occur as binary stars circle each other, moving from side-by-side to in-line with us here on earth. That\u2019s not rocket science. And it may even be detected if the detection machinery could continuously track the changing source. But the LIGO\u2019s cannot. They are attached to a rotating earth. So they can\u2019t detect anything more than clicks. Which do not signify waves\u2026 We\u2019re told that the U.S. LIGO which is fixed to the ground and pretty much limited to line of sight along with the other LIGO in Pisa Italy, also fixed to the ground, have done the impossible. That both were observing and comparing the very same spot in the cosmos at the same time. Am I missing something...? Changes in gravity strength will happen from stars rotating, exploding, or most any other changing motion in the cosmos. I could have told them that without the LIGO being built. In any case, whatever is seen, felt, or measured gravity wise, it is in real time. Gravity itself is instantaneous. It needs to be. To have \u2018waves\u2019 traveling through the cosmos would be very dangerous for the cosmos. Those from two or more sources would act like any other waves and mix to form interference patterns. Rocking the cosmos as they went in and out of phase. And that is not the worse part. Certain frequencies could cause square waves. Where there is zero gravity and then double strength gravity in alternating jolts. That I\u2019m sure would destroy that section of the cosmos up to and including at least one of the offending sources. With expected necessary adjustments that are needed from time to fime, gravity is a fairly steady balance of attractions throughout the cosmos. There is a lot to keep track of. It cannot afford the time waves would take, nor the shaking they would produce. Inertia would not be straight line inertia for one. :) Then of course with Gravity being the long looked for Aether.., as it surely is.., and a case of not seeing the the forest for the trees.., we cannot have a \u2018choppy\u2019 medium. What would it do to light\u2019s distribution to mention just one likely problem. The first reports said the waves were from a binary star system. Now there are claims they are black holes. Hm.. There\u2019s no such animal in the first place. In any case they were going around each other every 8 minutes. So the big doubt comes in with the earth moving through the cosmos and the LIGO\u2019s outer most reception and sensing ability sweeping the cosmos faster than the speed of light. How did they manage to register an eight minute wave cycle.? Or even the minutest part of it. Too small to even recognize it as a wave.?? LIGO's will can not detect any gravity wave originations by accident much less those that may be specifically searched for. Not only for the speed of the sweep, but that the LIGO\u2019s only compare two constantly moving directions out of 360^2 degrees of direction from earth, that can be further divided down to an infinite number of degree fractions at the far end of the sweep direction. So it\u2019s up to the earth what LIGO looks at. Ok, so they do sweep around to many other points as the earth turns, etc. But doesn\u2019t that give another problem? They will be sweeping across varying strengths of gravity that are occurring naturally in particular directions. They will appear as waves.too. But they\u2019re still just real time differences. They even said they verified the gravity wave coinciding with direct visual observation of the stars revolving. So that gravity is proven to operate at the speed of light. Right..! :/ IMHO ",

            "answer_text": "To spot gravitational waves directly for the first time ever, scientists had to measure a distance change 1,000 times smaller than the width of a proton. Researchers with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) announced today (Feb. 11) that they had made history's first direct detection of gravitational waves, enigmatic ripples in space-time whose existence was first predicted 100 years ago by Albert Einstein's famous theory of general relativity. The gravitational waves were generated by the merger of two medium-size black holes about 1.3 billion years ago, researchers said. These waves raced through space at the speed of light and encountered Earth, where they were picked up by LIGO's two huge detectors as a brief signal on Sept. 14, 2015. Supersensitive detectors The LIGO detectors are in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington. Each one consists of a giant L-shaped structure with arms 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) long. A laser beam shines down each arm from the crux of the \"L,\" and mirrors at the ends of these arms reflect the light back.  Using laser beams, scientists have detected the physical distortions caused by passing gravitational waves. If the beams from both arms arrive back at the crux at the same time, they cancel each other out, and no signal is produced in the system's light detector. This is the normal, expected scenario. But if one of the beams arrives a bit late, a signal is produced, which could be evidence of a gravitational wave. Gravitational waves, after all, distort the fabric of space-time. A wave that passes through a LIGO detector \u2014 and \"passes through\" is a fairly apt description, because gravitational waves do not interact meaningfully with matter \u2014 will lengthen space-time ever so slightly along one arm of the \"L,\" and compress it along the other arm. \"Ever so slightly\" does not fully capture just how minuscule this distance change is, however. The effect LIGO observed last September works out to a shift of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a meter \u2014 about one one-thousandth the diameter of a proton, project team members said. To put this kind of sensitivity into yet more perspective, LIGO technology is theoretically capable of measuring the distance from the sun to the nearest star \u2014 Proxima Centauri, which lies about 4.25 light-years away \u2014 \"to a level of about the width of a human hair,\" David Reitze of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), executive director of the LIGO Laboratory, said during a news conference today. \"LIGO is the most precise measuring device ever built,\" Reitze added. Achieving this level of sensitivity isn't easy. For example, LIGO's laser beams travel down the detectors' arms in a near-perfect vacuum. And the system's light-reflecting mirrors hang from pendulums in a sophisticated quadruple-suspension setup, to isolate them from the everyday jiggling and jostling experienced on Earth's surface, LIGO team members said. Furthermore, the groundbreaking detection wouldn't have been possible without a significant overhaul of the LIGO detectors, which first hunted for gravitational waves between 2002 and 2010. The project then took a five-year observing hiatus, as team members redesigned and upgraded the system's instruments to get a new \"Advanced LIGO\" up and running. Advanced LIGO features a sensitivity 10 times that of the original incarnation, project representatives said. The new version began its first official observing campaign in September 2015 \u2014 a few days after the historic detection, which was actually made during an engineering test run. The fact that Advanced LIGO made a detection so soon after getting to work suggests that the system will spot more gravitational waves in the near future, team members said. Source: space.com ",

I like to think of it in this manner: the mirrors don't move, but the gravity wave changes the amount of space between them.  (In general relativity, gravity exhibits itself in terms of a \"metric\".  The metric tells you how much space is found in between two coordinates.  That distance can change, even if the coordinates don't change.)  A gravity wave is a wave of the metric; it is the metric that is waving.  This metric replaces the old concept of the gravitational field. ",

Their is an instrument which emits a laser beam which gets split in two, and is sent down through two 2.5-mile long tubes. Their are mirrors at the end of the tunnel, which reflect this laser (the laser is shot perpendicular to the mirror). As per the law of reflection, angle of incidence = angle of reflection.  Hence, if the mirrors remain at their mean position, the laser beams should converge at the same point, right in the center (lasers travel at the same speed, and here, distance is the same).Now, we know gravitational waves warp space-time, which would rhythmically stretch and squeeze any object in it's path, which in this case, would make one tube longer and another tube shorter. Hence, the lasers would not converge right in the center, as the speed of the laser remains the same, but the distance traveled is greater in one case and lower in the other case!As they don't converge in the center, the gravitational waves are detected.

It consists of two arms(tunnels for light) running parpendicularly to eachother and light from a single source is split and sent into each arm . At the end of each tunnel is a mirror and each beam after several reflections is sent back to the source .. detector in such a way that they cancel out each other or produce a specific interference . But when a gravitational wave approaches one of the tunnels the spacetime becomes distorted and so the light beam takes a little(unimaginably little infact) extra time to reach the detector but  this causes a difference in the interference pattern which is detected. This is how g waves were detected. ",
