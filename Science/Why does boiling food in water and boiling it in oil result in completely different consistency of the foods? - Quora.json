            "answer_text": "Water boiling point 100 deg c. When you try to boil food in water some foods can dissolve in hot water makes its boiling point elevated. Also water cannot penetrate into food and try to disintegrate it. Where as oil can go 250+ deg and do not dissolve food much. Also it doesn't allow the food structure to dissipate rather make it dehydrated by thoroughly penetrating through it. The principle is heat transfer. Water and oil are two different type liquids. Polar and non polar. Oil substances in boiling have no affect on it where as water on hot oil evaporates much faster. ",
