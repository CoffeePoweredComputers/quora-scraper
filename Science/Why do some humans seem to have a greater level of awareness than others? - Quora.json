We don\u2019t want to violate their lives with our opinions or views. So the question then becomes, am I aware? Why or why not? I have no idea if others have a level of awareness that others don\u2019t. To me self-awareness is private and well it isn\u2019t something that many would choose to brag about or even talk about because you can\u2019t. It is like bragging about the fact that you can taste the sweetness of a strawberry. But then again, I don\u2019t know if you are asking me of self awareness or awareness as a whole. I can tell you that from personal experience, my awareness level came through experience and desire for change. I didn\u2019t like the way others responded to me and since I was too chicken to try to change others, I decided to change myself. As a woman, it is a bunch of small steps of reclaiming that which is and always has been yours, yourself. I had become a wife and a mom but hardly ever had a chance to be a girl, a child and in many ways, too little opportunity to be a woman. I don\u2019t believe some humans have a greater level of awareness, only more ample opportunities, a greater exposure to multiple experiences, just more experience and perhaps more time for contemplation. After all, how would I know the taste of a strawberry if I never even knew that such a fruit even existed? It is asking for too much to expect me to know the taste of a fruit that I don\u2019t even know exists\u2026don\u2019t you think? So don\u2019t worry about what is seemingly out there. Look to yourself and then you will see that it will be someone else out there wondering about things that only you know\u2026seemingly :) ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Scarlett, this is because different human beings perform different kinds of actions (karmas in eastern parlance) during the course of their respective lifetimes. I will get into the law of karma just cursorily\u2026it is basically a subset of the Universal Law of Cause and Effect. Karma applies to the causes( actions) and their corresponding effects only with respect to self-conscious beings\u2026those who have free will\u2026so humans, in the context of our world. Now extending this law backwards and forwards from a given person\u2019s life\u2026it follows that they came into this life from somewhere else\u2026and because of some cause(es) and their effects, the person was born into this world with this body and into this family and so on\u2026 Similarly, when this life ends\u2026they will go somewhere else based on their actions in this lifetime (over-simplification). So if we pursue this logic\u2026any person\u2019s life-threads go back into countless previous lifetimes\u2026and this is mentioned and explained in certain Religious Philosophies of the World. Therefore, it can be that one person worked very hard on themselves in order to grow spiritually as much as possible, in the previous lifetime, whereas, another person worked very hard on mastering the discipline of commerce, and so, the first person (in the above eg) comes into this lifetime with a high degree of self-awareness, and the second person comes into this lifetime with a natural (seems that way because we cant see their actions in the previous life) flair for business and trade and such-like. This explains why in any given area of human qualities or endeavors or Knowledge Disciplines etc etc, there \u201cappears\u201d to be a discrepancy in the abilities of different people in a given field. Hope this helps. Sincerely, Jai ",
