            "answer_text": "Pure research involves developing and testing theories and hypotheses that are intellectually challenging to the researcher but may or may not have practical application at the present time or in the future. Thus such work often involves the testing of hypotheses containing very abstract and specialized concepts. Pure research is also concerned with the development, examination, verification and refinement of research methods, procedures, techniques and tools that form the body of research methodology.Examples of pure research include developing a sampling technique that can be applied to a particular situation; developing a methodology to assess the validity of a procedure; developing an instrument,say, to measure the stress level in people; and finding the best way of measuring people\u2019s attitudes. The knowledge produced through pure research is sought in order to add to the existing body of knowledge of research methods ",

To make it we would have needed some pure research in various things: making a TV screen, wireless radio/TV, developing a microphone, a keyboard, etc. The example is wrong, because all these constituents were made already.
