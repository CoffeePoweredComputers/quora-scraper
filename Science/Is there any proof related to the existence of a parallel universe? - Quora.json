            "answer_text": "There were many different kinds of mysteries which gave rise to this idea. I am going to discuss just 3 main ideas below: - 1.Deja vu: - What is Deja vu? It is a very common feeling, we all have experienced it. Sometimes we feel like, \u201cthis event has happened with me before\u201d. That feeling is called Deja vu. This feeling kept scientists puzzled for long time. Then finally they came to a solution and thought that it might be happening because our other version, who lives in parallel universe, have already faced those events. Somehow, we are connected with our alternate version, that\u2019s why we feel like that. Hence, Deja vu gave rise to the idea of parallel world.  2.Quantum mechanics: - Quantum mechanics is a different way to see the world, it is based on probability. It says that until we measure or see anything, it exists in all of its possible states. For example, you toss a coin, while the coin is in air it exists in both of its possible states i.e. Head as well as Tail. Until we take a look on the coin, we cannot say which state it actually represents. Simple, right? actually it is not that simple. According to Quantum mechanics, the other state just vanished and you got the result. What happened with the other states? Those states were the result of the same event in parallel universe. In fact, all the possibilities of an event occur simultaneously and for each possibility there is a parallel universe. This idea was given by Erwin Schrodinger, one of the founders of Quantum Mechanics. This was the 2nd main contribution towards the idea of PARALLEL WORLD.  3.Time travel: - Since the idea of time travel came into existence, there are many paradoxes given by various minds all around the globe. The main popular paradoxes are Grandfather paradox, Bootstrap paradox, Hitler paradox and few more. All these paradoxes, normally, have no solution, but if we connect it with the Parallel world concept then we get the solution to this problem easily. How is the problem solved? See, if all the events of time travel happen in the parallel universe then it won\u2019t be affecting our universe and our present and future will remain as it had to be. In this way the paradox can be solved. This was the 3rd important reason behind the Parallel world Concept.  These were the 3 main reasons behind the concept. There are many more reasons which force us to believe in this strange concept, but that don\u2019t make sense, like: \u2022 Why do we see dream? \u2022 Mystery of Bermuda triangle \u2022 Mystery of ghost, spirits, gods and such These mysteries get solved with most accuracy, if we include the concept of parallel world with them. Now we are ready to know the different versions of the possible parallel world. Follow my space MessyMindScience ",

            "answer_text": "Scientists Discover Possible First Proof of Parallel Universe  A new study about one of the most inexplicable places in the cosmos may offer the first proof that we are living in a multiverse. The idea of a \u201cmultiverse\u201d proposes that an infinite amount of universes, including the one we are living in, exist in parallel to each other. These universes differ in a variety of physical properties, featuring multiple Big Bangs, space bubbles and maybe even an alternate version of you who is reading this article in a world run by slugs. The \u201cmultiverse\u201d hypothesis has been so far been impossible to test but has supporters among such scientists as Stephen Hawking, Michio Kaku, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Leonard Susskind. The study by British astronomers focuses on what\u2019s known as the \u201cCold Spot\u201d - an especially cold area of space that has been observed in the microwave background radiation coming from the early Universe 13 billion years ago. Usually temperatures of the radiation vary throughout the universe, but this area of coolness is much larger than others (about 0.00015 degrees Celsius colder than its surroundings).  The map of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) sky produced by the Planck satellite. Red represents slightly warmer regions, and blue slightly cooler regions. Credit: ESA and Durham University. The Cold Spot, first found by NASA in 2004, is a strange place 1.8 billion light years across that doesn\u2019t comfortably gel with existing cosmological models. One explanation is that it simply doesn\u2019t exist, being just an illusion created by the expansion of the universe. Spaces with lower amount of galaxies or \u201cvoids\u201d form as the expansion accelerates. With 10,000 fewer galaxies, the Cold Spot would be a \u201csupervoid\u201d. But the study, published in UK\u2019s Royal Astronomical Society, claims to prove that the supervoid is not a valid solution to the Cold Spot's mystery. The researchers think that instead of one giant emptiness in that area, there are galaxy clusters gathered around smaller bubble-like voids. And, significantly, these would be too small to be responsible for lowering the temperature in the Cold Spot. In fact, other answers must be sought. The scientists, led by postgraduate student Ruari Mackenzie and Professor Tom Shanks in Durham University's Centre for Extragalactic Astronomy, think one possible hypothesis is that the Cold Spot resulted from a collision between our universe during its early days and another universe. The energy release of such an impact would have created the Cold Spot. \"We can't entirely rule out that the Spot is caused by an unlikely fluctuation explained by the standard model. But if that isn't the answer, then there are more exotic explanations. Perhaps the most exciting of these is that the Cold Spot was caused by a collision between our universe and another bubble universe. If further, more detailed, analysis of CMB [Cosmic Microwave Background] data proves this to be the case then the Cold Spot might be taken as the first evidence for the multiverse \u2013 and billions of other universes may exist like our own,\u201d said Professor Tom Shanks. The multiverse, while an exciting idea, has its detractors. Some physicists feel since it\u2019s not something observable or provable, then a discussion of it is pointless or even unscientific. But when more ordinary solutions come up empty, the doors of science open wider. ",
