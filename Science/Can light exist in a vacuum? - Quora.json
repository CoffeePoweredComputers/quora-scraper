            "answer_text": "Firstly, thanks for such a profound question. I really appreciate that.Now coming to my point of view, Of course it can ! Light is an electromagnetic wave which propagates transversely. Unlike sound , it doesn't need a medium to travel through. Except for the fact that it can't be observed through visual perception because , in vacuum, there's no any kind of obstacle that reflects light back to our retina. But some scientists at Chalmers unversity of technology have succeeded in creating light from vacuum. Have managed to capture some photons that are constantly appearing and disappearing in the vacuum. Apart from that, nothing can possibly \u2018stop' light . And light is the only thing that's almost out of time! So it always exists, everywhere ,even in vacuum! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes,light can exist in vacuum.To understand this you need to know about the nature of light.Maxwell showed us that light is nothing but a electromagnetic wave,which contains electric field and magnetic field. To progress this EM wave or light,the M field and E field should be change with time.Thus we can see that the progression and existence of the light depend only on the E field and M field, there need not any medium. Hence light can exist in vacuum. But you have to sure that there or outside of the vacuum must have a source of light ",
