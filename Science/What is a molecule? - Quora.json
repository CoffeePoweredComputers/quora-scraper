            "answer_text": "A molecule is the smallest repeatable, independently existing (uncharged) unit of 2 or more COVALENTLY bound atoms. For instance pure H-Cl (hydrogen chloride) is a gas and molecule of one covalent bond and two atoms. In water, though, H+ breaks off and attaches to H2O while Cl- exists as an anion surrounded by the positively charge ends of water molecules. Now HCl has reincarnated as hydrochloric acid, an ionic entity comprised of H3O+ (hydronium) and Cl- (chloride). No longer a molecule but two ions in solution. One might say that because they behaved well as a gas they achieved \"solvation\" (sorry, unavoidable geekism) In the solid state, let's look at ionic NaCl ( or Na+Cl-). It's really an endless 3-D repeat of the cited \"formula unit\" according to a distinct geometric pattern (lattice). \"Formula unit\" is the correct name for the smallest formula retaining the integer ratio of its ions. Ionics, therefore the term \"molecule\" with \"formula unit\".In short, if it has at least one covalent bond and is neutral and a separate species it's a molecule. If it consists of oppositely charge species (even if one or both are molecular) So, in the above we've just conjured up the concept of a molecular ion. . An oxymoron? Not at all ! Consider \" CN-\" (cyanide). Carbon and nitrogen are joined by a triple (covalent) bond, but the thing has a net charge. Strictly speaking, not a molecule. These net ionic but covalently bound creatures are commonly called polyatomic ions. Other examples are carbonate (CO3 -2 with CO covalent bonds ) and ammonium (NH4+ with NH covalent links) Most molecules by the way, are made up of nonmetals and/or metalloids although there are metals that can make weak highly polar covalent bonds.... Caveat and Reality Check: people, even chemists, often use the term \"molecule\" to cover even the verboten cases of the above. It's convenient, if a little sloppy, So long as you KNOW when you - or someone else - is being informal..... ",

            "answer_text": "I will keep this very simple. First, you need to know what an atom is. Atoms comes in several types - more than 100! Each type represents a different element. Elements are things like oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, iron, helium, gold, silver, aluminum \u2026 and, as you can imagine many other. So, the element oxygen consists only of oxygen atoms, hydrogen only of hydrogen atoms and so on \u2026 For most practical purposes you can think of atoms as the smalles possible building blocks. Everything we know are built from atoms. Everything! Think of them as small marbles of different sizes and colors that can magically connect to each other, almost like magnets. And you can build things with them. Once you build something that consists of more than one atom, then you have a molecule! A molecule is also a kind of building block. There are rules for what kind of molecules atoms will let you build, but atoms are rarely alone. At least when we are talking about solid stuff like rocks, a TV or a knife. So atoms tend to stick together in molecules. Oxygen gas, which you can find in the air all around you, consists of to oxygene atoms that are stuck together as an oxygene molecule. We call it O2 - or simply oxygen since it is the most common type of pure oxygen. However, some oxygen atoms find that they want to pair up with two other, and make an O3 molecule. This is also a pure oxygen gas, but we call it ozone. Other elements, like carbon can make molecules that are much, much larger. But atoms does not only stick to their own kind. Following certain rules, again, they are very fond of teaming up with different kind of atoms. One of the most crucial molecules for all life consists of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. The oxygene atom in the middle, with one hydrogen atom on each side. We call it an H2O molecule - or water. A neat trick that most molecules does, is that they can be either solid, fluid or a gas. It all boils down to temperature. If water gets cold enough, the water molecules get lazy and finally settles in a solid structure that we call ice (or water ice). If we add some energy, that means heat, they get more restless again and starts wandering about. We have fluid - or water again. Add even more heat and the water molecules goes totally crazy and finally it\u2019s lift off and we have gas, or what we call steam when it comes to water. However, different molecules have different tolerances for heat/cold (energy), nitrogen gas (a molecule called N2, made from two nitrogen atoms) does not become solid until it is close to -210 degrees Celsius (-346 Fahrenheit)! Hope this helps. We have only been talking about very small molecules here, but they can be very large (for a molecule), very complex, and consist of many different elements. Also, everything above is a simplification, but it is a reasonable way of thinking about how it all works. We actually know that atoms can be broken up into even smaller parts, but that is a different chapter all together. ",
