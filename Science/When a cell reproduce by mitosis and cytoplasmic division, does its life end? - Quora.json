            "answer_text": "\u201cWhen a cell reproduces by mitosis and cytoplasmic division, does its life end?\u201d Forgive me if I\u2019m misinterpreting, but my understanding of this question is \u201cdoes the act of reproduction by mitosis and cytoplasmic division cause a cell to die.\u201d The short answer is no. The cell splits into two smaller daughter cells and continues on. However, technically the original cell no longer exists, even though it did not die. Additionally, if something goes exceptionally wrong during the process it may trigger apoptosis (cell death) as a defense mechanism against faulty cells. ",

            "answer_text": "In eukaryotic cells, chromosomes are linear. The specific machinery of dna replication face a problem when arrives at the end of linear chromosomes. The only way to temporarily solve the problem is to ignore the replication of one end of a chromosome and then after every round of division our chromosomes will be shorter. This shrinkage of chromosomes finally will encounter important genes and disruption of these genes maybe cause cancer. The first solution to the problem of the chromosome tail replication is to use a repetitive sequence, namely telomere, and use a different enzyme, telomerase, to replicate it. However, this mechanism is inactivated in mature cells and it just works in stem cells which their responsibility is to divide a lot of time. In a mature normal cells, after several round of division, the chromosme end arrives at the proximity of protein coding sequences. At this moment, Apoptosis, cell suicide system, will be activated and cell will kill itself before having a chance of becoming a cancer cell. ",
