            "answer_text": "Because there is a lot of gravity, and gravity is constantly being created, and everything is made of gravity. THE UNIVERSE AND PARTS THERE OF. Copyright \u00a9 7-24-98 / VAu 436-388 / Robert Evan Howard The UNIVERSE is comprised of Gravity in Oscillating Densities // U = G O D I could have used other words, but the acronym ( U=G O D ) was just too compelling - from free form gravity to energy to matter, and back again. Like a pendulum. As the original gravitational formation grew, it became denser and denser at it\u2019s core because gravity only attracts. Eventually the core became dense enough to create base energy, then complex energy, then base matter, and finally complex matter. As everything breaks down, the process is reversed - complex matter, to base matter, to complex energy, to base energy, finally back to free form gravity, then back again. This is why everything attracts to everything else in proportion to it\u2019s mass density. Gravity and light ( LENSING ) all things attract each other, that is why you can see something behind a star - the light is pulled toward the star thus it\u2019s path is curved. If you had stars well placed, light could be pulled into a circle trajectory. There are \u201c NO \u201c gravitational waves. Any device trying to detect such things would detect gravity from passing satellites, movement from the earths core, passing cosmic dust clouds, planet movements, plains, clouds, flocks of birds, and even migrating schools of fish. Free form gravity can not be mechanically separated from the energy or matter of which it is apart. Energy and matter share their free form gravity if close. Free form gravity will attract to it\u2019s self forming a spherical shape if left to it\u2019s self like in our formation between galaxy clusters where as the free form gravity has a greater attraction to it\u2019s self than it has with it\u2019s energy or matter part at great distances. Free form gravity will be assimilated or shared by by the free form gravity of any energy or matter it comes in contact with. Think of our system as a big ball of gravity with objects of varying densities scattered though out it. STAGE ONE COMPONENTS: a. DIMENSION - To infinity in all directions. b. TEMPERATURE - designation- not HEAT - of a CONSISTENT value at all points. ( Point of mention: If you placed a thermometer in the universe during STAGE ONE, the reading would not change. To say - The reading on the thermometer would NOT RISE or FALL forever. There would have been a static reading because there was no HEAT to alter it. ) DEVELOPMENT OF THE POINT of INCONSISTENCY: ( NO BIG BANG - JUST A LITTLE UMPH. ) STAGE TWO COMPONENTS: a. DIMENSION - To infinity in all directions. b. TEMPERATURE - \" HEAT \" - of an INCONSISTENT value. c. DENSITY - \" d. MOTION - \" e. BASE ENERGY- \" f. BASE MATTER - \" g. FREE FORM GRAVITY - \" POINT of INCONSISTENCY The development of a POINT OF INCONSISTENCY is the most difficult part of this theory to understand, and the crux of it as will. Something from nothing is difficult to explain, it took me more then 20 years to understand it myself. It is actually very simple when looking at the problem from the prospective of - ( Could ALL POINTS in eternity remain CONSISTENT for eternity? The answer is NO! ) OUR STRUCTURE The structure of our formation begins at the POINT OF INCONSISTENCY and continues outward to as far as light has been able to travel sense the creation of electromagnetic spectrum. It's matter is in the general shape of a typical spiral galaxy. What we can perceive from our position is only a small portion extending for billions of light years from it's center. Somewhere along the line, there might have been large explosions, but more likely what we perceive as \" OUR \" formation was thrown off from the outer edges. Plus, because our formation exists, there could be an infinite number on other formations already in existence, or that will be, or just ours. It will be a long time before we know. THE PROCESS [ The structure of OUR FORMATION begins at the POINT OF INCONSISTENCY and continues outward to as far as light has been able to travel sense the creation of electromagnetic spectrum. It's shape is spherical. During STAGE ONE, a POINT OF INCONSISTENCY changed the universe from having a CONSISTENT value to having an INCONSISTENT VALUE. This was the beginning of STAGE TWO. The point of inconsistency established motion, density, gravity, and heat. These properties created the stress which created an even greater inconsistency. As this process continued, enough FREE FROM GRAVITY was created to attract to itself with enough intensity to create the density necessary to form BASE ENERGY, then COMPLEX ENERGY, then BASE MATTER, and finally COMPLEX MATTER which is why gravity is a 3 dimensional force with specific intensity to all indivisible points that exists - energy. matter, or space occupied by free form gravity. LENSING - All things attract each other. That is why you can see something behind a star - the light is pulled toward the star thus it\u2019s path is curved. If you had stars well placed, light could be pulled into a circle trajectory. Complex matter is the end game for the building blocks of the universe. BASE MATTER forms at a single point, and is spherical do to the consistency of the environment in which it exists. BASE MATTER has maximum density, and like all things begins to break down even as it is created. The environment that allows the creation of BASE MATTER, prevents the individual particles from combining. Other wise, all matter would be one big mass. Because BASE MATTER is the smallest and densest particle possible, and is SPHERICAL. http://www.creationoftheuniverse.org/ For more info. ",

            "answer_text": "Because of the surviving particles after Big Bang. In fact there are so many stars, about 200 billion in our galaxy alone and there are trillions of galaxies. It is so huge and vast space that its unimaginsble. First gasses vere hydrogen snd helium, they formed stars as we know them today. All the stars in the universe were created from hydrogen and helium. As fussion occurs at the core of the stars star produce heavier elements. If the star is big enough it will fuse stoms until it starts fusing iron\u2026 At the beginnig of the universe there was about equall amount of matter and anti matter. Annihilation between the two happened and thre was little more matter than anti matter at the end. From that matter all matter was created. ",
