            "answer_text": "Tesla\u2019s college degree was in Mechanical Engineering. At that time, electrical engineering degrees and textbooks did not exist, and the electrical profession itself was just getting started. If a student wanted to become a designer or inventor, Mech-E was the path which offered the needed classes in mathematics and physics. What things did Tesla study? Everything. After reading every book in his father\u2019s home library, Tesla then tried to read the entire library at college, while staying awake around the clock, and while getting straight-As in all classes. The administrators contacted his father, fearing that Tesla was going to kill himself if not stopped. While a child, Tesla\u2019s father had tried to prevent Tesla from reading books until 5AM every day. He took away all Tesla\u2019s candles (this was before electric lights.) Tesla then made his own candles from scratch, plugged up all the light leaks in his door and windows, and continued to stay awake all night reading. But this time, his Father succeeded: he talked down about Tesla\u2019s perfect test scores. Tesla was crushed. He became a student delinquent, stopped attending classes, and spent all his time in bars playing poker for money. Tesla learned billiards and became a pool shark, which later helped make him money while in poverty in NYC. The police arrested Tesla for vagrancy, and took him home to his parents. See? EVERYTHING. As a kid he became expert with the slingstone, and build bows and arrows, and an \t\tarbalest which could put an arrow through an inch-thick pine board. He studied crow language, and managed to duplicate crow calls which would attract large numbers of birds. Tesla would do this while hiding deep in bushes, then bag all the crows which came to help the injured flock member. He made extra money by selling crows to butcher shops in town (for blackbird pie!) But he said it nearly killed him, when he was caught in the open by a flock of thousands. The mobbing started, and Tesla said he survived by squeezing into a fissure in a hillside. When Tesla was walking by a stream, and saw trout jumping occasionally, he flung a big stone and managed to cut one of the fish in half \u2026after having announced to his watching uncle that this was what would happen. The uncle called him \u2018Satan,\u2019 and wouldn\u2019t talk to him. ",
