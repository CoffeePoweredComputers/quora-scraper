            "answer_text": "The same way as any other planck unit is derived, i.e by combining the 3 universal physical constants [math]c, \\hbar[/math] and [math]G[/math] in suitable way so that it produces the dimension of mass. The right combination turns out to be [math]\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar c}{G}}[/math] which in SI units is approximately equal to [math]2.176 \\times 10^{-8} kg[/math]. ",
