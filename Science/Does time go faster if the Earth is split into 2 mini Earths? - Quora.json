            "answer_text": "This is a fun thought experiment that I invented to show that you don\u2019t need a leaning tower to prove (independent of atmosphere) that small things fall just as fast as larger things. If two objects are moving at the same rate/velocity then there is no special relativity or time dilation (between them). So, take a model Earth made out of clay, and then, break it into two equal model Earths. Will the whole clay sphere fall at the same rate as its two halves? The universe sees their cg (centers of gravity) between them the same as it was before (the same total mass), yet we have smaller spheres. Those spheres should fall at the same rate as the large one did. If all of the above is true, then it doesn\u2019t matter how mass is distributed in time, all of the individual cgs will fall at the same rate. If the Earth were split in two, then, each half would fall at the same velocity as the other half. Falling at the same rate means there is no problem of one relating to the other, or people on one relating to the people on the other. Because of this, there will be no time discrepancies between the two smaller objects. ",

            "answer_text": " If you lose your clock, time won't stop. If your clock stops, time won't stop. If the sun goes off and stop moving, the time will still go on. Time will NOT stop under any circumstances. Time does not depend on clock or on a day. Sometimes, a day (or a night) is 8 hours long, sometimes it is 12 hours long. One minute in a shorter day/night is exactly same as one minute of a longer day/night. A day could be short or long, but the time is always same. If the earth is splited into two smaller earths, that will spin quicker and will move around the sun quicker. The sun will set after about 4-6 hours of it\u2019s rising Yes, a day on that smaller earth would be 4\u20136 hours long. A night would have similar length. A year on that earth would be much shorter than our current world. Yes, the day, month, year, everything would be shorter. But, the time will be same (NOT faster). One minute on that earth would be exactly same as one minute on our current earth. Video : The longest queue ever  ",
