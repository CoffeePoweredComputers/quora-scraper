            "answer_text": "As we know that , when an atom absorbs the light the electron present in it get excited and jumps from lower energy level(stable) to higher energy level (unstable ) means jumps from ground state to excited state , so while returning back to ground state they emit light radiation and shows colour . So, when the electron returns back to ground state within the atom the coloured line is absorbed and each line is called to form line Spectra. Whereas when , large number of electrons return back to ground state and several coloured lines appears and they are closely spaced , means very close to each other form a band. Generally , it is studied under the branch of chemistry called spectroscopy . ",

            "answer_text": "To know about types of spectra, look at my explanation here. Band spectrum is almost the same as continuous spectrum over a small range. There are a large number of very closely spaced lines in this range, so that it appears to be continuous over the range. This means that the energies of the various levels are very close to each other, with almost no gap between them. If you like this answer, please upvote as a token of your appreciation. ",
