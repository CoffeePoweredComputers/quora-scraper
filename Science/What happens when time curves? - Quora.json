            "answer_text": "When time curves it usually slows down. Either near a strong gravitational field or a result of a high velocity movement . Whatever the case, it is that time with respect to some observer, because as you know , we are speaking relativity here, where time and space are ,well, relative, which means that they have meaning only w.r.t. some observer. Talking about time in general or in absolute term is nonsense . ",

            "answer_text": "Physics gets broken. Time is the ratio of Length over Light Speed. The ratio of Light Speed to Length is a constant so Time is absolute even though it not really a thing at all. It only dilates if we make incorrect assumption about Length and Time, as Einstein did. He assumed that Dimensions of Length were Uniform and Light Speed was constant. That can only be true if Time is constant which is basically Galilean Relativity. Instead he assumed Time was variable which is impossible given his postulates. David Wrixon EurIng's post in RQDVIII David Wrixon EurIng's post in RQDVIII ",
