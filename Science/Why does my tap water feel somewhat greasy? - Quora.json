            "answer_text": "Minerals in tap water change the surface tension of the water that affects the \u201cwetting\u201d affect that makes the skin feel slippery ( maybe slimy?) whne the mineral content of the water is low. Water that feels slimy or silky ( maybe greasy) is common with water that is treated with a water softener. A water softener removes some minerals ( calcium and magnesium) that change the \u201cwetting\u201d charactersitics of the water . It wets and covers your skin to greater extent and behaves like a \u201cbetter \u201c lubricant, resulting in a slimy feeling Some tap water is naturally soft without using a conditioner, based on the public water supply. I first noticed this affect from many years ago after I moved to the Jersey shore\u2026 seemed like i could never rinse the soap from hair, when in affect, the water was cleaner and just felt slippery. If the softness ( slipperyness) of your water varies throughout the house none of this makes sense to me Read the reference here...Explain the Slimy Feeling With Soft Water ",

Nothing in it, so nothing should be there. ph test paper is better than any pH reader\u2026.Controls should always be run. Any reader of pH must have 3 calibrators that must be on hand and must not yet be expired. Then the number read off the screen can be trusted.
