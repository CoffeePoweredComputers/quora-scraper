            "answer_text": "People sometimes shop for Realtors. Some people talk to few agents and figure out which agent is the best fit for their needs. Many times it\u2019s just a \u201cgut\u201d feeling. When you\u2019re shopping for a Realtor you should definitely tell us that you\u2019re doing this. We won\u2019t be offended at all, but be warned, we will duck out if you don\u2019t make a decision in a timely manner, and if we find out you\u2019re doing it and not telling us, we\u2019ll back out really quickly and write you off as \u201ccagey.\u201d Also, remember, while you\u2019re checking out the agents, these Realtors are also checking you out as a potential client. Realtors can pick and chose who they work with as well, so it\u2019s probably good to remember that you should also try to figure out if you\u2019d be a good fit for their style too. I\u2019ve turned down opportunities over the years because I knew that a particular personality wouldn\u2019t be a good fit with me, or because I just thought the potential clients were not being forthright with me. Being in a real estate relationship can be stressful, hyper focused and has financial strains on top of all that. It is much easier to cope and end up successful whenever you trust the person you\u2019re working with. These days you can even see client reviews, and learn about the past experience on the internet so you should be able to find good options and make a good Realtor decision quickly. Good luck. I hope you find a great agent and that your real estate experience is fabulous! If you find a good one you\u2019ll love it, I promise. ",

            "answer_text": "It is more typical to work with one realtor. It takes quite a bit of work on the part of a realtor to search out good listings that are likely to suit you and your spouse, then make appointments for viewings and take you around to see them. The realtor is working only for the potential commission on the purchase and will be sharing that commission with the selling agent. Most realtors will not give you their best effort if they know you are working with multiple agents. However, it does work sometimes, if you are looking for a home in more than one area, to work with a different agent in each area. If you do this, you should inform both agents ahead of time and make it clear to each which area you wish them to concentrate on. ",
