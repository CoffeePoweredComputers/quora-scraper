            "answer_text": "We know that for SHM, KE at maximum amplitude A is zero. Also that PE at this displacement is = \u00bd k A^2. where k is a positive constant of SHM This is also the total energy. Let the desired displacement be x We have Total energy = KE + PE At a point where KE = PE, above expression becomes \u00bd k A^2 = \u00bd k x^2 + \u00bd k x^2or \u00bd k A^2 = k x^2 or x = A/\u221a2 Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s say the amplitude of the simple harmonic motion is A and the total energy is E. So, at full displacement, the KE is zero and E = (1/2)kA^2 If KE = PE at displacement x, then (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)kx^2 = E/2 = (1/4)kA^2 x = A/sqrt(2) = .707 A ",
