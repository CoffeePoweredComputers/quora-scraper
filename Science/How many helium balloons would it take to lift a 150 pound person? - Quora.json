            "answer_text": "Q: How many helium balloons would it take to lift a 150 pound person? A: Weather balloons come in three sizes, the 3 ft the 8 ft and the 16 ft diameter models. They can lift 4 ounces, 10 ounces and 38 ounces respectively. How many needed to lift 150 lb? Using the 8 ft diameter model, that would be 150 X 16 / 10 = 240 of them. A thought on that 150 lb person: The FAA design rules for aircraft used to allow 170 lb per passenger. But that was then - women are lighter, but the average US male now is over 190 lb. Let\u2019s call it just 190 lb to be kind. That would take 190 x 16 / 10 in other words 304 weather balloons of 8 ft diam. ",
