            "answer_text": "Social sciences share a focus on human behavior, and cultural artifacts and other consequences of such behavior. They also share values and norms of objective, unbiased data collection, analysis, and conclusions. They differ in purpose and in their sources, forms, and ways of collecting and analyzing information, e.g., focus on historical, official statistical, survey, self reported, observed, or excavated data. Forms of data generally determine forms of analysis, e.g., qualitative or quantitative. Conclusions are expected to adhere to logical propositions free of \u201clogical fallacies\u201d or ideological, religious, racial, etc., bias. Social sciences are also usually explicitly oriented by philosophical assumptions, paradigms, theories, previous research, or prominent social issues that, i.e., all social sciences might focus on drug addiction, immigration, family patterns, etc., although not science in themselves, are often valuable guides to defining research problems, determining whether testable hypothesis exist or might be developed presently\u2014or if analysis and possible synthesis of existing theories from the literature; or basic research such as interviews or even participant observation of appropriate individuals or groups may be needed. In addition and legitimately, social sciences often provide context for essays that address greater or lessor social issues, going speculatively well beyond what can be directly supported research findings or commonly known facts, i.e., often dealing with the \u201cwhy\u201d of known patterns of human behavior that may or may not be common to all human societies, or only typical of some. In such instances, the social science based essay should be compared to positions based on folk, commonly sensed, ideological, propaganda, or other problematic views. Durkheim\u2019s work Suicide set a high standard by proposing a testable theory that extremes of social integration-disintegration are associated with corresponding types and epidemiology of suicides, e.g., \u201canomic\u201d deregulation evokes \u201canomie\u201d consciousness which contributes to suicide epidemics\u2014applying social theory and statistical analysis to a problem usually seen as explainable only individually from a religious, or philosophical perspective.
