            "answer_text": "There are two kinds of particles: Bosons, which follow Bose-Einstein statistics, and which can superimpose over each other. They don\u2019t interact with themselves, and you can have an infinite number on the head of a pin. These are mostly the so-called force carriers, which include photons, W and Z bosons (weak force), gluons (strong force) and hypothetically also gravitons. The massless ones (photons, gravitons) have the longest range and travel at the speed of light. Photons are spin 1 (polarized) and gravitons are spin 2 (as gravity is a bidirectional or always attractive field).Fermions, pretty much everything else, are spin 1/2, and follow Fermi-Dirac statistics, and cannot (normally) occupy the same space, or indeed, not even the same energy state. This is called the Pauli exclusion principle, but the resistance is not infinite and can be collapsed by a black hole. Most Fermions are charged + or -. except for neutrinos. Bosons which have identical quantum properties (e.g. wavelength) do not have separate identities. This affects the probability of finding them. Consider two photons in a box, and you plan to measure whether you find them in the left half, right half, or one each. The probabilities are as follows: 1/3rd - both photons on the left1/3rd - both photons on the right1/3rd - one photon on the left and one on the rightYou can think of this being because you cannot label the photons A and B. But in any case it is very mysterious. Fermions can\u2019t have identical quantum states, so you can think of this as being able to label them, and thus there are the following possibilities which are equally probable: 1/4th - A,B on left1/4th - A on left, B on right1/4th - B on left, A on right1/4th - A,B on rightP.S. 9/7/2020 - In addition to some interesting discussion in the comments, there is an experiment at LHC in which two photons coming together have sufficient combined energy to create a W-boson, see Large Hadron Collider Creates Matter From Light ",

            "answer_text": "Light is a wave that share one characteristic of particles (moving in straight line). Waves cross path, creating temporary interference. Then they separate and you would never know that they encountered any other waves. Electrons, on the other hand, act like tiny bolling balls. They are repelled from each other. The only way a CRT could create a clear image was using a conic shape beam where the electrons would come close to each other only at the very end, when they also collide with one of the color phosphor. The focus grid in the electron gun is a cylinder to which we apply about 1/3 the cathode voltage ; about 8 kv for 26 inch color tv. The electron start to spread, equally attracted by all sides of the positive cylinder. The next item in the electron gun is a smaller cylinder connected to 0 volt. The electron are pushed torward the center more gently\u2026this cone is very elongated , the tip expected at the front of the screen. ",
