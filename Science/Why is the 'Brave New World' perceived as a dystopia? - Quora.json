            "answer_text": "The comment by Sarath Avasarala is largely on the money.  It is perceived as a dystopia from the perspective of the author (and us, mainly given the relatively short gap between us and when the book was published - 1932). The author himself explicitly sought to depict a dystopia; both in terms of the collectivism (references to Soviet governance) and the 'assembly line' method of decanting - and then inculcating - human children (Henry Ford)  [1, my emphasis].    In Brave New World, Huxley contrives to exploit the anxieties of his bourgeois audience about both Soviet Communism and Fordist American capitalism. He taps into, and then feeds, our revulsion at Pavlovian-style behavioural conditioning and eugenics. Worse, it is suggested that the price of universal happiness will be the sacrifice of the most hallowed shibboleths of our culture: \"motherhood\", \"home\", \"family\", \"freedom\", even \"love\". The exchange yields an insipid happiness that's unworthy of the name. Its evocation arouses our unease and distaste.  But the real, direct answer to the question as stated is simply to be found in the author's own words in Brave New World Revisited (1958; my emphasis) [2]:   In 1931, when Brave New World was being written, I was convinced that there was still plenty of time. The completely organized society, the scientific caste sys\u00adtem, the abolition of free will by methodical condition\u00ading, the servitude made acceptable by regular doses of chemically induced happiness, the orthodoxies drummed in by nightly courses of sleep-teaching -- these things were coming all right, but not in my time, not even in the time of my grandchildren. I for\u00adget the exact date of the events recorded in Brave New World; but it was somewhere in the sixth or seventh century A.F. (After Ford). We who were living in the second quarter of the twentieth century A.D. were the inhabitants, admittedly, of a gruesome kind of uni\u00adverse; but the nightmare of those depression years was radically different from the nightmare of the fu\u00adture, described in Brave New World. Ours was a night\u00admare of too little order; theirs, in the seventh century A.F., of too much. In the process of passing from one extreme to the other, there would be a long interval, so I imagined, during which the more fortunate third of the human race would make the best of both worlds -- the disorderly world of liberalism and the much too orderly Brave New World where perfect efficiency left no room for freedom or personal initiative.  Thus, as to why it is perceived as a dystopia: it is because a writer of superlative skill deliberately and by design authored it to be so perceived; because he had fundamental and profound ideological objections to the logical end consequences he saw of societal changes within his own lifetime.  As to why a 2012 observer would perceive such a society in a negative light, aside from the author's intentions, that is another question =) [1] http://www.huxley.net/ [2] http://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/index.html#overpop ",

            "answer_text": "Because the conditions of your birth determine who you are-for your entire life. Chemicals like alcohol are injected into embryos so that the resulting human has a stunted growth, a lower IQ, etc. These people are in a caste system  with Alphas(intelligent, tall, and attractive) being at the top, and Epsilons(basically retarded midgets) at the bottom. Also, babies are hypnopaedically conditioned to be superflous and prejudiced.    Because the whole population is on a drug that basically makes you drunk without a hangover, for the purpose of avoiding all negative emotion. Not clinical depression, but literally, ANY and ALL negative feelings. Though it doesn't give you a hangover, people have a strong connection with it and RAGE if they don't get their daily ration of the drug. Who wants to knowingly live like that? Interpersonal relationships are shunned. Theres no such thing as devotion to one person, since everyone belongs to eachother and so they just have sex with whoever they want, whenever they want. The terms \"mother\" and \"father\" are obscenities.. Children are conditioned to not feel grief over death(given candy in a hospital for the dying) and as a result, aren't affected by the death of a friend or lover.   Art is dead. Besides reference manuals, there are no books.  No Shakespeare, no Dostoevsky, none of that. Nobody wants to read books anyways. Poetry is incredibly simple and mainly used for conditioning. So is music. Film is replaced by \"feelies\", porn with simple plots where you can feel what's happening on-screen happen to you.   If you dont confirm to the rules of this society, you're thrown into an Indian reservation.  its dystopian because life means nothing. The people are cells of a gluttonous being and are born happy, live in a continuous candy colored ecstasy, and die happy. Then the cycle repeats itself again and again and again. Life is empty. And did I mention all the consumerism?   ",
