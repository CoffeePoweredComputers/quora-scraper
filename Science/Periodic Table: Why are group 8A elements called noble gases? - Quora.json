            "answer_text": "The Noble Gases are called noble because at the time they were beginning to be discovered, they would not react with any other elements. They would remain pure and untainted \u2026 noble. The noble class of people in much of Europe during (mid 1800s) had quite the ego and thought they were pure and untainted \u2026 better than the rabble surrounding them. It was these widespread cultural ideas that led to slavery, even Civil War in the US. Abuse of the middle class in America and Europe continued until unions were able to muster the might of the many and get laws passed to protect the unwashed masses from the \u201cnoble\u201d people. Even today, people who work with iron, steel, tin, aluminum, etc (like mechanics, welders, sculptors, oilfield workers, construction workers, civil engineers, recyclers) are sometimes looked down upon stereotypically, while people who deal with more \u201cnoble\u201d elements like neon, gold, silver (jewelers, electronics technicians, petroleum engineers, neon artists, chemists) are thought of in a higher regard. If they were discovered today, we might not choose a term that represents our politicians, leaders or clergy. There is a lot of interesting history in the periodic table. In a way it is like a map of chemistry knowledge over time and looking at old maps shows how things have changed. ",

            "answer_text": "Because these gases were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, yet it wasn't until 1962 somebody found something one of these gases would chemically react with.In 1962 it was discovered that xenon reacts with platinum hexafluoride forming Xe+[ PtF6 ]- Over the years since that time a few compounds have been discovered for the other noble gases. However no neutral compounds have been discovered for Neon to date. ",
