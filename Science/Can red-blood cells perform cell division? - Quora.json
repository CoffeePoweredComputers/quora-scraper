            "answer_text": "Mature red blood cell (RBCs) lack DNA,nucleus and other metabolic systems needed for mitosis because it provides them a bi-concave shape to carry more oxygen and easily pass through capillaries where they have to move in a single row.Therefore if a cell lacks DNA,nucleus and other important metabolic system for cell division it will definitely not divide. RBCs are destroyed in liver and spleen after every 120 days and new cells are formed in red bone marrow. ",

            "answer_text": "No RBC does not have the ability to divide like other cells of the body. They lost their ability to divide in their development stage known as \u201corthochromatic eryhthroblast\u201d or \u201c late normoblast\u201d. The second point is that cell needs nucleus and their genetic material for division. RBC also lose their DNA in the stage mention above. These are unipotent target cell and died in reticuloendothelial system( spleen and macrophages) after completing their life span of 120 days. ",
