            "answer_text": "Dean's Blue Hole: The underwater sinkhole in Bahamas was believed to be the deepest in the world In general, sinkholes form in limestone rocks and are caused by the passage of weakly acidic rainwater. Limestone, a calcium-carbonate rich rock, is highly susceptible to dissolution by water containing carbon dioxide. This dissolution can create three common types of features within the limestone, grouped together under the generic term 'dissolution features'. These features include sinkholes, solution pipes and swallow holes. Sinkholes are depressions at the ground surface caused by the collapse of overlying chalk or superficial deposits into underground voids created by dissolution. Their shapes and sizes depend on the features of the underlying voids. The world's deepest underwater sinkhole was thought to be the Dean's Blue Hole in Bahamas, which measures 202 meters (663 feet) deep, before Chinese researchers made the announcement on July 22. The underwater sinkhole is located at 16.31 degrees north latitude and 111.46 degrees east longitude under the surface of the South China sea, according to China Radio International. It's situated near the disputed Paracel Islands, also known as the Xisha in Chinese and Ho\u00e0ng Sa in Vietnamese. Chinese experts measured the dimensions of the blue hole during field research between August, 2015, and June, 2016. With the help of equipment including sonar scanners, deep-sea current meters, underwater robots and underwater cameras, they found out the sinkhole is 300.89 meters (987 feet) in depth. They also measured the width of the sinkhole, which is 130 meters (426 feet) at the entrance and about 36 meters (118 feet) at the bottom. ",
