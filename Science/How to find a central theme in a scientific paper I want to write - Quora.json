            "answer_text": "I agree with the two answers that were given so far, from Jane Chin (\u9673\u76c8\u9326) and Roger Pearl. Another way to look at it is this (this is the way I was taught to look at it): what is the key question your research answers? There can be two or three \"specific aims\" meant to address this main question. Alternatively, addressing the main question can be one of your specific aims, and there can be maybe one or two other specific aims that address secondary questions - questions of lesser importance that are to be answered \"on the way\" to figuring out your main question. An example of the latter would be: you want to address a specific question and want to use one of two techniques to try to answer it. Maybe a secondary question is this: what are the challenges of the two techniques and which is more appropriate for answering my main question? Either way, you should be able to articulate one main question in the form of, well, a question, meaning one sentence ending with a question mark. So, think about this - what is the main question you were trying to answer when you started the research? What is the main question that your research actually did answer when it was all done and the results came in? Knowing these two things can help you formulate your plan for writing the paper. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming that the paper is not about your own research, and you\u2019re writing a paper for a course. Otherwise, you would know the central theme by now. The best way to go about this is the same way you would choose a research topic. First, become familiar with the literature in some subfield that interests. Then identify important unanswered questions in the field, based on the literature. Pick one of these and write a paper about it. The question you are going to address is the central theme. You might write much of it like a scientific paper without results, since you haven\u2019t done actual research to answer the question. But you would write an Introduction summarizing the results of others. Give a justification for thinking the question you picked is important. Then describe approaches one could use to answer the question. Finally, a summary. ",

            "answer_text": "Compose a single sentence that clearly states the problem you set out to investigate in your research. For a research project, this is usually stated as a question, but it also could be a complaint or a requirement. Remember, the problem is not the solution! They are two different sides of the same coin: the problem is the reason for seeking a solution. If you go to the doctor, the problem is your sore throat; the solution is (say) antibiotics and lots of fluids. The problem statement alone is a short statement of your \u201ccentral theme\u201d, the raison d\u2019\u00eatre for your research. You will find more help and a more complete answer to your question starting on page 181 of my book \u201cGetting It Right: R&D Methods for Science and Engineering\u201d, available at Amazon. Then, when you have time, please read the whole book. :-) ",
