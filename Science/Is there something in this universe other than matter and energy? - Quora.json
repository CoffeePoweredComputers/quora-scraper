            "answer_text": "What physically exists at the fundamental level are the quantum fields. These are continuous objects that occupy all of spacetime and that contain energy. There is no non-circular way to define \u201cenergy\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s just a conserved quantity that is \u201cwhat the quantum fields have\u201d, and which can be transferred between fields. Fields that are able to exchange energy are said to be \u201ccoupled\u201d. Discrete excitations of the field are called \u201cparticles\u201d. All matter as far as we know is made up of these particles. Note, \u201cmatter\u201d just means \u201cstuff\u201d, so the idea of \u201csomething that isn\u2019t made out of matter\u201d would be sort of nonsensical\u2026 wherever there is \u201csomething\u201d made out of stuff, then whatever the \u201cstuff\u201d is, it\u2019s by definition some kind of matter, even if that were a kind of matter we didn\u2019t know about yet! (One candidate for \u201ca kind of matter we don\u2019t know about yet\u201d is dark matter, if it exists). So, I guess the \u201cyes or no\u201d answer to your question would be \u201cno\u201d. There is nothing in this universe other than matter and energy. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "According to physicists, whatever we can see around us - including all the stars, planets and galaxies and so on, make up just 4% of the universe. The other 96% is made of something that astronomers can't see, detect or even comprehend. These mysterious substances are called dark matter and dark energy. Astronomers infer their existence based on their gravitational influence on what little bits of the universe that can be seen, but dark matter and energy themselves continue to elude all detection. Researchers haven't so far been able to figure out what dark matter is made of. A popular hypothesis is that dark matter is formed by exotic particles that don't interact with regular matter, or even light, and so are invisible. Yet their mass exerts a gravitational pull, just like normal matter, which is why they affect the velocities of stars and other phenomena in the universe. Dark energy is even more mysterious than dark matter. It's a relatively more recent discovery, and it's one that scientists have even less of a chance of understanding anytime soon. Scientists estimate that roughly 68% of the universe is dark energy. Dark matter makes up about 27%. The rest - everything on Earth, everything ever observed with all of our instruments, all normal matter - adds up to less than 5% of the universe. Science Mission Directorate ",
