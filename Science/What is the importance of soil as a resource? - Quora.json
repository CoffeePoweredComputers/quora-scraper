            "answer_text": "Soil is magical, even mystical\u2026maybe bc\u2026being realistic\u2026we all return to it\u2026 in a sense we are all part soul and soil. Soil is truly ancient too. Besides\u2026Pedology, soil science\u2026 fascinates me\u2026especially, the more I dig into it:) Soil\u2026good or great soil\u2026just doesn't appear overnight. In places\u2026that rich topsoil is the product of thousands (more on that in a bit) of years of rock formation, rock breaking down, heat and freezing and thawing cycles, volcanic activity, glacier deposits\u2026 rain, sediments, organic matter grown and organic matter returned to the ground and soil\u2026even deposited animal dung\u2026large and small creature's remains\u2026 This Indiana ground I'm walking on and working\u2026just a few feet under me\u2026used to be\u2026 an ocean floor. Midwest Southern Indiana was a warm water ocean\u2026 What's formed on top of that former ocean floor took 150+ million years of sediments to form\u2026those fossils I dug up a few feet down\u2026date to the Carboniferous period. Really\u2026below that just a few more feet\u2026could be dated 200 million years plus. What's 50 million years between fellow Quorans? Let that sink in. So soil\u2026takes \u201ca few\" years to form\u2026and if we are careless\u2026in just a few years\u2026it can be washed away\u2026via erosion and bad land management practices. It is a resource that we should both appreciate and care for\u2026besides\u2026in all seriousness\u2026 I like eating. ",

            "answer_text": "What did you have for lunch? It came from the soil. Maybe some plants had to go through some animals and get turned into meat first, but it originated from the soil. How about breakfast? It came from the soil. Same like lunch. Same like dinner last night. Etc. Etc. How about the oxygen you breathe? It came from plants that live in the soil. Plants change carbon dioxide into carbon (which stays in the plant) and oxygen that goes into the air. Before there were plants, there wasn\u2019t a lot of oxygen in the air. The above is an over-simplified version of what occurs but is nevertheless mostly accurate. If you are looking for a totally simple answer, just go with the first three paragraphs. ",
