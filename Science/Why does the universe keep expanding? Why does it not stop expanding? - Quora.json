            "answer_text": "\"Expansion,\" is a term that for me can be misleading. The reason is that if we can \"view\" the universe en masse', we'd have to admit that we are not the only \"present.\" -Light from distant objects are proof that the past is our future, as it streamstowards us. For all we know, it can be imploding and it simply appears like an optical illusion that it is expanding because we are defining a given frame in time-space. -But if we can \"shine the headlights\" (light) on the \"highways\" of the universe, we must admit, especially after Hubble Telescope proved that \"space is being created faster than the velocity of light\" that the \"future\" exists now in different locations of the universe. -This means that the \"geography\" of the universe is bigger than our particular anthropomorphic observation post. We can rely on trustworthy clocks and measurements, and perhaps even use these all over the universe. However, that does not dismiss any notion of a \"universal clock.\"-A \"universal clock\" would have measured and unmeasured time-space, and as such is pre-existent with a priori empirical events that we have not observed, until the light years have past. -Relativity speaking, of course, those distant frames may think of us as \"the future\" because their headlights can't see the \"stream of our light\" until they get the blast of some rock and roll and religion.

            "answer_text": "I believe what we don\u2019t understand about the complexity of our universe, could be explained & the answers found in another dimension, which in itself is hard enough to comprehend. The universe expanding could be thought in a way that if an explosion was created in another dimension, could our universe be the effect of that explosion & is that explosion still happening right at this time ? Then we look at time, i guess time would be of a different reference in that dimension because us humans created what's known as time, to keep track of everything from daily tasks to when the next event of an eclipse was due & the only real value time has is here on earth. So in fact if this is an explosion & still exploding outwards, then our millions of years could only be seconds for something in another dimension & if the universe is still expanding but suddenly stops, does it all end or stay this way ?
