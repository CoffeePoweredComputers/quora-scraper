            "answer_text": "55 million light years. A light year is the distance light will travel in a year - its a distance, not a time. Light travels about 180,000 miles per second. Multiply by the number of seconds in a year .. 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 = 31.5 million So a light year is 5.6 trillion miles - so the black hole is 312 million trillion miles away. And the light will have taken 55 million years to reach us. We see the object as it was 55 million years ago. ",

That kind of \u201cresearch\u201d is wishful thinking at best and total academic dishonesty at worst. We have been seeing an increasing amount of this in recent years. ",
