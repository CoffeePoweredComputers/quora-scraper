            "answer_text": " Sadly, I don\u2019t have a good answer and I doubt there is one.I\u2019m sure you are familiar with the derivation of the Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation and the typical answers to this question:  is the substrate concentration at which the initial velocity of the catalyzed reaction is half the maximal velocity ( if  )No sh**, Sherlock! I mean, this is not a real answer. so when  this is  , which is the dissociation constant of the enzyme-ligand complex.This is misleading. Added to the steady-state assumption, this answer relies on other assumptions. Not all enzymes are \u201cmichaelean\u201d, that is, the dependence between their initial velocity on substrate concentration is NOT a hyperbolic function. And even among the michaelean enzymes, few follow a 2 step reaction mechanism like MM proposed. So  is not a relationship between 2 or 3 kinetic constants, but a relationshiop between several of them, obscuring the actual meaning of it.I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, all the theory behind MM is very useful and mandatory for anyone interested in anything related to enzymes, but is not an all-encompassing theory of enzyme kinetics. It has its limits, and one of them is that  is little more than just a parameter, with little density of concept. I\u2019m sure there are people who disagree. I hope this can turn into a good argument about MM and enzyme kinetics. ",
