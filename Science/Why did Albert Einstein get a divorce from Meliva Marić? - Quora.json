            "answer_text": "Einstein was not a good husband at all. These are some of the reasons: He was a womanizer, and ran around on Mileva, even with his own first cousin, whom he later married. Mileva knew about it, but Einstein didn\u2019t listen to her pleas. He felt he had the right to do what he wanted.Mileva was a great physicist in her own right, but failed her final exams at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic, and never returned to retake them. She had always dreamed of being a renowned physicist, working with other great scientists, but ended up being a stay-at-home mother and a housewife. She became jealous of Einstein\u2019s success and notability. This caused many arguments and hard feelings.Einstein presented Mileva with a list of things she must comply to, if she wanted to stay married to him. His demands were not only cold and hurtful, they were impossible for two people living together with two young children. More power to her, Mileva refused to accept these terms.Mileva had always hated Berlin, and she felt she could not stay married to Einstein, even though she did not believe in divorce. Einstein agreed to give her the prize money when and if he won a Nobel Prize, if she would give him a divorce. Mileva weighed the odds, and felt sure her husband would eventually win the prize, so she agreed. She took the boys and moved back to Zurich, a city she loved. Einstein won a Nobel Prize in 1921, he kept his promise, and gave Mileva and the boys the prize money. It was a considerable amount. The man who changed our world, and gave us a new vision of the universe, could not save his own marriage. ",

            "answer_text": "There were two (not unrelated) reasons. One is that Einstein had reached a stage when he found it nigh on impossible to continue living with Mileva, in large part because they had very different personalities. The second is that he had started an affair with his widowed cousin Elsa Rosenthal conducted by correspondence since 1912, when he had met her in Berlin in the course of a short visit to investigate an offer for him to take up a major post as a theoretical physicist at the University of Berlin. Re Jan Layton\u2019s comment, Mileva did return to Zurich in October 1900 to prepare to retake the Zurich Polytechnic (later ETH) final diploma exams and to develop her diploma dissertation into a doctoral dissertation. She failed the exams again in July 1901 without improving her grade average, under the adverse condition that she was some three months pregnant with Einstein\u2019s child. She gave up on her doctoral dissertation shortly afterwards. A minor slip by Jan: Einstein had a professorship at the University of Zurich when he received the offer of a Berlin post in 1912. It was Zurich (not Bern) to which Mileva and their two boys returned after the couple agreed to separate in 1914 after Mileva had found it untenable to live in the same household with Einstein under the oppressive conditions he had set for her.
