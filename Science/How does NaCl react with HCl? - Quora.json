            "answer_text": "Sodium Chloride won\u2019t react with Hydrochloric Acid to form a new a chemical compound. But the solubility of NaCl will decrease due to the common ion effect. Let the concentration of NaCl is \u2018S\u2019 in an saturated solution. The solubility product Ksp will be the product of molar concentration of Na+ and Cl- ions. So, Ksp = S^2 If you add HCl of molarity \u2018x\u2019, let the solubility of NaCl will be S1. The concentration of Cl- will be S1+x and that of Na+ will be S1. So, Ksp = S1^2+S1*x In a fixed temperature, Ksp is constant. So, S^2 = S1^2 + S1^x It will not need rocket science to deduce that S1<S. The (S-S1) mole/L NaCl will be precipitated. This technique is uses to make NaCl or NaHCO3 or some other salt\u2019s crystal. It does not mean that the Cl- ions of the crystal will be just from initial NaCl. Cl- from HCl can be present in the crystal as well. But that\u2019s not what we call reaction except in purist sense.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t see any way in which they could be said to be forming new compounds. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid, fully dissociated into hydrogen ions and chloride ions in aqueous solution. Sodium chloride is extremely soluble in water (on the order of 350\u2013390 grams (nearly 6 mols!) of NaCl able to dissolve in a liter of water). Thus, the presence of Cl- ions from HCl isn\u2019t going to prevent NaCl from dissolving, adding more chloride ions, along with sodium ions, to the solution. NaCl + HCl \u2192 NR ",
