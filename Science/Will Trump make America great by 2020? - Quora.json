Did he keep in great in 2016, 2017, 2018, let\u2019s see so far in 2019 he\u2019s locked children up and taken them away from their parents, some have died ? He\u2019s advanced white supremacy quite a bit ( oh my\u2019bad) he did that in past years too lest we forget) He\u2019s done zero about gun control, shut down the government to build his stupid wall. ( is it there yet?) Insulted and degraded pretty much everyone who isn\u2019t HIM. Sucked up to KingJungUn and Putin some MORE\u2026 I could go on? But I think his tweets take the cake oh NO, my\u2019bad again! It had to be the photo he took with the 2 year old in ElPaso with his stubby little thumb in the air !! So, to answer your question. He\u2019s NEVER made America great. He\u2019s made us the laughing stock of the world and worse. He\u2019s degraded the office of the President of these United States. He will never make America great, E V E R! The best place for him is in jail when he gets voted out in 2020, THAT will make America great again, or at least we can start healing from this nightmare!

His tax plan is going to blow up the deficit, the republicans will \u201creform\u201d the social benifits system (read cut).His healthcare plans have already caused premiums to shoot up, and his other plans have shown to throw 20+ million people off of healthcare. (what happened to his claim: I will give everyone healthcare?)His enviromental stance will make the rivers of states where you guys drill for oil and gas to turn into industrial sludge.He is not going to make America great again. He is just going to make the wallets of the corporations great again. ",
