            "answer_text": "Polymerase chain reaction is a procedure conducted in the lab with the aim of amplifying a segment or segments of DNA. The main enzyme used is taq polymerase, which is similar to the DNA polymerase used in the cell to make new strands of DNA using the existing template. Taq polymerase is used because it is a thermostable enzyme. It was isolated from a heat tolerant bacteria, Thermus aquaticus. T.aquaticus is found in hot springs. PCR has 3 main steps: denaturation which is conducted at 94\u201396 degree Celsius, primer annealing at45\u201360 \u00bac and primer extension at 72 degrees Celsius. All the three steps are conducted above the normal human body temperature( 37\u00bac) hence the need of a heat stable enzyme. ",
