            "answer_text": "Despite our inability to currently travel beyond Solar System in a human life time, the nearer the planetary hosts, the more exciting they are considered. Hence, there is a general push or rush to discover the planets around the nearest stars. The closest system is Alpha Cen system with proxima Centauri holding a habitable planet. More planets are suspected to be present in the system. But these planets will be different from our own given the presence of three stars, two of which are around the size of the Sun. The planet goes around Proxima, and is in the \u201cclassical\u201d habitable zone. Now looking at the database, here is what I get from NASA Exoplanet archive for the closest exoplanets:  Systems like TRAPPIST-1, one with seven planets, are also close on the astronomical scale of things \u2014 39.6 \u00b1 0.4 ly or (12 pc);. These stars are faint, hence only the nearest one can be observed at all. Most of the common types of star in our galaxy are red dwarfs, stars with mass around 10% of the Sun. Given their high magnetic activities, planets around them will be different space weather. But usually red dwarfs are believed to have \u201crocky\u201d planets, and lacking Jupiter type of gas giants. ",

            "answer_text": "The closest star is the Alpha Centauri system. We know it has planets, but we don\u2019t know how many or a lot about what they are like. Even the closest star is too far away to resolve many details of planets. We have the traditional methods for discovering them and we can make some broad claims about what they might be like, but we need better telescopes or some kind of probe to have a great idea. Even something like Pluto, which is in our own system was a bit of an enigma until New Horizons went there to take pictures. ",
