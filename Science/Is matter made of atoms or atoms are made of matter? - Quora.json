            "answer_text": "It may be that the answer is no. First case.  Matter is probably not made of atoms.  As best we currently understand, atoms are merely a superconstruct, with subatomic particles being more fundamental.  Since atoms themselves are constructed of subatomic particles,  and since these subatomic particles can have independent existence (however fleeting in some cases) it would seem logical that they (atoms) should not be specified as the fundamental building blocks of anything, matter included. Second case.  Atoms are quite possibly not made of matter.  Certainly from one seemingly valid viewpoint, all \"particles\" (including subatomic particles) seem to be constructed from something like waves (or strings if you would prefer).  In fact, from this viewpoint, there may be no such thing as matter - it may be just a way that we perceive reality, and may be without any real substance (pun intended). ",

I mean, atoms are classified as the lowest point on the biological organization\u2026they make up all matter\u2026that\u2019s what you are taught in school, at least. But you know, atoms are made of quarks\u2026so, like I said, deep question\u2026I\u2019ll get back to you after 20 years of studying quantum physics\u2026after I get into college\u2026so, in 30 years :3. Can\u2019t wait to do it *Walks away thinking about how others ask the super deep questions and not understanding where they get them* O.o Iris (not even gonna say Boom, you blew my mind. O.o) ",
