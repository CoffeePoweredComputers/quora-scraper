            "answer_text": "Because we buy in to the marketing that we\u2019re bombarded with in all forms of media. We don\u2019t require nearly as high a level of hygiene as most of us partake in. We don\u2019t need daily bathing, but if we don\u2019t, we do exude an odor and others don\u2019t like it (in part because we\u2019ve gotten used to people not smelling), and since that\u2019s no longer socially acceptable (at least in many parts of the world), we bathe more often than we need or should. Many people have minor skin issues that are caused by too much bathing. Study after study has shown that raising children in too clean of an environment significantly raises the risk of allergies and asthma. Other studies show that kids who play outside in the dirt regularly have better immune systems. While I\u2019ve bought into the social acceptance of daily bathing, my now 9yo son takes a bath 2\u20133 times a week. He doesn\u2019t smell in between and does just fine. Once he hits puberty, that will most likely have to be adjusted to a daily basis, so he continues to be socially acceptable and is more likely to find a mate and continue his line of DNA. ",

            "answer_text": "Hygiene can be viewed at a high level or a low level. It can be viewed scientifically, socially, politically, medically, dentally, dermally. It can be over-valued or under-valued. It can be hyped by Madison Avenue to sell products, trends, and youth or it can just an Ivory soap bar 99.44% pure. It can be strict and sterile when performing open-heart surgery or lax and minimal when camping and hiking the outdoors. It can be serious when dating and finding a mate or comedic when listening to George Carlin. It can be required if traveling on a luxury 6-star cruise or requirement-free if hiking and hitchhiking through the interior and remote parts of China, Tibet, and Mongolia. Passports however do not have this \u2018option\u2019. It can be observed in candidates running for political office or unknown, media-free, and apathy-filled as in the Unabomber alone in his shack. In short, it can be observed, sensed, and recorded through any of the five senses, the various cranial nerves, and the brain. The degree and standards that humans see, smell, set, desire, flock to, and become obsessed with is no more and no less \u201cone standard\u201d as it is a \u201cvariable and variety\u201d of standards. Now ask the very same question but from a microorganism\u2019s point of view. ",
