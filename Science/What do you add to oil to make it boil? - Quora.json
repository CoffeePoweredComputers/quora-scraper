            "answer_text": "What makes oil boil? Heat makes oil boil. More precisely, heat causes the molecules to become more energetic, with more movement. When the movement of the molecules in a liquid, such as in oil, the liquid boils. It is the same process that causes water to boil when it is heated, though the amount of thermal energy that\u2019s necessary isn\u2019t the same. The temperature that is necessary is also greater the more pressure is applied to the liquid. This is because it takes the molecules more energy in order to move in high pressure situations. ",

            "answer_text": "A ridiculously large amount of heat. Water boils at 100 degrees, but most oils boil at upwards of 300 degrees. To raise the temperature to that level from room temperature is going to take a large amount of heat. ",
