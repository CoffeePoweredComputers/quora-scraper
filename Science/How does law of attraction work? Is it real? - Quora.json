            "answer_text": "It is real, but poorly understood. For example, \u201cthinking positive\u201d is not always a good way to attract what you want, and can actually be detrimental if applied incorrectly. It is actually pretty lousy advice for someone prone to OCD/anxiety/depression. While \u201cfeeling good\u201d about what you want definitely is one method of attracting what you want, all LoA actually requires is genuine belief that it will happen. So don\u2019t try to manipulate yourself into believing something that you don\u2019t actually believe, or your results will be inconsistent at best. It also has limitations, if the vibe you put out is getting a lot of interference patterns from the people around you, it will not work as well as it could (or at all, even). So if you want to manifest something, be damn sure not to share that desire/goal with someone who is not completely supportive of it manifesting for you. (and them saying that they support you is not always a good sign that they aren\u2019t subconsciously sabotaging you) There are also limitations brought on by the life contract you agreed to pre-incarnation. You can only attract things that align with what is allowed by your meta-self, which is the holder of your life contract. The more you align with your meta-self and agree to your pre-incarnation life path, the easier manifestation happens. For best results, try not to manifest \u201cthings\u201d, instead manifest \u201cfeelings\u201d. For example, you may want a lot of money because of the desire for freedom or security, well there are many paths to freedom and security, and money generally has some kind of strings attached to it, so that may not be the ideal way of manifesting those feelings. Ironically, focusing on hoarding a large stash of money is lack mentality, you are objectifying money and giving it too much power/importance. What you probably want instead is to be freed from money restricting you in some way. A vibe of manifesting freedom/flexibility to do what you want in life is a very different vibe than a vibe of acquiring money because you somehow believe it\u2019s a necessary evil/prerequisite... Or perhaps you are obsessed about a particular thing like a car in a certain model and color and whatnot, well you can attract what you want specifically, but perhaps you\u2019d be just as happy with something \u201cclose enough\u201d that can show up tomorrow instead of a year from now, so always be willing to accept \u201c\u2026or something equivalent\u201d/\u201c\u2026or something better\u201d. Being too much of a control freak about it can backfire. Once you really tap into the potential of this stuff, and really start to understand what is going on with it, you will want to surrender as much control to your meta-self (or \u201cthe universe\u201d, if you prefer) to bring the things into your life that you most want, because 90% of the time people think what they want is going to make them happy, but it\u2019s stuff they never could have predicted in a million years that pops up at random that brings them the most enjoyment. For best results with LoA, don\u2019t read books on it and follow other people\u2019s methods. Don\u2019t sit in a room all day visualizing and hoping for the best. Instead, quietly shift your focus to the things in life that have worked for you/made you happy/manifested in the past, especially the \u201csmall stuff\u201d. Figure out your vibe and then get out of the house and meet people, find out specifically what options you have to acquire the things you want/need, that sort of thing. Follow the white rabbit\u2026if some small curiosity tugs at you, see where it leads instead of ignoring it as silly or inconsequential. LoA is more about getting out of your own way and stopping making stupid excuses for why you can\u2019t believe that you\u2019ll ever have what you want than it is about focusing intently on \u201cmanifesting\u201d. Your beliefs have to be \u201crealistic\u201d enough for you to actually believe them to be possible. Start small with outcomes that you\u2019re not overly attached to, and work your way up to bigger and bigger things. Too much attachment is detrimental to the process. Personally, I don\u2019t like LoA that much and prefer chaos magick\u2026technically it\u2019s tapping into the same pool of \u201csource energy\u201d to manifest what you want, but having a bit of ritual and making it fun by doing your own thing intuitively is far more powerful IME than affirmations and visualization and thought policing. It is more focused and easier to detach from, you do your ritual and send out the energy/reprogram your vibe, and then let go with calm assurance that it is happening magically in the background, and all you have to do is recognize and follow the breadcrumbs when they present themselves. But that\u2019s just my experience, ymmv. Like I said, really get honest with yourself about what has worked well for you in the past, and then do more of that. ",

            "answer_text": "No it is not! Law of attraction is fictional \u201claw\u201d. By the principles of law of attraction if you visualize you will attract that what you visualize. So by this simple \u201cprinciple\u201d you can test it yourself. If you fail to attract what you want that simple means that it doesn't work. Most people try for years to use law of attraction in order to attract desired items, but instead of attraction they accomplish nothing at all. From time to time prople will have coincidences and they will claim that LOA works, when in fact it doesn't. For example person will visualize car, and couple hours later they will see that exact car on the street, and they will say that this is message from the universe that visualization works. LOA teachers have all kinds of manipulative techniques in order to convince you to buy another book if for some strange reason LOA won't work for you. And they will always blame YOU because you faild to use principles so simple even children use them. My question is, why so many books when you just need to visualize? It is simple technique why so many literature on simple law? Answer is simple, so they can make more and more money on something that doesn't exist. You need to understand that all LOA authors, (and even motivation speakers) never accomplished anything before releasing books or giving lectures. For example Napoleon Hill wrote best selling LOA book of all time, think and grow rich. Couple of researchers found out that he never meet Mr Carnegie, let alone work for him. There is no evidence that he even encounter any of the person he claims to interview in his book. There is not a single evidence that indicates claims he wrote in his books. Be careful, LOA is generating billions of dollars, LOA is business nothing else. Same as motivation speakers, you will never hear anything useful that will help you in your life. All motivation speakers say: you need to invest in this and that, but not a single one of them will give you specific tips on investment that you can use in real life. If you try principles from LOA and fail to accomplish anything, that simple means it doesn't work. It is that simple. But people love to live in delusions and they will try everything to defend belief that there is some law that will magically bring you car, more money or whatever. Most of them think they will attract lottery winning ticket lol. I can't believe how many times I saw and heard that they trying to win lottery with LOA. This shows you that LOA is for lazy people who thinks there is something for nothing. When I ask people what exactly did you attract with LOA? Answer is always: I didn't accomplish anything yet but I'm seeing all this sign around me that it works. Don't get me wrong i have nothing against LOA and motivating people, let everyone do what they wants and believe what they wants to believe. I'm just a devil's advocate. ",
