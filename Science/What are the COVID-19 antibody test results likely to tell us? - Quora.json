            "answer_text": "Technically, it would tell you if 1. a person had been exposed to Covid-19 2. within a period of time sufficient for their body to produce enough antibodies to detect. Closer to English: It takes about five days after exposure for symptoms to appear. It was recently reported if someone is tested 4 days prior to >symptoms<, more than 85% will test negative for antibodies. At two days prior, it is like 25\u201330% will still test negative. This is because their immune system has yet to produce enough antibodies to be detected. (Note, this study did have some weaknesses, but the above should remain relatively true.) Also, if you have had the virus, and it has \u201crun its course\u201d - meaning one recovered or one died, the person\u2019s blood will test positive, showing the exposure and the immune system response. If living, the person will retain these antibodies for as yet an unknown length of time. A most important and sought-after unknown. ",

            "answer_text": "The Covid 19 blood antibody tells us that person has had Covid 19 and has some protection against the virus.This person may have been asymptomatic or had the disease with fever cough and body aches( symptomatc). We do not know how long this protection will last and some experts think that a person may get this infection for the second time. The swab test will tell us if a person has the infection that time or not. If the swab test is positive that person should be isolated. This is why we need both the swab test and the antibody test to control this disease. ",
