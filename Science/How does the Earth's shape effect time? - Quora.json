            "answer_text": "Time isn\u2019t really a tangible or observable phenomena, it is completely relative to the speed of an object, as well as the mass and the location of the observer. Rather, time is what affects earth\u2019s shape as various environmental processes (like erosion and tectonics) and other processes like the differentiation of Earth happen over time. If I set a dense cylinder on a granite block, for example, it would just sit there, but if I left it there for a million years (that\u2019s the time) then the granite block (aside from flowing ever so slightly outwards) would show deformation due to the overlying weight of the cylinder. What I\u2019m essentially saying is that Earth does not affect time, time affects the Earth. ",

            "answer_text": "Very good question. The Earth is shaped by space-time which may be inferred by the fact that the rate of time is the same across it's surface (that is clocks run at the same rate relative to each other). There is a difference for example where we compare sea level to the top of a mountain but of course the tendency is for the surface to smooth out over time. Because the Earth is shaped by space-time and because it is rotating it is not a sphere but elongated at the equator which maintains the rate of time. ",
