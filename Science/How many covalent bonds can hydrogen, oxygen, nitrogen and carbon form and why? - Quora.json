            "answer_text": "Covalent bonds are those formed by sharing one or more electron pairs (here I am deliberately neglecting particular, unusual, cases). Hydrogen can form only one covalent bond, by pairing its only electron with another unpaired electron of another atom (of hydrogen or other element). Oxygen usually forms two covalent bonds, or a covalent double bond, in the same way as hydrogen did; actually, it has two unpaired external electrons (aka valence electrons). Sometimes oxygen forms just one covalent bond, by acting as acceptor of an electron lone pair provided by a donor atom; in this case, the covalent bond is designated as dative bond, or coordination bond. Very seldom, oxygen can make three covalent bonds, one of them being dative, but with oxygen acting as donor of one of its two lone pairs; this occurs, for instance, in carbon monoxide (see down the text). Nitrogen usually forms three covalent bonds, because it has three unpaired external electrons; these bonds may be three single bonds, or one single and one double, or one triple bond. Sometimes, the covalent bonds of nitrogen become four, when it acts ad donor of its electron lone pair to form a dative bond with a suitable acceptor atom, endowed with an empty orbital or of an orbital that can be made empty. Carbon in most cases forms four covalent bonds, inasmuch it promotes an external s-electron to a p-orbital, thus obtaining four unpaired electrons, and contextually choosing for those electrons the kind of hybridization that is the most suitable for the number and kind of bonds it is going to make. Keep in mind that to the formation of a bond corresponds an energy release; so, the bound system is more stable than the unbound one. These four bonds may be four single bonds, or one double and two single, or two double (rather uncommon), or one triple and one single. Sometimes, carbon makes only three covalent bonds; it occurs when it does not move an s-electron to a p-orbital, thus conserving an empty p-orbital; in this case, it can act as a lone pair acceptor in a dative bond. The most famous case of this kind is in carbon monoxide CO: between the two atoms there are two \u201cusual\u201d covalent bond and a dative bond. Other cases are, for instance, diazomethane and fulminic acid. Last, very seldom, carbon can make only two covalent bonds, by employing only its two unpaired electrons; the most famous case of this kind occurs in (some forms of) carbenes. ",
