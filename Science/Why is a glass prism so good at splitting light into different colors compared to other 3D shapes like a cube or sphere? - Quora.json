            "answer_text": "I suspect you mean a triangular prism, popularized by Isaac Newton and Pink Floyd.  First, you need to know that light commonly consists of waves with a variety of energies or wavelengths, which we perceive as different colours from blue, green, to yellow, orange and finally red on the lower end of the energy spectrum. In a ray of sunshine, they all travel together towards your eye and \u201caverage out\u201d to a yellow-white colour. However, in a material such as glass, which is optically dense, waves of higher energies (bluer) will travel faster than the less energetic ones (redder). In other words, when the mixed-colour ray hits the air-glass boundary, the rules of propagation suddenly become different for the various colours, with the more energetic ones taking a different trajectory (bending more from the original route) than the others. Now if you had a rectangular prism, eg a windowpane, all the wavelengths of light face a totally symmetric situation when they leave the glass and go back into the air. You effectively reverse the process of spreading out the colours and the rays will emerge at the same angle at which it entered the pane. So if you want to take the phenomenon which takes place inside the glass out into the air and visualize it, by projecting it onto a surface, you need the second face to be at an angle to the first. That way, the individual colours will hit the wall at different angles, and spread out even more. The neatest way to achieve this is with a triangular prism. ",
