            "answer_text": "This questions poses a lot of subjective and variable answers. It depends on types of home owners, the affordability, safety. below is what i have analysed . Safety - Meaning there are thousand of stories around about break ins , scam cases and fraud cases . Even in USA, almost every household owns more than one gun or other weapons. Try and knock on their door and see if they point a gun at you. There are too much Ads and posters everywhere. chances to be seen is a questions. and Ads & posters are just 1 sec thing, it is a waste of money. Phone calls, nowadays, unknown calls can be block automatically from any phone. TV Adverts, You got to be seriously rich to put ads on the TV. if you are rich why you need more sales unless that is not enough for your rich pockets. Internet marketing, since it is widely available and widely been used\u2026 chances of getting seen is also very costly and not effective at all. Hold Convention and meeting or gatherings and free products ? Mostly pyramid BIz will do that\u2026 There are so many people joined, and as said\u2026 since it is pyramid where do you stand ? at the top ? at the middle ? or the last row ? So finally the best way is thru known friends or partners. that will be the best way. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to get more home buyers is to pursue public policies that create more good jobs, jobs that feel stable, jobs that pay enough to allow the people in those jobs to save up money for a down payment and eventually feel confident enough in their futures to take out a 30 year mortgage. Supporting labor unions and the rights of workers in general is a good way to do this. Encouraging investment in the technologies that will build the future (sustainable fuels, solar, etc.) is a good way to do this. Giving tax cuts to big companies who then close plants and move jobs abroad is not a very good way to do this. Propping up coal plants is not a good way to do this. ",
