            "answer_text": "There are two possible reasons and it's often a combination of both these factors. Babies are often born with a lighter eye and hair colour than the one they are going to have later on. This is because the production of melanin (the pigment responsible) usually starts very slowly. Babies who later have hazel or brown eyes are often born with blue eyes for the same reason. Also, during puberty the melanin production changes again, often it increases, resulting in a darker hair colour than during childhood.During childhood, the hair on the head is very fine, individual strands of hair are very thin. Also, most children spend a lot of time outside, so they get a great amount of sunlight. The UV rays in sunlight break down some of the melanin, thus bleaching the hair, and because it has such a fine texture, this happens relatively quickly. So you almost never see the 'original' hair colour on a small child, but almost always the 'sun-bleached' colour. Then, during puberty, because of hormonal changes, the hair often changes texture, individual hairs become thicker, and people who used to have straight hair might get wavy hair instead. The new, thicker hair strands are more resistant against the bleaching (called 'weathering') by the sunlight, and the hair colour appears darker.",

            "answer_text": "Quite often it\u2019s an inherited tendency. Dad had strawberry blonde hair, and Mom was a brunette. Two of the four children had strawberry blonde hair as children, and mostly kept it, only a little darker than when they were young. The other two were blonde as young children, one of the two was extremely blonde as a child. Both of them had hair that darkened by middle school. Mom the brunette parent, was blonde as a small child, and one of her brothers had hair even lighter as a child. As teenagers their hair darkened. So I\u2019m pretty sure that sometimes the tendency of blonde children to have darker hair later goes by family inheritance. I don\u2019t have enough information to generalize to people who aren\u2019t in my family though. ",
