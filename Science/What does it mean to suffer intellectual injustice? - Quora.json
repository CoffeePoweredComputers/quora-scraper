            "answer_text": "I will take a stab at it. The right wing of America ridiculing those who worked their asses off to go to university, and achieve higher education, is intellectual injustice. They call us elitest. They despise that we made a choice to learn. They do everything possible to demean \u201cliberal\u201d institutions, education and educated Americans. They do everything possible to defund schools and dumb down America. They trap young students in endless student loans and do everything possible to make education unaffordable. Perhaps if they actually read and worked at it, they could go to school too. They are too lazy to work hard at learning; so they demean those who do. That is the epitome of intellectual injustice. Everything is done out of fear that they can't stand on their own two feet and compete against others who decide to get an education. ",
