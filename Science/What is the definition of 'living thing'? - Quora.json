            "answer_text": "This isn't exactly your question, but I remember an acronym I used to use in bilology for the 7 characteristics of living things... Or what classified something as animate as opposed to inanimate.  G-Growth.O-Organisation R-ReproductionA-AdaptationC-CellsE-EnergyR-Response Here's the explanation:G - All living organisms grow, to some amount. Even amoebas grow before they divide.O - Living organisms are organised, complex creatures, even signle celled organisms have the same basic layout of the cell.R - The goal in life is to replace yourself. Therefore, all living creatures must have a means by which to reproduce (even if they are sterile, like mules, which are biologically speaking, failures)A - All organisms can adapt to their surroundings, both in their own lives, by changing behaviour, and over many generations through natural selection.C - Cells are the basic building blocks of life. If you aren't cells, you ain't alive.E - All living things must consume and use energy, via chemical reactions, to survive, reproduce, and do nearly everything else on this list.R - Similar to adapt, response means that an organism can detect external stimuli, and act accordingly, but this differs from adaptation in that is is not neccesarily a change that is, shall we say, ling lasting. Looking at this list is what allows scientists to decisively decide whether or not to classify something as living, though more and more often, they are finding things that push the limits of what we thought was alive or not.

            "answer_text": "Conventional wisdom has been that somehow living things in general are \u201cspecial\u201d and we humans among them are \u201ceven more special\u201d having special qualities like soul, consciousness, thought and what not. To me that is the \u201creligious\u201d point of view that invokes special and supernatural concepts without proof, or even a shred of evidence. From the point of view of a physicist, everything in the Universe obeys the same laws of physics, so nothing can be special. So then why do living things seem special and how and why are they fundamentally different from non-living things? The answer is, in one word, software. Right down to the molecular level. All living things are built according to software encoded within the genetic code of DNA molecules. And therefore it follows that all living things are essentially computers, where \u201ccomputer\u201d is defined as an intelligent system that has software running on its hardware. That hardware must therefore necessarily include the means to store and retrieve information, analyze such information and alter its behavior according to the result of such analysis (aka memory, cpu, I/O). Such a simple computer system, like a single cell, is not \u201cconscious\u201d because it is not equipped with much sensors to actively engage with its environment. But more complex life forms, and in particular all animals, do have sensors that allow them to consciously interact with their environment. In particular, they can sense and intelligently respond to threats, seek food for energy and growth, and find mates for sexual reproduction. Of those 3 key abilities of \u201cliving\u201d computers (acquired as result of evolution over a very long time), the most advanced man-made computers, such as autonomous cars, have only recently developed the first ability, viz., to sense and intelligently respond to threats. They are however still like babies at a very early stage, but they will no doubt learn and mature with experience. You don\u2019t have to agree with this point of view, but I wanted to be clear that there is an alternative, and far more logical and self-consistent, viewpoint today than what is traditionally accepted as conventional wisdom.
