            "answer_text": "There are, I think, maybe three possible reasons. One, if you have a Betta fish, the fish may have made a bubble nest, which is quite normal for these fish. It\u2019ll eventually break up, but they\u2019re kind of fun while they last. If you just did a water change, there may be tiny air bubbles coming up for some time, but it is temporary and quite harmless. But, if the water surface has a film on it, one that looks a bit like gasoline or oil on the water, or slightly cloudy, that\u2019s a protein film. It\u2019s very common, not particularly dangerous, and it can easily trap air bubbles at the surface so they don\u2019t break and vanish as they usually would. The fix for protein films is to disturb the water surface enough to break it up, and once you do that, it\u2019ll disappear. An air stone can work, or aim a small pump or filter upward so the water flow from it disturbs the surface just enough to get rid of the film. ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t see the surface of the water so I don\u2019t know what bubbles you are seeing. But anytime items go in the aquarium there will be air that escapes. And when you add water, let it settle so \u201call\u201d the air bubbles escape before you use it. But, then again, if you pour it quickly that there can be air bubbles as well. All should settle down. If there are bubbles on the glass, just run your hand over it and they\u2019ll disappear. ",
