            "answer_text": "In terms of simple summary statistics for data populations, the three \"C's\" [Communication, Credibility, and Convergence (on \"truth\")] are reasons why statistics are important in research. Communication - Expressing or communicating your results in numbers (statistically based) is a powerful way to convey your findings versus using terms like \"almost as large as\" or \"slightly greater than\".  What is \"slightly greater than\" to one scientist may not mean the same thing to the next scientist.  The numbers, and testing of the numbers to find real, \"significant\" differences in populations, is a necessary form of communication for scientists.Credibility - Use of numbers also provides an air of credibility to scientific studies.  Use of statistics requires forethought and statements about experimental design, methods, and data base structure. The numbers also force you to formalize your thinking about hypotheses and how best to ferret out meaning from your data.Convergence (on \"Truth\").  Truth?  What is truth?  When it comes to scientific research, a goal of our work is, through the use of data, to converge on principles, laws, and data relationships that inform us about how nature operates. Numbers and statistics help us gauge this progress and to heighten our confidence in the results. So, in summary, remember the 3-C's!  The 3-C's are a simple recap of why statistics are important in research. ",

            "answer_text": "Research is about expanding our knowledge about our environment. In order to handle its complexity, we describe it using statistics. If it is well done, it allows you to describe a phenomenon in a precise manner. Being precise means that you have an unbiased measure of the phenomena that you want to explain and how it interrelated to other factors. This is mainly what research is all about and so, by using the tool correctly, you could yield to a breakthrough in your field. On the other hand, statistics could be harmful for the development of science. Most of contemporary research is about measuring new phenomena in a more precise manner. For instance, demography used to be a literary science where people have to write down their thoughts in order to explain the dynamics of the population in a broader sense. To my knowledge, they have been one of the first social sciences integrating statistics. Such change leads to a decline in the complexity of the models developed, it bounded researchers to analyze (more or less) simple relations between variables. They stopped pursuing their theory based on their thoughts and preferred to use statistics to be more \u201cprecise\u201d. Another issue is nowadays well-known from economists, we describe it as \u201cmeasurement without theory\u201d. The availability of datasets for a couple of decades stimulates the use of statistics to describe things which used to be unmeasurable. So far, a bench of economists piled up really advanced statistics (where most of the hypotheses are not verified) without contributing to the theoretical development. To sum up, statistics are cornerstones for the development of science in a short run. On the other hand, it could be harmful for our way of asking new questions in research if researchers focus on statistics modeling instead of making their field going further. ",
