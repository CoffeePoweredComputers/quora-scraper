The \u2018ball-and-stick\u2019 model works well for teaching and exploring general chemistry concepts. Models involving bond angles and energies become more important when exploring rates of chemical reactions. For detailed knowledge of processes and intermediates you will probably have to dive headfirst into the abyss of physical chemistry. Have you asked your question of Wikipedia? ",
