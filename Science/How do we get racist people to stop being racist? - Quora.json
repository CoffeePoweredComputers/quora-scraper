            "answer_text": "My own family has a deeply sad and brutal relationship with racism so this question really hits a nerve. Both my mother's side of the family and also my father's side has an unfortunate history with racism which runs deep and ugly. One side has a happy ending, the other does not. Racism is a social problem and can involve group behavior, yet at it's root is is an individual perception issue. So the crux of the issue is how to alter individual people's perceptions of those of a differing race. Sounds like a highly improbable pipe dream? My grandmother is a case in point that people can change their racist views. Grandmother Lillian was a racist individual who changed her mind after positive one on one contact, consistently over time completely exposed her to individuals of color, and she did a 180 degree whole-hearted change in her views on race. My grandmother was an Appalachian poor white woman in Tennessee coal mining country who detested black people and really any people of color. So the ultimate irony is her son, my father, married a hispanic woman, my mother, when working onsite in Texas where my hispanic mother was the office secretary. Love bloomed, marriage followed. My grandmother was beside herself, but she loved the resulting grand babies, my sister and I. Someone mentioned this in their answer than contact with mixed race children can alter a racist's perceptions of discrimination and I think for my Grandmother this was true as she softened a bit, but not totally in her racism. Then years later on my Grandmother became ill and guess who is her devoted and super kind daily at-home aid? An angelic black woman named Ruby who cared for her until her death. So the two people who washed Lillian, fed her, cared for her until my Grandmother's dying breath were ** drumroll** totally dark skinned people. Fate has a good sense of humor sometimes. My grandmother Lillian doted on Ruby and felt a fierce sense of loyalty to her, and grudgingly learned to admire my own hispanic mother and the resentment about dark skinned people faded in time. She realized her own distorted views on race were purely based on a stupid social construct house of cards and they all crumpled to the floor. However, not one single government entity can legislate anti-racism thoughts. Sure, legislation can make it against the law to dish out racist-based action in the work place, or in housing, or other areas of social contact. Society can exert change toward racism by making outward forms of racism illegal, difficult to achieve, and be considered gauche or socially in poor taste. But the pure change of heart, the hidden deep inner views on racism don't even exist within the domain of social laws, but rather it lives and breathes in the realms of psychological and cognitive issues, and is a highly individual subjective thing. How can laws change psychological views? Laws cannot change inner personal psychology. However, over time shifts in society do happen. Look, just a bit over 150 years ago blacks as slaves was considered simply doing business, so society and social norms do shift over time. The dark sticky and ugly reality of racism is something which permeates all societies around the globe, sometimes overtly and often moreseo covertly. All those advertisements in various cultures such as India on how to obtain whiter skin for women? Yeah, that is racism just as much as a shouted spittle-flying racial slur, it just doesn't seem as oppressive or hostile while existing uncomfortably but more benignly under the cover of \"beauty.\" Even business can be complicit in perpetuating racism if it makes a buck doing so. How can we stop people being racist? We give people more opportunities for one on one contact with those of differing races, to allow for more face to face contact. Laws don't alter people's views on those of other races, rather one on one personal contact can. This made a difference for my grandmother. Getting to know ONE black person up close and personal in an organic way which unfolded over time was the magic ticket for my Grandmother. She learned that people are people regardless of their skin color, but that \"aha!\" understanding took time, it took extended contact and a genuine connection to Ruby to unlearn all her racism. Whether that means keeping some affirmative action quotas or mixing up races as often as possible in efforts to get races in contact with each other, I don't know. But this is tricky business as sometimes forced intervention to undo decades and centuries of racism can backfire and races can feel pitted against each other when integration is a zero sum game of competition for spaces in school, or jobs. The nuance often gets totally lost and racism can often grow as a result of too heavy handed an effort at anti-racism or anti-discrimination social engineering. Genuine change is often not a matter of legislation. Racist people only stop being racist when their world view is not only challenged it is upended entirely and a personal friendship with someone of a differing race which blossoms organically isn't something which can be legislated or forced but it can be encouraged due to circumstances. One friendship can make a huge difference, one deep genuine contact. One person can change it all. ",

            "answer_text": "You may as well have asked how do you get people to stop being people. All people are racists in the extant definition of \u2018racist\u2019. If you are a black person and call black people who hate white people; racists, it means you are in some sense disloyal to your own people. Same with white anti-racists\u2026aren\u2019t they anti-white? Our problem lies with the definition being \u2018mis-coined\u2019 and it becomes more clear when we use the term \u2018racist\u2019. A racist is not necessarily a person that hates all races or some other race. A racist same as a florist, is an expert of the subject. Racial realism is really what racism really is. Let us face it, there are different races otherwise the word \u2018race\u2019 would have been superfluous. There are races because they are different. North Koreans are probably the most intelligent people on this planet, and they are closely followed by other Asians, the Dutch, Germans and sadly further down the IQ chain, Americans and the British. The lowest on the IQ chain, are the Pygmies with an average IQ of about 60. Pygmies are often \u2018kept as pets by other Blacks!\u2019 All the racists and anti-racists now have to do, is to see what the lesser and higher IQ make a people. It is not impossible for a profoundly gifted child, IQ > 180, to become born among Sub-Saharan Blacks, and the same with a Forest Gump among the Americans. Then with all of this in mind, imagine the hate of a Black that can never own a motor car unless he steals it, or the brilliant and smart young woman whose husband was killed due to the higher crime rate of Blacks in America. This is where racial hatred originates and the only solution is racial segregation. In the post Apartheid RSA, we have openly reversed racism and more than 10 white farmers are killed by Blacks daily. Racism had all along been there on both sides \u2018of the color line\u2019. Racial tolerance and indoctrination is the emerging situation with racial realism. Both are one step short of capitulation and total racial miscegenation; a coffee colored people who already make up the far greater majority of the demographic and coincidentally the lower IQ. Can we blame really smart people from feeling their and their progeny to be threatened? ",

            "answer_text": "Patience and education. You don\u2019t stop it by acting like the stereotypes.You cannot force people to stop being racist. Calling them racist is also pointless. People like me know they aren\u2019t and the jerks just don\u2019t care. You don\u2019t stop it with doing some more racism. Example (if you\u2019re white act like this, if you\u2019re a person of color act like that).You don\u2019t stop racism by dividing humanity to white people and everyone else (people of color), I cringe everytime I see people refer to the whitest of Asians as people of color. No really, If there\u2019s a term I absolutely loathe it\u2019s the \u201cpeople of color\u201d. The fact is, racists are oftentimes afraid. And in these times, I see politicians instilling even more fear into people. Because it\u2019s profitable for them. Saying something like: \u201cI\u2019ll remove all the islamists from our country\u201d will get you votes and praise, despite being a completely stupid and unrealistic claim. That\u2019s why we require patience and education, so people stop falling for demagogic crap. And also to recognize brainless counter-intuitive claims like \u201cMy best merit is being a woman\u201d. Being a woman is not a merit, you can\u2019t fool me with populist bullshit like that.Also, Dondald Trump happens when you are agressive towards people. Many of them voted for him out of spite. Because they are sick of bullshit and authoritarian behaviour. Despite the \u201cleft\u201d claiming to be open-minded, tolerant and unprejudiced, they are the exact opposite of what they claim to be. As an outside observer, I think the political left in America isn\u2019t that much different from the right. Everyone is racist and full of stupid (really, really stupid) prejudices. The only difference is the people they hate. And this is where education steps in. So people from both parties will stop being racist. We must make them understand that forming prejudices and agressive behaviour is not the act of tolerance. And most of all, we must make them stop using the term \u201cpeople of color\u201d because it causes world famine and kills kittens. ",

            "answer_text": "In my 29 years of life, I\u2019ve increasingly noticed that if I want anything to change in any kind of situation, lecturing doesn\u2019t work. If I\u2019m in an argument with someone and I really want them to understand my feelings, treating them like they need to be educated or \u201cenlightened\u201d has never been successful long term (or short term really). Nor has attacking people personally, regardless of how wrong they are. For instance, in my experience \u201cshut up and listen old privileged white man\u201d rarely is responded to with, \u201csure, I\u2019m so sorry about the way I was acting\u201d. Haha, yeah no, these tactics rarely garner reflection and change. Instead they incite and provoke deeper hatred and violence towards people like me. It\u2019s widely assumed that \u201cawareness\u201d is the answer to all the world\u2019s problems. It is an easy solution because, I mean, who doesn\u2019t love to sit on a soapbox and tweet your angst out to whoever will listen, right? Feels great to preach\u2014 especially if there\u2019s a hint of ridicule and sarcasm, too! And now we can sort of piggyback off of other people\u2019s clever attacks and feel even more clever and self-righteous when we re-tweet or re-post a Facebook status. Great for the ego, but I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s great for the problem. You can\u2019t drive out hate with hate-MLK. What might the world be like if race wasn\u2019t important. I mean if every image of beauty, intellect, health, brilliance, generosity, love, etc, is white or predominantly white, then race is most certainly still too significant. But if the world could treat skin colour as it treats, I dunno, finger shape or something, then we\u2019ll have made real progress. When it ACTUALLY just doesn\u2019t matter. And obviously we need to stop using terms \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d as descriptors\u2014Dated inappropriate terminology with way too many powerful associations. Less preaching would help exponentially. Less ad hominem attacks. Less isolationist tribal sounding rhetoric\u2014such as anti-white man rhetoric which seems to be popping right now. Truth is, white people don't suffer from their racially-contentious rhetoric. They don\u2019t. They get to spew what they want and then go back to being worshipped\u2014 even by those they are criticizing. But dark-skinned people like me have to deal with the lasting effects of resentment and hate that is often deepened by this sort of crap. It\u2019s human nature for people to respond negatively to attacks on character. It\u2019s partly why so many people have stopped going to church. Who wants to be told they\u2019re an unholy sinner who needs reform and that they\u2019re going to hell unless they do a,b,c etc? Unless you\u2019re already on that bus, it\u2019s hard to attract people to it. And it\u2019s no wonder! Duh! How different is that rhetoric from \u201cyou privileged white xenophobic man you need reform\u201d? Generally, people don\u2019t respond positively to rhetoric that labels them negatively, is accusatory, and demands them to change. Heck think about relationships. I had a friend who really hurt me deeply. I hardly accused him, but merely mentioning that I was hurt and wanted to talk to him,(even with no label or accusation, and no request for reform) caused him to avoid me like the plague. Sigh, 50 going on 12 as they say. Frustrating, indeed\u2026 but human. We\u2019re all just humans. If change is indeed the aim, then it has to be a bigger priority than momentary self-gratification. Being an asshole to assholes has never worked. And historically, the vulnerable ones have paid the price. If a comment hits a particular white man the wrong way one morning, the witty outspoken white man or woman who posted the comment won\u2019t pay. It\u2019ll be the black guy who he decides to pull over and bully that morning, or the Indigenous woman he gropes angrily, or the black woman he humiliates in the workplace who pays. Get it? At the risk of abusing an adage, MLK didn\u2019t die because of his unyielding desire to \u201cput whites in their place\u201d or cause more disunity. He died as a result of his efforts to END segregation, to eliminate tribalism. His dream was that little white boys and little black girls would join hands. Try and remember that. If we want the world to treat non-white people better, bullying the bullies is not the answer. No, if we want people to see us as fully human and beautiful, race as a whole needs to become LESS significant, not more significant. ",

In fact, trying to get rid of racism only creates more racism\u2026 especially if you are trying to get rid of racism by more racism. The only way for racism to disappear is to let it die. As long as the laws make everyone legally equal in their opportunities, the social aspect of racism will fade. It takes generations to do so. You cannot force it. You can only ignore it. Ignore race in general. Children will grow up seeing their grumpy racist parents or grandparents and not understand, because society will have moved on. They may pick up this racism if it\u2019s taught to them, but they\u2019ll be in the extreme minority. Many more will simply move on with their lives, because race doesn\u2019t mean anything to them, because nothing in their life is even remotely affected by their race. You cannot kill racism, not even with kindness. You can only let it die by ignoring it. Anything more, any definition of race or special privileges or \u2018evening the playing field\u2019? All that does is continue racism. What\u2019s really weird is I don\u2019t even understand racism against Jewish people. How do you know what a \u2018Jewish\u2019 person looks like? Jewish people look like a lot of things, even ethnic Jews.

I don\u2019t get it. I wish we could just stop thinking in race. Sure, white and black and asian are decent descriptors, but why do we need to attach more than simple physical description to people we don\u2019t know? I will never understand. I don\u2019t know what the difference is supposed to be. ",

            "answer_text": "By stop talking about it and exegerating stories\u2026. Here is reality: Simple statistics: If there are over a 100 million white people living somewhere, your head would have to be in your a$$ to not think that a small percentage of that group wont have racist individuals. Among the ones that are racist, will have another sub group that are violent with their racism. Same for every other groups and every other bad names(Murderer, thugs, pedos, prejudice, sexist ect) you get the picture. In every big number, there are bound to be bad apples. So the notion that racism is \u201crampant\u201d and out of control in USA is nonsense. USA is amongst the best country to live when it comes to making a living amd finding a group of people to connect with that accepts you for you. Not the same for many countries out there. Those protestors need to change places with alot of desperate souls out there in 3rd world countries who would love be in the position right now as oppose to dealing with the hardship in their poor country. People are naturally born with prejudices , that is just reality. We as humans however, have a sense of ethics and morals to help fight our prejudices, but it wont be perfect as some people choose to have negetive views of groups of people, including black people. I grow up with them, and I can testify that many of them speak ill things about white people and other races. I can be certain other races do the same thing too. So should whites be treated different in that regard? Because they owned slaves once in the past? Nah\u2026 slavery was always a thing in the past\u2026just that the last ones recorded doing it in modern times were whites(who also officially declared it wrong world wide). Otherwise, slavery wasn't something only unique to white people. So we need to bury that hachet and move on. So stop treating every altercation between a white person and a black as racism. Sometimes it's not. They can hate each other for character. The white person can be an evil jerk and not care for race. Thats possible. How can you want racism to end yet aren\u2019t able to think that such scenarios are plausible? \u2026 Also, the word \u201cracism\u201d is used too loosely, thus significantly devaluing the word, and can be very dangerous long term. Crazy people are even trying to alter the meaning. There are differences to simply being rude, prejudice, aggressive, insulting, disrspectful, and of course racist. The people in power dont seem to care though and love promoting the white vs black crap\u2026 So nope, it wont end, greedy people are making too much money off it to stop. And many Blacks unfortunately love the victim mentality. So it will forever be there. I just ignore it and turn off the news , play some videos games or get some good sex or a nice vacation \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a The rest of you can go ahead and be crazy over garbage. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two paths that work. This answer portrays the importance of one-on-one contact, Getting to know people who seem different from ourselves is important. The other way to end racism is educational. Not education about racism being wrong. It doesn\u2019t work. Education that appeals to the selfish interests of the racist can ease racism. What am I talking about? Here is what we know scientifically: Negative emotions are indicators that your mind and/or body are experiencing stress. When you look at someone and judge them to be bad in some way, you believe the negative emotion affirms the rightness of your point of view because when you think of that person or people like them, you feel negative emotion. Researchers changed the definition of the purpose of emotions in 2007. The purpose of negative emotion is not to affirm your perspective about someone or something. The purpose of negative emotion is to let you know that the perspective you are taking is not the healthiest perspective you can take about the situation or person. Healthy for whom? Healthy for you! Racists not only spread stress to those they view in a negative light, they also experience higher stress every time they see or interact with people they\u2019ve chosen to see as bad, less than, or in a negative light for some reason. While the people who are the subject of their racism can find perspectives about racists that lower the amount of stress they experience as the result of racism (and should for their own well-being), I\u2019ll focus on the health of the racist because selfish best-interest is a motivator. Chronic stress is responsible, at the root cause, for between 66 - 99% of all physical illnesses. Different researchers cite different numbers but they are all very clear that chronic stress is detrimental to physical health. All mental illnesses are preceded by chronic stress. Racism is self-imposed chronic stress on the racist.  An aside: If someone who is the subject of racism knows this, it can be used to mentally feel better. This racist is being bad to me but he\u2019s also harming himself and is ignorant of that fact. He thinks I\u2019m the ignorant one but in fact his attitude makes his life much worse than it could be and how much his idiocy affects me is largely up to me. It can feel better to think that someone who is attempting to harm you is harming themselves (shooting themselves in the foot). Anything you can do to make yourself feel better that isn\u2019t illegal and doesn\u2019t worsen the situation for you reduces the stress you experience.  This issue, racism, and other forms of discrimination, is one reason I am so passionate about teaching people how to understand the revised scientific definition of the purpose of emotions. When emotions are accurately interpreted using the new definition, people become self-correcting. We want to feel good. We can\u2019t feel good and find fault with others. Now I hear people saying there are bad people whom we should find fault with. The truth is that we can disagree with behavior but if we focus on the behavior and not what we\u2019d like instead and how to get more of what we want, we will be stressed. If, in the moment we decide we don\u2019t like something (i.e. criminal behavior) we shift our attention to solutions, \u201cHow can crime be prevented at the level of primary prevention?\u201d for example, we feel less bad and can feel excited to be working on, finding, and implementing solutions that will help everyone. Another aspect of the new definition is that positive emotions guide us toward self-actualization. The benefits (health, career, and relationship) of positive emotions has been heavily documented during the past couple of decades. In other words, what we want lies in the direction of positive emotions. Hate, distrust, seeing others as less than, seeing self as unworthy, and other negative emotions associated with racism are unhealthy. On a very personal level, racism harms the racist. Racism also harms the racist in a larger framework. Racism worsens the health of both the racist and their targets. The cost of health and availability of health care affects everyone. Increased usage of health care increases costs and we all bear some of that burden. So, using science, we can prove that being a racist is: A personal choiceCurableHarmful to the racist on a very personal levelWhile I agree that being a racist is wrong and unfair, those arguments will never change the mind of a racist. Self-interest can and will change minds. I was not raised to be a racist. I was raised to be a nationalist, to see Americans as better and to hate Russians (it was during the cold war). After I began applying the new definition of emotions in my life and managing my emotions so that I felt good, I recognized that I couldn\u2019t see American as better or hate Russians (or anyone) and feel as good as I want to feel. My best friends aren\u2019t Americans (One is an Aussie, one is a citizen of the UK but originally born in South Africa and left after being persecuted under Apartheid, and another is a UK citizen who lives in the US, and another is Canadian). I do have American friends but my nationalist attitude completely changed. I even have Russian friends. I\u2019ve written before about a night when my Russian friends and I laughed over the fact that at one time we dutifully hated one another in obedience to our government\u2019s encouragement. Self-interest, when the purpose and use of emotions is understood, can change mental attitudes. I teach people about the new definition of emotions and how to apply it. I do not tell racists that it will make them want to stop being racists because they would not want to use it. Our minds want to protect our established beliefs. If they learn how to use the new definition and apply it, they will get their on their own. When you master skills that allow you to feel good simply because you want to feel good, it is exhilarating. You work on finding ways to soothe the rough edges of your life. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a homeless addict or a CEO, we all want to feel better. When you learn how, it\u2019s almost addictive. It\u2019s like sanding a piece of wood. When you get the large rough edges off, the smaller ones become apparent and you work on those. There is no end to how good you can feel if you are willing to adjust your perspectives towards those that feel better. When someone is not happy, the negative emotional hit of being a racist (or a nationalist, or sexist, or homophobic) doesn\u2019t stick out like a sore thumb. But give that person tools that help them soothe the rough edges of their life and they will quickly realize that every time they think racist thoughts they feel worse, they will begin working on it because they selfishly want to feel better. I am not saying selfish is wrong. In this case, selfish best interests are aligned with the best interests of others. In fact, when folks are happy, selfish best interests are aligned with the well-being of others. When you actually feel great, it feels far better when others feel good, too. Happy people are nicer to strangers, they\u2019re better corporate citizens, and they are unlikely to commit crimes. Selfish can lead to harm when people don\u2019t feel good emotionally and don\u2019t have healthy skills to feel better. It\u2019s difficult to ask, \u201cWhat would be better for the racist?\u201d and see this solution. Our tendency is to punish the racist. There are no solutions down that path. When we approach life with an attitude of finding the best thoughts we can find, we can find a path through loving kindness, that leads us to solutions that work because they are based on science and self-interest. Do we really want to punish the racist for having attitudes that they were taught to have or do we want to end the problem? We cannot do both. For me, I\u2019d like to leave the world better than I found it so the answer is clear. It is not possible to end racism without benefiting the racist since racism harms the racist. ",

            "answer_text": "First, stop identifying YOURSELF as a member of any race but the HUMAN race. Then stop doing that with other people. Second, stop identifying yourself or other people as white or black or red or yellow. These terms separate us into groups of \u201cus\u201d and \u201cothers\u201d and are at the heart of racism. (I didn\u2019t include brown because nearly all of us are somewhere between pinky-tan and the dozens of shades of brown, and it\u2019s a continuum.) Third, stop seeing skin color as an extreme dichotomy, as with black/white, as this leads to one being seen as good and one as bad. Catalogue people by types that CROSS the old racist definitions, and see everyone who shares your types as related. But don\u2019t include skin color! For example, people who like this band I like, or people who like hats like mine, or people who have tattoos, or don\u2019t, or people who live in my neighborhood or go to my school, or people in my income bracket. Or people who like this food I like. Or people who like this tv show I like. But don\u2019t see those not in the group as the enemy, but merely as members of different groups with different tastes. Ethnic groupings are not the same as races, so it is easier to use them for good in overturning racism. Some ethnic groupings are very small, and some are transnational. Learn to find all these ethnic grouping interesting and non-threatening. Study them, enjoy them, learn from them (such as skills and foods), but don\u2019t feel that you have to be like them. Anthropology is fascinating. For example, there are many different ethnic groups in Mexico, each with their own customs and food. There are also several in Cuba. Many of the ethnic groups in Mexico share many similarities. Also, Mexicans in general differ in some ways from Cubans in general (or other areas). Explore the differences and enjoy them. This is similar to the way \u201cNative Americans\u201d are made up of hundreds of different ethnic groups that have some things in common but also have many differences. Learn to enjoy difference. Distance yourself from people who aim to dichotomize the human race, no matter what their ancestry. Join some groups. Enjoy other groups. Tolerate what you don\u2019t really enjoy. ",

One) I was very very very homophobic as a young man (criminally so on occasion) but continued interactions (drug dealing, booze cans, friends of friends and finally a pride parade with a bunch of girls from a porn company) and nothing bad happened. No molesting, drugging, raping etc, all my irrational fears never came to fruition and I progressively got better\u2026One of my friends (I suspect something awful happened as a kid and pedophilic homosexuality and homosexual got co-related in his head) was the same as I\u2019d been. I introduced him to my gay roommate and they were civil, then FB friends. Don\u2019t get it wrong i also teased him gently when he said homophobic shit. The other day we were talking and he said in no uncertain terms he\u2019d gotten over his homophobia, my answer\u2026I know, I\u2019ve been watching. If someone had been stupid enough to attack me or him physically over it, they would have been smashed into a hospital and reinforced our fear/anger/hatred (s)\u2026you change the world with kindness and empathy. Two) last time i saw literal racism a friend walked into a bar in scarboro only to be told he didn\u2019t belong there, he told me. I proceeded to walk around to the group of men I was with and we all stood around pointing at the guys laughing\u2026the instigator hung his head and sat at the bar quietly. I shamed him in such a way as to discourage future occurrences. as a side note, my friend could fight and we would have stomped them all but that would have reinforced his racism and been pointless. In conclusion, and this is from a guy who really knows how to fight like a motherf*cker so I don\u2019t have to be nice because I\u2019m afraid, but kindness love and EMPATHY change the world. Their fears are real to them, so don\u2019t reinforce them? If that doesn\u2019t work, shunning works wonders. We are pack animals so negative attention can still be perceived as esteem in the pack, shunning\u2026.not so much. (trust me I\u2019m pretty far from being ghandi as I offer this real world advice). This statement doesn\u2019t mean I wont fight if i see racism get out of hand it just means it wont be my default setting and will be the last resort. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but usually it is not easy, and most racists are not motivated to let go of their racism and are also highly resistant to abandoning their racism. First, define what racism means. I am not one of those people who believe that people of a certain [race] cannot be racists. To me, racism is a learned pattern of behavior that can include aggressive actions against people on the basis of their being capped (or crowned, if you will) as members or as not-members of a certain [race]. If we stay away from the shallow end of the bell curve of racism, the typical racist person will have the mistaken idea that [race] is a valid category, that belonging to a certain [race] determines the possession of each individual therein of a certain list of characteristics, that the possession of some subset of those characteristics is bad, that the word \u201cbad\u201d has objective criteria that back it up. If the description of [race] and racism stopped there, it wouldn\u2019t be so difficult to change. When a person is an objective observer and encounters evidence that invalidates some empirical generalization such as, \u201cAll apples are red,\u201d then that person will change that belief. The other aspect of racism, and the part that makes it difficult to change, is that it includes strong components of emotion. Moreover, since racism has been around for a while and has met many challenges from rationalists, there is a complex of emotions and defenses that is difficult to penetrate. Racism is based on in inauthenticity of the individual. At the core of the individual is some version of the belief, \u201cI am bad. I am guilty of really bad sins. I am ashamed of myself for being x, y, z, and having many more defects.\u201d And ( as one student once described himself to me) \u201cI am not worth shit.\u201d I think it is pretty obvious that it took his family, his community, and maybe his nation a decade or two to nurture these beliefs in the individual. They will not go away by themselves. While the individual has these self-condemning beliefs and strong feelings agains himself or herself, a way of defending against, and salving these open lesions of the soul or psyche. The way is to find people who are even worse than oneself, and then to redirect the disgust and hatred one feels for the self out against members of the other [race]. Displaced aggression is found in many situations, e.g., when one beats one\u2019s spouse after being excoriated by one\u2019s boss. The use of [race] gives one a socially constructed target with defenses and rationalization already in place, and social confirmation that one\u2019s racist ideas are affirmed by millions of other people. A few billion flies cannot be wrong about the taste of excrement. Racism is basically a socially constructed phobia. Fear is at the core, and anger can be added to that as a defense against the fear. That way, the unfortunate [black] person takes the punishment for the other person\u2019s lack of authenticity rather than the other person healing the inconsistency at his or her core. The unfortunate [oriental] person takes the punishment for the other person\u2019s \u201cdisgusting and shameful\u201d sexual urges that cannot really be denied but can be denied in word and at least through some overt actions. The unfortunate [Jew] takes the payback for the inherited guilt feelings for what one\u2019s own family members did, ironically, to the group they called [Jews, homos, and gypsies]. The fundamental problem is that the racist does not see what is really there and adjust his or her feelings toward others accordingly. The way to treat this problem is to get the person to actually see several members of the hated [race]. Phobia treatment works for things like the panic-inducing fear of baby chicks. Probably the patient in that case is already aware of the irrational aspects of fearing baby chicks. Racism treatment in most cases will be more like psychotherapy because of the need for rooting out all of the defenses. Another possibility is that the [racism] is destroyed by some version of instant enlightenment, and then the individual would need help dealing with the core issues of guilt, shame, and profound feeling of worthlessness. Deep relaxation (AKA meditation) can help face the feared [race] individual, but for deep-rooted issues it may require augmentation by some kind of talk therapy to help the individual use adult processing to confront childhood \u201csins.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Racism is a misnomer in describing why people may have rejection towards a group of people that appear \u201cdifferent\u201d than them. To expect someone to give up on identifying people is contrary to human nature. Take dogs for instance. When a dog approaches another dog that it has played with, they both get excited and happy. If they approach a dog they don't know, I they appear to be on guard and cautious. They will smell each other (getting as much information as they can), and try to show dominace over the other. A bark will cause a defense posture or even an attack. If a dog approaches another dog that has previously fought with him, they will attack or avoid the dog. This is natural behaviour. We humans do not differ in that we have a natural instinct to protect ourselves. Replace the dog smelling to get information with humans using sight to get information. As you walk down the street and see another person approaching, you will access their facial appearance and expression. You will access their dress, their gait, makeup, what they may be carrying or any other thing you can see. A smile or angry look may immediately give you enough input to smile back or be cautious. Wearing a MAGA hat can influence your perception of the person. Seeing someone wearing pants not even covering their behinds, may turn you off. Seeing a women with a Habib may remind you of 9/11 even though you have many Muslim friends. You gather as much information as you can, process it through your memory and make a conclusion. It will be done automatically in a second. This not a process of deep in thought, it comes from the hypothalamus (the old brain). By making \u201cracism\u201d a highly debatable subject only adds more negative information to the automatic process. The differentiation process is inherant to humanity, and will always be used. It is futile to try and stop it. Chastising \u201cracism\u201d only makes things worse. Programs like Affirmative Action don't help either. Lyndon Johnson didn't do any favors in preventing \u201cracism.\u201d Where is Science on this issue? ",

Any or all of them might work \u2026 but I doubt it. You\u2019re talking about changing attitudes, beliefs, thoughts, by force of law. That\u2019s the worst form of dictatorship. Instead concentrate on changing actions and results. If someone is unfairly held back, for race or any other reason, help them move forward. Don\u2019t try to change the attitudes of those holding them back. It will backfire. The \u201claw of unintended consequences\u201d will get you. There\u2019s only one sure-fire way to eliminate all racism, racialism, racial distinction and discrimination: have only one race. There are two ways that can happen. 1) some race kills off all the others; or 2) there\u2019s enough interbreeding that we all become one \u201cmixed\u201d race. If everyone just gets along, lets people live together without nagging at them all the time and making their lives miserable, then the second is bound to happen sooner or later. OTOH if you try to force the issue, you\u2019ll just p*ss everyone off. Keep at it long enough, pass enough laws, lecture adults who know more about life than you ever will long enough, put them in jail and destroy their communities long enough - and someday the law of unintended consequences will come into play. They\u2019ll try to force the end of racism, via the first method. Stop trying to change other\u2019s thoughts, when your own thinking ability is obviously not much to brag about. Don\u2019t worry about the mote in your neighbor\u2019s eye - concentrate on getting that beam out of your own. But hey, what do I know? ",

Economic instability, the breakdown of cultural values, social chaos, isolation (in places where we feel safe, and in places where we don\u2019t), fear of the unknown, disintegration of structure, and many other issues that are legitimate concerns within a society, are usually the underlying issues driving racism. Racism is an easy distraction, it\u2019s a simple way to handwave away a problem by blaming a group that\u2019s powerless to fight back. When a society uses racism to prop up a system that will ultimately fail, then the problem isn\u2019t the racists, or the oppressed\u2014it\u2019s those in control of rigging the system, who are playing both sides against the other. If a racist understands that the real reason he\u2019s in danger of losing his job is because his company made questionable investments and did shoddy research, it might make him a little less racist. If a citizen understands that the real reason his country\u2019s economy has hit rock bottom is because the government used inflation as a short term solution to mask a much bigger problem, it might make him a little less racist. There\u2019s usually something ugly brewing well before race ever becomes part of the equation. Racism is usually misdirected anger, it creates a lot of distraction without ever coming close to revealing the real problem. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer: Through education from parents, friends, society, culture and the leaders within each grouping. The idea of the races of humanity is just a social construct. The truth of the races of humanity is below.  The person who only believes what they are told and has no need to ever consider seeking the truth. Is evidence of the total enslavement of their mind. C.J.MacKechnie ============== Respectfully questioning authority is mandatory for each person. By doing so, you are assured that you are not deceived. In today's modern age, a person or every person should be allowed develop the skills necessary to search for any information at its source of origination. When this can be accomplished, a new civilized world can be established based on truth and not apparent truths which turn out to be out-right lies with evil intentions such as hate, war, murder, fear, anger, rage, distrust and so on. In the current atmosphere of race relations, no one anywhere on this planet wants to know the truth or even seek the truth. Organizations that define words contribute to the lie and ongoing deceptions. Can we prove that the definition of the races of humanity are false by scientific standards? Yes, from 1985 human DNA profiling and again in 2000 with the Human Genome Project. The science is absolute and clear. There is only one singular race of human beings on this planet and it is human, not black, white, red or yellow species of people. ============== One lie proven wrong. Races! June 2000 White House Event A partial quote from then-president of the United States of America, Bill Clinton: \"The third horizon that lies before us is one that science cannot approach alone. It is the horizon that represents the ethical, moral and spiritual dimension of the power we now possess. We must not shrink from exploring that far frontier of science. But as we consider how to use new discovery, we must also not retreat from our oldest and most cherished human values. We must ensure that new genome science and its benefits will be directed toward making life better for all citizens of the world, never just a privileged few. As we unlock the secrets of the human genome, we must work simultaneously to ensure that new discoveries never pry open the doors of privacy. And we must guarantee that genetic information cannot be used to stigmatize or discriminate against any individual or group. Increasing knowledge of the human genome must never change the basic belief on which our ethics, our government, our society are founded. All of us are created equal, entitled to equal treatment under the law. After all, I believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms, all human beings, regardless of race, are more than 99.9 percent the same.\" =============== If you want to stop racism, you have to begin with the evidence to counter the wrong thinking of the world. You have to cause organizations like Dictionary.com - The world\u2019s favorite online dictionary! to change the definition based on thirty-year-old and again on 16-year-old scientific proofs. You have to convince people that this is a world problem and not the racial monopoly of the USA. I have listened and heard many shows from many different sources and all of them are the same including the radio show Equipped with Chris Brooks. Every show host only wants to know opinions and feelings. No one wants to explore any evidence or to seek any kind of factual truths. Everyone is enslaved by their own way of wrongful thinking. Everyone wants to continue to believe that this lie is an absolute truth which will not or cannot change. This is why people like Chris Brooks have enslaved mind in regard to the races of humanity. I'm only picking on Mr. Brooks because I value what he does and says. I'm much more than an occasional listener. I have not mentioned any other hosts or people because they simply are unimportant to me since I realized they offered zero real answers or solutions. ============= Moody Radio Florida | 91.1 FM WKES | 90.9 FM WSOR | 104.3 FM WKZM | 91.9 FM WHGN DNA profiling - Wikipedia Human Genome Project - Wikipedia Please study how DNA profiling is used in international courts of law. Why do they only use a small portion of the DNA panel? Please study the human skin, how the skin is the largest organ of the body. Study how there are primary functions and secondary functions. If you lose a primary function you can die. If you lose a secondary function you will merely be uncomfortable and a possible social outcast. So since I cannot drink alcohol very well because of genetic inefficiencies of my liver organ, why am I not a different race of person from those who can drink alcohol very easily and in huge quantities? Isn't that similar to differences between a lightly pigmented person and a darker pigmented person? ---------------------- What happened at the tower of Babel? The beginning of racism or the belief in the division of the human species. In modern terms, this where God deleted the one common language of humanity and downloaded up to 77 other basic languages into up to 77 different groups of people. People grew into an us-versus-them mentality. Tower of Babel - Wikipedia We are all from one blood line, Noah and his sons - a total of 8 adults. Noah - Wikipedia To go back even further from only one male and one female. Adam and Eve - Wikipedia ============ If humanity all the way back to Adam and Eve became a separate race of human beings on each region of this one planet, then the genetic differences would be much greater than LESS THAN .1%. Because within that less than .1% is where all of your unique identity resides. This does not include your cultural, social and educational upbringings, or even the lack of cultural, social and educational upbringings. The math is huge and very exact. And we have not even begun to talk about the genetic markers of sin which can reside in specific places along the DNA structure, which can be passed along to our offspring. So what did Jesus know about this when he said all you have to do is think sin and it is already done? =============== Added on 27 July 2016: Here is a fact which cannot be argued, but it can be denied and rejected. All of your DNA and my DNA is more than 99.9% identical. Can you fathom that? Here is a comparison in regard to Ethnos. Read this and understand. ethnos ethnos - people of the same race or nationality who share a distinctive culture. This is the definition - people of the same nationality who share a distinctive culture. So if a person alters either his nationality or culture, that person changes his racial distinction as defined. How about that for an error with zero scientific evidence? The traditions of man is a basis for race. ------------------ Here is another. Race (human classification) - Wikipedia Race, as a social construct, is a group of people who share similar and distinct physical characteristics. Are you getting this? Race is a social construct. What are the distinct physical characteristics? Ears, legs, liver, spleen, hair? I am pointing you in a direction. That direction is toward scientific fact and away from any human social constructs. Be sure you continue reading to discover that the first use of race was with those who spoke a single common language. Can you start thinking about the Tower of Babel as the beginning source for racism and the division of humanity via language? Since race is a social construct. It can be assumed that a person who was poor and then is rich changes their race. Likewise, a person who was rich and is now poor also changes his race. So if a person knows many languages are they multi-racial? -------------------------- Here is a good comparison: A person bought four exact Dell computers with no operating systems installed. On Dell computer #1, which is to be the personal computer, this person installed Windows 10, some games and other fun software. On Dell computer #2, which is to be the work computer, this person installed Windows 7, some work specific software, and professional Office software. On Dell computer #3, which is to be the industrial use computer, this person installed an industrial version of Linux operating system along with specific controls software. On Dell computer #4, which is to be a French language specific computer, programs were installed that were mostly for the streaming of all French-language content. I know you're smart and you know where I'm going with this. The more than 99.9% of all of our DNA can be represented by the physical Dell computer machines. The less than .1% is all tied in the software. I would consider this a lose comparison. Still the point is made. Each of the above computers are the same. Except for the operating systems and purpose of use. This is where we can get our lazy and crazy people, Bruce Lee people, Albert Einstein people, Michael Jordan people and so on and so forth. ============== 28 Sept 2016: Before Racist: (Unedited): 23 Sept 2016: Before any person can become a racist he must first believe in the separation and divisions of the human species. C.J.MacKechnie ==================== To avert all of the coming bad and sad prophecies. We each must decide to do the following everyday, every hour, every minute and every second. To Love one another. To live in peace with everyone. To exist in harmony with all. To Cherish all life. To be obedient to the Laws of God. To become righteous and holy by the accepting eyes of God only. All without pride, ego, arrogance, supremacy or entitlements. ",

Failing that, time: so the population of racists dies off and replaced by a more tolerant generation. You\u2019ll notice that people, in general, now, are lots less racist than people used to be. A specific individual can be challenged in aspects of their racism, and have been known to change their behaviour as a result. They may still think of the target group as \u201cinferior\u201d or something, just that they come to realise that they should not judge all members of that group by the generalisation. That\u2019s quite common \u2026 so the shift is from racism to racialism. From racialism\u2026 they may be able to go the next step. I did once know a biology student who defeated her own indoctrinated racism starting with the realisation that \u201crace\u201d did not exist in biology. If she wanted to be rational as well as bigoted, she needed to find a biologically objective distinction for the people she was singling out and could not find any. So one of these had to go\u2026 and she chose to ditch the bigotry. It can, and often does, go the other way. ",

            "answer_text": "Its definitely possible but you will have to do your part: Question your assumptions about different races and commit to disregarding them for the sake of achieving a truly empirical understanding. Be aware of and act against your more subliminal racial instincts as well.Try to make friends of people from others races (as you say you are open to this). Try to pick some that share your economic professional or life background and interests, so that you don\u2019t confuse with class, upbringing, or other factor. I add this measure of specificity as it relevant to your case.Try to instead judge, say, an Asian person as a pervert based on any hints of such behavior. The results you will observe will present direct evidence of existence and power of confirmation bias. I am confident that this will not be difficult. Try this with other stereotypes as well, just keep swapping them around. Be aware not to confuse with other social factors, as described in the previous step.Having successfully gone through the above activities, begin to force yourself to think of people of different races as equals, and see the cultural or physical differences as merely superficial aspects. Possibly even beautiful or pleasant differences. Try doing this for a while until you feel a sense of liberation.Watch movies, TV or other media of black women that you actually do find attractive, even if few come to mind. Commit to giving them sufficient exposure, even just for a few weeks. I personally can\u2019t understand how anyone would find Kerry Washington to be anything but very attractive. Give it some time and don\u2019t be dismissive, and you will gain some degree of appreciation of the bone structure or features of a black woman (considering that it is the specific aversion you mentioned). Or just appreciate the common womanly features and eventually you will grow to appreciate a wider spectrum of beauty.Try this for as long as you can, moving on to the subsequent step after a few weeks, plus or minus, as your mileage may vary. Give it a \u2018true and honest\u2019 effort throughout, or consider the start of any phase the moment when you have done just that. Undoubtedly, you will become less racist and over time you can repeat the steps in order get rid of any residue. Believe me and any other non-racist person you can ask anywhere, its great and you wont regret it! See, nowadays, even kids get it, and its like the norm! They really aren\u2019t all that special really (they are cute, yes) but benefit from the more diverse communities we live in and the decades of progressivism that has elucidated society. These are just happy kids in a copyright free image but they do represent much of what has been happening (and will continue to happen increasingly so in our more connected world). If you are not a racist, you are going to be much more comfortable living in this world, which should provide enough incentive to follow the plan.  ",

It only reaffirms their beliefs that minorities are out to destroy and marginalize them, and that members of their own race who side with minorities are traitors who will throw them under a bus in order to make themselves look virtuous. You only make a racist more racist. You marginalize a racist, he/she doesn't stop being racist, he/she just stops expressing his/her views publicly. He/she then starts associating with other racists, people who won't call them evil for their views, people they believe will have their back in a conflict. Allowing minority hate groups to get away with spewing their own hatred also contributes towards making racist more racist. It shows that standards of \u201ctolerance and equality\u201d are not applied equally, which breeds resentment. If the Klan is condemned by the public but the Black Panthers and Nation of Islam gets a pass, then all the talk of tolerance and equality is absolutely worthless. It\u2019s like using the film God\u2019s Not Dead to convince an atheist to stop being atheist. ",

            "answer_text": ">> Is it possible for a racist to stop being a racist? A lot of racism is initially due to ignorance; and ignorance can be cured through education. The problem is, the media will not permit this. And watching and hearing groups of people accusing others of being racist all the time and having a sense of entitlement for injustices they never went through themselves makes people angry. Angry enough that it cements racist beliefs in ones mind when if education was given rather than accusations, it could have been cured. But now it's not. Ending racism will not happen as long as people are using it to manipulate others to get favour and preferential treatment. Every person is responsible for ending racism. Stop blaming each other and stop assuming everyone is against the other. But I just do not see this happening. There are far too many people that are encouraged by the media to play victim. And playing victim is also racism. So until everyone knocks it off and stops accusing everyone else and stops claiming to be a victim or saying their feelings are hurt by this or that, racism won't end. And individuals won't change either until people stop feeling sorry for themselves and trying to get attention and pity. Doing that is just as wrong as the racist having racist\u2019s beliefs. And the sad thing is, those beliefs in society could have been changed. That is, until they got accussed over and over of being one when they weren\u2019t. And when someone is accused of something again and again, they tend to start to become what they are accused of. So if people want it to end, my question to them is - what are you doing to help end it? Or are you being part of the problem? ",

'dark, depressive, threatening, hopeless, oppressive,gloomy,ominous, diabolical,menacing,hostile - these are the words which the English Dictionaries tell us mean the same as \u2018black\u2019. Right now under the definition of \u2018black\u2019 English dictionaries give the following examples: \"a ship that was declared black by the union\"\u2018\"my soul is steeped in the blackest sin\"\u2019;\u2018I was looking on the black side and thought I would get a sentence of five years\u2019;\u2018Robert's character could surely not be as black as Dawn had painted\u2019;'got a black mark for being late'\"a black deed\" These examples portray the colour black in negative light. How can one associate a colour with so much of negativity and particularly when a community of the same colour and only because of the colour of their skin has been suffering since times immemorial? English Dictionaries don't stop here; they call Black \"the opposite of white\" and according to dictionaries white mean same as \"virtuous, moral, ethical, good, righteous, angelic, saintly, pious, honourable, reputable,clean, honest, upright, upstanding, exemplary, above reproach, beyond reproach, irreproachable, innocentdecent, worthy, noble, blameless, guiltless, sinless, stainless, spotless, immaculate, impeccable, unsullied, unblemished, unspoiled, unaffected, uncorrupted, untainted, undefiled\" This is astonishing to see such discrimination by reputable sources like University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, Merriam-Webster for they have great influence in setting norms around English language. These racist definitions have become widespread because online search engines license the use of dictionaries from these sources for their definitions. This can influence the way black people are spoken about. So, we must take a serious step towards reducing the harm English language is causing Black community, and this starts with the dictionary. Should institutions like University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, Merriam-Webster portray black this way? What message do they send across to black kids about their identity and expectations for the future? If we want to create an equal society, we need language that is completely free of discrimination. I have filed a petition is asking University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, Merriam-Webster to: Eliminate all phrases and definitions that discriminate against and patronise black and/or connote white\u2019s superiority over black; Together, we can succeed in removing the offensive and damaging definition of black from the dictionary. PLEASE SIGN MY PETITION I hope you support me and join my campaign! Please sign this petition and take the first steps towards a fairer and a less discriminating world. Thank you!

No amount of proof or rationalization will work. In fact, debating some of the subjects deeply held by some people here on Quora will be a proof of this. For example, try debating a creationist. Good luck with that! Bottom line, the best one can do in a debate is convince the audience. That being said, I think one good approach is to show racist people how very, very closely related humans are to each other. We are basically one gigantic family, and share a very small number of ancestors (the ones who had children all the way back from the original group who left Africa). Not only that there are no races, but even ethnicities and any other forms of groups are a thin, thin veneer covering our basic sameness. I can understand that people can disagree, obviously brother has killed brother since the beginning of humanity, but it is not because we are different, only because we have different views on how to behave. The only difference between people is cultural. If racists realized that, they would understand how their opinion is not a reflection of reality.

Unfortunately everyone who has attempted to speak statistics or \u201ccurrent\u201d truth is shut down by PC Mobs and then they don\u2019t have the confidence to stand by their statements. 2. Human beings are feeling creatures all you have to do is have strong positive feelings for a member of another race. That begins to unwind the blanket stereotypes and hatred one may have of other races. Unfortunately the new definition of racism isn\u2019t based on hating another race but is just about white people offending people of color and thus enabling any narcissistic tendencies that might have. Basically, white people are expected to treat blacks like they are retarded children with anger issues. So if you say anything that offends someone of color you\u2019re considered racist. So under the current definition of racism I see no way to resolve this. A certain segment of blacks are demanding to be treated like a special victim group and demanding certain privileges that other races do not get and white liberals are more than happy to oblige regardless of any potential disastrous or destructive outcomes that may result.

Don't judge the racist. Ask him why he doesn't like a certain group of people. Ask him how that group of people has affected his life. If they have at all, it's usually something like perceived preferential treatment in the workplace. Be understanding.

To appear racist you must act in a way to imply superiority over a particular racial group. To offend someone racially in any way, intentionally or not is not racist unless it implies superiority. It may be racially offensive, bias, prejudicial, racially motivated and just plain ignorant, mean, rude or nasty, but not racist. To stop people from feeling superior, all that is needed is to appear superior yourself or appear less inferior. To stop people from being racially offensive you must make everyone identical in appearance and racial group, simple right? You would have to eliminate all emotions, instincts, independent opinions, differences or pretty much any human traits. Even animals though ate bias for what ever reason, they prefer or disapprove of individuals of their own species and seldom allow breeding between species, even subspecies live separate lives and seldom tolerate each other.

Why is there Black Lives Matter and integration issues with blacks in the US more than a century and a half after the American Civil War, but not Asian Lives Matter and integration issues with Asians? 4. Why did Detroit turn into a ruin and one of the most dangerous cities in US after population replacement? 5. Why do I constantly hear about people from certain races having difficulties in integrating, but i never hear the same thing about whites? Thank you.  Best.

What you can do is point out how racism, like bigotry, xenophobia, and misogyny, is often a symptom of unacknowledged insecurities, inadequacies, and fears and most racists find it easier to blame real and imagined fears on scapegoats than honestly admit their real problem is cowardice. TL/DR: In terms of the need to maintain (i.e. trigger and protect) dopamine flow, when safety (and dopamine flow) are threatened racists scramble to return to homeostasis by artificially trigger dopamine (by building weak egos up and inflating esteem by looking down on what they convince one another are their inferiors. If they\u2019re in the company of racists, playing \u201cit\u2019s not us, it\u2019s them\u201d provides bonus dopamine squirts resulting from winning peer approval and attention. With some racists, pointing out how their problems can be linked to fears and cowardice prevents them from triggering gratuitous dopamine with racist remarks because knowing the remarks will expose them for what they are threatens esteem and dopamine flow. With some racists, threatening their safety, esteem, and dopamine flow with facts can land you in big trouble. What is Charles Faraone's definitive post or answer in which he explains his ideas on dopamine flow? ",

When you (Government, institution e.t.c) tell one group, for over two centuries they're superior to others for whatever reason, then all of a sudden declare racism as inappropriate, nothing changes. The Monster created will simply not disappear. The government must first admit to its own contribution to racism and tear down the institutions on which these beliefs are founded. Next, racism should be labeled as a misdemeanor, racist organizations torn down, its members brought to justice and racist platforms blocked. This is just a start though. Reforming the system of education will also play a tremendous role as well. A man's freedom of speech ends the moment it infringes on the rights and freedoms of others. ",

I am mainly conservative, not a Democrat, grew up in a rural area farming, hunting, like country music. I would go to conservative clubs and country & western bars and associate with folks. A few white clubs & bars would not let me in but I did get upset but most did let me in. Whites would approach me, ask questions, sometimes using racial slurs. I would ignore and not get offended by them which surprised them. We would discuss various topics and they were shocked to find out we had many shared values and I was not that much different from them. We were frank and not PC in our discussions. They told how they really felt about blacks and admitted they were racist. They said after meeting me they were wrong, all blacks are not the same, They said there are good and bad in all races and reconsidered their racist views. We all became close friends and they no longer saw me as a black man and accepted as a person. I took some to a black bar and they were shocked how well they were accepted and treated. Short version. A white guy walked into a white biker bar in NC and called me a racial slur and I had to stop whites from kicking his ass. He was no longer racist. Some people will never change and stupid BS like stop calling everyone racist don\u2019t solve the problem. ",

If they think there is s lucrative career waiting for them in, say, some Affirmative Action, Racial Obsession Department, sorry. That college career train has just about left the station. Twenty years ago, I almost drove off the road when I heard Walter E. Williams on a talk show. I had heard him in person a few years earlier and read probably thirty of his Economics columns in various publications. Not just a smart man but an infectious sense of humor. By a stroke of luck, I got through, only realizing later we were talking before over three million mostly self\u2013employed, upscale people. I asked about Racial Studies and Gender Studies in college. Dr. Williams went on a bit of a rant, saying school management, desperate to appear trendy and intelligent, was only revealing its collective lack of sophistication, because those courses are empty of useful content. He outright called them phony scholarship. I wonder if he foresaw the preposterous tuition inflation from 1999 to today, with college management multiplying admin staff a dozen times over, while slave-driving teaching assistants and overpaying and underworking tenured types.

Their solution is to just silence the racists; blocking and banning these people from social media and smearing them online as the anti-christ. That\u2019s not what you do, that doesn\u2019t stop anyone who\u2019s racist from being racist, that only ends up strengthening their bigotry. Engage with them, no matter how much you hate them and they hate you; get a racist person to know you as a person so that their first thought towards you isn\u2019t the colour of your skin. An OPEN DIALOGUE is needed more than ever these days. \u201clive in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character\u201d, once said by a great man.And maybe that won\u2019t work, but it\u2019s much better than just wailing on them like these Antifa dibshits do.

As liberalism has become more widespread, part of their platform seems to be to accuse opponents of racism. It\u2019s one of the techniques they use to gain votes from minorities, by creating the white male as an enemy. The second way is to try and put yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes. Every race and culture loves their people and their heritage, and they shouldn\u2019t be accused of racism for promoting it, unless they are being hateful and violent. It\u2019s possible to love and respect others while also loving and promoting your own race and people. Everyone does it, but it is only claimed as racist by society if it\u2019s a white person. ",

They can call it a party or orgy for all the victims care . Putting a few perpetrators behind bars dont satisfy the aggrieved.

To completely flush our mind of those reflexes to become completely non racist starting from strongly racist seems very difficult to me. But we can get better. And the way to do that is to become more self aware. If you feel a pang of uneasiness at seeing a person of a different race you must learn to fight it, to remind yourself that that person has never done anything to you. If you see these attitudes you should look in yourself to identify where they come from. We may be unable to completely root out prejudice from our mind but we must strive to make our prejudices our problem not that of others. ",

I don\u2019t want to believe that it\u2019s ALL a sham. People do see the error of their ways, and they see a diminishing period ahead, with their opportunities for redemption getting shorter and shorter. I do hope that some of them get sick of the wickedness, and truly turn away from it. ",
