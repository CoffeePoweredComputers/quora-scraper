            "answer_text": "How do I return to Earth from space? Well that's complex. You have to ask yourself few questions. how did you manage to get yourself to space at the first place? If you went to space in a, spaceship, can you use the same ship to return back? Are you in an orbit around Earth? Or floating somewhere in deep space? If in Earth orbit it's just a matter of slowing down a bit for atmospheric reentry. If in deep space, do you have enough fuel to return to Earth? And depending on how far you are and how long would you take to land back on Earth, do you have enough supplies, food, water, oxygen etc? Is your spaceship damaged? Are you in a space suit? If yes do you have access to some kind of escape pods? Do these escape pods have enough fuel to get you back? Is your communication with Earth operations in good shape? Can you request help from ground control? Thanks for your question, I hope you enjoyed reading my answer. If yes, appreciate an upvote, and your comments perhaps would help me improve on my answer.

            "answer_text": "Astronauts come back home inside the protective confines of a spacecraft, that\u2019s how. This isn\u2019t an especially easy process since they are traveling at least 17,500 MPH (7.8232 km/second) to stay in Earth orbit. So, first a spacecraft fires retrorockets, which slows the spacecraft down and causes it to descend out of orbit. If a spacecraft is coming from the moon, as the Apollo missions did, there\u2019s no braking. They hit the atmosphere around 25,000 MPH (11.176 km/s). Most spacecraft used to descend, or re-enter the atmosphere are small conical or spherical modules. They are typically protected by ablative coatings, which create a protective layer of gas as the coatings burn off and wick away additional heat.  After re-entry is over and the spacecraft is back in the thicker atmosphere, parachutes open to lower the spacecraft to an ocean landing (most American vehicles) or ground landing (all Russian spacecraft). Such spacecraft are used only once in general. Some unmanned vehicles such as the Dragon cargo spacecraft can be reused, after some work. The Space Shuttle, a spaceplane that flew for 30 years (retiring in 2011) used a type of reusable thermal protection system composed of thousands of silica-based tiles and blankets. The Shuttle would then glide down to a runway landing similar to airplanes, except that, as a glider, it had only one chance to do it, or crash in the attempt.  ",

            "answer_text": "They fire retros (thrusters firing in the opposite direction to their direction of travel) to slow them below orbital velocity (approximately 17,000 mph). It is crucial that they tightly maintain a descent path angle within a fairly narrow margin: too steep, and the increased friction will burn up the spacecraft; to shallow, and the extra speed gained will cause them to bounce off the atmosphere back into space. Apollo, Gemini and Mercury, Soyuz and Shenzhou were/are roughly cone-shaped capsules with the ablative heatshield (designed to burn slowly away, carrying the heat away) on the blunt end, and automatic RCS (Reaction Control System) thrusters to maintain the heatshield-angled-down orientation; Vostok and Voskhod were spherical capsules with a counterweight but no positive means of maintaining the capsule orientation beyond the counterweight bias: thus the whole capsule was covered in ablative heatshield material. The SST (Space Shuttle) was covered in thermal tiles that were designed to be reusable. In practice, in most missions, at least a few tiles were lost. Also, the tiles were fragile, a factor in the Columbia disaster. The American space capsules (Mercury, Gemini and Apollo) slowed their final stage of descent with parachutes and splashed down into the ocean. The astronauts were fished out of the water by helicopters. The Russian Vostok used a parachute, but required the cosmonaut to eject before impact with the ground (though it was falsely claimed that Gagarin bravely stayed on board, so the Soviet Union could claim an altitude record). Voskhod 1 was basically a one-person Vostok capsule with three people crammed aboard, including the unlucky spacecraft designer, who had been \u201cvolunteered\u201d. This was to beat the pending Gemini two-man capsule by putting up three men. There was no room for spacesuits: this was spun as possible because the \u201cnew\u201d! spacecraft was so safe. In fact it was no safer than Vostok. There was no room for ejection seats either, so the spacecraft had a retrorocket that fired one metre above the ground to cushion the landing (a system the Soyuz and Shenzhou capsules still use) Voskhod 2 was a Vostok capsule with a two-man crew and an inflatable airlock, so the Soviets could claim the first spacewalk. There was room for spacesuits, but not for ejection seats. The re-entry module did not detach properly, and the capsule swung about madly. It landed in trees in Siberia and the crew had to be rescued. The Space Shuttle had a \u201cpancake\u201d re-entry, with the underside of the vehicle perpendicular to the re-entry vector. Automatic RCS maintained the vehicle attitude. To scrub off speed after the worst of the re-entry heat build-up, the command pilot would fly the unpowered spacecraft in wide alternating S-shaped arcs. When slow enough, the command pilot would perform a manual dead-stick (unpowered) glider landing. An automatic landing system was available, but it was never used. ",

            "answer_text": "This video explains the method currently used by our astronauts, courtesy of the ESA:  Soyuz undocking, reentry and landing explained European Space Agency, ESA (run time 20:44) Basically, they just fall back to Earth, and the atmosphere slows them down until the parachutes are deployed. They land on the ground in a designated rural area in Kazakhstan where a ground crew will come to meet them and take them back to the launch facility location. The Soyuz capsule is designed to fly itself back to Earth, but the crew can take over if necessary and fly it manually. The release of the parachute is one of only a few functions that have no manual override controls. Returning to Earth from orbit is not possible without a heat shield.

            "answer_text": "Exactly the reverse way they go from  Earth to space. The entry occurs at the Karman Line, 100 kms from the Earth's surface. Since the atmosphere contains air particles which resists gravity induced freefall, half of the problem is solved. Now this resistance (or friction) is a mixed blessing. It heats up the craft significantly (up to 3000\u00b0C temperature). The vehicle (spacecraft) has to be built well enough to withstand this extreme atmospheric friction (and heating up) on the reentry. Thermal protection systems are provided on spacecrafts for this purpose. The shape of the entry vehicle (craft) is also important: A blunt body vehicle always provides a safer option. When the craft (with blunt-shaped surface facing down) enters the atmosphere, the blunt shape creates a shock wave in front of the vehicle.  This is a mechanical wave and helps ward off the heat to some extent. Moreover, due to the bluntness, the atmospheric resistance is much lesser due to less pressure exerted per unit area. In the early days of space exploration, ablative material were used (like the Command module in the Apollo program) which absorbed heat and burnt down.. Modern vehicles are designed for reuse, and hence implements advanced technology. Russian Soyuz crafts (since the 1960s) are still in use as spacecrafts. Others include Gemini, Mercury, Viking etc. When the craft has descended to sufficiently low altitudes, several parachutes are used to further slow down the speed of the vehicle till its landing.See:  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to answer this question in a generic way: They return in a space re-entry vehicle. This is frequently, but not always, the same vehicle the used to get into orbit. Assuming you start out in Earth\u2019s orbit, the first part of re-entry is to fire a rocket to slow you vehicle down. Where and when in the orbit to fire your rocket is computed ahead of time in order to land where desired. Once the vehicle slows down, gravity takes over and vehicle plunges into the atmosphere while still going very fast. The atmosphere slows the vehicle down even more but also creates a lot of heat. The re-entry vehicle will have some sort of a heat shield to deal with that. Once the vehicle has slowed down sufficiently, it either deploys parachutes or glides to a landing. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. Astronauts are orbiting above us at an extremely high speed: approximately 17,500 mph. When anything travelling at that speed hits the atmosphere, they will slow down, but a huge amount of heat will be generated in the process, potentially burning everyone and everything on board to a crisp. Spacecraft re-entering the Earth are protected by heat shields. These are lightweight materials that heat up to extremely high temperatures, then they radiate that heat away thus protecting everyone on board. Special ceramic tiles were used on the Space Shuttle. A material called Reinforced Carbon Carbon (RCC) is used for the areas of a spacecraft that are liable to heat up the most. In 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia was destroyed after a damaged heat shield failed to protect the crew. Everyone onboard perished. ",

It also creates a tremendous amount of heat, which is why ships re-entering from orbit require heat shields. The air slows the ship enough that it falls toward the ground; From there, they pop a parachute to slow their descent. The Russians fire an engine just before contact with the ground to cushion their approach. ",

One uses ablative heat shielding (clever in its own way) to a parachute landing and the other uses heat resistant tiles (clever, passive, in its own way). The shielding is needed as either craft picks up speed and encounters the upper atmosphere. The chemistry in this region isn't like 1 Std. ATM. For now, what we have works. People talk about maybe doing active cooling, but they have no idea of the complexity this introduces. So they get largely ignored until such time as something is proved better. ",
