            "answer_text": "There have been many good and bad impacts of technology on our daily lives. Good Impacts Medical Field Advancements in medical technology have allowed physicians to better diagnose and treat their patients since the beginning of the professional practice of medicine. This merger is responsible for improving and saving countless lives all around the world. Hospital are filled Medical Equipment such as CT Scanners and XRays. Technology has also helped in medical research, with many instruments used in finding different cures or discovering new dieseases we don\u2019t even know about.Mobile Technology Mobile phones have allowed us to communicate with people on the other side of the planet with a touch. Mobile Tecnology has allowed us to cramp loads of info into a small portable device. In mobiles we can take pictures, write emails, read Quora and even play games. Mobile phones have also introduced new people to each other with messaging, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.Aviation and Aerospace Technology This technology has helped us reach differnt places in hours which may have taken months or years by a ship. Aerospace has also helped unlock the mysteries of our solar system. Cassini for example has discovered the possibility of Titan and Enceladus harbouring life, which would mean the possibility of colonisation of other planets or moons.Bad Impacts Cyber Bullying Technology also has been the beginning of cyber bullying within online chat groups and websites. It has hurt many peoples feelings and have in some cases led to suicide. Cyber bullying should be stopped because it has ruined many people\u2019s lives. For example if someones father is in prison. We should not make fun of the family or the kid. We should instead be supportive. Cyber bullying in this case would be making fun of the father in prison, calling him a criminal.Addictions Have you ever looked at your screen for long periods without resting or talking a break. Wherever you are talking, texting, taking selfies or snap chatting. Then you are a social media addict. Social media addiction has caused many people( including myself) to get distracted in class, work or even during a family dinner. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology has changed my life quite drastically . It has made access to different things very fast and efficient. Technology have had a profound impact on everyone's life including me. It can be seen in education, infrastructure development, health and medicine, manufacturing, exploration research, communication, security, entertainment and so on. On one hand , it has become easy for us to extract information, express our views and opinions on various social platforms , interacting with people in the remotest part of the world, socializing globally , signing online petitions , paying bills online , learning various subjects through the internet, applying for courses and registering online , transferring money with internet banking, buying and selling online , downloading important apps ,connecting with people all over the world and seeking wordlwide support for the various current issues and so on\u2026\u2026. It's quite evident that with the advent of technology our lives have definitely become easygoing but every coin has two sides i.e, both positive and negative impacts. It is indelible to ignore that with the aid of Technology we will soon become slaves as we are dependent so much on technology that we have become lethargic and get zonked out very easily. 24 by 7 we have our eyes stuck to the screens of our mobile phones, laptops, tablets , PCs which is not at all favourable for our eyes. Most of the time we are so much engrossed that we don't feel like spending time with our family and friends. Even if we wish to write an article or an essay or doing a project we just simply look for it on Google and begin to copy with the speed of a Xerox machine. We don't wish to look for the matter in books and our mind becomes limited and the thinking process comes to a halt. Moreover , when used inappropriately it leads to wastage of precious time. Well, the list of advantages and disadvantages is never ending but it obviously, depends on us that how sincerely we access technology. Thus, in my life technology ,undoubtedly has a very positive impact as things have become easier but I use the internet to a certain extent so that it cannot hamper my skills and mind and I can save much of my time for other productive things! Thanks for reading :) Cheers!! ",

            "answer_text": "Technology has not so much changed my life versus guided it over the decades. That is probably true for more people than they actually realize. That is probably due to the fact that people have a limited idea of what they consider technology, i.e., just computers, smart phones and smart devices. People evolve with it. Homes did not have microwave ovens when I was a kid (early 1960s), just electric and gas ranges. Thru decades of playing racquet sports my racquets went from wood, to metal, to plastics, to graphite and other advanced composites. Consider manufacturing technology - you may not use it yourself, but you benefit from the lower cost of manufactured goods helping you afford items that you might not be able to afford otherwise, thus making your life better. Thank green tech for the increased variety and quality of food you eat and biotech for better healthcare. That said, we all also make choices about how much and what sort of tech we use. For me it has been computer tech from using mainframes for statistical analyses in the 1970s, learning programming and (what was then called) micro-computers in the 1980s, embracing distance learning in the late\u201990s to get my certificate in financial planning, to using various apps for many aspects of my life from simple communications to investments. Today, I am retired and manage all of our household investments online which is the source of our income. Beats working! ",

            "answer_text": " The use of the new $14 VERTICAL jet bidet, the KO BIDET, thought to be a defining act, as its use, instead of t. paper, offers more in convenience, dignity, 100% cleaning, even on hemorrhoid presence (immediate proof: the always clean underwear), time sparing, ecology, water economy and mainly hygiene ( it reduces: fecal dust* and so UTI, HA Infection, antibiotic resistant microbes), and also in reducing hospital functional cost by 10%. Also it is the only bidet could be used with raised toilets, and helps blinds, as its 100% cleaning effect free them from knowing when to stop wiping. *FECAL DUST: It comes from fecal residue, left after wiping with t. paper (complete or, worse of course, incomplete) . Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air it travels to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination. That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause of the known HAI. The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a 4-6 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density in the wards is a one more factor that increases their chance of developing antibiotic resistance.\u201d It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added. CDC, responding to my relative question about fecal dust\u2019s role in HAI, said they could not give me any answer positive or negative. That means that nobody had done any relative research work. 99,000 Americans Die of Healthcare-Aquired Infections Every Year https://www.healthline.com/.../aging-healthca... \u201cA single gram of human feces\u2014which is about the weight of a paper clip\u2014can contain one trillion germs\u201d .

Flabbergasted  by Instagram - *online* Wow! *AFK* Dude, is that really her!????? (I know, *judgemental asshole alert*) 3. Distorted from reality - On a beautiful windy night at Apsarakonda, up and high. \tFriend1 to Friend2: (tripping) Dude, you need to get a life! \tFriend3: (Little deaf due to the strong winds) Don't worry bro, I'll send you a torrent link for it. Just remind me later.(Yes, he actually said that!) 4. Show-off a bit - Using words like AFK instead of IRL: AFK - Away From Keyboard; IRL - In Real Life. 5. Nostalgic by DateTime - Every discussion inevitably ends or changes to, \"You know, it was simpler back when we were small/90's\". And then travel through the long and winding road of Nostalgic lane. 6. Happiness without guilt - Stalking your crush, sister's best friend, friend's ex ex(bro code doesn't allow for friend's ex!) without being tried for being guilty of doing it. Creepy - Check. Fun - Check. Smile-on-Face - Check. Waste of time - Check. 7. Intense anger by torrent sites - No. Not because they violate \"copyright infringement\" or some shit like that. No. Many movies don't come out in HD early! YOU HAVE TO WAIT!!!!! Urg! More to come. If memory is red flagged, edit answer; else wait for memory to get red flagged and then edit answer.
