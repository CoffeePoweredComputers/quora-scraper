            "answer_text": "As a Malaysian, I have taught in Indonesia and Malaysia. I am a TESL graduate. I taught in Indonesia for 1 month for my practical (something like an intern) and came back to Malaysia to finish the rest of my practical around 3 months. To tell you the truth, I kinda had culture shocked when I came back to Malaysia. Lemme just explain something here. When I was in my university days, we were taught to be creative in our methods of teaching. So it was embedded in our heads that when practical comes, we have to do that too. It was going well when I was in Indonesia. I had taught at SMA 1 Semarang, and the experience was great. The students are all very communicative and responsive. They were up for a challenge when I want to play games while teaching them English. To top it off, my supervisor teacher was very encouraging. He would help me in planning and improvise it if he thinks the student could not understand what I am teaching. To me, that whole 1 month was special and fun. So when that 1 month ends, and we have to come back to Malaysia. The moment we step in the school office we knew that something was wrong. Well, one of the thing that is not okay was that we were sent to one of the worst school in the district. But I kept an open mind. So I was given a few classes to teach. I tried to do some games. However, my supervisor teacher was not very supportive (the reason behind this is because she is afraid that it will not turn up well, though as a person she was nice to me). Generally teachers in Malaysia do not want to insert some games in the class as a method of teaching. They are afraid that it will interrupt other classes and so on. Nonetheless, I executed a few games and the students seemed to enjoy them. If I compare the students of Malaysia and Indonesia, they are VERY different. Our students are less responsive and shy. When I started teaching they didn\u2019t really want to participate. We are more exam oriented. I played few games to start things going and at last I manage to get the class to participate to all of my lessons. The feeling was great though. I have to admit, despite sometimes the students gave me hard times, I felt that the worst was the pressure of other teachers (politics >.<). Anyways, I may be kinda struck a nerve of one of the teacher. That teacher was the head of department for English. She was the one that gave me hard times in school. I cried almost everyday because of her. She even scolded me in front of the whole office. The reason? because apparently I have American accent. I don\u2019t sound like a typical Malay and she said the students could not understand me. I asked the students, they understand me perfectly well. See where I am going with this? Sometimes I do feel that the ones that making a job difficult is not the job, it is the surrounding. The job is okay. All in all, teaching in Malaysia means you have to get ready with all kinds of politics in school (anywhere also have this kind of issue) and most importantly do not give up on the students. They may look shy but you have to break the ice a bit in order to get to know them. Good luck! :) ",
