            "answer_text": "Hydrogen is a gas denoted by H2, which is formed when two hydrogen atoms bond together and become a Hydrogen Molecule. H2 is the smallest molecule on Earth, consisting of two protons and two electrons. It is the most common form of hydrogen. Hydrogen atom does not carry any charge. While a hydrogen ion carries a +1 charge due to loss of its electrons. A hydrogen ion is made up of a nucleus with charge +1 (a single proton). Therefore, the positively charged ion has charge +1. It is denoted H+ ",

            "answer_text": "Hydrogen ion is also termed as hydron. It is made by the removal of one electron from atomic hydrogen. Hydrogen ion has a +1 charge (monovalent). Hydrogen ion carries a +1 charge, as opposed to neutrally charged hydrogen atom. \u2022 Hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron, whereas hydrogen ion has one proton, but no electrons. ",
