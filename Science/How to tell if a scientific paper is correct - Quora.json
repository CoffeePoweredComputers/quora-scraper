            "answer_text": "Being published in a peer-reviewed journal (preferably with a high impact factor) is a start. Not a guarantee - but it\u2019s certainly better than being announced by press conference or published outside the peer reviewed journalsBeing cited by a lot of other papers - preferably written by respected scientists - helps. Although, any paper that seems to break new ground will be highly cited unless it\u2019s shown to be wrongMaking testable predictions - especially if tested and found to be correct - helps even more.Lasting for years or decades is nice (although not essential)And, of course, your own BS sense. Does it make sense to you, or does it seem as though the authors are really stretching their data and its interpretation? If your own BS sensor goes off\u2026you need to convince yourself that the paper is likely to be right.Something else to remember is that it\u2019s hard to say that a paper is \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cincorrect.\u201d The paper that first introduced the concept of an asteroid strike wiping out the dinosaurs had some mistakes in it - but the overall concept seems to be pretty accurate.

            "answer_text": "Roger Bacon invented the modern scientific paper. This invention is based on the power of an experiment to validate a concept. A most important part of the scientific paper is the EXPERIMENTAL section. Roger Bacon prescribed that anyone who could successfully replicate the experiment, and obtain the results that were reported, would be convinces of the validity of the phenomena and the interpretations of the original author. In other words, if you can duplicate the experiments, you will be convinced that the paper is correct. In labs where I worked, we frequently duplicated experiments reported. Not every lab has the ability to do this. We have to rely on the record of the authors to report things professionally. Occasionally we have to call up the author and get additional instructions on how to conduct the experiments. I pity the specialties that must rely on what someone says. People frequently lie, or make up things in their heads and pass them off as true. ",

            "answer_text": "First question - is it published in a peer-reviewed journal? The peers who support the journal\u2019s editors will generally know much more than you do about the subject in general, correct use of the relevant methodologies, and proper interpretation of experimental results. Many \u201cscientific results\u201d are published in non-reviewed journals. Scientific results move the field forward only when they meet standards of reproducibility, and non-reviewed journals regularly publish papers that do not meet that standard. Otherwise, you might ask scientists you know WHO HAVE PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE IN THAT PARTICULAR SUBJECT MATTER whether they have studied the paper and what they think of it. Finally, you might educate yourself to a level of experience that allows you to critique the paper yourself or, ultimately, try to reproduce the results yourself. Simply assessing that the paper \u201cfeels right\u201d or \u201dmakes sense\u201d in no way validates the results. ",
