            "answer_text": "A lot of that will depend on how old they are right now and what lifestyle choices they put in place in their early years and carry through their life. If you are 65, have been living the typical western lifestyle of bad diet and sedentary living and just now waking up to what it will take for you to realize your full-potential, I can only say \u201cgood luck, bucko\u201d. You are most likely screwed and going to end up just adding to the average. We need to be real here with our thinking about what it takes to get to 100. We now know that genetics/family history may play only a 30% role in our longevity, no more. So if mom, dad, grandpa, and grandma lived to a ripe old age, don\u2019t expect to duplicate that if you are making major contributions to Carl\u2019s Jr. and Little Caesar\u2019s Pizza bottom line. Or becoming one with your La-Z-Boy and voice-activated remote. We did yeoman work in the 20th century to pick the easier and low-hanging fruit of things that were taking us out early. We saved more newborns, reduced or eliminated infectious diseases, created safer workplaces, improved our water and food quality and distribution, and enhanced quality and availability of education. The easy work has been done and now we have hit a wall and are stalled or actually slipping back a little. So our response is to turn to science and hope that they will come up with a magic pill or potion that will help us overcome the reason we\u2019ve stalled - our crappy lifestyles. We have a \u201cwhole-life potential\u201d benchmark of 122 years and 164 days established for us Mme Jeanne Calment of Arles, France who lived that long (documented - the debunking of this has been debunked). We\u2019re doing pretty poorly against that benchmark in America, only hitting, on average 66% of that average.  Consider this: the U.S. is 46th amongst countries of the world in life expectancy, two slots below Cuba and sandwiched in between Estonia and Panama. And going backward. But, hey - science with their magic potion will come along and save us from that. Damn if I\u2019m going to give up HBO and Applebee\u2019s to study and learn about my biology and take control of it. A physician once told me that the biggest killer in our culture isn\u2019t diseases - it\u2019s self-care illiteracy. We are just flat too lazy to understand how this magnificent machine we walk around in works. Look at the stats: the five major killers in our culture - heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and dementia - haven\u2019t changed in decades. And they are all lifestyle diseases and preventable. Dr. David Katz, a physician at the Yale School of Medicine, and founder of an organization called the Academy of Lifestyle Medicine said the following in a presentation to a large group of his peers: \u201cWe already know all that we need to know to reduce, by 80%, the five major killers in our country. We don\u2019t need any more fancy drugs or equipment or more Nobel Prizes. We know all we need to know today.\u201d Dr. Walter Bortz, retired Stanford geriatric physician and author of seven excellent books on aging, said this: \u201cThere is no biological reason that anyone should not live to 100 or beyond.\u201d His books \u201cDare to Be 100\u201d and \u201cThe Roadmap to 100\u201d lays it all out for us. And guess what, no mention of magic pills or potions. He also says: \u201cIt is possible to live to 100 by chance, but not likely.\u201d His point is that it takes \u201cguts and smarts\u201d to live a long life. How smart is it to wait for a solution to come along to compensate for laziness and ignorance? NOT! It\u2019s never too late to start but always to early to quit. Regardless of age, you stand a better chance of getting to 100 by simply honoring your birthright of good health and do by your body what it needs to function optimally. And that\u2019s pretty simple - oxygen (as in exercise), good nutrition (as in a mostly plant-based diet), social engagement (as in a wide circle of friends), and continuing mental stimulation (as in learning something new every day). Four pretty simple pillars of good health. Try those while you wait for the magic pill. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s interesting that the average human lifespan has been going up almost every year in the 100 years or so. Modern medicine, good sanitary practices, and increased wealth have all contributed to this. For instance, in the year 1900, American life expectancy was about 47 years of age. In 2020, American life expectancy is about 79 years of age. However, the longest known lifespans have not changed. The longest human lifespan which is undisputed is that of Sarah Knauss of the United States (1880\u20131999), who lived to age 119 years. Right now there are over 450,000 people alive who are at least 100 years old. But no one that has been verified has reached 120. So our bodies seem to be programmed to live no longer than 120 years. It could well be that life expectancy (in developed countries) could reach 100. Some current estimates are that life expectancy could reach 100 by the year 2100.  Getting past 120 years of age will take some sorts of breakthroughs that are able to slow down or stop aging. Quite few scientists are working on this now.
