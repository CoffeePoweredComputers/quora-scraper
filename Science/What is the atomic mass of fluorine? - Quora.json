            "answer_text": "The accepted value for the atomic mass of fluorine is 18.998403163 atomic mass units. This is an average taking into consideration that almost all fluorine atoms have a weight of 19.0, but there is a trace amount of F-18 always in existance, probably because of cosmic rays and natural radioactivity. The F-18 lowers the average ever so slightly from 19. ",
