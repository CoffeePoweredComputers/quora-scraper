            "answer_text": "In the next 20-50 years anthropology will become increasingly focused on the practical application of anthropological research in non-academic settings. There are two main factors driving this, from within the academy and outside of it. Inside the academy, jobs are drying up and pursuing a career of pure research is not a viable career path for the majority of people with advanced degrees in anthropology.  So, anthropologists in my generation are looking for non-academic positions. Right now we're forced to make up our own career path, but in the coming years shifting to applied research will become more institutionalized within anthropology departments. Outside of the academy, both businesses and non-profits are increasingly interested in the social and cultural factors underlying the work they do. Within business, this can be seen in user experience, design research and qualitative market research, all of which draw heavily on ethnography, qualitative interviews, and the contextualizing of behavior in social and cultural contexts. Non-profits are using ethnography in program design and evaluation. I would disagree with Selim Jamil's answer that quantitative analysis will become a significant tool in anthropology. You might see some increase in the use of statistics by some anthropologists, but I doubt it will become widespread in the field. While some cultural anthropologists might use quantitative analysis, they are definitely a tiny minority - only a handful of the hundreds of cultural anthropology books or articles I've read have used any quantitative analysis. Anthropologists in applied settings do use statistics more, but its not their strong point. (This only holds true for cultural anthropologists - many archeologists, linguistic and cognitive anthropologists, however, are heavy in to statistics.) We're focused on the particulars of everyday life, and I don't see how big data is particularly useful for the kinds of questions we ask. That isn't to deny the usefulness of big data, but if a company wants to put big data to use, they'll hire someone else. From conversations I've had with data scientists, my sense is that we approach things from very different perspectives that are hard to bridge. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there could be some very interesting applications for the social sciences in the next decade. Big data has the potential to generate a lot of useful information that can be explored by sociologists and anthropologists and such. Questions about online browsing habits of social groups and cultures can inform us about learning styles, economic choices and a myriad of other topics. I think the social sciences will continue to explore and focus on quantitative analysis and modeling as a result of this. We may see less emphasis on qualitative analysis but I'm not sure that's a bad thing. ",
