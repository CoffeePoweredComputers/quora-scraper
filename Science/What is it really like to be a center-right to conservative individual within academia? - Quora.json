            "answer_text": "I think the experience of grad students and junior faculty (people who have not yet received tenure) is in many ways like that of gays before the gay rights movement: it\u2019s not that there\u2019s a great deal of overt pressure to alter your opinions, but rather that you feel you must conceal your opinions because you can\u2019t be sure that you won\u2019t be received negatively. Since everyone with these sorts of opinions does this, liberal and progressive faculty seldom realize they are in the presence of a libertarian or conservative, and thus jokes and disparaging remarks get made as if no one present could possibly be offended, and the person in question then feels all the more incentive to conceal their opinions. A big part of this is that academics value intelligence for obvious reasons, and it is a part of the liberal political way of seeing to think that conservatives are stupid and unenlightened. Since an aspiring academic needs all the support they can get (it\u2019s a very competitive environment in which jobs are scarce and not receiving tenure can be a career-ender) it\u2019s simply too risky to be \u201cout of the closet.\u201d Is that the fault of the liberal academics? No more or less than any form of bigotry and prejudice is. The idea that there is a kind of radical leftwing \u201cauthoritarianism\u201d is greatly overstated. Most academics are moderately left of center and put up with more extreme views without sharing them. However, the expression of extreme views is more newsworthy, and thus the appearance to the outside world is that academia is a hotbed of a very aggressive and willful form of enforced opinion. It\u2019s more like passive and ignorant stereotyping than deliberate regimentation. After you receive tenure, once people know that you\u2019re not stupid or a horrible person (assuming that you wouldn\u2019t receive tenure if you were) you can begin to make clear that you are a reasonable libertarian or moderate conservative, and people are largely accepting of that, at least when it\u2019s not election season! Academia is full of people with exotic personalities, and the tendency is to think that your conservatism or libertarianism makes you just another exotic creature. ",

            "answer_text": "Academia has always been very liberal minded (in the classical sense) which is essential to the origin and propagation of new Ideas. However, like many other centers of classical liberal thinking, the academy has for many years now found itself to be the home of the more radical left. Marxism has always been more popular within academic circles than outside of them, as have communism and anarcho-communism and second and third wave feminism and the modern \u201cSocial Justice\u201d movement. What is it REALLY like to be conservative in the modern sense within academia? Are the horror stories really true? Is the constant stream of videos being released from rallies, conferences and lectures highlighting an atmosphere of left-wing authoritarianism really representative of the experience of the typical academic? Elaborate. ",
