            "answer_text": "There is no other correct proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT) other than the definite proof by Andrew Wiles, with the corrections by Richard Taylor. There were many false proofs of FLT by amateurs, all partial or flawed because of one basic mistake: most of them wrongly supposed that numbers can be uniquely decomposed into primes in any number systems. The unique prime factorization is of vital importance, and it is not granted for all number systems. Leonard Euler falsely \u201cproved\u201d the case for exponent 3 in the 18th century, but his proof contained some flaws.Leonardo Fibonacci proved the case for fourth powers in 1225, even before Fermat proposed the general problem, in his book \u201cLiber Quadratorum\u201d. In 1847 Gabriel Lam\u00e9 presented a proof in a meeting in Paris, and Augustin Cauchy suspect that there would be a problem concerned with unique factorization for n \u2265 4. There was a fierce discussion and competition, and some time later both deposited \"secret packages\" to the Paris Academy, in order to establish priority. Those secret envelopes were a method devised by the academy to guarantee priority on academic prizes or competitions. Both proofs by Lam\u00e9 and Cauchy were wrong: \tJoseph Liouville, based on ideas of the German mathematician Ernst Kummer, proved that Lam\u00e9's complex numbers missed the unique factorization property. The unique hope is now to find (if possible) a shorter proof of FLT. Beal's conjecture, if true, would provide a two-lines proof of FLT (see my previous answer on Beal's Conjecture) ",

            "answer_text": "Andrew Wiles gets credit for proving Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. His work depends of course upon the work of many others, including especially Richard Taylor with whom he collaborated on one of the two papers completing the proof, and a previous result of Ribet showing that the Frey curve ([math]y^2=x(x-a^p)(x+b^p)[/math]) of a counterexample ([math]a^p+b^p=c^p[/math]) would not be modular. For brevity, I\u2019m leaving out a lot of the story. No essentially different proof has been made yet. The techniques in Wiles\u2019 proof have been extended to prove modularity for all elliptic curves and I believe made nicer in some other ways. (I\u2019m not familiar with what changes have been made.) There are several other approaches that have been considered, and I tend to suspect that some of them will work some day. If one were to prove a strong enough version of the ABC conjecture, for example, that would do it. By a strong version I mean one that gives an explicit bound; the ABC conjecture just claims that a certain constant exists depending on an [math]\\epsilon>0[/math], but a proof is likely to give us a formula for a specific bound. Results about cyclotomic fields have been used to prove cases of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem for many specific exponents. ",
