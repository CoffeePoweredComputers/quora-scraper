            "answer_text": "When a light travels from one medium to other medium it's speed changes. The ratio of the speed of light in vaccum to the speed of light in vaccum is termed as refractive index.The refractive index of a medium tells us how much the speed of light has slowed down in the medium. It is denoted by a Greek letter u(pronounced as mu).Since it is a ratio it has no units. u = c / v where c is the speed of light in vaccum and v is the speed of light in the medium. u = sin i / sin r where i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of reflection.

            "answer_text": "It is the measure of how much the velocity of light reduces while it travels through a medium other than vacuum. Higher the refractive index,slower the light moves through that medium. The lowest value of refractiveindex possible for a material is 1. If it goes below one,it will be a violation of Einstein's special theory of relativity. ",
