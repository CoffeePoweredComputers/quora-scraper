            "answer_text": "The equation above represents the combustion reaction for propene, the third in the homologous series of alkenes with general molecular formular CnH2n which are more unsaturated compared to their preceding simbling, the alkanes (CnH2n+2). Alkenes generally burn with more smoky flames compared to the alkanes because of their higher carbon-to-hydrogen ratio compared to their corresponding alkane simbling.Infact the alkynes CnH2n-2 ,have more degree of unsaturation You must agree that it definitely Doesn't take much to show thatn/(2n-2) > n/2n > n/(2n+2) for any whole number n>0Also the denominators are increasing steadily by a common difference of 2 When hydrocarbons such as propene C3H6 (Organic compounds with hydrogen and oxygen Cx Hy where x and y are positive whole numbers) reacts with oxygen O2, the reaction always yields various moles of Carbon(iv) oxide (CO2) and water(H2O). Actually, we can exploitatively summarize all the balanced combustion reactions for the three hydrocarbons spoken of above due to the symmetry they showcase inherent in their consistently increasing number of hydrogen atoms per unit carbon atom as already observed above and consequently , enunciated below in terms of two parameters which we shall term as (n ,d)Let d =1 for alkanesLet d =2 for alkenesAndLet d= 3 for alkynes Where n is their number of carbon atoms hence defining the particular hydrocarbon and d is just their usual homologous order A generally balanced equation i heuristically made up sometime ago would then be, CnH2(n+2-d) + 1/2(3n +2-d)O2-----> nCO2 + (n-d+2) H2O Now for propene C3H6 where d =2, n=3, The balanced equation would be C3H2(3+2-2) + 1/2 (3 x3 +2-2) O2 -----> 3Co2 + (3-2+2)H2OC3H6 +9/2 O2------> 3 CO2 + 3H2OIf you dont like the fraction, multiply out by 2 and you have,2C3H6 + 9 O2-------> 6 CO2 + 6H2O. *For a rough check, the law of conservation of mass credited to the french chemist Antoine Lavoisier tells us to be sure the total mass of reactants equals that of the products in any well controlled chemical reaction.So, taking the relative atomic masses as ( C =12 ,H =1, O=16, g/mol respectively)Reactant: 2{(12 x3) +(1 x6)} + 9{(16 x2)} = 84 + 288 =372g/mol.Product: 6{12 + (16 x2)} + 6{(1 x2) + 16} =264 + 108 =372g/mol.
