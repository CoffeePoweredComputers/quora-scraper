            "answer_text": "Why didn't you ask this when Ronald Reagan ran up the National Debt and had Congress pass legislation so he could take from the FICA trust fund (which he had been so concerned about preserving that he hiked the taxes) and write IOUs? Oh yeah, here it is, from Jon Perr over at Crooks and Liars:\"Reagan,\" Vice President Dick Cheney famously declared in 2002, \"proved deficits don't matter.\" Unless, that is, a Democrat is in the White House. After all, while Ronald Reagan tripled the national debt and George W. Bush doubled it again, each Republican was rewarded with a second term in office. But as the Gallup polling data show, concern over the federal deficit hasn't been this high since Democratic budget balancer Bill Clinton was in office. All of which suggest the Republicans' born-again disdain for deficits ranks among the greatest - and most successful - political double-standards in recent memory. Then came George W. Bush, who promised in his 2001 message to Congress:At the end of those 10 years, we will have paid down all the debt that is available to retire. That is more debt repaid more quickly than has ever been repaid by any nation at any time in history. Instead, President Bush produced red ink as far as the eye can see. After inheriting a federal budget in the black and CBO forecast of a $5.6 trillion surplus over 10 years, President George W. Bush quickly set about dismantling the progress made under Bill Clinton. Even with two unfunded wars and the similarly unpaid Medicare prescription drug benefit, Bush's $1.4 trillion tax cut in 2001, followed by a $550 billion second round in 2003, accounted for half of the yawning budget deficits he produced. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities explained, if made permanent those Bush tax cuts would add more to the national debt over the next decade than the impact of Iraq, Afghanistan, the recession, the stimulus and TARP - combined. During his presidency, Republicans in Congress voted seven times to raise the debt ceiling, the last to $11.3 trillion. By the time George W. Bush ambled out of the White House, he left his successor a $1.2 trillion budget deficit for 2009. Barack Obama inherited two wars, a doubled national debt, and that $1.2 trillion deficit from George W. Bush. (As Orrin Hatch described the Bush years, \"it was standard practice not to pay for things.\") But one thing was new: Republican concern about the budget deficit. Obama's agenda, ambitious as it may be, is responsible for only a sliver of the deficits, despite what many of his Republican critics are saying,\" the New York Times' David Leonhardt explained in 2009, adding, \"The economic growth under George W. Bush did not generate nearly enough tax revenue to pay for his agenda, which included tax cuts, the Iraq war, and Medicare prescription drug coverage.\" That fall, former Reagan Treasury official Bruce Bartlett offered just that kind of honesty to the born again deficit virgins of his Republican Party. Noting that the FY2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion was solely due to lower tax revenues and not increased spending, Bartlett concluded:\"I think there are grounds on which to criticize the Obama administration's anti-recession actions. But spending too much is not one of them. Indeed, based on this analysis, it is pretty obvious that spending - real spending on things like public works - has been grossly inadequate. The idea that Reagan-style tax cuts would have done anything is just nuts.\" Which is exactly right. Thanks to the steep recession, as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and others have documented time and again, the overall federal tax burden as a percentage of GDP is now below 15%, \"levels that low have not been seen since 1950.\" And as Jonathan Cohn and Paul Krugman each explained, it is not a mythical Obama \"spending binge\" but the drastic loss of revenue combined with automatic increases in mandated safety net outlays that is producing the current budget gap. In June 2011, Rhode Island Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse lamented the double-standard at work in the Republicans' posturing on the national debt:\"I understand the point about the debt and the deficit and the spending,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). \"But to me, that doesn't have an enormous amount of credibility, because when President Clinton left office, he left an annual surplus... At the end of [George W. Bush's] term, we had $9 trillion in debt... We would have none of this if it hadn't been for the Republican debt orgy that they went through,\" Whitehouse said. Apparently, Sheldon Whitehouse and his Democratic allies don't understand how this game works. As Cheney said, \"Reagan proved deficits don't matter.\" (Unless a Democrat is POTUS) In 2016, Trump said several things that basically amounted to \"the government can't run out of money, it can just print more.\" The Deficit and the National Debt were not a part of the Republican Party platform when he ran. It will be interesting to see if the Republicans are as hawkish about it in 2017 now that they are in control of the government. Based on past obersations, I'd say no. I predict they'll cut taxes for the top 1%, give corporations a tax holiday for re-homing offshore profits, and watch the debt skyrocket -- and blame it on \"entitlements\", their code word for \"the poor and lazy\" rather than their entitlements for the rich/corporate welfare.

            "answer_text": "First of all, there seems to be this conception that as soon as Obama took office, he should have been able to wave his magic wand and make the deficit - if not the entire debt - go *poof* and disappear, and because he didn\u2019t do so, then he MUST be some kind of tax-and-spend liberal. It would do you a world of good to get a bit of the backstory on how we got to where we are today when it comes to the deficit and the debt. Both Democrats and Republicans pretty much had the deficit under control until Reagan came in with his \u201ctrickled-down economics\u201d (what Bush Sr. rightfully called \u201cvoodoo economics\u201d), slashed taxes, poured many billions more into defense, and tripled the debt in eight years. He saddled Bush Sr. with the S&L crisis and the subsequent recession, and Bush Sr. tried his absolute best to get our economy back on track. He raised taxes and cut defense spending (both against howls of protest by the Republican party), but because the economy didn\u2019t (couldn\u2019t) turn around overnight, Clinton won the next election. I am a liberal, but I\u2019m of the firm conviction that much of the credit for the mid-90\u2019s economic boom and the subsequent budget surplus goes NOT to Clinton, but to Bush Sr. for raising taxes and cutting spending. What Clinton did right is that he pretty much kept to Bush Sr.\u2019s economic program, and as a result, when George W. Bush was elected, Clinton handed him a budget surplus that was projected to pay off our entire national debt by 2012! But what did George W. Bush do? He slashed taxes yet again while at the same time increasing spending, and - for the first time in our nation\u2019s history - took us to war without raising taxes to pay for the war. We went to war on the nation\u2019s credit card, and we were spending as much as $12B per month for George W. Bush\u2019s military adventurism. So\u2026yeah, Bush flushed the budget surplus right down the toilet, and several years later handed the presidency over to Barack Obama. And the day Barack Obama took over, he was handed the worst economic s**t sandwich since the Great Depression (we lost over 800K jobs that very month!) AND was handed two very unpopular wars at the same time! On top of all that, the very night before Obama took the oath of office, the Republican elite got together and decided to completely oppose everything - absolutely everything - that Obama tried to do even if they\u2019d supported it before! So Obama was simultaneously handed the worst economic meltdown in eighty years AND two very unpopular wars AND the worst degree of political opposition faced by any president since the Civil War\u2026and yet he still cut the deficit by more than 50%. Unfortunately, cutting the deficit is only cutting the amount America\u2019s losing by 50% - it\u2019s not the same thing as paying down the debt. In order to pay down the debt, he would have had to wipe out the entire deficit and have a surplus - but that could not have been done without raising taxes\u2026which the Republicans simply wouldn\u2019t allow. In other words, if you really want to know who\u2019s to blame for America still having a deficit and a massive debt, most of the blame (though certainly not all) lay on George W. Bush and the Republican party\u2026because if you\u2019ll recall, the GOP\u2019s held control of Congress (and the national \u201cpurse strings\u201d) for all but four years since 1992. ",
