            "answer_text": "Several examples will clarify the point you have raised. For frictional force to come in to existence ,there will have to be relative motion between bodies whose surfaces are in contact with each other. Even if they do not move relative to each other but due to some applied force they have tendency to move relative to each other then also there will be friction opposing that tendency.(1): As an example consider a block of mass m1 resting on the horizontal floor. Let mu be coefficient of friction between block\u2019s surface in contact with floor and the surface of floor. The maximum force of friction here can be (mu)mg. Now, if we apply horizontal force F ,say, in X- direction and if |F|<(mu)mg, the block will not move, but it will have tendency to move in X- direction. In this situation frictional force will be equal to the applied force.The direction of frictional force will be opposite to that of applied force.(2): In above situation if magnitude of applied force is gradually increased we come to a situation in which the block is just on the point of moving in the direction of the applied force. Now, (mu)m1g=|F|. The friction is opposite to the force.(3): Let there be two blocks of mass m1 and m2. Now imagine the situation in which m1 is on the floor and m2 is on m1.Let coefficient of friction between m1 and floor be (mu1) and that between m1and m2 be (mu2). Suppose we apply a force F1 in X-direction on m1 and m1 moves relative to floor and m2. Then in the free body diagram of m1 following forces will have to be shown:1)F1 in X- direction.2)(mu1)(m1+m2)g opposite to direction of force3) (mu2)m2g also opposite to applied force.(4): If external force is applied on m2 then in free body diagram of m2 the frictional force (mu2)m2g will be opposite to applied force. Also, in this condition frictional forces on m1 will be (mu1)(m1+m2)g opposit to applied force and (mu2)g in the direction of the force. In the above examples if both bodies move with same velocity the friction between them will not be there. The system of two bodies will behave as one body of total mass(m1+m2).(5): There are frictional forces in case of rolling body. Suppose a wheel is rolling along the horizontal floor under the effect of a horizontal force passing through it\u2019s axis. At the point of contact there will be tendency in the wheel to slide in the direction of the applied force. This tendency will give rise to frictional force opposite to applied force. This frictional force will produce a torque about the axis of rotation. Hence the wheel will rotate and also it\u2019s center of mass will move forward in which case the same friction will oppose the linear motion of center of mass of the wheel. In case of a body rolling on an incline the external force is gravitational force. (6): The motion of cycle is interesting from friction point of view. When we paddle, we produce angular acceleration in thr rear wheel. The friction at the point of contact with the ground comes in to existence such that it opposes the angular acceleration of the rear wheel, This frictional force is in forward direction and it pushes the cycle in forward direction. At the same time the frictional force on the front wheel is in the back ward direction because at the contact point of this wheel with ground the wheel has tendency of sliding forward. Regarding Newton\u2019s third law of motion you might have heard a famous conversation between a horse and the owner of horse cart. The problem is resolved by forward frictional force of ground on the \u201cfoot\u201d of horse and tendency of wheels to slide in the forward direction causing frictional force in the back ward direction which in turn cause torque on the wheels about their centers.

            "answer_text": "Observe motion. That is the best way to understand in which direction friction is acting. If two surfaces are trying to move or moving in opposite direction, friction will act and it will act in a direction such that the motion that is happening stops. Friction hates relative motion. It'll try to bring relative velocity zero. So the direction is always such that relative velocity becomes zero. As an exercise, try to find direction of friction on front and back wheel of a bicycle.
