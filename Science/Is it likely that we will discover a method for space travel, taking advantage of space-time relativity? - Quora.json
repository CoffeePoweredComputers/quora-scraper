You can also find the answer at http://www.creationoftheuniverse.org/ \u2014- http://www.aslodge.com/time There is \u201c NO\u201c space-time, gravity works just fine by itself. TIME and EXISTENCE Time is just a \u201c MEASUREMENT \u201c. It is constant wherever you are. The accuracy of the instrument you use will be influenced by gravity, centrifugal force, heat, and a few other variables. Time in not a \u201c FORCE \u201c. There is no time \u201c DIMENSION \u201c. There is no possibility of time \u201c TRAVEL \u201c. All that exists, does so in the present \" INDIVISIBLE \" moment. ",

Gravity is still a force propagated through space without the need for some fictional fabric \u201ccurved by mass\u201d which \u201cguides the movement of masses.\u201d We already use gravity to boost velocity for space travel.

            "answer_text": "Space travel is inevitable. Space time relatively is a misconception and is based on how things appear. The universe is more than how it appears. There is no absolute space or absolute time, therefore, there cannot be an absolute speed. All we need to do is design faster propulsion systems. As the whole universe is there to be explored. ",
