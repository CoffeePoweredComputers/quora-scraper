            "answer_text": "Marie Byrd Land, the portion of Antarctica that lies between about 150 and 108 degrees West, is the largest terra nullis on earth and is about 1.6 million square kilometers. Nothing else comes close - the next largest unclaimed land is probably Bir Tawil, a remote and unpopulated area of about 2000 square km along the Egypt-Sudan border that has been the subject of a longstanding border dispute.. Each side, citing different British colonial-era surveyors from the turn of the 20th century, interprets the border in such a way that the Bir Tawil belongs to the other side: Egypt thinks the border should run straight across the 22nd parallel (green line in the map below) while Sudan thinks it should be the jagged path in blue. Both sides want access to the better land along the Red Sea more than they want Bir Tawil.  ",
