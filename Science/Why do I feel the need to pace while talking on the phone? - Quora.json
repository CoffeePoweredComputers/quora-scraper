            "answer_text": "I pace when I am talking on the phone . I get yelled at all the time because I walk in and out of coverage. I get told my phone cuts in and out so have to force myself to stand still. \u201cCan you hear me now?\u201d. I am a restless person. I can only read so much and have to put the book down and then after a few minutes pick it back up again. If the phone call is more serious than the weather my emotions and nervousness come out my feet. I can't talk in front of people without pacing. If a friend is right there I can relax and be comfortable but talking on the phone I have to consciously force myself to concentrate on everything they are saying. Major flaw. P.S, This is an explanation for why I pace during a phone conversation. Don't know how many other people have this problem. I have issues. ",

            "answer_text": "Pacing is a good, no, a GREAT thing. It is movement connected to thinking. It\u2019s part of my New Asian major movement awareness, because most people \u201cthink\u201d by sitting, sedentary, the symbol of inaction in non- motion. We spend the largest portion of our days sedentary, and pacing brings us out of that without having to spend time on treadmills to nowhere and stationary gym equipment. Prisoners use pacing as part of their workout in their cells. Monks use pacing as part of their meditation. Pacing, like standing while working, should be an essential part of your awake day. Pacing, motion, any opportunity to get off your heiny, is the pathway to \u201ccrack your body to get to your mind to release your spirit\u201d. Pace more! ",
