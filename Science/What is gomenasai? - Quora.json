            "answer_text": "It is gomen-nasai: means something along the lines of sorry for troubling you so much. To be said only when one is extremely, regrettably sorry. Otherwise, a 'sumi masen' will also do. Among peers, one can also say just 'gomen'. E.g- when you accidentally brush against someone, say 'sumi masen'. Mind you, this term also doubles for 'excuse me'. So be careful in the usage.E.g.- When you accidentally drown your friend's pet cat, say gomen nasai. Though that might not be enoughExamples are to denote the seriousness of the situation where the terms are to be used. Please don't take it in any other way. ",
