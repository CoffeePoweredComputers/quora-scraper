            "answer_text": "Not all research is scientific. Research is defined as a formalized way to find information. So going to the library to find references for a paper you want to write is a type of research. Looking up ways to cook spaghetti for dinner in a variety of cookbooks is a type of research. That said good scientific research strives to find objective information. The most interesting type is hypothesis testing. A lot of effort is needed to design and execute studies and to eliminate sources of bias and error. Perseverance is needed. Studies often do not work out the first time usually for technical reasons. Nature does not give up its secrets willingly. However, if you do research and get an unexpected result and have eliminated sources of error and bias, you have something interesting. You may have touched upon very new knowledge. Be sure to consult with others about your results to make sure you are not fooling yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "In theory, research is a scientific method to get the data to see trends and infer probabilities. However, the probabilities are frequently wildly skewed because contrary results and studies without a significant result greatly tend not to be published. This greatly diminishes the validity of, especially meta-studies. Scientists are left with skewed one-sided information and compounded errors. ",
