            "answer_text": "Molecules have a much, much higher density of energy levels than atoms do. As a consequence transitions between molecular energy levels give origin to bands (spectroscopic lines are broadened by various mechanisms, so that in most situations they blend to form continuous absorption bands). Molecules have so many more energy levels because they can vibrate and rotate, and have therefore rotation-vibrational energy levels. On the other hand atoms only have an electronic spectrum, which is much more sparse. Here is a concrete example. The first excited level of the nitrogen atom lies at about 19,230 cm-1 from the ground state, the second excited state at about 28,840 cm-1 and the third at about 83,300 cm-1. So the nitrogen atom has only three excited states in the range up to 83,300 cm-1 (some of these states split because of spin-orbit, but let\u2019s not go into that). The hydrogen atom has an even more widely spaced spectrum, with its first excited state at about 83,260 cm-1. So in the energy range up to, say, 30,000 cm-1 the two separated atoms have of the order of 4 energy levels in all (counting also the ground states). There is therefore only a handful of possible transitions. However, if we put these two atoms together to form the NH molecule (the imidogen radical) we obtain more electronic states and many more rotational-vibrational states, of the order of several thousands. So we go from ~4 to, say, 4000 energy levels in the given energy range, a 1000-fold increase in density. And this is just a diatomic molecule. A polyatomic molecule, especially one with heavy atoms, has an even denser spectrum. As I have mentioned at the beginning, it is precisely this wealth of levels - which exist in molecules but don\u2019t in atoms - which gives origin to molecular spectroscopic absorption and emission bands as opposed to atomic line spectra.
