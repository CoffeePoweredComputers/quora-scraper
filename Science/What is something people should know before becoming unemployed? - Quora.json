            "answer_text": "I took voluntary redundancy when I was 45. (note: that is a BAD age to job seek). Things I learnt: That it is easier to get a job when you already have one , than when you don\u2019t.Create a CV - don\u2019t bullshit! , Make it REALLY easy to read quickly (no more than two pages but make sure that the first page tells you ALL they need to know.Don\u2019t expect to get jobs from job adverts. (That\u2019s a lottery)Don\u2019t trust HR departments. It is their job to reduce the applicants, not recommend them.Research the companies in your commune range (however you set that)Find out the name of the CEO, or MD .Write asking him if he could give you twenty minutes to advise him about how you could get into his industry sector (i.e. don;t ask for a job - even if you are).Research the company. Know what they do, who runs them and what they might need.Network: Ask everyone you know if they could give you twenty minutes (in work time - NOT at the pub/club) to discuss who/how/where you might find a job - don\u2019t EVER - ask a friend for a job - just ask them for their ideas, leads etc. (but if they offer - take it!)Being unemployed - doesn\u2019t mean not working. your job is finding a job.Get up at normal time get washed dressed, fed, and start your job hunt at 9 give yourself a lunch hour then work until 6. then finish. Monday to Friday.You are NOT unemployed at the weekend. Relax. Enjoy.Exercise - go to the gym if you can afford it. Hike, cycle, swim as much as possible - you need to keep body and mind string.NOTE: It is NEVER easy. Being unemployed was the hardest work I ever did. ",
