            "answer_text": "If we go for the reaction in terms of mole concept then it refers that for 1 mole of O2 two moles of Mg are required to produce 2 moles of MgO. 1 mole of O2 is its 32g and 2 moles of Mg is 2 * 24.31 =48.62 g but we need for 16 g O2 which is half mole of O2 then dividing b/s by factor 2 we have Mg + 1/2 O2 \u2014\u2014\u2192 MgO 24.31g + 16g \u2014\u2014-> 40.31g. thus we need 24.31 g Mg.
