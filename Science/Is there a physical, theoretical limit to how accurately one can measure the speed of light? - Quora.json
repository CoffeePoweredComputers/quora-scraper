            "answer_text": "This question is more subtle than may appear at first glance, and it has to do with what you mean by \"measuring a speed.\" You might say that you pick a unit, say meters per second, and then you measure how many times bigger the speed of light is than a meter per second. Seems simple enough. Except... What is a meter? And what is a second? Well, you might pull out your meterstick and tell me that there, that's a meter. As for a second, that's easy: Everyone knows what a day is, so just split that up into 24 hours, split each of those up into 60 minutes, then split each of those into 60 pieces, and that's what a second is. And, frankly, that's what people did for a while. Here is the official meterstick of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, which defined the meter up until 1960.   But what happened in 1960? Was there a distortion in the space-time continuum that changed the length of a meter? Sadly, no. All that happened was that a lot of folks started wanting to measure distances precisely, and sometimes they didn't happen to have their copy of the International Prototype Metre with them, or maybe it got bent. Also, by that time folks had invented Interferometry which let them measure very precise distances with a lot less squinting at tiny lines on a meterstick. In fact, all this had happened many decades before 1960. 1960 was just the year when the International Bureau of Weights and Measures finally got fed up with all the complaints and decided to replace the international prototype metre with... The Krypton Standard. Rather than being a code of behavior followed by Superman, the krypton standard redefined a meter in terms of a property of the element krypton. Sometimes krypton gets excited, and when it settles back down it releases orange-ish red light. The meter was then defined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of this light. Great, now that you've settled on what a meter is, you can do science. Oh, but the wavelength of light is different between air and vacuum, so you have to make sure to measure the krypton wavelengths in a vacuum. Oh, and also there are five different stable isotopes of krypton, and each of them releases light at slightly different wavelengths. You sigh, get out your centrifuge, spin up some krypton gas to separate out the isotopes of krypton, take the heaviest one, krypton-86, and measure the wavelength of that. OK, now that you know what a meter is, you can measure the speed of light. But wait! What about the second? But didn't we already settle that with defining it as a certain fraction of a day? Unfortunately, it turns out that the rate of the Earth's rotation changes, so using it to define a second is no good. The rate of rotation gradually slows due to the tidal forces from the Moon, and it also changes sporadically due to the rearrangement of the mass of the Earth, sort of like a figure skater moving their arms in to spin faster except with earthquakes and volcanic explosions. Well, crap. So you think bigger and decide to use the revolution of the Earth around the sun to define a second. But, alas, it turns out that, like a day, a year isn't as constant as you'd think. The tug of Jupiter and the other planets on the Sun is enough to move it off course a little bit, which can change the length of a year slightly in a way that's hard to predict. Alas, the time intervals that you thought were constant have all betrayed you. But all hope is not lost! The Atomic clock comes to the rescue. Just like your friend krypton-86, the atom cesium-133 atom also releases light in particular frequencies when it settles down after getting excited. An atomic clock can measure this frequency very precisely, which lets you define the second as the time it takes for there to be 9,192,631,770 oscillations of the emitted light. After all your hard work in nailing down a meter and a second, you can finally measure the speed of light like you wanted all along. But what's this? The International Bureau of Weights and Measures redefined the meter in 1983 to be the length that light travels in 1/(299,792,458) seconds. The speed of light is thus exactly 299,792,458 meters per second, to arbitrary accuracy, by definition. But that's cheating! On the other hand, from a physics perspective, using one unit to measure length and another unit to measure time makes about as much sense as using miles to measure horizontal distances and feet to measure vertical distances. Yes, going 100 miles north is very different from going 100 miles up, but if you insist on using different units for horizontal and vertical lengths, boy are you going to have a fun time setting up ladders. Or playing with lasers, if you break out of the metaphor. In fact, if, instead of using the wavelength of light from krypton-86 to define a meter and the frequency of light from cesium-133 to define a second, you had picked the same atom for both, then you'd wind up with the same sort of cheating for speed of light. The wavelength of that light times its frequency is the speed of light, so if you fix the wavelength by definition and you fix the frequency by definition, then you end up fixing the speed of light by definition. It's a very unsatisfying answer. However, the case isn't closed, and there's still a very reasonable question to ask: How accurately can you measure speeds, at least theoretically? If you see a thing that's moving, how accurately can you measure its speed in terms of the speed of light? Or, if you like, how accurately can you measure the speed of light in terms of the thing's speed? Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle doesn't actually pose a problem for you. The principle says that you can't know both a particle's position and momentum: If you want more accuracy in measuring one quantity, you have to give up accuracy in the other quantity. However, if you know the particle's rest mass, then you can compute the particle's velocity knowing only its momentum, and you can know the momentum as accurately as you like, provided you give up all hope of ever finding where the particle is. There is also something to be said about the Planck length. However, it's not currently clear what, if any, physical significance the Planck length has. If you believe that the Planck length is the smallest measurable length, then the smallest theoretically measurable velocity is the Planck length divided by the lifetime of the universe. So, if you want to measure the velocity of a moving particle, you won't be able to compute it to greater accuracy than the Planck length divided by the lifetime of the universe. Tough luck, I know. Of course, if the universe will go on for ever, as is currently believed, then there is no limit to your accuracy. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there is a fundamental limit to the accuracy of any physical measurement, for two reasons. Firstly, you have Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle), which basically states that the accuracy with which you can simultaneously measure certain pairs of physical observables, such as energy and time, or position and momentum, is constrained by the fact that the product of the uncertainties in both measurements must always be approximately equal to  Planck's constant (omitting a small numerical factor). Secondly, the assumption of infinite precision in measuring the speed of light - or any other speed - requires that we are able to measure both spatial distances and periods of time with infinite accuracy - i.e. that both space and time are continuous entities and infinitely divisible. According to quantum theory, however, this is not the case. The smallest distance we can theoretically measure is the Planch length (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length), and the shortest interval of time we can measure is the corresponding Planck time (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time). Both these units are staggeringly small, of course, and the energy we would have to attain in order to probe these distances and time scales, called the Planck energy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_energy),  is also staggeringly high. So, for all practical purposes, it is inaccuracies of the Heisenberg type, rather than the Planck type, that  would dominate in any physical measurement. ",
