            "answer_text": "This is applicable only for a system where force(gravitational, electrostatic, etc) is proportional to the inverse of the square of distance (i.e. second power of the distance separating them) separating any two bodies, And where the potential energy is proportional to the first power of the distance between the bodies.. If these conditions are true, then :Total Energy = Potential Energy /2 = - Kinetic Energy And the above statement makes sense, since Total Energy is the sum of potential energy of Kinetic EnergyT.E = P.e +K.E = 2xT.E. + (-T.E.) =T.E. (verified) ______________________________________________________________________________________ However, if you are given a hypothetical situation where The above mentioned Conditions are not applicable, then You must use the basic formula of potential Energy, which is :Force F = d(U)/dr where U is the potential energy, and r is the variable related to distance/height etc. of which U will be a function. (The above formula is a very basic formula. On cross multiplying , you get F.dr =dU which makes sense. Whatever Work you do on a body gets stored as its Potential Energy , provided there are no losses to the surrounding) And Kinetic Energy will be found by Newtons laws of motion:1. F=ma and using the basic definition of accelaration2. a = dv/dtwhere v is the velocity. Obtain v by solving the above two equations simultaneouslyKinetic energy is K.E = 1/2mv^2 Total Energy =Potential energy +Kinetic eergy ",

            "answer_text": "When an object is moving under the influence of some conservative force field (like gravity) and there is no loss due to friction or air drag/ fluid viscosity, the relationship between total energy (TE) , potential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE) is PE +KE = TE Otherwise this is not valid. Friction/air drag/viscosity causes loss of energy. So, the equation should be modified TE = PE + KE + Losses Hope this helps. ",

It is not a thing, it is a theoretical notion There several different types of change modelled by different energy changes. So the total energy change is the sum of all of the energy changes relevant to the situation you are modelling. ",
