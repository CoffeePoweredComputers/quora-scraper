            "answer_text": "Before going in to Ozone layer and its importance, lets discuss about molecular absorption process. Every object has color because it absorbs all the color except that specific color. Plant leaves appears green because chlorophyll absorbs all colors except green.Oxygen appears to be pale blue color because oxygen molecule absorbs all colors except blue.Basically specific atoms/molecules strongly absorbs a set of wavelengths and it purely depends on properties of atom / molecule. Intro to Ultra violet radiation Light is electromagnetic radiation - or radiant energy traveling in the form of waves. Ultraviolet (UV) energy is found in the electromagnetic spectrum between visible light and x-rays and can be described as invisible radiation UV Light wavelength  Affects of UV Radiation The UV light penetrates the outer cell wall of the microorganism, passes through the cell body, reaches the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and alters the genetic material. The 185 nm UV light, used in TOC reduction applications, decomposes the organic molecules.The 185 nm light carries more energy than the 254 nm light. The 185 nm light generates hydroxyl (OH\u00b7) free radicals from water molecules.Ozone Introduction Ozone is mainly found in two regions of the Earth's atmosphere. Most ozone (about 90%) resides in a layer that begins between 6 and 10 miles (10 and 17 kilometers) above the Earth's surface and extends up to about 30 miles (50 kilometers). This region of the atmosphere is called the stratosphere. The ozone in this region is commonly known as the ozone layer.The remaining ozone is in the lower region of the atmosphere, which is commonly called the troposphere. Formation of Ozone Ozone in the stratosphere is mostly produced from short-wave ultraviolet rays between 240 and 160 nm.   where \"M\" denotes the third body that carries off the excess energy of the reaction. The ozone molecule can then absorb a ultra violet photon and dissociate in to,  Importance of Ozone Ozone in the ozone layer filters out sunlight wavelengths from about 200 nm UV rays to 315 nm, with ozone peak absorption at about 250 nm. This ozone UV absorption is important to life, since it extends the absorption of UV by ordinary oxygen and nitrogen in air (which absorb all wavelengths < 200 nm) .The lower UV-C (200\u2013280 nm)Entire UV-B band (280\u2013315 nm).The small unabsorbed part that remains of UV-B after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans, and direct DNA damage in living tissues in both plants and animals. Low level of Ozone Ozone directly reacts with some of hydrocarbons and forms the products readily. The ozone-depleting compounds contain various combinations of the chemical elements chlorine, fluorine, bromine, carbon, and hydrogen and are often described by the general term halocarbons. The compounds that contain only chlorine, fluorine, and carbon are called chlorofluorocarbons, usually abbreviated as CFCs.  Hence its our responsibility to reduce the emission of halocarbons and protect the Ozone layer. Hope it helps !! ",

            "answer_text": "The stratospheric ozone layer absorbs ultraviolet light (UV) emitted by the sun. If the solar UV light were able to penetrate the stratosphere and troposphere and reach the earth\u2019s surface, it would seriously damage our ecosystem. For example, ultraviolet light kills microbes, bacteria, and fungi. These microscopic forms of life play a key role in plants being able to process and absorb nutrients in the soil. It is also estimated that half of our atmospheric oxygen has resulted from past microbial and bacterial activity of phytoplankton in our oceans. An increase in the flux of ultraviolet light would also dramatically increase the incidence of sunburn, causing stress and potentially death of many types of plants and animals. Exposure to UV light also causes cataracts, currently the leading source of blindness in people over 40. Therefore, increases in ultraviolet light would induce blindness in people at a much younger age. It could even cause blindness in animals. Thus, the ozone layer plays an important role in making the Earth habitable. PS Don\u2019t be afraid to upvote this answer. ",
