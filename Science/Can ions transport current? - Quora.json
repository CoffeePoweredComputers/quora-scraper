            "answer_text": "They sure can! Sodium, potassium and calcium ions are responsible for the generation and transportation of electrical current (so-called signals) in our bodies. Also neurons \u201ctalk\u201d to each other via ionic electrical current. Ions are also the reason why most of the people believe \u201cwater\u201d is electrically conductive. Without the foreign ions in \u201ccommon water\u201d that would not be the case. (And no, the ions provided by autoprotolysis would not be enough). \u201cPure\u201d water has an electrical conductivity that is 15000\u2013200000 times lower than tap water and is equally conductive as sand stone or ceramics. In other words, pure water is an electrical isolator according to our definitions of conductivity. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. A current is a bunch of charged particles moving in roughly the same direction. If a field (like an E or a dB/dt) is present and ions can move, a ionic current results. In a plasma both electrons and ions are free to move. There are huge currents in the plasma in Tokamaks. A large portion is ion movement. Ion gun intensity and Proton Therapy does (and here) is measured in nano-, micro-, or milli-amps \u2014 which is a measure of the number of ions passing through a plane. The MeV specifies how fast the ions are traveling. ",

A killer variac (YouTube project to control an universal motor, allso nicknamed scaryac) And an MHD drive, which uses salt water and magnetic fields to produce movement. ",
