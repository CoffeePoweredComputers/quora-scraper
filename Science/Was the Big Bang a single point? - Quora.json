            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a big fan of the Big Bang either. But assuming arguendo, at first, that it happened, I think the answer to \u201cWas the Big Bang a single point?\u201d is still \u201cNo\u201d. There are several reasons for this. One presumes a singularity with infinite density as one might find in a black hole. Mathematics do not support this. Also, expansion from a single point would leave us with a universal center which does not exist now and as far as we know never existed. Moreover, space isn\u2019t just 3 spatial dimensions; it isn\u2019t just space at all; it\u2019s \u201cspace-time\u201d. Time originated with space in what might best be thought of as an extant and emerging phenomenon very unlike a bang . The phenomenon precipitated time and the various spatial dimensions; in turn, they precipitated energy which precipitated subatomic bosons and leptons. Accordingly, the origin of our universe is one of emergence not of explosion notwithstanding the era of inflation occurring in the earliest period of our universe\u2019s history. As such, it\u2019s \u201cpoint of origin\u201d, what you have been told you would find by reversing the outward expansion of the universe. is unreachable. This is true even if one could reverse time. This is because the universe emerged more fully formed than a locatable space-time-energy kernel. It really must have emerged as an unbounded region consistent with our findings today that the universe is unbounded. As such, it had some initial spatial dimensionality. For it to expand, the phenomenon of time must have already existed. If the initial conditions of the universe were something more than a singularity, the theory of the Big Bang is undermined. One popular alternative consistent with the foregoing analysis and speculation is the inflationary origin of the universe. It is the theory that universes undergo random inflation in random regions that eventually (or quickly) hive off into new universes. The fact that our own universe started with inflation supports this. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea of a singularity (That was a point in space) was actually dropped by physics about 40 years ago. Basically, we observed that the observable universe was getting larger and cooler\u2026 and THEORIZED that this meant that it used to be smaller and hotter. That is the big bang theory in a nutshell. The rest is working out details, such as HOW small and HOW hot, HOW fast is it expanding, etc. To clarify, as we are talking about the expansion of SPACETIME, not stuff, there was no \u201cexplosion of matter flying out in all directions\u201d, etc. As we are talking about space-time, it is useful to remember that the big bang did not take place at a place, but at a time. So, when we say \u201csmall\u201d, we are talking about the space between things\u2026 and, when we are talking about spacetime, we mean its density. So, there was a hot dense state, before the inflation\u2026 basically, what you\u2019d have if the higgs field collapsed. As spacetime inflated, it was becoming LESS DENSE. As it became less dense, the plasma, etc, cooled enough to allow sub-atomic, and, then atomic structures to form. Eventually, the simplest element, hydrogen, could form, and clouds of hydrogen are seen whenever we find things that are approaching 13.8 or so billion years old. (We know we are looking at the way things looked 13 billion years ago, because if the light takes 13 billion years to reach us, at the speed of light, we are seeing what was there 13 billion years ago) So, as spacetime continued to expand, and the temperatures continued to cool, stars formed, due to gravity, and, that also started fusing that hydrogen into helium\u2026 \u2026and then those early stars exploded, and, that fused even more elements, so some more heavier elements were released by the exploding stars. Those elements were then found in the next generations of stars, that burned longer and cooler, and then exploded, and released even MORE of the periodic table and so forth. So, anyway, that\u2019s the big bang theory. :D ",
