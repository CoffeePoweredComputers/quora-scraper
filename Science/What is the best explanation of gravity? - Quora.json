            "answer_text": "I see you\u2019ve gotten some pretty good descriptions of general relativity, which is our best theory of gravity. But you didn\u2019t get any sensible explanations of why there is gravity (hot electrons isn\u2019t a sensible theory). That\u2019s mostly because we don\u2019t have a good theory which explains gravity in terms of something else. There are some theories on offer, but they are not sufficiently worked out to even be testable. There are several variants of a theory in which gravity is a kind of statistical effect of the virtual interactions of particle fields. Eric Verlinde has written a paper about this theory he calls entropic gravity. Padmanabhan has written a book on gravitation discussing these theories. They all try to explain general relativity. General relativity is a geometric theory, it\u2019s based on the idea that spacetime can be curved and is curved more in the presence of matter. So these theories try to describe how distances along different paths in spacetime can vary depending on matter. There\u2019s a good youtube video of Leonard Susskind explaining this in terms of entanglement between vacuum oscillations in particle fields. But as I say none of these are worked out to the point of making testable predictions. You shouldn\u2019t find this surprising though. We\u2019ve used Newtonian gravity for over 300yrs and we never had any explanation for it. When Newton was asked how the force of gravity reached the planets he said, \u201cHypothesi non fingo\u201d (I make no hypothesis). I think it is insufficiently appreciated that science doesn\u2019t aim at explanations, it aims at descriptive models that can be used to make predictions. \u201cExplanation\u201d is a more psychological concept, i.e. what gives one a comforting feeling of understanding.

            "answer_text": "The subject of this question may be science, but this is a philosophy question. Science is not in the business of explaining things. Mine. My Explanation is the best one because it is consistent with everything we know. I actually explain the nuts and bolts of what gravity does and how it does it. I do not offer you any new formulas or equations. Einstein\u2019s and Newton\u2019s maths are quite sufficient. Here is my basic explanation: Gravity is actually quite simple, but we will not understand it until we get ourselves off the shoulders of the giants who came before us, who attempted to understand it. They did great work, but left us with a few misconceptions. Newton convinced us that the Sun and Earth are pulling on each other. I attest that the Sun and the Earth are too far apart to be having a chemical reaction with each other. Add to it, the LIGO scientists told us that gravity moves at the speed of light. Here is why this is off track: It takes light eight minutes to travel from the Sun to the Earth. If gravity did this, it would have the wrong vector for stable orbits. It would be chasing the orbiting mass and slowing it down substantially. Why does gravity perform like it is instantaneous? Because it is instantaneous. Thus \u201cgravity\u201d waves are not gravity, they are either time dilation waves or they are waves in the Galactic Plasma. If gravity is just bent spacetime, then we should be able to put a beam of light in the same orbit as the Moon. That is not happening. General Relativity, as good as it is, also does not explain why a mass accelerates as it falls to Earth. To have gravity, three things are necessary: There must be at least one mass, There must be some time dilation, The mass must be in the gradient of the time dilation. Then, the mass can push itself toward the local center of time dilation. Time dilation has no force. Gravity is universal? No, mass and time dilation are products of your galaxy, not the universe. You and I live in a galaxy, not in the universe. Each galaxy defines itself by the plasma it creates, its density and its vectors. The universe has a much older version of the same properties, too weak and transient to establish a universal frame of reference. Edwin Hubble saw galaxies in his telescope that were moving away from us at more than the speed of light. Their redshift was more than z=1.4. Those distant galaxies can not possibly have a frame of reference in common with the Milky Way. Therefore, there is no universal inertial frame of reference. There is also no universal rotational frame of reference. All galaxies are stationary, just not from our perspective. Their rotation is conserved from their parent entity. Yes, gravity and inertia and the speed of light are galactically defined. All matter has mass? Hardly. Ninety five percent of the matter in our galaxy is plasma, massless quarks and gluons moving at the speed of light. The other roughly five percent is made of the same kind of quarks and gluons, but has a peculiar construct that prevents the construct we call normal matter from moving at the speed of light and renders a gamma response to any attempt to accelerate it in any manner. This gamma response is the interaction of the galactic plasma with the normal matter on a quantum level. We call it mass, or inertia, or momentum. It is a common, ordinary, reliable quantum effect. The normal matter is pushing itself against the acceleration, because the acceleration is attempting to push the quarks closer to the speed limit of light, and that causes the gamma response. Now, lets set up a thought experiment with a mass in the middle of a gradient of time dilation. A good example would be a mass just above the surface of the Earth, the collection of mass ( The Earth ) causes time itself to be slower, locally. This means time itself, and the speed of light, is slower near the center of time dilation, deep in the Earth. In this environment ( a gradient of time dilation ), we get a permanent, steady gamma response from every bit of normal matter because it is closer to the speed of light below it than the speed of light above it. No kinetic acceleration needed, normal matter, as it interacts with the galactic plasma, renders a gamma response that pushes itself toward the center of time dilation. That is gravity.
