            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give a short answer: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is a spectroscopic technique that is based in two or more nucleus energetic levels which are, in turn, the result of an application of an extremely homogeneus constant magnetic field over the sample being analyzed. The transition is detected by the absorbed radiant energy applied to the sample tranversely to the static magnetic field. The radiation is applied in form of radio frequency. In the today\u2019s way of use of NMR, all frequencies are apllied over the sample at same time and the response will show what is called Free Induction Decay (FID) which is the information in timelike format. To see it as a spectrum, one should mathematically transfom it by use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Formely the spectrum was acquired directly by scanning the sample continuously over the frequencies and being electronic handled in analogic way (today is digital and computer controled), but the today\u2019s technique has several advantages NMR FID FFT Spectrum ",

            "answer_text": "Nuclei with nonzero nuclear spin are tiny magnets. When placed in a strong magnetic field they will align with the field and split into 2 energy levels. The difference in the energy levels is in the radio frequency range and depends on field strengths modified by the exact chemical environment of the nuclei. The typical instrument works at constant frequency and sweeps the magnetic field and each nucleus responds according to it's environment. The nuclei also interact with nearby magnetic nuclei so information is given about the chemical environment and about nearby nuclei; consult literature for in depth discussions. Nuclei commonly used are: 1H, 13C, 19F, 31P. There is also a variation, electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR, that measures unpaired electrons, free radicals. ",
