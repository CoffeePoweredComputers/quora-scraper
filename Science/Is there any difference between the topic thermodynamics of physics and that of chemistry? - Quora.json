            "answer_text": "Yes there is some differences between the thermodynamic study in physics and chemistry. In physics we studies the laws of thermodynamics and used to study the anthropic of Universe and objects. The study of planets, stars, energy in space, cosmology, astronomy, variations in phases etc are explore or understand by using the concepts of thermodynamics. Here we study how the thermal energy is converted into other energy and make affects on matter. Equilibrium of the many reaction and process understand by thermodynamics. Topics like heat, temperature, specific heat, thermal conductivity, Energy transfer, laws, Entropy etc are involve in the thermodynamics.(Physics). This are the four laws of thermodynamics. The Zeroth Law states that if two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with some third body, then they are also in equilibrium with each other. This establishes temperature as a fundamental and measurable property of matter. The First Law states that the total increase in the energy of a system is equal to the increase in thermal energy plus the work done on the system. This states that heat is a form of energy and is therefore subject to the principle of conservation. The Second Law states that heat energy cannot be transferred from a body at a lower temperature to a body at a higher temperature without the addition of energy. This is why it costs money to run an air conditioner. The Third Law states that the entropy of a pure crystal at absolute zero is zero. As explained above, entropy is sometimes called \"waste energy,\" i.e., energy that is unable to do work, and since there is no heat energy whatsoever at absolute zero, there can be no waste energy. Entropy is also a measure of the disorder in a system, and while a perfect crystal is by definition perfectly ordered, any positive value of temperature means there is motion within the crystal, which causes disorder. For these reasons, there can be no physical system with lower entropy, so entropy always has a positive value. In the chemistry thermodynamics is used to study the chemical reaction and there equilibrium. Thermodynamic principles of metallurgy is used to decide whether the reaction is spontaneous, non spontaneous or equilibrium. Topics like Gibbs free energy, Entropy, enthalpy, endothermic and exothermic reaction, heat and work, phase change etc are studied under chemistry thermodynamics. ",

            "answer_text": "Thermodynamics means the interconversion of energies from one form to another form. Chemistry is the subject deals with chemicals; ions; salts etc while physics deals with nature ; physical properties like lightning ; earthing . Therefore the physics thermodynamics is the another branch and chemistry thermodynamics is another . So thermodynamics of chemistry deals with typical chemicals reactions which involves dissociation of ions; formation of ions while physics with natural processes of their interconversion of energy or the main form of energy. that is heat.
