            "answer_text": "This is a little hard to answer.   Are you asking about the origin of the photon and the Electromagnetic spectrum ?   If so, the answer is the widely accepted theory of the Big Bang .   Are you asking about the discovery of electromagnetic waves? That profound eureka moment is commonly attributed to Michael Faraday and refined by James Clerk Maxwell  (History of electromagnetic theory ).   Or are you asking about the partitioning of the EM spectrum into regulated bands for use by the public?   If that is the question then Frequency allocation really got its start back in 1927 with the Federal Radio Commission and the Radio Act of 1927.   ",
