            "answer_text": "The prefix \u2018hetero\u2019 literally means \u2018different\u2019. This is a mix of different things that remain distinct from one another. Think of a salad. A salad may have lettuce, onions, tomatoes, croutons\u2026 but the salad is a heterogeneous mixture. The individual items remain distinct from each other. You can separate them without much effort. The lettuce and croutons don\u2019t begin to morph together. The tomato and onion don\u2019t start to become indistinguishable. The other side of this is a homogeneous mixture. This is not a pure substance because it is still a mix of things, but the ingredients do not remain separate items. Koolaid would be like a homogeneous mixture. The original ingredients - dye, citric acid, and sugar, are no longer individually distinct. They have dissolved fully in the water. There are ways you can go about trying to extract or separate the substances but it\u2019s more work. ",
