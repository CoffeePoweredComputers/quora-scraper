            "answer_text": "Quick thought: How do you know what a person is like?  By observing the effect they have on others.   At the other end of the scale from atoms, we discovered the planets.  Let's pick everybody's favourite, Uranus (snigger).  So, William Herschel comes along and thus far we're up to Saturn.  He doesn't even know how many planets they are supposed to be, or that there are any more in the Solar System to be found.  However, the clues are there: tiny, unexpected deviations in known behaviours caused by a planet that nobody knows exists. The universe is not a jigsaw with convenient discovery shaped pieces waiting to be found.  Some of the bits filled in could well be wrong or need altering a bit.  However, stuff that we don't even know to look for, has a way of implying its presence.  Even if we are not aware of the gap it will fit in to. The possibility of the unknown becomes apparent when we observe something we don't expect within a system that we think we know.  As Dennis says, it's a constant re-evaluation and refinement. Science discovers X-rays.  How cool is that?  The next stage is then: what can we do with this?  Let's fire it at stuff and see what happens! Why not direct a beam at a thin sheet of gold and look what happens to the X-ray beam.  Not that we can see the X-rays, but we can see the effect on a development plate.  From that pattern, we hypothesise.  Then we test, and as we learn more in other areas - electron beam scanning, developments in computer processing - we can observe phenomena in ever more detail. As for everything being made of atoms, that's also a decision on where you draw the line as to your basic unit of matter.  As you know, we can go smaller still.  We don't even know what the final picture on the jigsaw box looks like.  Even worse, it will change over time so will only be true for smallest amount of time it is possible to imagine. The Higgs Boson was theorised by an almost unmeasureable mass in subatomic particles where no mass would be expected.  That theory had to sit and wait until we had the technological capability to put it to the test. There will be theories right now that are sitting and waiting...... ......and there are those that we haven't even thought of yet! ",

            "answer_text": "I present: A Boy and His Atom   More Seriously... by thinking about heat. It all started in 1738 with the work of Daniel Bernoulli, who postulated that we could derive the behavior of gases and fluids from imagining many small particles interacting.  This gave us the idea that maybe gas was made of little things we now call molecules. The predictions were remarkable and people built on it. Physics greats James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann took Bernoulli's ideas and showed that we could describe temperature as a change in how the ordering (in the sense of entropy) of a collection of atoms or molecules changes with their average energy. And of course, the periodic table All the stuff I've described indicated that things we thought of as solid fluids were made up of little molecules. But at the same time, chemistry gave us more hints. In 1800, chemist John Dalton observed that elements always react in ratios of whole numbers. And he proposed that the reason for this was that elements (which we knew made up more complex materials) came in packets of stuff, i.e., atoms. ",
