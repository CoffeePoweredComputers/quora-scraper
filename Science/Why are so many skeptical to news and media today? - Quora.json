            "answer_text": "Most people have never studied \u201cthe media\u201d and have little idea of its history, its diversity, its profit motive, and its role in our society. If I had my way, Media Studies would be a manadatory class in all American high schools. The Media is our prime story-teller yet most know next to nothing about it. This leaves them wide open for\u2026A president whose criticism of the media has reached historic levels. Building his own cult of personality, the president has taken the idea of Nixon\u2019s private Enemies List public, urging his supporters to rant against anyone who opposes him, labeling them \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d But. . .The media is scarcely an innocent victim. TV in particular, driven by ratings and the money made from selling outrage, dropped the ball during the last campaign, circulating far too many fake stories without doing sufficient fact-checking. Our unscrupulous president has taken advantage of this by calling all news he doesn\u2019t like \u201cfake.\u201d His supporters refuse to do the diligent work of checking him on this, preferring instead to cling to an \u201cUs vs. Them\u201d attitude about all of the presidents \u201cenemies,\u201d including the media, the FBI, the intelligence community, NFL players, LeBron James, the Justice Department, our NATO allies, etc. Etc.So if the media keeps watch on the government, who keeps watch on the media? We do. We call out errors. We reject stations, newspapers, and Websites whose accuracy is suspect (not because we disagree with their opinons but because their facts are wrong.). Shoddy, irresponsible media is shown to be worthless, and it fails and disappears. Responsible media is supported and continues. Or so it used to be, but anyone who believes anything said about the media, without checking, without studying the media and how it works, gets the government \u2014 and the media \u2014 they deserve.",

            "answer_text": "It is probably a good thing to be somewhat skeptical of what we hear and read in our cyber age. Anyone can post anything whether or not it makes any sense. I rather like the warning, \u201cIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\u201d In other words, the first test should be to ask oneself whether it is logical and from whom does it come. For example, the conspiracy theories of Alex Jones are so ridiculous that they should be dismissed out of hand. Other \u201cnews\u201d articles are harder to vet. Personally, I like the news outlets that have a long history of good and truthful reporting, and who have the reputation of fact checking their own work. When they do make mistakes, they promptly issue corrections. Our current President has the unfortunate habit of labeling anything he doesn\u2019t like as \u201cfake news.\u201d Usually, it takes only a few key strokes to find the truth. Fact checking sites are also valuable. Anyone who writes argument should always included sources and support. If none is there, it\u2019s probably nothing more than opinion. Even columnists and editorialists, however, include checkable facts and support, if they are reputable. Reputations are easy to lose but very hard to regain. ",
