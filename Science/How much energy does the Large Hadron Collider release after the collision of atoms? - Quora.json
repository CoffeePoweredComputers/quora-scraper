            "answer_text": "One of the important parameters controlling particle collisions (protons or lead ions in case of the LHC) is the so called inelasticity. This characterizes amount of the initial kinetic energy converted into the newly created particles. The extreme cases are elastic scattering (no energy loss) and full energy loss, which is only a theoretical limit as it practically never happens. This collision inelasticity is related to the number of interacting quarks and hardeness of their collisions. In case of heavy ion collisions it can be related to the geometrical distance of the lines of flights and can be estimated by measuring number of nucleons which have particpated in a collision.http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/53089 ",
