            "answer_text": "Your question is absolutely legitimate considering the advancements that we have made in the fields of medicine and healthcare technology. Why was such a potential salivary gland not discovered before ? Well there's no outright correct answer. One reason is that conventional scanning techniques such as ultrasound, CT (Computerised Topography), and MRI(Magnetic Resonance Imaging) don't reveal these glands. They were an incidental finding in a research on tumourous growths in relation to prostate cancer by a group of Dutch scientists. The researchers were using a new imaging system, the PSMA PET(Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen imaging using Positron Emission Tomography) which clearly shows salivary gland aggregations. Another reason may be the lack of initiative to look for another set of salivary glands in the body. It was believed that the nasopharyngeal region( location of these newly found \u201corgans\u201d) had evenly spread microscopic salivary glands. But there's no solid explanation behind the fact that anatomists and researchers missed a set of salivary glands even after centuries of medical research. ",
