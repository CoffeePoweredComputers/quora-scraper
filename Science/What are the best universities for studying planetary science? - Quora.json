            "answer_text": "The following stand out in the United States and Canada (as of 2015): - Arizona State- Caltech- Washington University at St. Louis- Brown- Stony Brook- Purdue- Western Ontario- University of Arizona This is based on having multiple full-time faculty dedicated to planetary science, mission involvement, and whether the school has a specific planetary \"program\" where you could get a complete course load as a graduate student, rather than one or two faculty in a geology department who dabble in planetary.  I imagine that as at Brown, the planetary activities at these other schools trickle down to the undergraduate level in terms of courses available and summer research opportunities. ",
