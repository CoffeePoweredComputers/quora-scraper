            "answer_text": "More than 4,000 years ago, people in Egypt and Mesopotamia discovered meteoric iron and used this \u2018gift of the gods\u2019 as decoration. But it was another 2,000 years before people began producing iron from mined iron ore. The earliest finds of smelted iron in India date back to 1800 Before Common Era (BCE). The Hittites of Anatolia began smelting iron around 1500 BCE. When their empire collapsed around 1200 BCE, the various tribes took the knowledge of ironmaking with them, spreading it across Europe and Asia. The Iron Age had begun. However, iron is not steel. Iron Age metal workers almost certainly discovered steel as an accidental by-product of their ironworking activities. These early smiths heated iron ore in charcoal fires, which produced a relatively pure spongy mass of iron called a \u2018bloom\u2019 that could then be hammered (wrought) into shape. These early smiths would have noticed that when iron was left in the charcoal furnaces for a longer period, it changed. It became harder and stronger: qualities they undoubtedly recognized as valuable. They would also have noticed that these qualities improved with repeated heating, folding and beating of the material as they forged the metal. Having discovered steel and its superior qualities, Iron Age craftsmen transformed it into tools and weapons such as knives. Soon, new techniques were developed, such as quench hardening \u2013 the rapid cooling of the worked steel in water or oil to increase its hardness. An archaeological find in Cyprus indicates that craftsmen were producing quench hardened steel knives as early as 1100 BCE. Nonetheless, in the ancient world, steel making remained a lengthy and difficult process, and the rare steel items produced would have been highly prized. ",

They used iron to replace bronze in implements and weapons. \"This shift occurred because iron, when alloyed with a bit of carbon, is harder, more durable, and holds a sharper edge than bronze.  For over three thousand years, until replaced by steel after CE 1870, iron formed the material basis of human civilization in Europe, Asia, and Africa.\" SourceA Brief History of Iron and Steel Manufacture ",
