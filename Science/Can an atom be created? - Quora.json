            "answer_text": "You may have heard of the equation E=mc^2? It describes the mass-energy equivalence. What it basically says is that a certain amount of matter and annihilate it, you will get a certain amount of energy. Conversely, if you take a certain amount of energy, you can convert it into a certain amount of matter (slightly more complicated). This matter could potentially be programed to form as an assortment of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Thus, you have created an atom. If you meant \u201ccan you create an atom out of other atoms,\u201d than again, yes. It\u2019s called nuclear fusion. ",

            "answer_text": "A neutron apparently can convert into an H-atom. Also atoms decay into other atoms. And perhaps at the center of the galaxy we have creation of new elements via fusion and spallation. The total quantity of material appears fixed. The fact that the total amount of material is fixed is the reason why big G is a constant in newton\u2019s gravitational equivalent for two masses. If the total quantity of matter were changing all the time this would not be a constant since it results from the aggregate gravity tug of all atoms together.
