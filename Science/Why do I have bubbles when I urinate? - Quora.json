            "answer_text": "Normal causes of bubbles in the urine Rapid urination: Urinating too quickly or forcing urine to come out can be responsible for its bubbly appearance. This is because air is introduced into the urine stream, causing the bubbles. In this case, the bubbles typically disappear within a few minutes. Concentrated urine: If you\u2019re mildly dehydrated, the urine may become more concentrated, so it appears bubbly. This can be easily resolved by drinking more fluids. Toilet cleaner: Sometimes, urine reacts with toilet cleaner, resulting in bubbles. If you\u2019re unsure if your urine is bubbly or whether it\u2019s the toilet cleaner causing it to bubble, you can urinate in a separate container that has not been treated with the cleaner and watch for bubbles. Semen in urine: After sex, small amounts of semen are left in the male urethra. This small amount won\u2019t cause bubbly urine unless the bladder sphincter malfunctions, causing the semen to go back into the bladder. In this case, urine will appear bubbly. Abnormal causes of bubbles in urine Proteinuria: This is a condition in which protein is released in the urine in high amounts. Protein is normally released in the urine but in small amounts. When these levels become high, the urine can appear bubbly. This can be a sign of an impending kidney problem as the kidneys are not filtering urine properly and as a result release too much protein. Untreated high blood pressure and diabetes may contribute to kidney filtration problems, along with other factors like toxins, infections, or trauma to the kidneys. Urinary tract infection: When bacteria enter any part of the urinary tract system you may develop an infection. Along with pain, higher urinary frequency and urgency, and burning while urinating, your urine may appear bubbly as well. You should see a doctor if you begin to experience UTI symptoms because the earlier the treatment begins the less of a risk of complications you will have. Kidney disease: Bubbly urine can be a sign of kidney disease resulting from kidney stones or diabetes. A simple urine test will determine whether you have kidney disease. Preeclampsia: Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication that results in swollen legs, proteinuria, high blood pressure, and headaches. It can be a fatal condition to both mother and fetus, and all symptoms can worsen with its progression. Vesicocolic fistula: A fistula is an abnormal connection which, in this case, develops between the bladder and the colon. This allows air, gas, and bacteria to travel into the bladder. Along with bubbly urine, a person with vesicocolic fistula will have frequent infections. Symptoms may be similar to those of a UTI. Other causes: Other causes of bubbly urine include amyloidosis, cancer, chemical poisoning, diabetes, heart conditions like an enlarged heart, high blood pressure, infections, kidney failure, liver disease, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and sickle cell anemia.

            "answer_text": "You have bubbles when you urinate in what way? There has been quite a lot of discussion about this recently here and there. Ultimately, male or female, you have liquid which is being pressed out of your contracting bladder, I assume down into the toilet bowl, or onto the ground. Take the toilet bowl first, there could be some cleaning fluid residue in the water, remember what water from a tap would do to this, so would urine. Hit the ground with force, and especially if it is dry ground, you will get bubbles. I pee outside a good deal and I often get bubbles where I have peed. Now, you need to take a control somewhere here to see if you have a real issue. Relax and as gently as possible, pee in to a clear container pressed up against your body or very close to the end of your penis to counter for the problem mentioned above. Still bubbles the urine then sure, there are some medical conditions that cause this, so a trip to a doc might be advised. Good luck with your diagnosis. ",
