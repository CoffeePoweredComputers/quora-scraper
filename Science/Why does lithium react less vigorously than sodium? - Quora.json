            "answer_text": "Atomic number of lithium is 3 and the electronic configuration is 2,1. It's valence shell is close to the nucleus. Hence the valence shell electron is strongly attracted by the positively charged nucleus. Hence a lot of energy is needed to ionize lithium and the reaction is less vigorous. In the case of sodium with atomic number 11, the configuration is 2,8,1. The valence electron being farther away from the nucleus, experiences less attraction force from the nucleus making it easier to ionize it. Thus it reacts vigorously. ",

            "answer_text": "The reactivity increases down the group. It is because the number of shells increase and so, the distance between the outermost (valence) electron and the nucleaus increases as well, as a result of which, the internuclear force of attraction decreases, letting go the valence electron easily to be donated, making the reaction vigorous. Lithium is above Sodium and hence it reacts less vigorously. Hope it helps you! :) ",
