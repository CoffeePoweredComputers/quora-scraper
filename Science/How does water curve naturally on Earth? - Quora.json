            "answer_text": "How does water curve naturally on earth? Gravity. There is no universal down: instead, everything is attracted to the local center of gravity. In the case of the Earth, the center of gravity is roughly in the middle. Everything is attracted to that point, including all of the Earth and everything on it. The direction to that point is \u201cdown\u201d, no matter where you are. Water is also attracted to that point. It tries to creep down until it fills every nook and cranny. And when it fills up a large body, like an ocean, \u201cdown\u201d at one end is at a different direction than at the other end. So it doesn\u2019t make a flat surface, but a surface where every point has the same distance to the center. And that is a curved surface. ",
