So, if you do away with empty space are you in replace it with something? I going to jam everything together? Are you going to put air in between objects? Going to have objects? Do you have gravity? Do you have matter at all? Do you have atoms? Are you going to have electrons protons and neutrons? Are you going to have forces and accelerations? Get the idea? ",
