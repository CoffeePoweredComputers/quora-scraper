            "answer_text": "This is a very good question since it exposes one of the problems with teaching chemistry. Chemistry uses still a lot of ideas from the 18th and 19th centuries and some even earlier. Here is the odd thing about language. We are told that HCl, for example, is a strong acid yet when HCl is added to water in fairly high concentrations we say the remaining solution is a strong acid. Yet the HCl has essentially disappeared, since it has fully dissociated. We are also told that the resulting H3O+ (being the so-called conjugate acid of a strong acid) is a weak acid. So we have now a language problem when we say a solution is strongly acidic (i.e. has a high concentration of H3O+) and that a molecule is a strong acid (i.e. has the tendency to give up a proton - on certain occasions). Thus the term \u2018acidity\u2019 and \u2018acid\u2019 not only fail to relate to the same concrete entity they fail to relate to the same concept. This is a source of tremendous confusion for many people. Thus here lies the problem. It is really unhelpful to define a molecule as an acid or a base. What is best is to say is this molecule is now acting as an acid since it is now undergoing proton transfer reactions (or it will undergo proton transfer reaction if you to this or that) . So HCl is only an acid when it undergoes an acidic reaction when mixed with water (don\u2019t forget this is a dynamic equilibrium so HCl is constantly reforming an dissociating). What have we left after this reaction - or better to say - at equilibrium? Well H3O+ which can also can undergo acid reactions with other substances. I would therefore say that molecules that have a tendency to undergo proton transfer reactions in H2O form H3O+. Does H3O+ actually react with hydrocarbon in your skin? That is another topic. OH- certainly reacts with lipids and this is why you get this slimy feel on your skin if you touch NaOH or KOH. If you touch pure HCl then I suppose among other things your skin will burn due to the heat released when HCl dissolves in the water contained in your skin. ",

            "answer_text": "An acid is a substance that donates hydrogen ions. Because of this, when an acid is dissolved in water, the balance between hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions is shifted. Now there are more hydrogen ions than hydroxide ions in the solution. This kind of solution is acidic. ",
