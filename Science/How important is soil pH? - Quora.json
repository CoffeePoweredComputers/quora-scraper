            "answer_text": "This is difficult to answer as there are too many variables. To keep the answer simple (you can follow up if you wish), it measures the acidity or alkalinity of soil but pH is but one of five major things I assess when I look at a soil report. The driving factors of healthy plant growth are a balance between the major cations (calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium) . and the major anions (phosphorus and sulphate sulphur). Finally, the Base Saturation percentages related to the total Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). Now come the nowledge of what the soil type is - sand, loam or clay - and as these are generally mixed, an idea of the percentages of each portion. A low pH (acidic) soil is usually limed (CaCO3) to rise the Ph to around 6.0 to 6.4 (optimal for most crops). On the other hand if I have a high pH I have to look at the cations carefully - is it because of a high calcium (?); a high magnesium (?), a high Potassium (?) or a high sodium (?). Each will hold the pH high if in excess, each in a different way. ",
