            "answer_text": "Three organs use lipids due to high energy demand. The heart, because it is beating constantly, hopefully, needs higher energy than available from glucose sugar which can vary in contraction. Skeletal muscle uses lipids to release energy during rest and light exercise. The liver has about 100 different biochemical functions and metabolites lipids as do the kidneys which are constantly filtering the blood and absorbing useful substances before delivering wastes into urine made by the kidneys. One tissue which uses lipids for releasing energy is adipose or fatty tissue which stores excess fats. Western diets have far more energy than required by sedentary bodies so obesity occurs easily and the three organs and one tissue have to work harder as a result. ",
