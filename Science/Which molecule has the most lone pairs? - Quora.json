            "answer_text": "Well, if we restrict our answer to diatomics (in which scenario we can discount long chain polyethers) would it not be a dihalogen? And in the difluorine molecule, [math]F_{2}[/math], there are SIX such lone pairs, four in dioxygen, and two in dinitrogen\u2026and with respect to [math]F_{2}[/math], because these are smaller, and more localized on an atom of HIGH nuclear charge, the [math]F-F[/math] bond length is UNUSUALLY longer than it should be on the basis of repulsive interaction between lone pair orbitals on the ADJACENT atom of the same molecule\u2026 ",
