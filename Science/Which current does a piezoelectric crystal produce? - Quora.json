            "answer_text": "It depends on the material. Each material has a different piezoelectric density constant (d). For EH you usually look for d31 and d33 constants. The bigger the constant, the bigger the current (well, technically its wider, since it produces alternate current). It becomes AWFULLY hard to matematically explain how much you can get off it since there are a lot of mathematical and physical variables involved, but a little example for you to understand: A typical 1USD crystal that you can take off a guitar, produces around 20mA against the pressure of your thumb. *Golden Rule: Fuck Impedance.* ",

            "answer_text": "A piezo crystal will produce an AC output if it receives continuous impacts in succession at a regular rate. Another words, the crystal will put out a pulse of current in positive polarity when impacted and when the crystal rebounds from the impact, there will be a reversal of current flow in the form of a similar but lower level pulse. So you could rectify this crude AC to get a DC product and then smooth it to some degree with caps and inductors. This principle is how a piezo-electric microphone works. Of course audio waves impacting a crystal will produce much smoother pulses as the deflection of the crystal is very tiny. ",
