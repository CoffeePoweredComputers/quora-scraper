            "answer_text": "If the universe is in fact expanding then some outside force is gravitationally pulling at it. God is physics. Why not? He is sustaining and allowing gravity to occur. Science can only replicate what exists with what is coexisting in the same time and universe. Science can only teach us about what we can see, outside of this there is only speculation. There is no scientific explanation for the \"whys\" of this universe and the recorded time, which we have faith we exist in. Why does matter, antimatter or gravity exist? What is the reason for existence, existing. Atheists think they themselves are the reason. But has anyone made himself exist? Can a human being without any experiential knowledge, know if they exist. Everyone knows they exist for a reason and they know the reason, but trick their neurons into only knowing what they can touch. There must be a higher reality and if you are able to perceive the physical world from that vantage point you would be able to understand reality and why it exists. If you created reality and gave it a purpose, then made a part of it different. Like yourself. This part you loved, you were in love with it, you loved it more than yourself and gave it everything it needed or wanted and hung out with it all day. Then it stopped loving you and stopped fulfilling its purpose. You made it like yourself with the ability to choose to do something or not to do something. Then you told your creation one thing displeased you and it chose to do that one thing. And in your nature you could not fill the same space with that which displeased you. You were forced to break the connection between you and your creation. Then it hated you and only wanted to do that which displeased you. Would you still be in love with that part of your creation. Why would you still love it. If you see things from someone else's perspective but are able to not do the things they do, you can understand why you can still love them no matter what they do. Would you give them a way out of their self-inflicted hell? If you became one of your creations, to experience everything they go through. Then you told them if they believed in you again then you would restore them to there original state of being without the want of disobeying. Then they killed you in the worst way they had thought of. And at the same time and place all the wrath that is part of your nature was put on yourself and you experienced the worst thing you could imagine so that those who believed in you wouldn't have to experience it. You do all this for that which you are in love with and it still won't believe. What would you do? Would you rescue those who love you? Then what? The rest is unnecessary. New existence begins and lasts forever. Sorry if that got away from antigravity and such. Just see gravity from its perspective, it wants to do its purpose, leave it alone. Shit flies yo, make what you got work better. ",

            "answer_text": "I can paint you a picture that will help you imagine gravity. Imagine a trampoline and in the middle place a ball. This ball represents a body with mass and the surface of the trampoline is spacetime. Now the ball will bend the surface of the trampoline according to its mass. Smaller balls will bend the surface less and larger ball will bend em more. Now if you put another ball at the vicinity of our first ball due to the \"curvature\" the second ball will fall towards the first one and as they get closer they will move towards each other faster. You have to put energy to separate them. For repulsion our first ball has to bend the surface of the trampoline not downwards but upwards. Something like the ball sticks to the surface and the ball is pulled upwards. This way if you put another ball at the vicinity of the first one they move apart. You have to put energy to bring them together. this is in essence negative gravity. Practically to achive negative gravity two particles have to interact and one of them has to have negative mass. One way to achive negative mass is if that particle is moving backwards in time. That can be achived if the particle is moving faster than light. ",

            "answer_text": "According to Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, gravity is as result of the curvature of spacetime fabric. If you jump upwards, spacetime fabric will return you down because you are trying to curve it. Imagine of stretching a rubber band, it always returns to its original length due its elastic recoil. Maybe there are some kind of movements spacetime fabric can either allow, support or resist. I think we don't need to create anti-gravity, what we need is to find one kind of motion which spacetime fabric support thus giving an illusion of anti-gravity. 2. We need to find natural forces that interact with spacetime fabric and then include those forces in that one motion that is supported by spacetime fabric. Professor Eric Laithewaite discovered the one motion that we are looking for and is on an official record. The motion is circular motion. He used a wheel to demonstrate that a rotating wheel felt lighter when lifting it than a stationary one. For the natural force, it has been demonstrated over and over again that magnetism interact with spacetime fabric and that magnetic force is several times stronger than gravity. When a system containing magnetic field is rotated it interact with spacetime fabric thus creating an effect that creates an illusion of anti-gravity.Searl's effect Generator is one of that system. Also a replica of Searl's effect Generator was created by two Russian scientists, Godin and Roschin. Godin and Roschin claimed that at a bove 450 RPMs, their generator appeared to start accelerating without any power withdraw from the power source! At around 580 RPMs, the entire system started to reduce in weight on the weight metre. It continued to reduce in its measurable weight with increase in RPM. Its measurable weight reduced by 35% as per their measurements by the time they stopped the experiment because the system became unstable for running the speed it was not designed for. It seems, we don't need to find some material that is anti-gravity or create anti-gravity. What we need is to create systems that comply with the motion that spacetime fabric can support to give an illusion of anti-gravity. ",

            "answer_text": "Charge flowing in a loop will create a magnetic field with a polarity which depends on which direction in which it is flowing. What does mass flowing in a loop do? Do two bodies spinning about the same axis in the opposite direction repel each other? The best way to find out if flowing mass acts like flowing charge would be to mount a few bicycle wheels on a pole such that they can freely slide along their axes. Do they attract or repel depending the direction in which they are spinning? While searching for a picture of such an experiment, I could only find this: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/34268/34268-h/images/fig58.jpg What is that guy doing? https://www.gutenberg.org/files/34268/34268-h/34268-h.htm The second link is an old lecture from 1908. It was given by Prof. John Perry, a student of Lord Kelvin and it makes my heart sing to see how the whole darn thing is written in plain English with no mathematical sophistry whatsoever. Beautiful. When I see a question like this answered only in terms of \u201cmysterious dark energy\u201d and general relativity, I really wonder if the world wars messed up physics in a major way: Why is Einstein so overrated? But maybe I am wrong and \u201cdark energy\u201d is exactly the same thing as the force which keeps a top from tipping over. Each star shooting away from us in the night sky is like a wire carrying electric current in the same general direction. Wires with current flowing in the same direction attract, so mass flowing in the same direction would repel, according to a simple analogy from Gravitoelectromagnetism: Electrons repel, magnets attract and repel, electromagnetic waves make atoms stable Mass attracts, [the gravitational analog of magnets] repels and attracts, gravitational waves make orbits stable Kirsten Hacker's post in A public notepad Thus, the gravitational analogue of magnetism could be the \u201cmysterious dark energy\u201d force which is causing the observed accelerating expansion of our universe. Once you remove the lack of transparency which infects physics today, I think what is underneath is really very simple. It just got lost during the confusion of the last paradigm shift when learning physics became equivalent to learning to think counterintuitively. To understand more about how our theories fit together, see: If a moving electric field produces a magnetic field, does a moving gravity field have it's own \"magnetic equivalent\"? ",

            "answer_text": "I have heard there is repelling gravity. Is this true? Yes. Gravity is associated with mass, they are part and parcel of the same thing. The equations of physics indicate that positive mass would have positive gravity; and negative mass would have negative gravity. Dark energy if made up of negative mass particles, would have negative gravity. The particles that could make up dark energy are negative-imaginary mass neutrinos and neutrino like quantum mechanically symmetric particles. The \u201ccosmological constant\u201d is a mathematical fudge factor that forces our universe to accelerate. This is not the same as negative gravity. It does not obey the equivalence principle postulate of Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, because it is not indistinguishable from acceleration. It also does not obey the principles of physics: i.e. conservation of energy, conservation of momentum or Newton\u2019s second principle (the definition of force or mass). This should be more than enough to rule it out completely, once and for all. Negative gravity is consistent with all the principles of physics. ",

And space drives like Shawyer's EM Drive are not antigravity devices even though they reportedly provide thrust without exhaust in the opposite direction to cause and equal and opposite force to drive them forward.  There have been tests of it on board the Chinese space station and by NASA at the Glenn Space Center, that indicate it works, but they are near the limit of accuracy. In theory, microwaves bounce off the walls of the reaction chamber unevenly and that causes a thrust even though no exhaust comes out.  That violates newton's three laws of motion but its been know for over a century that newton's laws are not complete. Shayer thinks that the special theory of relativity explains the effect completely. Antigravity has not been observed in the lab. The acceleration of galaxies away from each other seems to be caused by an antigravity force called dark energy. But the latest measurements of the Hubble red shift call that into question. The universe's expansion might not be accelerating after all. It might be expanding at a steady rate. ",

The reason is very simple: If you look at the equation of universal gravitational force you will notice that it depends upon mass x mass divided by separation squared. Since (i) mass is always positive (and cannot under any circumstances be negative) and(ii) separation is also positive (and cannot under any circumstances be negative) it means that the attractive force is also always necessarily positive. There is, therefore, no real situation in which anti-gravity can be created. ************************************** If you want to check this out, look at Newton's law of universal gravitation - Wikipedia. It\u2019s a bit technical but gives the basic idea in the first few paragraphs. Some people are a bit confused when they see the vector form of the equation has a minus sign in front of it which they think implies that gravity can be negative. In fact, the minus sign is a mathematical tool and has no physical significance. ",

Gravity\u2019s draw is simply masked by the free-falling motion of a spacecraft as it circles the planet.

            "answer_text": "Anti-gravity also known as non-gravitational field is an idea of creating a place or object that is free from the force of gravity. It does not refer to the lack of weight under gravity experienced in free fall or orbit, or to balancing the force of gravity with some other force, such as electromagnetism or aerodynamic lift. Anti-gravity is a recurring concept in science fiction, particularly in the context of spacecraft propulsion. Examples are the gravity blocking substance \"Cavorite\" in H. G. Wells' The First Men in the Moon and the Spindizzy machines in James Blish's Cities in Flight. In Newton's law of universal gravitation, gravity was an external force transmitted by unknown means. In the 20th century, Newton's model was replaced by general relativity where gravity is not a force but the result of the geometry of spacetime. Under general relativity, anti-gravity is impossible except under contrived circumstances.Quantum physicists have postulated the existence of gravitons, massless elementary particles that transmit gravitational force, but the possibility of creating or destroying these is unclear. \"Anti-gravity\" is often used colloquially to refer to devices that look as if they reverse gravity even though they operate through other means, such as lifters, which fly in the air by moving air with electromagnetic fields.

            "answer_text": "This is the dark energy, which appears to match a simple coamological constant, with an energy density that is positive, but a pressure that is negative. In the tensor equations of general relativity the negative pressure outweighs the positive energy density because it carries a factor of 3 (3 spatial dimensions) and the net effect is a \u2018negative\u2019 or repulsive gravity. See here for a more complete and more subtle discussion: Why Does Dark Energy Make the Universe Accelerate? It wins out because the more space you have the more dark energy, whereas matter dilutes as volume increases. ",
