            "answer_text": "As a Conservative, I am well aware of media bias, therefore, I always need to consider the source of the information and read it carefully to sort the distortions. For example, I read the New York Times, daily. Since President Trump has announced his intent to run for president, there has been a minimum of one, and usually more, negative front page stories about the President. I think I remember one neutral story, about two years ago. Obviously there to extreme bias. Even Genghis Khan had some positive stories about his life and endeavors. Cable news outlets are even more distorted; mostly negative toward conservatism and one or two somewhat distorted in the opposite direction. So, to answer your question, I attempt to read at least four or five sources and then use a mental calculus to discern the actual story. If the writer of an article states their belief of the motive of the person he is writing about, I generally discard the article. I also know, before reading any journalism, that 80%+ of journalists in the U.S. classify themselves as liberal. I also know that most Journalists will gleefully write negative stories about conservatives and are very reluctant to write positive articles. As an example, President Trump donates salary to a specific charity each quarter. Has any newspaper ever written an extended article about those donations and how he decides which group to give the donation? We all have flaws and we all have good intentions. Which aspect of that person is highlighted? ",

            "answer_text": "You make it sound like conservatives think all news is fake and biased, but of course that\u2019s ridiculous. The news is pretty much the news, and is reported similarly by all outlets. It\u2019s when politics is part of the story that the bias shows up. Sometimes the reporters are so biased they just make stuff up. Getting news from different sources makes spotting lies and bias easier. Conservatives are surrounded by news from left-leaning sources, the entertainment industry and academia are also left-leaning. It\u2019s impossible for conservatives to ignore all of it, not that anyone thinks that\u2019s a good idea. So we routinely hear both sides. For example: Joe Biden is still repeating the \u2018Trump called Nazis good people\u2019 line that was widely reported by the MSM about Charlottesville. Conservatives heard the same reports, but right-leaning sources eventually showed Trump\u2019s entire remarks, which made it clear he wasn\u2019t talking about Nazis or white supremacists, who he condemned. \u2018Slow Joe\u2019 is sticking with the original fake news reports, he\u2019s in his liberal news bubble and may not have heard anything differently. That\u2019s hard to believe, but let\u2019s give him the benefit of the doubt. So, if liberals believe the MSM is honest and fair, how do they know if they never listen to anything else? Bubbles are comfy, but if they\u2019re never left it\u2019s willful ignorance. ",
