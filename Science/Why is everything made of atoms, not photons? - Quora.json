            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy is everything made of atoms, not photons? \u201c Well, this is an interesting question and crazy question, along the lines of \u201cwhy is there something rather than nothing. \u201c first of all, photons do not interact a lot, and definitely don't like binding to each other, preferring I stead to whiz about at the speed of light. So, you couldn't really build something from light, unless that something was a black hole. (A sufficiently large energy density could theoretically make a black hole despite the lack of any actual mass.) But a different question might be, why are there atoms at all? And as best we can tell, it's because energy had to go somewhere, and the excitation of the electron field and quark field was the \u2018easiest\u2019 way to store the energy. ",

            "answer_text": "Atom is composed of protons, neutrons and electrons. The protons and neutrons together form the nucleus of the atom while the electrons are present around it. Photons are actually particles of light. Occasionally the electrons get excited or energised. But they don't remain like that for long. They always return to their ground state, that is the low energy state. For example, if you get angry or happy or any emotion for that matter, you will naturally express it. If you're happy, you laugh or if you're sad you might cry. So, when the electrons need to give away their excess energy, they emit energy. Photons are just a part of it. And, photons do not have mass. So they cannot be classified as matter. This is the reason why photons or particles of energy cannot make up matter while atoms, which have mass, can. ",
