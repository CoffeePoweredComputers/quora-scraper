            "answer_text": "Depends on the details. All have features to recommend them. Natural Fission - also known as geothermal - is quite efficient and safe and productive in those areas where it makes sense. This is a minor energy source despite the fact that natural fission reactions occur at the center of the Earth that make the center as hot as the surface of the Sun. $3000/kW Could provide about 2% of our energy needs.Artificial Fisson - there are 450 fission reactors in the world. This is 11% of the world\u2019s generation capacity, but has cost 40% of the money spent on electrical generation. Over half the money spent on nuclear power resulted in failed projects. At $6000/kW it is one of the most expensive energy sources on the planet. Major decommissioning costs and liabilities accrue. Yet, the cost of mining and processing a ton of thorium or uranium is no more than the cost of mining and processing a ton of coal. Yet, 3 million times the energy content is contained in these fuels. There is also an abundance of them in nature. Furthermore, the radioactivity of the debris need not be any greater than the natural isotopes started with. So, what\u2019s the problem?The technology is hampered by an embargo of nuclear knowledge due to legitimate concerns with weapons proliferation. This limits techniques and fuel choices and makes the technology more dangerous and more costly than it need be. A technical path toward Improvements have been outlined since the 1950s when Brookings Institute looked at nuclear as a possible solution to our then looming America\u2019s energy problem in 1970. That problem came and went with the energy crisis of 1970 and our switch to Mid East Oil and all that entails. These findings have largely been ignored since it assumes international cooperation on nonproliferation that never happened. We would do well to review them today, as the globe is approaching an energy crisis today and faces new environmental challenges beyond that;Conventional; 300 C temperature - 40% efficiency. 600 MW scale $6000/kW cost.Molten Salt Near Term - 900 C temperature - 60% efficiency - 6000 MW scale - highly enriched plutonium, highly enriched U233, thorium fuel cycle - $350/kW cost. HTRE-3Nuclear Light Bulb 10 years term - 1800 C temperature - 85% efficiency - 60,000 MW scale - tungsten based alloys of plutonium and uranium - thorium fuel cycle - $35/kW cost NERVANuclear Pulse - 20 years term 100,000 C temperature 90% efficiency - 600,000 MW scale - clean fission blast with appropriate $6/GW (too cheap to meter) ORION permits 100% re-processing of all waste and extraction of ores from rock using plasma techniques.Natural Fusion - the Sun is a natural fusion energy source whose light is freely available to all. 10,000 more energy falls on Earth than humanity uses. Beyond the Earth\u2019s surface 21.27 trillion times as much energy as humanity uses is freely available.Terrestrial solar - ultra-low-cost hydrogen producing solar panels produce 26 kg/year/m2 hydrogen at a cost of less than $475 per ton from sunlight and rain water from systems that cost less than $35 per meter to install.Solar Power Satellite - ultra thin laser glass is fabricated into a shell 2.15 micron thick which absorbs the full spectrum of sunlight at 1361.5 W/m2 and using optical phased arrays beam laser energy at 500 nm delivering it using four wave mixing to many receivers simultaneously. Producing 60 kW/kg and costing $8,500/kg - $145/kWStellar Laser - a pair of laser satellites similar to those described previously are placed in an 8.766 hour orbit around the sun at 1/100th AU. These pass a laser beam through the solar chromosphere between them and cause iron vapour in the chromosphere to lase at 125 nanometer producing a 1,000 TW beam with two satellites launched on conventional launchers. Working in conjunction with Earth orbiting solar power satellites already described, a network of 5 satellites launched by conventional launchers provide more power than humanity needs. 125 nm wavelength laser energy is received in Earth orbit and beamed at 500 nm to users on the ground. All thermal sources are replaced by molten salt systems relatively rapidly. Direct laser chemical processes recycle all waste. Other processes react CO2 in the air with water vapour to produce CH4 on demand. Still other processes receive laser energy and conduct it via optical fibers replacing our electrical grid usuring in the photonic age. Direct use of photonic propulsion opens the skies to humanity and 60 million ballistic drones replace 1.3 billion motorcars.Artificial Fusion. First achieved in Project Ivy in 1952 the details of this have been highly classified ever since. Suffering from the same issues as artificial fission, artificial fusion is even more constrained. Accurate cross section data and simple discussion of proper analysis remains highly classified. There is an active program of suppression and disinformation underway world wide. I personally found a reference that was open source in the 1930s but classified in the 1950s at my college library and that book disappeared after I brought it to my mentor\u2019s attention. The hot fusion program touted by the media is a distraction from practical Low Energy Nuclear Reactions that are well known to weaponeers. This is kept secret since it makes the prohibition of fissile materials passe given the wide range of common materials that support aneutronic fusion. Neutron mediated aneutronic reactions were first outlined in 1946 by Ulrich Jetter and reduced to practice in 1952. They were \u2018born classified\u2019 and no one since the demise of Louis Strauss and the untimely death of Project Sherwood researchers, has agitated for their declassification. Li-6 + H-2 \u2192 2 He-4 + 22.4 MeVThe net reaction above is easily initiated and sustained at room temperature and pressure. It leaves no radioactive waste. The cost of the raw mateial is $240 per kg. The energy yield is 270.2 trillion joules per kg. Humanity already produces 60,000 tonnes of this fuel. Enough to grow our economy 30x along the lines outlined in the artificial fission discussion for about 1/3 the costs given the reduction in decommissioning costs.",

            "answer_text": "RE: Would fission or fusion be better for creating a clean source of energy? That\u2019s not really a question which can be accurately answered right now since we do not yet have anywhere on Earth a fusion reactor which actually works. However I\u2019ll take a shot at it as a guestimate. Short answer: FISSION is cleaner by far. Why? Fusion a la ITER fuses deuterium with tritium to make neutrons to make more tritium. Tritium is an intensely radioactive gas which has to be contained, which they can certainly do. Plus there is a plethora of extra neutrons which will make the reactor itself radioactive. So, contrary to a lot of hype, fusion as done by ITER makes some intensely radioactive stuff, but it should all remain contained so there will be no problem. But there is a problem, a big one. ITER is not scheduled to actually try to make fusion happen until 2035, but that\u2019s just the start of the actual fusion experiment. ITER will not produce electricity even if it is successful. If ITER reaches its goal then a larger and even more expensive test reactor will need to be built in order to actually make electricity. So what are we talking time-wise \u2014 2050? 2060? \u2014 to finally have ONE fusion reactor producing power IF all goes according to plan? The problem is . . .  . . . we need to stop using fossil fuels NOW (even tho that ain\u2019t gonna happen). In the meantime we have designs for completely safe Gen 3+ reactors which have been built and are running, and more are being built, tho mostly not here in the US much to our shame. So given the time frame of, say, 40 years (?) until starting build-out of fusion reactors (If they work at all) all the while burning coal, oil and gas VERSUS starting build-out of existing Gen 3+ fission reactor designs TODAY, then which is cleaner? Obviously fission is cleaner because we can start to work on reducing the burning of fossil fuels TODAY instead of 40 (?) years from now.  I really dislike it when people give answers but disable all comments. That means no on can call them out on their answers when said answers are questionable or wrong. There is one such answer (thus far) on this question: from Anton Carver: RE: In order to make energy cleaner, one must first make clean energy cheaper than fossil fuels. As fission isn\u2019t cheaper than fossil fuels it is never going to displace them in the energy mix. Fossil fuels will run out FAR sooner than nuclear fuels. What do you do then? And if you burn all that stuff there will be so much CO2 in the air that the Antarctic ice cap and other glaciers all over the world will be melting like mad, raising ocean levels and inundating coastal cities and low-lying countries all over the world. Fossil fuel reserves would crush climate goals: report We need to stop burning fossil fuels. And if you factor in the costs of losing our coastal cities and low-lying lands, then fossil fuels aren\u2019t so cheap. And what about the costs of the 8 million premature deaths every year plus many more millions of illnesses from breathing fossil fuel pollution? What does that do to the real cost of fossil fuels? And like many other advocates of renewable energy, his answer ignores advances in nuclear power reactor technology, trying to make us believe that all future reactors will be just the same as they are now, behemoths floated on oceans of cash. We are moving towards small, modular power reactors which can be mass produced in factories and shipped to wherever power is needed in ordinary shipping containers. Mass production will knock down the price a lot, and simple assembly on site will knock the price down even more. RE: One you look elsewhere for clean energy sources\u2014renewable energy provides several sources of energy that are cheaper than fossil fuels. When the wind stops blowing windmills produce no power. When the sun stops shining solar cells produce no power. BUT we must stop burning fossil fuels. That leaves energy storage \u2014 batteries \u2014 and massive, world-wide interconnection. $$$$ To implement energy storage to get reliable power from intermittent sources makes even the current Gen3+ reactors look cheap in comparison. I\u2019ve written in another answer an extrapolation of what it would cost to expand existing, real, solar farms and battery farms based on their actual cost to equal a 1 gigawatt nuclear power plant. I don\u2019t feel like typing it in all over again, so go read it at Jeff Barry's answer to What's your view on the claim that \"Solar farms take 450 times more land than nuclear plants, and wind farms take 700 times more land than natural gas wells, to produce the same amount of energy.\"? But if you don\u2019t care to read the actual numbers and see my calculations, here is the conclusion from the above: To that 18.6 billion add the $38.4 billion for the redundant solar farms spread around the world + cost of a [global] grid + cost of maintaining and replacing the solar cells and batteries + energy losses over transcontinental or trans-global power lines + . . . . Renewable energy is VASTLY more expensive than nuclear power. Real number from real places make that clear. What the heck, let\u2019s throw in another one of my answers on this general subject: Jeff Barry's answer to What don\u2019t they tell you about renewable energy? Enuf, gudnite. ",
