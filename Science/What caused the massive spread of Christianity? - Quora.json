            "answer_text": "There are many different causes for the spread of Christianity. Christianity is 2000 years old and as such, it has had many different periods of rapid expansion and some periods of decline. Here is a brief outline of some of the periods of rapid expansion: 1. Early ChurchThere are some reports that Christianity grew by 40% every ten years in this period. This is remarkable because there were periods of tremendous persecution. Christianity had new or \"cutting edge\" ideas during this period. Christianity's embrace of slaves and women were a major reason for its growth. Anti-Christian Celsus claimed that Christianity was full of slaves, women, and poor people. Monotheism and high ethical values would probably be listed as reasons for rapid growth.     2. Post-Constantine Constantine made Christianity legal, became a Christian himself, and this eventually led to the Roman Empire effectively making Christianity the state religion of Rome. Of course when there is a mandated state religion of the largest empire in the world, there will be massive \"expansion\" of Christianity. Of course the Roman empire in actuality only covered Europe and parts of Africa, but this still represented a huge expansion in Christianity. So you could say that the conversion of Constantine was the major reason for the spread of Christianity during this period.     3. 18th & 19th Century Missionary MovementChristianity remained largely a Western religion until the 19th century. From about 600 AD until 1700 AD, Christianity experienced steady growth, typically simply from population growth of Western nations. It wasn't until the 18th century and really accelerated in the 19th century that Christianity became a truly global religion. This spread is largely due to a movement called the Evangelical movement which stressed the conversion of new believers. They were extremely active in sending out missionaries to other countries. The evangelical movement was also very independent and decentralized allowing unique Christianities to grow in Africa, Asia and South America that are distinct from European and North American forms of Christianity. In otherwords, new Christians around the world didn't feel like Christianity only belonged to Europe, rather it belonged to them.   ",

            "answer_text": "First, when it began, Christianity offered something new\u2014something no one else did or ever had. It\u2019s a little hard for us to comprehend how different the world was before Christianity. We swim in the sea of a Christianized western culture whose revolutionary ideas are now taken for granted even by non-Christians. But there was a time when Christianity spread because these ideas were new and changing the world one life at a time. Christianity spread because it has always been evangelistic. Women talked in the marketplace and men spoke together in synagogue and that was incredibly effective. Countless individual decisions were made that added up to a profound cultural change that eventually spread across the whole Empire. Part of the power of these new ideas was because of the conditions of life at the time. Citizens of Rome were generally better off than most of the rest of the world, but in spite of all the glories of the Roman Empire, people lived in gross inequality. The masses lived in great poverty while there was immense wealth in the hands of a very few. Romans believed a person\u2019s fate was deserved, whatever it was, so there was no concern for the poor out of a sense of common humanity. Even with the many sicknesses, diseases, and plagues that spread like coronavirus through the population, there were no public health services in the Roman empire. Romans did occasionally donate to public works to raise their social standing, but there was no organized charity for the poor. Romans would have been appalled at the idea\u2014in fact they were when Christians started practicing it. Doctors were expensive. Very often the only alternative to starvation in the event of being unable to pay\u2014whatever the cause\u2014was to sell yourself and/or your family into slavery to pay your debts. Sexual mor\u00e9s, political clout, business contracts and even marital arrangements were all determined by your social position in Roman empire. It was considered morally acceptable for upper class men to sexually abuse their slaves because slaves, being on the bottom of society had no social position, and to a Roman that meant they had no capacity for moral thought. They were things. Romans weren\u2019t even convinced women were people in the same way noble men were. Part of the power of the new Christian ideas was because of conditions of life, but part of their power was in the ideas themselves. The Christian community, taught and genuinely practiced \u201cthere is neither Jew nor Greek, neither male nor female, neither slave nor free.\u201d They pooled their resources, and took care of each other in unprecedented ways. Christianity cared for the poor and built the first hospitals aimed specifically at helping those without the means to help themselves. They allowed women a freedom and power no one else ever had. One of the earliest extra-biblical references to Christianity we have mentions two women slaves who were deacons in their local church. We have a register of the church at Rome dating to the year 251: they had a number of people that they catalogued \u2014 46 presbyters, seven of this and seven of that\u2014quite a lot of people are in this catalog. At the end of the register it says over 1,500 widows, along with other needy persons, are on the roster as being supported by the church there. This gave widows the freedom not to marry, since under Roman law, widows were required to remarry within two years of their husband\u2019s death. Church members bought slaves just to set them free. They taught people that there was no authority above God, not even Caesar. They said God had declared that every human life had value to Him\u2014even a slave\u2019s life\u2014and He had demonstrated that, Himself, by coming to earth, being crucified in human form, and rising from the dead. Christians talked about this God who loves, a God who loves enough that he would send his very son into the world -- never mind how odd the notion of God having a son was to the Jews who began this movement, because there it is -- the Christian story is a story of a god who calls upon people to exercise a similar kind of love that he himself has demonstrated, a love which is manifested in this death for others, the death of the Son of God. It was a revolutionary concept\u2014 an ideology of love instead of power: love your neighbor as yourself\u2014which must also mean love yourself, and love your wife, and your children, and your brothers and sisters in Christ, and oddly, even your enemies. This was a new message, a rather improbable message. Romans were familiar with stories of the gods coming to earth and leaving behind half human progeny, but none of them claimed it was because those gods cared about mankind. One of the things that runs through the Apostle Paul\u2019s letters, is his conviction that\u2014 what he calls the Word of the Cross, or the reasoning of the Cross\u2014ought to pervade the whole lives of the individuals who believed. The way in which one exercises leadership or authority in the congregation must somehow tally with the notion that the power of God is manifested in the reversal of how Romans saw and exercised power, in which the most powerful one in all the universe comes to be crucified in the most shameful form; the one who is equal with God, gives that up to take on the form of a slave. This becomes the model of what love is. Love is re-defined. It is this other-regarding sacrificial act\u2014choosing to put oneself on the line for the sake of the good of the other\u2014and this is grounded in the claim about the way the ultimate power and structure of the universe manifests itself in the human heart. It was a whole new way of being human. It changed the human heart one life at a time, and spread, and still spreads, filling the earth, because the heart of man still needs its message: you are loved. You are valued. You matter. ",
