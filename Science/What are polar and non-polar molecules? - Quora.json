            "answer_text": "POLAR MOLECULES : Polar molecules are those molecules in which two atoms do not share their electrons equally in a covalent bond. They have partial positive and partial negative charge on them. For Eg : Water - H2O Ammonia - NH3 Note: Ionic compounds are strongly Polar compounds. Eg. NaCl (Sodium Chloride), HCl(Hydrogen Chloride) etc. NON POLAR MOLECULES : Non Polar molecules are those molecules in which share electrons equally in a covalent bond. Since electrons are shared equally therefore there is no net electrical charge across the molecule. For Eg : Any of the homonuclear diatomic element like H2, N2, O2, Cl2 etc. Carbon dioxide - CO2 Benzene - C6H6 ",
