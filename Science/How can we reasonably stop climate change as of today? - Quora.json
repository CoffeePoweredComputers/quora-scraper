            "answer_text": "It is impossible to stop climate change. What we can do is slow it down significantly. Perhaps in the future, we\u2019ll determine a way to begin reversing the temperature increase and decrease the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Every little thing helps, such as reducing or eliminating the amount of plastic you use, recycling if you can, volunteering to reforest or clean up a lake, etc. The best thing you can do is join or start a group with at least one person well versed in climate change and get the information out to the public. While it is getting more press these days, it still isn\u2019t obvious to a large number of people that we are responsible for most of it. At this point, climate change is speeding up due to nations increasing their fossil fuel consumption and production, rather than lowering it as agreed to. Unless we can get our leaders to take climate change seriously, there isn\u2019t a lot the private people can do. Most companies like solar installers or makers and wind turbine builders and installers are needed. Substitutes for plastic are sorely needed, since our entire infrastructure depends on it. Plastic comes from oil. That includes this like PVC piping. We use plastic everywhere; hospital equipment, for instance. We absolutely must get to net zero carbon yesterday. Contrary to what everyone is told, we don\u2019t have until 2030 or 2050 to stop polluting the atmosphere, the ocean, drinking water and the land. If we don\u2019t immediately start major changes, we will not stop the rapidly increasing temperatures, storms, fire, etc. There are things we can do at the same time, in the hope that we can get the Federal government to stop subsidizing oil and gas and begin fining those industries instead. Planting trees and ground cover are one way. Getting state and local government to stop building new houses is another, as is preserving more land. The ocean can only hold so much carbon before it too, starts dying. There are many other, opportunities, too numerous to describe here. My master\u2019s thesis is focused on reversing desertification, which is similar to reforesting, but it instead returning land that has been turned into man made desert into healthy land. It is a much slower and more difficult process than simply reforesting, but reducing the deserts also helps decrease temperatures. I hope to do that professionally once I finish. Do what you can, but most of all, push your governmental bodies to make changes to save water, trees, and land. Put back marshes. Learn more and teach more. Okay, I\u2019ll stop there. I know it\u2019s a little long, but hopefully it will give you some ideas. ",

            "answer_text": "As of right now, I don\u2019t believe it is possible to stop climate change doing serious harm. Even if the entire world unanimously agreed to take immediate action it would still take years to get the infrastructure in place to stop burning fossil fuels for energy. It would take decades to bring the tech needed to replace the internal combustion engine. If we\u2019d started when the warnings were ramping up 20\u201330 years ago we\u2019d already be 3/4 of the way there now. The other huge problem which often goes overlooked is that even if by some miracle we turned off every source of human carbon production today it will still take decades for the residual carbon to start to dissipate. For some years to come the atmospheric carbon parts per million (ppm) will continue to rise before they finally level off. Depending how high this leveling off occurs will dictate whether we are past the tipping point or not. Another issue is that no-one knows what the tipping point is. For all we know, and it is highly likely, the tipping point was crossed a long time ago. This means that we are at the mercy of natural cycles to find their balance. This may or may not be at a point conducive to human habitation as we now know it. So, quick fixes. No new power stations which utilize fossil fuels. Switch to renewable energy solution especially on a small scale like homes, small businesses, villages. This can all be done reasonably quickly. New battery storage can make houses completely self-sufficient. Solar, wind and hydro can be used all over the world and scale will have to vary depending on the local needs. Demand will need to change so businesses don\u2019t run neon 24/7 and any unnecessary lighting has to be shut off when not needed. The toughest thing to fix will be transport. Heavy transport is years off shifting to renewable sources although more environmentally friendly gas could be quickly moved into production. Lanes of traffic would have to be closed to allow the use of bicycles particularly for trips under 10km. We are so used to being lazy and hopping in the car we have forgotten that is actually isn\u2019t that hard to cycle. Not only would it be great for the environment it would have a massive impact on obesity in the western world where even a 1km trip to the shop for milk is now done by car. If you can change attitudes and habits you could make giant leaps in carbon reduction, improve human health and get people to see a simpler, cheaper way to live and go about your daily tasks. Sorry. I\u2019m trying to keep this brief so I\u2019m just touching on a lot of key issues quickly and not fully exploring them for you. Many Australian outback towns are shifting to wind and solar because the cost of grid power has increase exponentially since privatization of the network. In 3rd world countries looking for village and small town power small scale wind and solar would be a much more feasible alternative to using fossil fuels and can be located locally negating the need for wide spread electrical networks. There are many ways we can make a rapid impact but first you need to people prepared to make the changes and the political will to implement the changes which, unfortunately, you aren\u2019t going to get with our current money hungry crop of political figures world wide.
