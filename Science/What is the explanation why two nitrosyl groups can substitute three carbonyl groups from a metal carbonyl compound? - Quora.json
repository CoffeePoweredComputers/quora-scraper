            "answer_text": "Nitrogen monoxide (NO) is an odd electron molecule with bond order of 2.5This you can verify from molecular orbital diagram for the molecule. So basically, the molecule has a double plus half bond between nitrogen and oxygen.3 bonding molecular orbitals are completely filled and the odd electron enters into antibonding molecular orbital, thus giving a B.O. of 2.5 Now, the nitrogen has a pair of electrons on it and there\u2019s an odd electron lying in the high energy antibonding molecular orbital of the molecule. So, it is possible for the molecule to act as a three electron donor, i.e. lone pair on nitrogen and the high energy odd electron can be donated and moreover by doing so, since electron is given away from ABMO, the B.O. increases to three. So, that\u2019s how by acting as a three electron donor. two nitric oxide molecules can replace three carbonyl groups. for example: [Fe(CO)5] + 2NO gives [Fe(NO)2(CO)2] + 3CO [Cr(CO)6] + 4NO gives [Cr(NO)4] + 6CO Hope this helps :) ",
