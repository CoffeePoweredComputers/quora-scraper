            "answer_text": "Yes they can. If carbon-rich grime (say from food spills) contacts the point of attachment where the burner plugs in, current will \"carbon-track\" through you to ground.  Generally though, you won't get a shock because the electrical conductor is not exposed. It's embedded in mineral (magnesium oxide) insulation, inside the metal coil you see on the stove. If the equipment is clean and in good order, there's no difference of potential between ground and the parts you can touch. ",
