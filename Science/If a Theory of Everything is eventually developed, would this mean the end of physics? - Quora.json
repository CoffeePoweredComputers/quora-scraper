            "answer_text": "Suppose we have a computer. Would computer science end completely? Suppose we have a periodic table. Would that be the end of chemistry? A working theory of everything would certainly change a lot of things about physics, but it wouldn't be the end of science by any means. For one thing, we'd need to test all of the theory's predictions. This would probably take centuries \u2014 for obvious reasons, the most interesting tests involving black holes and neutron stars cannot be performed anywhere near Earth. More importantly, a \"theory of everything\" would not actually answer all of our questions about the universe. Yes, it would give us a very accurate description of how particles behave and interact with each other. But solving the equations directly would become intractable very quickly for large groups of particles, and even computers can only simulate so many particles at a time. A theory of everything would not bring us much closer to understanding large-scale emergent phenomena like life, consciousness, or superconductivity. In fact, most fields of science \u2014 biology, chemistry, geology, and so on \u2014 would be almost completely unaffected. To expand on that point, imagine that we did have enough computational power to directly model macroscopic objects from the properties of their component particles. That would be amazing! In principle, we could now simulate (for example) an entire human body and predict its behavior. But how would we know what data to feed into the model? The outcome would probably depend very sensitively on the initial conditions, which means that at the start of the simulation, we would have to know the exact position and state of each atom to get a useful result. That\u2019s simply not realistic. Thus, even if we had a theory of everything, figuring out how to apply its equations to real-life situations would be a monumental task. And that\u2019s just the most fundamental problem we would face. Once the new theory is well understood and can be used to predict real-world phenomena, applied scientists would start looking for ways to optimize the inputs to achieve particular results. With billions and billions of possible arrangements of particles to choose from, these scientists would have no shortage of interesting topics to study. Finding the theory of everything would not be the end of science. It would be the end of one line of inquiry and the beginning of a thousand others. ",

            "answer_text": "No way! No how! How do I know this? Simple. It has nothing to do with physics. It has to do with math, specifically set theory. Kurt G\u00f6del came up with a theory that says that any axiomatic system of sufficient complexity will have an inexhaustible set of conjectures that cannot be proven. So even if a theory of everything is developed there will still be an infinite number of unsolved problems in physics. Of these an infinite number we can (and perhaps will) solve and an infinite number we can't solve, ever. And we don't know which is which!  Added 9/18/2015: Frank Heile raised an intriguing issue in his comment which compels me to articulate more fully my logic train in the above so here goes: 1) The theory of everything (TOE) if developed would be a theory of Physics 2) Theories in Physics are expressed as Math 3) All Math is expressed within an axiomatic system, so either: 4) TOE will develop a new axiomatic system or 5) TOE will live within an existing axiomatic system [ex of new physics in existing axiomatic math system is  which lies in the existing system of algebra over the non-negative reals.] 6) All axiomatic systems sufficiently complex  for TOE are subject to Godel's first theorem. [Since TOE can't be less complex than current physics, whose axioms are already embedded under Godel.] 7) Thus Godel states that there are an infinite number of theorems that will not be provable or disprovable under TOE even if they are true. 8) Therefore there will be true statements under TOE which must be addressed experimentally, or through new axioms.
