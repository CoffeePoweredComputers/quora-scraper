            "answer_text": "I learned the answer in Catholic Grade School > 60 years ago. The earthly, visible realm (our observable physical universe) has 3 spatial dimensions and one time dimension. The heavenly realm co-exists with ours and has three spatial dimensions but no time and the hellish realm also co-exists with ours and has 3 spatial dimensions but no time. The remaining 11th dimension is the realm of the Creator. It doesn\u2019t make sense that the 6 dimensions outside our realm are somehow folded and not extending throughout the universe. I have no mathematical proofs or experimental evidence but neither did the religious scholars and theologians have scientific proofs or evidence that the universe has a beginning in time and has been expanding while as late as the 1950\u2019s the \u201cscientific consensus\u201d was that the universe was infinite and eternal. Einstein and most main-steam physicists discounted George Lemaitre and Hubble until Penzias and Wilson discovered the cosmic background radiation and the scientific consensus was forced to accept that the universe had a beginning from a singularity and has been expanding ever since. Scientists are speculating that space contains various metaphysical entities with dimensions at the planck length which provide for the the existence of matter and propagation of energy and gravity. I have about as much expertise in metaphysics as them so I propose that whatever entities or substance there are in our physical space, there are corresponding types of entities interspersed with ours for the two spiritual realms. These realms coexist with our 3 dimensions and the strings for entities in our realm \u201cvibrate\u201d primarily in our dimensions to manifest their physical properties but potentially \u201cvibrate\u201d in the other 7 dimensions as well. \u201cStrings\u201d in the two spiritual realms likewise \u201cvibrate\u201d primarily in their 3 dimensions but potentially vibrate in ours in a limited extent. Although a \u201cgulf\u201d exists that separates the 3 realms, the substance of the human soul seems capable of interacting with all 3 realms, at least while in a human body. Otherwise one would have to discount as false, the innumerable accounts throughout human history of angels, demons, and supernatural experiences including the vast body of accounts of supernatural cures, miracles and demonic possession. Finally, what about this proposed 11th dimension being the primary dimension for the existence of the Creator? My only evidences is this, most attendees of catholic grades schools in the 1950\u2019s or earlier probably had visits by the parish priest to occasionally teach religion class. Many students probably heard the class \u201cwise guy\u201d ask the priest \u201cHey father, if God is everywhere, is he also in hell\u201d? Answer: \u201cyes God is everywhere and not in hell\u201d.

            "answer_text": "The best way to understand dimensions is to start with smaller dimensions than three and work up very slowly so that the analogy is clear. An overage of detail is needed to eliminate confusion. Patience will pay off. Furthermore I hope to point out that a spatial version of Tarski\u2019s undefinability exists in consideration of dimensions without any reference to formal set theory. 1) Creating a space to hold things and defining the relationships. A zero dimensional object is called a point but a single dimensional \u201carray\u201d used to store it can have infinite points. The array is the actual \"dimension\" which contains the point objects. (an array in programming looks like this: arrayname[#]) Given that a point has no dimension and is not measurable, it is a bit misleading to insist that a collection of dimensionless points is somehow measurable. In fact, the relationship of the points to each other is utterly undefined until another dimension is defined. An infinite number of them could all be in the same place or they could be randomly arranged in some higher dimensional space. The point is that the dimension or array is a \"space\" which is kind of like an infinite set of containers. If a higher dimension does not exist, however, our concept of arrangement between them is something we add via imagination because of our concept of a linear arrangement of a number line that we label those boxes with, but that relationship cannot exist in a 1D reality. In a 1D reality there is no spacial relationship between points. Just like higher dimensions, our pre-conceived notions accidentally add things to lower dimensions as well. There\u2019s no collision or direction because there\u2019s no way to define a direction without something for the \u201cline\u201d to traverse. Therefore the following is visualization is misleading without higher dimensions. What it does convey is that we use sets of containers called arrays to store and label things like bits of empty space of whatever size we decide to use for a unit size.  Once the higher dimension is defined, however, (two dimensions) then the relationship of the points (places or bits of space) in that higher dimensional structure is also somewhat automatically defined by cartesian coordinate systems. Suddenly, because there is an external reference, measurability becomes more meaningful. If they were labelled in numerical order then they now exist in a line. There are also now unlimited number of possible locations along a line that a point can exist and the relationship between the points in this higher dimensional reality is numerically labelled in a two dimensional array. (arrayname[x][y]) This is to say that what we think of as lines, can now actually exist since there is some higher dimensional reference. Our labeled boxes for holding points may be labeled along x because that\u2019s what we do for cartesian coordinates, but a general line can go across both x and y axis. The habit of cartesian coordinate systems adds something that isn\u2019t really there for a 1D reality. Without that y axis, the \u201cline\u201d(or collection of bits of space) could be thought of as piled up in one place or tied in a knot and there\u2019d be no way to differentiate because the relationship is undefined. It would all be imagination without that higher dimensional reality to contain and define it.  This means that going from one dimension to two defines a real structure which, filled or not, has unlimited \"slots\" for the lower dimension. To restate it, while unlimited number of points could have existed in the single dimensional structure before the extra dimension was added to view it from, no relationship between them could be clearly defined. IE The relationships of a dimensional structure we use to keep up with things, cannot have real relationships unless there is a (somewhat hidden or intimated) higher dimensional reality to view it from. We should think of the one dimensional array as the \"space\" of one dimension and while we might think of it as an infinite line, that straight structure called a line cannot exist without the next dimension. It is arbitrary that we would usually stuff the previous single dimension into the two-dimensional array at the bottom and lay in out orthogonal to the y axis. (arrayname[x] gets put into arrayname[x][0]) Consequently, once a second dimension is added, the \"space\" of two dimensions now exists whether or not you fill it with lower dimensional objects such as points. Or same-dimensional (2-dimensional) objects such as lines. (unlimited x and unlimited y) This additional dimension now allows us the very first \"shape\", a line, but it also simultaneously allows numerous lines to exist upon different axes. A crucial digression on the borderline between dimensions: Above it looks as though I\u2019ve called a line a 2-dimensional object by mistake. A line is conventionally considered a 1-dimensional object. I find this convention to be misleading because points are called zero dimensional. This is a little like timekeeping in that the spaces between divisions can cause a little oddness. So long as one has lives 10 years and 2 seconds that lifetime can span 3 different decades. Within the conventional terminology, there is the acknowledgement that an arrangement of 0 dimensional objects is 1 dimensional but involves two dimensions. (0th and 1st) When I called a line 2-dimensional, it was not my intent to confuse, but to bring to mind the reliance upon the second dimension for a line to be in any way line-like. It is crucial to understand this borderline between dimensions and keep it in mind when attempting to grasp the real meaning of dimensions. Recapping: In the case of going from one dimension to two, simply adding one additional dimension not only defined relationships between 0th dimensional objects like points but also allowed for relationships between conventional two dimensional objects like triangles and one dimensional arrays (lines) can now be curved and have an additional relationship to themselves. We gained not only lines but other shapes such as triangles etc. This idea of additional new relationships between different parts of a line is an important concept moving forward. Let\u2019s simplify for a moment and just consider dimensions without all the requirements and dependencies and in-between things. If we intend to extend from dimension to dimension in a way that makes sense, then we can use our first concept of the first dimensional space as an infinite number of points leading to an infinite length straight line as one dimensional space to see that an infinite stack of these lines creates the second dimensional space. EG: Think of making a line along the very bottom of a page from tiny points and knowing you can do this forever on a page that has no side edge. Now think of making the next line on top of this one and the next on top of that etc. You know you can keep doing this forever and you have now described an infinite plane or two dimensions. (bear with me, while obvious, you'll want to hold this idea in your head for going from the third dimension to the fourth) This infinite stack which is called two dimensions can now also be stacked. Though two-dimensional space is an infinite plane, sometimes it's easier to conceive of as a sheet of paper. With this concept it becomes easy to think of a stack of paper that can be infinite. We now have infinite points stacked into an infinite line for the first dimension, infinite lines stacked into an infinite sheet for the second dimension, infinite sheets stacked into an infinite cube for the third dimension. (and you're seeing where this is going) What we must now realize is, that upon adding a second dimension, it became easier of us to think of a whole universe that is 2-dimensional. An infinite plane is a two dimensional universe and the infinite cube is a 3-dimensional universe.  Just like when we added the second dimension we created a new form of relationship between one-dimensional objects, upon adding a third dimension we have created a new form of relationships between two dimensional objects. Previously with only one dimension we had only one line constrained to be in a stack but then with the second dimension there could be multiple lines with multiple relationships. When there were only two dimensions there was only a single sheet constrained to be in a plane. Upon adding a third dimension multiple sheets could exist with not only relationships to each other but with relationships to themselves. IE A sheet not only has a rotational orientation but it can now be curved back upon itself.  If we now add a fourth dimension we have created a space with room for infinite three dimensional universes. Consequently we have now also created new relationships between these three dimensional universes such that they can have an orientation and additional relationship to each other. They can now be curved back upon themselves. This idea of creating an infinite set of sets (adding another dimension) continuously allows new types of relationships to appear (or be defined) with each additional dimension added. An additional dimension allows a set to be bent back upon itself. Simplifying the 4th dimension. Given that time is conjoined with space in special relativity, there are some strange conventions that have to be employed to represent rearrangements of the 4th dimension, so lets just start with collapsing spatial dimensions. We can think of a 2D plane at a sheet of paper with it\u2019s various points and shapes being swept down to the bottom of the page and squashed flat along the bottom line and we\u2019ve compressed 2D into 1D. We can think of doing this for a whole stack of papers and we\u2019ve compressed 3D into 2D. Now it is crucial to note that when we think of a 3D universe we are thinking of a single moment in time and therefore the universe we think of is already 4D. A 3D array can only hold the information for one single moment of time and would require a 4th dimension to store all the copies of the universe that exist moment after moment. So, now with our 3D universe compressed to a sheet, we can stack these sheets together to represent a 4D universe. Just like a sheet shape within a 3D plane is not constrained to one axis, we can now define a moment as a slice through that 4D (multiple compressed 3D) universe. So far this is all pretty easy until we add relativity.  Now, however, upon adding relativity there is a requirement of a 5th dimension. This is not apparent in the video above, but before relativity the universe was already 4D. A single moment was 3D and there were multiple moments. Upon adding relativity, however, a single moment is fundamentally 4D. One cannot speak about space without mentioning time. Location is dependent upon time. What this means for the discussion in the video above is that the \u201cloaf\u201d of spacetime they show is only one possible configuration of all the moments. Modern interpretations of relativity state that there is no preferred frame of reference therefore entirely different versions of that loaf are equally valid as the one presented. When we consider the alien on the bike and the man on the park bench we think of them as definitely directly across spacetime from each other. This relationship, however, cannot be established since another frame\u2019s idea of simultaneous would place them at an angle to one another across the loaf in one direction while another would place them at the opposite angle. That is to say, there are multiple valid arrangements of the loaf such that if we consider forward time to be x, in one case the alien starts out in front of the man on the bench (further along x) and in another valid arrangement, the man on the bench is in front. So if we try to think of being simultaneous with another location\u2019s future, how do we determine where the starting point to move forward from is? The relationship is undefined. If there is no singular true and valid arrangement we are actually slicing from then another dimension is required to store all the various but valid alternative configurations of our 4D loaf of the universe. To cut across a 4D universe a 5th dimension must be added just like to have a line, a second dimension must be added. Godel and mutual dependencies. This problem above is an expression of Godel incompleteness and Tarski\u2019s undefinability in yet another form. There are many structures such as lines that we do not think of as actually a comparison or interaction between things and we therefore lose sight of the need for another \u201cthing\u201d to compare or interact with. Imagine if there was nothing in the universe but two people. Each can say of the other \u201cyou are above me\u201d and they might both be considered correct or incorrect because the answer is undefined without an external reference. What we think of as a river cannot exist if we remove the water. That\u2019s just a dry depression. It cannot exist as water alone. That could be a cloud or an ocean. It is only by the interaction of the water and the depression that a river arises. There are many instances in which we metaphorically attempt to keep the concept of a river while removing one of the components it is made of. This leads to various problems in logic and attempts to make judgement about things which are undefined. ",
