            "answer_text": "Hard water contains calcium and magnesium salts. When you add soap into hard water, soap which is a sodium salt react with the magnesium and calcium ions. The product will be a calcium soap or magnesium soap. These are insoluble in water and separate as scum.. since they are insoluble, they do not help in the cleaning. So the soap you added will first react with the metal ions in water and then start to dissolve and give a lather. This happens only with a soap. Detergents does not undergo the reaction. And detergents sometimes contain a water softening agent to aid the washing. ",
