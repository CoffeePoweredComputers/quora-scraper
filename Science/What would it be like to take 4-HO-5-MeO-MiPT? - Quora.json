            "answer_text": "Nobody knows. There is no record of this substance ever being consumed by a human. The synthesis would be extraordinarily difficult. In fact, the easiest way to produce this chemical would be through utilization of the enzymatic processes that occur in Psilocybe mushrooms. If one were to synthesize 5-MeO-MiPT and mix a large amount of it into the substrate used to grow Psilocybe mushrooms, the chemical would be hydroxylated at the fourth position by enzymes in the mushrooms, producing 4-HO-5-MeO-MiPT. It would be very unstable, however, so the mushrooms would need to be immediately dried and pulverized, and the 4-HO-5-MeO-MiPT would need to be extracted and converted to a relatively stable salt formulation, probably with fumaric acid. Even then, the substance would not last for more than a few weeks. The best option to keep this chemical long-term would be remove the polar hydrogen by converting the fourth position substitution into a calcium salt, which should actually result in a stable final product of 4-CaO-5-MeO-MiPT Fumarate.
