            "answer_text": "It is neither, mostly. Nuclear energy uses natural resources in the process of creating heat energy. The latter is then used to heat water to create steam which turns electrical generators to produce electricity. There are two types of nuclear energy: fission and fusion. Fission, which is currently available commercially, uses radioactive elements (such as certain isotopes of uranium or plutonium) to create the initial heat. In the process, the fissile material is consumed (converted into other elements with less radioactivity) and must be replenished. However, there are nuclear fission reactors, which can actually create usable elements with sufficient radioactivity to be used in new fission reactions to create more heat energy. These are called breeder reactors. They use uranium or thorium to create the heat. In the process they actually create more highly radioactive isotopes than they consume. Nevertheless, the starting materials are consumed, so they must be replenished and are, therefore, not continuously renewable. Breeder reactors also pose several very difficult technical hurdles, are much more expensive to build, have more ardent political/environmentalist opponents, and pose significant problems with handling the highly radioactive elements produced, much of which is weapons-grade. Currently most countries consider breeder reactors commercially non-viable. Fusion reactor energy is currently only experimental and has not been sustained for more than a minute or so. Some fusion researchers are claiming it may be commercially available by 2030 or so, but many others consider that to be highly optimistic. Fusion reactors also use certain elements (primarily the hydrogen isotopes, deuterium and tritium), which are consumed in the fusion process and must be replenished. However, these isotopes can be obtained in abundance from water and lithium, respectively, both of which are in huge supply. Nonetheless, the isotopes are not renewable, so fusion cannot be considered a renewable energy source. While most fusion reactors involve the same heat energy to produce steam to turn electrical generators, there is one type of fusion reactor which creates electricity directly from the fusion process. It also consumes the reaction isotopes so is not a renewable energy source either. Even with various technical difficulties, nuclear energy is thought to be the only viable path to fossil-fuel independence by many scientists, including the \u201cgodfather\u201d of the unproven hypothesis of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming, Dr. James Hansen: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/nuclear-power-paves-the-only-viable-path-forward-on-climate-change ",

We have reached the stage now Minnie where we simply can not afford to continue burning fossil fuels, if we want the human race to survive. The economy, corporatism & the continued city lifestyles should not be a priority. Society needs to change now, we need to stop burning fossil fuels now. The chaos created by doing this will be nothing to the chaos, death & destruction caused by the collapse of society if we do not act NOW.'Uninhabitable hell': Climate change and disease threaten millions  Welcome to the Anthropocene Age.
