            "answer_text": "I assume that your question is about the depth at which the magma is generated (it`s called lava only once it reaches the Earth`s surfae): there is no single answer, because the tectonic settings of active volcanoes show interesting variations. Many basaltic magma chambers under active volcanoes are detected in a range of 1\u20135 km depth, but some are thought to be recharged from greater depths. These magma source depths are commonly poorly known, even for frequently erupting volcanoes such as Hekla in Iceland and Etna in Italy. In In Becerril, L., Galindo, I., Gudmundsson, A., and Morales, J. M. (2013) Depth of origin of magma in eruptions. (Sci. Rep.3:2762) scientists showed that the length-thickness ratios of feeder dykes could be used to estimate the depth to the source of a magma chamber, and estimated that the magma that feeds volcanism in the Canary Islands originates by melting at 11\u201315 km depth below the ocean crust:  If you are asking how deep can magma form and still feed volcanic activity, this is still debated: Magma in Earth's Mantle Forms Deeper Than Once Thought. Here is a cartoon from a 2016 review article:  \u2026 , explaining that the stress field in a given area is one of the variables that may result in melting occurring at different depths.  ",

            "answer_text": "The experts say they go really deep but according to gravity law lava being less dense than whatever is deeper it will float on top just like water floats on denser rock below. The experts are wrong again and volcanoes are only found very near the surface within 100km of the atmosphere anyway. They simply cannot have deep roots as is assumed in every model in every book on the topic. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Charlie, . . . Not sure what your question really is. . . . Earth is formed on tectonic plates of rock, floating on top of the molten centre of Earth, which goes right down to close to the centre of the earth. . The very centre, where gravity and pressure is so very high, might be very, very hot solid material.. . . . . But the vast majority of planet Earth is molten magma, with just relatively thin solid crust floating on top of that molten magma or lava.. . So the literal answer to your question is about three thousands of miles deep. ",
