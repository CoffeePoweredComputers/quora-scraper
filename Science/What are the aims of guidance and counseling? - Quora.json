There are so many ways people need and can be assisted to achieve a more satisfying life. First and foremost is understanding that person\u2019s idea of what they think they need. That is accomplished in an assessment. School guidance counselors have access to students records, those include information on behavior and grades. When they have contact with the child they evaluate how what the paper works says lines up with what they observe. Depending on what the child comes to them for, the guidance counselor works with them to help them figure out an acceptable way to achieve their desire. Sometimes they suggest referrals for therapy counseling. Very seldom is the aim to just tell the child what to do and how to do it. Therapy counseling works more in depth with the client. After long and short term goals are collaboratively established. Clients are usually seen weekly. When goals are reached, new goals can be established if needed. Therapist should not tell clients, this is what is wrong with you, and this is how you can fix it. By talking about their lives, they are lead into an understanding of what they want and why they are not getting it. Coping skills are learned, alternative perspective are discussed. Evaluations of their efforts, and many other things different individuals might need are explored. The aim is to get the child to understand himself and to make good choices, and to be able to change them when they don\u2019t work. Self reflection, evaluation, and planning.

Therefore, at the acknowledged risk of complicating the water, I\u2019m providing my own opinion of the two most important concepts of guidance and counseling. It\u2019s not about you, the therapist. It\u2019s about the client. The client is coming to you because of their stuff. Their stuff, whatever it is, may generate some thoughts and feelings inside of you. If you\u2019re going to do a good job as a therapist/counselor, you\u2019ll need to know yourself well enough to be able to manage your reactivity to the things you\u2019ll hear in session.You don\u2019t get to give advice.

It helps them solve problems, maybe as an example,a guidance counselor may help someone choose whatever classes they should take. They also help children or adults in difficult situations talk out their problems. If someone is acting out bad behavior, guidance counselor might try to figure out why. They also make theirselves available to an abused child, or to someone that has been effected by domestic,substance, or physical abuse. They can also provide resources for people who need financial assistance. They can also identify someone who needs further counseling, and or refer them to someone that can further evaluate them. Basically they help with generalized problems that do not require a PhD, or medical attention. Nevertheless they can identify a problem that may need a more extended solution. ",
