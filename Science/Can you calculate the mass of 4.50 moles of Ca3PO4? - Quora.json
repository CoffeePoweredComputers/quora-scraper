            "answer_text": "I can easily work out the molar mass of Ca3PO4 - but I do not see any reason to do this. There is no such compound If you want the molar mass of tricalcium phosphate , then the correct formula is Ca3(PO4)2 . For purposes of calculating the molar mass it is easier to write: Ca3P2O8 Ca = 40.078g/mol *3 = 120.234g P = 30.974g/mol *2 = 61.948g O = 15.999g/mol *8 = 127.992g Total = 310.174g/mol Mass of 4.5 mol = 310.174g/mol *4.5mol = 1395.783g ",

            "answer_text": "For all such type of questions we firstly calculate the mass of 1mole of compound, then we proceed for further calculation. Mass of 1mole of Ca3PO4=3(atomic mass of Ca)+atomic mass of P +4(atomic mass of O)=3(40)+31+4(16)=120+31+64=215g(since i have taken 1mole of compound i;e why i have written mass in grams, would I have taken as 1molecule then mass would have been in amu.) So mass of 4.5moles of Ca3PO4 is 4.5\u00d7215=967.5g ",
