            "answer_text": "As a practical matter, falsifiability really is not very important or useful. First, note that falsifiability is very rarely analyzed in formal scientific publications. You can\u2019t expect to find a \u2018falsifiability\u2019 section in a typical paper published in any major science journal. Falsifiability, as a topic, is unlikely to be taught in any university science class outside of a philosophy department. You likely can be a successful science practitioner, even if you have never even heard of the concept. Furthermore, falsifiability is more an attribute of a practitioner than of a scientific proposition, per se. A blind person will have a different sense of falsifiability than will someone with eyesight. It is possible that some people have magical, transcendent abilities that allow them to discern truths about reality. Unfortunately, you must have such abilities to judge them. Also, the scope of the natural world for you might not be static; your natural world, and hence, your judgments of falsifiability can potentially change. Your inability, in principle, to falsify any particular proposition may just be due to impatience or laziness on your part. Also note that falsifiability is not a matter of degree; i.e, a proposition is either falsifiable, or it is not. This lack of nuance means that judging closeness, or potential for improvement, is impaired. Most fundamentally, science is not about assessing \u2018truth value\u2019; instead, it is a practical tool for creating reliable models for the prediction and control of the natural world. Proposed pseudoscientific models are naturally winnowed out over time by their failure to provide differentiated predictions, not by some pious falsifiability analysis. Falsifiability seems more like a quasi-religious tenet than a practical tool. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that falsifiability shouldn't be a defining criterion of science, it's just a bloody good idea, among others. To the extent that it is in practice a defining criterion of science, that's just a damning and pathetic indictment of the competition. That's because, to the extent a theory is unfalsifiable, it could easily be wrong without your noticing. Since error tends to be contagious in large systems of ideas, it's prudent to place a disproportionately high priority on keeping error out (at the anticipated expense of occasionally missing a nugget of truth). Therefore, to the extent an idea is unfalsifiable, it's prudent to assume that it is wrong, and you haven't noticed. Falsifiability of course can't be the be-all-and-end-all because we're finite and fallible creatures and everything we do is subject to the Problem of induction. No matter how reliable a trend has been in the past, it could in principle go wrong tomorrow, and it's unfalsifiable regarding tomorrow today. At the same time, induction is often reliable enough to bet your life on, and there's a difference between doing it as well as possible in the face of fundamental limitations, and doing it sloppily, with willful disregard of avoidable sources of error. Against that background, I think Kuhn needs to be read as a warning. Yes, in principle, any theory can be saved from adverse results by post-hoc excuses, and that's particularly easy for the large, complex theories that tend to be the basis of paradigms, or the large complicated experiments that tend to be needed to test them. But to the extent that's business as usual, you might as well pack up and go home. If you really think that you need to be making a excuse for a theory to defend it from apparent falsification (and hey, sometimes experiments are botched, and sometimes theories are salvageably close and need modifications rather than tossing out), then you need to worry about the falsifiability of your excuses. If your excuse is that the frooblewhatsit wasn't plugged in, you'd jolly well better be thinking in terms of looking for power cords lying on the floor and other signs that something had been unplugged. If your excuse is that momentum wasn't conserved because there was an invisible particle emitted (the way the neutrino was first suspected), you'd jolly well better thinking of how to detect that particle, and you'd jolly well better keep a mental question mark over that result until you have more info.

            "answer_text": "Absolutely.  Karl Popper was a philosopher and Thomas Kuhn was more of a historian, and they really aren't talking about the same aspects of science.  Most scientists are neither, but that's because they are scientists. Not being philosophers and historians does not prevent them form doing great work as scientists. This problem is, quite literally, beneath most scientists and most science, but to answer how science works, there is no better question. This question is about the source of scientific viability itself and falsifiability is absolutely the defining criterion of science. Here is a perfect illustration of falsifiability. We all have some form of identification. An ID is treated as legal hard evidence for who a person is. This ID must be falsifiable. That is the only reason why it works as it does. What this means is, there must exist the possibility that the ID is fake, for the real ID to hold any empirical meaning. If IDs were unfalsifiable that would imply fake and real IDs are indistinguishable. What then? All IDs would be imaginary, and they would all be useless! So just as falsifiability acts here as a defining criterion of what makes an ID an ID, the same mechanism is used to sustain ALL OF SCIENCE. In a nutshell: For something to be real, there must exist the possibility that it is fake. And it's realness must be experimentally verifiable. That UV light they use at the airport is such an experiment. All scientific statements about nature are falsifiable. But just as we don't need real fake IDs to make real IDs real, false only needs to be possible for a statement to be scientific. Now, after observation, if we can correlate either TRUE or FALSE with something that actually happened, then the power of the experiment transcends to the statements of that experiment. Just as an ID becomes real identification, any statement can become a statement of reality. And for the first time we can juggle reality with just words. With science, we can distinguish a conversation about what is real from one that is not. Falsifiability is the defining criterion for our ability to make this distinction. To borrow an example from another answer, \"Everyone must eventually die\" is a falsifiable statement. One must distinguish between unobtainable falsifying evidence (the impossible falsifying experiment) versus the falsifiability of a statement. The latter is absolutely the defining criterion of science. Our inability to perform certain tests is the defining criterion of the limits of science and of the scientist. There are many such examples, but all this shows is our limits, and it isn't even a surprise. Ya, we have limits. It's what real scientists fight every single day! To begin any scientific conversation, falsifiability is an absolute prerequisite, and it's all one needs to begin their science. This is just how science works. But then why do so many scientists seem so unfamiliar or uninterested when it comes to falsifiability? They can take it for granted. Scientists only talk about what is real, and when real is ubiquitous, falsifiability is a given. Like air, what is everywhere is good as invisible and irrelevant. Most science involves continuing a conversation handed down to them. To this end, knowledge of falsifiability is completely redundant. And the only relevant definition of falsifiability, for those that wield it, is that of experimentation. But this trend still does not negate the mechanics of how science works and the nature of falsifiable statements pre-experiment. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer: if you look at the history of science, you will often find scientists working to support hypotheses, not falsify them, and even 'great' scientists like Newton and Copernicus ignored evidence that would seem to 'falsify' their theories. So really, falsification has not historically been a major goal in science; nevertheless, falsifiability remains an important heuristic tool for distinguishing real science from various other sorts of things masquerading as scientific claims. The (very) long answer: Kuhn was more of a historian, Popper more a philosopher; the two approaches aren't mutually exclusive. Popper wasn't by any stretch ignorant of all the historical examples of scientists working to confirm rather than falsify their hypotheses - in a way this is what Kuhn referred to as 'normal science,' even though I'd say it's true throughout the history of science. This isn't necessarily a problem for his account. In the first place, Popper was offering a normative principle, not a descriptive one - if past 'natural philosophers' didn't adhere to it, however much we may respect their contributions, then perhaps they simply weren't scientists. But moreover, the idea is that scientific claims must in principle be open to falsification, not that scientists must actively try to undermine their own hypotheses. The point, on Popper's account, is that scientists make risky predictions, and if scientific these predictions can be shown false - they can't be 'proved' true like mathematical propositions, but if they're truly scientific claims one must be able to specify conditions under which they'd be refuted. That's falsifiability, and for Popper it is indeed the defining criterion of science. Kuhn, for his part, simply points out that scientists usually work within a community around certain research problems, trying to establish truthful hypotheses rather than disprove things.  The classic case study for these kinds of questions is the transition between Newtonian and relativistic physics. More specifically, the precession of Mercury's orbit gives some good examples of the strengths and weaknesses of falsifiability as a concept. What makes Newton's approach such a paradigm of scientific reasoning is that it sets out universal principles in the form of equations that allow us to predict how all sorts of different physical bodies will behave, to varying degrees of precision. It makes successful predictions for just about all medium-sized physical systems, and for many years scientists were hard-pressed to come up with any case where it proved false. In the mid-1800s, though, astronomers realized that Mercury's observed behaviour didn't quite match what Newton's theory would predict. A minor variance, but this is physics - it was certainly a large enough difference from the expected value that it was hard to explain it away through measurement error.  At points like these, scientists find themselves at a crossroads. Do they throw up their hands and say that the theory of Newton is false, having proved itself so accurate over the centuries? Or do they try to rationalize the anomaly in some way and thus continue to hold that the theory is in fact quite sound? Obviously Newton's paradigm is right so often that most astronomers opted for the latter, while probably none simply decided that it was 'falsified.' But the important thing is that some continued investigating anomalies like the precession of Mercury with an open mind. This eventually led to new theories, culminating in Einstein's, which did successfully account for the phenomena that were anomalous under the old theory, while also accounting for the correctness of Newtonian dynamics in many contexts.   This is the kind of transition that Kuhn was so interested in, and his paradigm-shift theory does account well for this example at least (it was his favourite); more recent writers like Peter Galison have argued that his model of a 'fractured' history of science is quite right in some ways, but overstates the case for 'incommensurability' of different paradigms. But it's important to remember this is a bit beside the point from a Popperian perspective. It's not about what scientists have historically done, but how, philosophically, we can demarcate true science from the mere semblance thereof. Where Kuhn is interested in transitions within science like the one from Newton to Einstein, Popper is more interested in broader shifts from quasi-mystical practices to more scientific ones, as from astrology to astronomy or alchemy to chemistry. In that context, the role of falsifiability in defining science is clearer. It's especially clear if we compare present-day astronomy to present-day astrology: the science of astronomy makes definite predictions about how objects in space will behave based on empirical observations, while astrology, though ideally based on the same accurate observations, isn't a science precisely because of how vague and non-falsifiable its predictions tend to be. \"Your life will turn a corner soon\" or \"today is a great day to make a new friend\" clearly differ in terms of falsifiability from, say, \"comet x will pass through the solar system between y dates on trajectory z.\"  This makes the point, hopefully, but doesn't really do justice to astrology, even on Popper's terms: astrology has been around for thousands of years as the study of celestial bodies, and Popper's view was that astronomy grew out of astrology as it progressively set aside its mystical, non-falsifiable aspects (predicting our futures based on the observations), in favour of the falsifiable, empirical stuff (predicting what the celestial bodies will do based on a set of laws).  But astrologers keep on making their silly claims, and the principle of falsifiability is good medicine for them and their ilk. It might not capture all the nuances of scientific practice, and there may be times when scientists need to ignore it, but it helps to distinguish real science from pseudoscience. Things like astrology, creationism/intelligent design, and homeopathy generally differ from science either in that they ignore evidence which falsifies their claims, or their claims aren't falsifiable to begin with. Lack of falsifiability is perhaps most glaring in the case of 'Young-Earth' creationism, which responds to geological evidence by arguing that God carefully placed all those strata 6,000 years ago in a way that only seems to suggest that all life evolved from a common ancestor over millions and millions of years. Good trick, God! It certainly could be thus. Same goes for claims that homeopathy works by some totally unobservable magic resonance. There is no way we can decisively rule these claims out by science, but they are not scientific precisely because they're not falsifiable by empirical evidence. In this and plenty of other cases, the principle of falsifiability is a useful critical tool, one which does indeed help us define science in contradistinction to other sorts of knowledge-claims; it's simply not, and was never intended to be, a descriptive account of how things have always worked in the history of science.  (As a counterpoint to the creationism example, Popper infamously also criticized certain formulations of Darwinian natural selection as lacking falsifiability - ie, survival of the fittest, and the fittest are those who survive! Though right enough for naive formulations like that, I think Popper was wrong on this, and in any case it's beyond the scope of this question.) ",

            "answer_text": "Falsifiability is the ability of a theory to make empirical predictions that can be falsified when tested against empirical measurements. If a theory does not do this, then it either needs to be refined so that it does, or there is good reason to disqualify it as being considered a theory of empirical science. So, yes, falsifiability is a necessary condition for a theory to satisfy the definition of empirical science. It is useful in demarcating science from non-science. (See my answer to How do we differentiate scientific knowledge from other types of knowledge?) Falsifiability only means that any theory, to be considered scientific, must be capable of being empirically falsified in principle. It does not mean that any scientific theory that has made a single prediction inconsistent with one observation must or should be rejected at once as false. That is not its meaning, and is not how science works. For example, that would not allow for the fact that there may have been a mistake with the observation. It also could be that an error was made calculating the prediction from the theory, or a minor auxiliary assumption was in error rather than the theory in its main assumptions.

            "answer_text": "One way to understand falsifiability is to start with the related logical positivist idea that statements only have meaning as claims about what you would find if you went and looked.  So \"metaphysical\" claims about the number of angels dancing on the head of a pin should be taken as literally meaningless if there is no way to see angels.Falsifiability means that you are claiming something that could turn out to be wrong, and you would have to change your mind.  It can be a handy tool for recognizing weak science, pseudoscience, or non-science.  People who can't be proven wrong are making claims that in an important way don't say much.   Scientific hypotheses ought to be falsifiable--that's a big part of what experiments are about, checking to see if you are wrong.  A scientific *theory* is really a way of thinking, a bunch of related hypotheses and definitions that form a fuzzy and evolving whole.  Nobody gave up on our theories of physics when it turned out that most stuff is \"dark matter\" and there is more \"dark energy\" than there is \"stuff,\" though they certainly want to figure out how these surprises fit with what we already know.  Nobody gave up on evolution when they found genes in the wrong phyla or Lamarckian inheritance, they looked for explanations and started incorporating horizontal gene transfer and epigenetics into the theory.  Which is ok, because scientific theories are works in progress, and one way they progress is by replacing incorrect hypotheses. So Popper was right that falsification is a useful tool for recognizing ideas we want to take seriously but it is easy to exaggerate exactly what a given fact can falsify.  And Kuhn was right that you often can't make scientists give up their theories just because they don't work perfectly, but that is not obviously a bad thing.  The line between fixing an existing theory and adopting a new one can be fuzzy, as when astrology \"led to\" astronomy and alchemy to chemistry.  Is that replacement or refinement?  Or is \"that\" a metaphysical question? ",
