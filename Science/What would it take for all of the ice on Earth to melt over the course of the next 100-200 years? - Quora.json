Engineer a period of runaway global warming leading to a return of Cretaceous conditions. That ought to do it. We know from sediment cores that there was rain forest in Antarctica during the Cretaceous when the temperatures were around 8 degrees higher than preIndustrial averages. How to go about doing that, easy, in fact we are doing that right now, we cannot help it because of our addiction to fossil fuels. We are raising global mean temperatures at around 2 degrees per century right now, and when you model in future feedback mechanisms that would rise to 3 degrees per century. Our confidence in the models decreases the higher the temperatures get and the further into the future, but as a rough estimate you\u2019d be looking at somewhere around 200 - 250 years for a complete melting of the cryosphere on our current track. This would raise sea levels around 80 metres, drowning all the worlds coastal cities, hence the drive to decarbonise our economies to avert the worst outcomes. ",
