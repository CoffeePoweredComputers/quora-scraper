            "answer_text": "Ch4 is in sp3-hybridisation. It's structure is tetrahedral. So since CH4 has four H's (four groups) on its central carbon atom, it's sp3 hybridized and takes a tetrahedral shape. ... That's three different groups - a double bond counts as filling up one \u201cslot\u201d because it uses two pairs of electrons - so the structure here is trigonal planar and the central carbon is sp3 hybridized.

            "answer_text": "It is quite simple and one of the best examples, mentioned in textbooks when dealing with hybridisation, is this methane. The hybridization at carbon is sp3 with all the four orbitals being indistinguishable, single-electron-occupied and degenerate with an internal mutual angle of about 129 deg., while lines joining their tips defining a regular tetrahedron. The 4 hydrogen atoms make a covalent overlapping with their respective 1s orbital. The CH4 moleculae aslo, hence has a structure of regular tetrahedron. ",
