This star is almost at the limit of how large a star can be (explained in a further wiki article which the above links to), so no, there can\u2019t be a single star large enough to contain the entire solar system.

            "answer_text": "VY Canis Major is the largest we\u2019ve found so far and would be large enough to encompass Saturn (probably). So no, not even close to the whole solar system seeing as there appears to be at least one other large planet outside the Kuiper belt which we haven\u2019t even identified yet, but if true would mean that the orbit of Saturn is only about a half of the solar system (or less). This doesn\u2019t mean there absolutely couldn\u2019t be a bigger star, just we haven\u2019t found it yet. Interestingly, a photon would take about 6 hours to travel around VY Canis Major, whereas for our sun it\u2019s only about 15 seconds. It is BIG! ",
