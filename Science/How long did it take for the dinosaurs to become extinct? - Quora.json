            "answer_text": "\u201cHow long did it take for the dinosaurs to become extinct?\u201d The same as for mammals, amphibians, reptiles and fish. Some of all of those groups survived. Dinosaurs are not extinct and their diversity is probably greater now than at any time during the Cretaceous. Birds are the surviving dinosaurs. What happened with the K-T transition event was that the megafauna were wiped out. Some species possibly within days, some for longer but then lost out to competition. As far as we know, the megafauna of the time were mostly dinosaurs and some reptiles such as crocodilians and pterosaurs. Mammals don\u2019t appear to have grown large until somewhat later. A few of the smallest dinosaurs were amongst the survivors along with the smallest mammals, reptiles and amphibians, as well as insects that had not grown very big anyway. Not a lot of any kinds of animals survived. In rough terms we can think of as many species of dinosaurs as of mammals having survived. The mammals had not specialised much at that point so they were fairly adaptable. The specialised dinosaurs will have died out very quickly and those that survived were the ones that could use whatever food they found without being too fussy whether it was animal or vegetable, alive or dead. The kinds of mammals that did survive were better suited to growing to large sizes when circumstances allowed later than the surviving dinosaurs were. There have been some large birds, including the moa of New Zealand, but they have not been on the scale of the biggest mammal. Bear in mind, though, that individual size is not the best measure of how important a species is in its environment. ",

            "answer_text": "I expect the aftermath of the impact event finished off the non avian dinosaurs within a few generations at most. Consider that the entire pre-impact food chain was globally destroyed. Individuals that survived would have trouble enough feeding themselves with scarcely any plants to browse and hardly any living prey. The added difficulty of reproducing and caring for young would be overwhelming. Most offspring would perish before maturity, and most parents would perish before raising their offspring to maturity. The longer a species took to mature to reproductive and parenting age, the greater the probability it would suffer severe die off and extinction. Even scavengers would run out of rotting meat. There were likely pockets of persistent populations, but it is possible that the very recovery of the earth lead to their demise. The plants that pioneer a devastated landscape are not the plants that comprised a stable ecology. The selective pressures would be changed drastically, and pockets of survivors would fail in competition with other survivors better equipped for the new world arising. Why did the bird lineage survive? Perhaps because of their short lifespans and intense reproductive cycle, conducive to natural selection of adaptive change. Perhaps because of their relative mobility and opportunism. It should be noted that although the bird lineage survived and thrived subsequently, it is not inconsistent that a staggering number of pre-impact bird species likely didn\u2019t make it. It is the lineage that squeaked through, not entire populations. There are no validated fossil remains of non-avian dinosaurs above the Iridium layer marking the impact event. There is no evidence within a timespan of a million years (only a few feet stratigraphically) that any non-avian dinosaur species continued past the K-Pg boundary. Anyone who found such evidence and validated it beyond question would achieve lasting fame in paleontology, so there is a lot of incentive\u2014but no results. ",
