            "answer_text": "The fundamental light particle, better known as the photon is a carrier of information across space-time symmetry. Think of a paper boat traveling down a stream, collecting an endless series of snapshots of its surroundings. Now imagine that this stream is going down a mountain. At the bottom of which a person waits to collect those images. Now the real question that will boil a triple PhD\u2019s brain is \u201cWill you be able to determine the elevation of those images from the bottom of the mountain?\u201d The answer is no, you will not. This is a perfect explanation of space-time symmetry in regard to observation, using the z-axis as a reference to time passage rates. A particle may not report on time based factors of a frame it is not in. Lest we not forget that all observation is local observation only. Leading to the following mechanics. You know the phrase \u201cAll roads lead to rome.\u201d? Well, say hello to rome.            I would be remiss if i let this last diagram be displayed without a explanation. Note that this diagram depicts a traveler traveling at non-relativistic velocities. Figures in blue and grey are distances as seen from earth. Values in green are distances as seen by the observer. For the purpose of this diagram the galactic centre would be over 4000% influence, Earth is 100% as the gravitational baseline and 0% could only exist in the voids between galaxies or superclusters if at all. People seem to really be having a problem understanding, time is distance. I wonder how likely william of ockham would find spatial expansion now? I should note that my research has spanned three decades so far and is the direct result of zero funding. Imagine what i could do with a few bucks and direct access to realtime deep space observations. =) It is clear that our species suffers from a drastic misuse of global resources. ",

            "answer_text": "If a traveller travels from a planet A to another planet B (A being the earth and B being distance d apart and stationary relative to earth) with a velocity v, the time, as measured by an observer stationary with respect to the earth ( call it \u2018earth time\u2019 or ET) will be d/v. But the wristwatch time ( called thr Proper Time) of the traveller will be less by a factor (square root of {1\u2014v exp2/ c exp 2). Let us call this ratio r. Then the Proper Time (TT) of the traveller is vr. ET>TT From the point of you of the traveller, ET runs slower and vice versa. Both earth time and traveller\u2019s time run normally with respect to earthbound observer and the traveller respectively. But when they look at each other\u2019s clock, they both appear dilated by a factor r. If v comes closer and closer to c, r will become smaller and smaller and the TT (of the traveller) as observed by earthbound observer will be smaller and smaller as compared to ET (which will appear to run normally for an earthbound observer.) Similarly, for the traveller, the TT will continue to tick at normal speed. When v=c (which is impossible, but suppose that for the sake of argument), r =0 and so is TT. The time of travel from A to B as measured on the earth is d/c, but as measured by the traveller (the photon), it is 0. Thus, from the perspective of the photon, all distances in the infinite universe are covered in 0 time. But there is no reason to suppose that photon\u2019s own wristwatch stops. The clock showing Proper Time must keep running at the normal speed. For the photon, the entire universe is covered in 0 time, but what happens in the next instant, no one can say. Where is the photon ( in its own perspective) after it has covered the entire universe instantaneously? Surely not in the same universe. Does it make sense? But neither does the thought of an observer travelling with velocity of light! ",

            "answer_text": "No, light does not travel through time only its clocks ticks down much slower and time delays for it with respect to the observer but for the light particles which are photons time remains constant, and nothing travels time at high speed only its time slows down for the observer , but for the thing which is travelling time remains constant. Hope this helps follow for more such answes\u2026.. ",
