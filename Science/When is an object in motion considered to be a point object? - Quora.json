            "answer_text": "There is no general rule and it depends on what you are interested in. Just to make an example, consider the earth in its movement around the sun. For this purpose, the earth can be approximated as a point. In fact if you consider that the diameter of the earth is 12 and the distance sun earth is 8 light-minute, i.e. 8 you can easily understand why. If, though, you consider the interaction earth moon, then things don\u2019t go this way. You must consider both the earth and the moon as 3D objects as their geometrical dimensions are much more similar. ",

            "answer_text": "An object in motion is considered to be a point object or particle when the size or dimensions of the object are not taken into consideration to analyse its motion. For instance, if we want to calculate how long will it take for a car that moves at certain velocity, to travel from A to B. In this case the size of the car is irrelevant for us to be able to calculate its motion. Regardless of the size of the object, it is just considered as a point with mass. As a result a force acting on it can also produce an acceleration. ",
