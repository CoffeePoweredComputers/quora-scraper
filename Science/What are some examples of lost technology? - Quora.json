            "answer_text": "Everyone likes to look at technology lost over hundreds of years, but we can lose it over dozens, as well. Your Miata is using the wrong tires, according to Mazda and Bridgestone. In 1990 Miata was a watershed in reinventing the roadster market, and the designers specifically engineered a set of tires to run on the car. The Bridgestone SF-325 was one of three tires developed in the late 1980s specifically for Miata (Dunlop and Yokohama produced the other variants). The tread pattern aped that of earlier radials, like the Dunlop SP Formula, fitted to classic European sports cars. The engineering brief prioritized predictability over maximum grip. The original tire ultimately went out of production in favor of more conventional tires until 2016 when Mazda embarked on a faithful restoration of the original. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the same compound as we had for the original tires, nor the same tread. We didn\u2019t have any of those,\u201d said Ikeda. All Bridgestone had to work from was a single Miata on SF-325s loaned from the Mazda museum, and their memories. \u201cI, Ikeda, and Kasahara-san from Mazda, were actually the original real members who worked on the development of the NA MX-5 back then. We were the test drivers.\u201d In that case, they had to recreate something for which the compound was discarded along with the original molds. All in, the effort took a year, or about half the time Bridgestone would devote to developing a tire for a new car. The reborn SF-325s retail in Japan for about $1000 a set\u2014about double the Japanese-market price of Bridgestone\u2019s other summer tires in that size. Bridgestone and Mazda essentially had to design a new, bespoke tire to approximate the original since the technology to make the original models had been discarded. Lost, even if intentionally so. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that \u201clost technology\u201d is a misnomer, a mislabeling, or perhaps a misunderstanding. For instance, Damascus steel is one such. The problem is that a Damascus steel sword, as far as anyone has determined (that I know of), is not a technological product; it isn\u2019t the end product of an engineering process. It\u2019s the end product of an artisanal or craft process. The same is true of Japanese swords. The people producing the items learned in an apprentice system; there were few, if any records kept of the ingredients, let alone exact ratios of ingredients, in the steel alloy; the temperatures used in working, quenching, and annealing the steel were not measured, but were a matter of a master craftsman\u2019s judgement. There are other aspects of the Damascus steel swords that can be picked through and shown to be the product of skill, judgement, and heuristics than of any rigorous technological process. The product isn\u2019t, though, primitive technology; it exists outside the boundary of technological process. The \u201clost technology\u201d of the Stradivarius violins is another example of people trying to \u201cshoehorn\u201d an artisan\u2019s craft work into the technology box. If an engineer or scientist of the late 19th Century through the present had been dropped by some (non-existent) time travel mechanism into Stradivarius\u2019s workshop or the foundry and forge producing Damascus blades, they could bring technological order to the process. The processes are not outside the realm of being reproduced and re-implemented as technological items; its simply that in their own mileu, their own time and place, they were the products of craft, not technology. The rocket engines used in the USA\u2019s NASA Apollo program are occasionally brought up as a lost technology. That\u2019s a misunderstanding of the engineering and technological process. The engines could be reconstructed. There may still be enough documentation around to do most of it and the remainder could be reverse engineered. We haven\u2019t lost the technology - we\u2019re simply not building that kind of launch vehicle (Saturn V, etc) any more and when that program stopped, so did the build process for the engine type used for the vehicle. In fact, we can probably build better engines now. We haven\u2019t stopped building rocket engines. We simply didn\u2019t need engines with that kind of specific impulse rating for the programs and projects coming on stream, like the Space Shuttle. We don\u2019t build Space Shuttle engines any more either, but we could build something much like it, or even an improved version. ",
