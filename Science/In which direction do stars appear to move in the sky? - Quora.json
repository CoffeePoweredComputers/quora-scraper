            "answer_text": "Not all stars rise and set. In the Northern hemisphere, stars that are no further from the North Celestial pole (a spot in the sky near Polaris) than the angular distance from it to the horizon are up for 24 hours of every day. The rest rise in the east and set in the west. All the stars seen from the northern hemisphere, appear to revolve clockwise around the NCP. Some are far enough from it that they go below the horizon for part of their apparent track in the sky. This is why they rise and set. The same is true of the stars visible from the southern hemisphere, except that they appear to revolve around the South Celestial Pole, which is in the constellation of the Southern Cross. The stars appear to make these circles in the sky because the Earth is rotating counter-clockwise, as seen from above its North Pole, around its axis which is pointed at the North Celestial Pole. ",

            "answer_text": "The earth is rotating counter clockwise on its axis, so just as the sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west, the stars appear to rise/set more to the north or south depending upon the time of year. This is caused by the 22degree tilt on our axis. As the earth progresses on it\u2019s orbit new/different stars appear to move into the eastern sky. These result in different displays and organizations of stars in, for example, Summer and Winter night skies. A time exposure taken through a camera lens pointed at the north pole, will show the stars in circular orbits around the pole. This is caused by the daily rotation of the earth on its axis. In astrological writings (such as your daily horoscope), constellations, planets and stars are referenced to the day time sun. Those objects won\u2019t be seen that next night as the earth is facing toward the sun on the other side. Because of the distance away from us, the actual movement of any star is all but imperceptible in our life time. Over a longer period or eons it is considerable and generally random. ",
