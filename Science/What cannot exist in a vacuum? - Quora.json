            "answer_text": "If you are implying a space-like vacuum, very many things simply cannot exist naturally due to lack of resources that would be vital for them to exist. Gasses exist in a vacuum, but are spread out across the distance of the vacuum. Sound waves are one of the few things that cannot exist inside a vacuum as sound requires a medium to move through; a vacuum simply has no means for sound to travel and by implication, sound cannot exist. It all also depends on how you view existence. ",

The largest (I believe) organism that can however is the Tardigrade, aka Little Water Bears that we\u2019re discovered in the late 1700\u2019s.  In 2007, scientists discovered that these microscopic critters can survive an extended stay in the cold, irradiated vacuum of outer space. A European team of researchers sent a group of living tardigrades to orbit the earth on the outside of a FOTON-M3 rocket for ten days. Popularmechanics.com ",
