            "answer_text": "Nikola Tesla never developed a \u2018free energy\u2019 device. In Tesla\u2019s day, electricity was mostly only available in cities. Farms and small rural communities didn\u2019t have it, and wouldn\u2019t have it until President Roosevelt\u2019s Rural Electrification Administration set up hundreds of electrical cooperatives and developed high-voltage transmission systems that could move power more than a few miles. Tesla\u2019s idea was to use the resonance of the earth to send electricity as \u201cvibrations\u201d that would be received by paying customers using some sort of a machine that would convert the vibrations into usable electricity. But what is the best proof that Tesla had no interest in free energy? Tesla\u2019s Patent 455,068 is for an electric meter. A man who invented a device to help electric companies calculate customers\u2019 bills is not a man who would be interested in giving electricity away! ",

But so far all anyone has produced is words, claims, pseudoscience, etc. And strangely, all the promises fade away because of reasons like lack of investment, the scientific establishment hiding the truth, the Illuminati and giant lizards doing what they do, blah, blah.
