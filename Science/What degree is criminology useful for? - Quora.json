            "answer_text": "Hi Katrina, great question. A degree in Criminology can factor into so many different aspects of different jobs and a lot depends on the degree such as a B.S., Masters. Doctoctorate, etc. Other things to consider when getting a degree in criminology is having a degree of any level in psychology. Whether it be in Criminal Psychology or Abnormal Psychology or even victimology. There are some states that require someone who is applying to become a State Police officer to have a degree in Criminology. The more advanced degrees that you are able to get in a field such as this, can lead to an amazing career. Even getting a degree in some kind of Forensic can lead to even greater jobs. I know that even these are just television shows, but there actually is such a thing as NCIS, it\u2019s just not a television show. Also a television show like Criminal Minds, there is actually a division of the FBI called B.A.U. (Behavior Analysis Unit). The best way to get these degrees is to join the U.S. Navy and become a S.P. officer, then use your G.I. Bill to pay for your college to get these degrees. You have an amazing opportunity ahead of you if you want to pursue something in these fields. ",
