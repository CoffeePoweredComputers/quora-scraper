            "answer_text": "Technology can play an important role in the STEM learning process. The Office of Educational Technology, in partnership with Digital Promise, reviewed research literature on how technology can enrich STEM learning. They found nine ways that technology can help students engage with these subjects which are highlighted in this newly released report from the U.S. Department of Education Innovation Spotlights: Nine Dimensions for Supporting Powerful STEM Learning with Technology. This report is the result of a systematic review of the current research on the impact of integrating innovative digital technology in STEM and computer science curricula and classrooms. We hope that teachers, curriculum specialists, and other education leaders will learn how these methods can deepen students\u2019 learning experiences. You can see these methods in action by clicking the link to each video. 1.Dynamic Representations. Students learn or master STEM concepts through interacting with digital models, simulations, and dynamic representations of mathematical, scientific, and engineering systems. 2.Collaborative Reasoning. Technology tools support students\u2019 collaborative reasoning around STEM concepts, equalizing participation among group members and helping individuals and groups improve their ideas. 3. Immediate and Individualized Feedback. Digital tools provide students practicing or learning STEM skills or concepts with immediate and individualized feedback, beyond right or wrong. 4. Science Argumentation Skills. Students use technology that supports science argumentation skills including presenting and evaluating evidence about scientific or mathematical claims. 5. Engineering Design Processes. Students plan, revise, implement, and test problem solutions using engineering design processes and appropriate support technologies. 6. Computational Thinking. Students use technology to formulate and analyze problems and their solutions, reason abstractly, and automate procedures through algorithmic thinking. 7. Project-based Interdisciplinary Learning. Students use digital technology tools in the context of authentic project- or challenge-based learning activities that integrate multiple STEM fields (e.g., science and mathematics). 8. Embedded Assessments. Digital assessments are embedded in STEM instruction to prompt students\u2019 reflection on the quality of their explanations, models, or problem solutions. 9. Evidence-based Models. Students use technology to develop models based on data and evidence. ",

            "answer_text": "Whatever innovative approaches were put into place, the STEM educational blueprint was paramount: integrating technology into the daily educational experience, specially trained teachers who knew how to best present these subjects, inquiry-based interactive teaching methodologies and, of course, a robust curriculum with adequate knowledge assessment practices. Because of the government and business funding initiatives, becoming a STEM-designated school can mean access to significant financial resources. However, the specific criteria for becoming a designated school vary by state. There is the basic educational blueprint to which all designated schools must adhere, but each state has its own approach how to best follow that blueprint. As previously stated, many new academies and specialized schools have been launched that are essentially STEM schools. However, existing schools are also adjusting their curricula and teaching methodologies to win this designation. Even though the initiative has solid support at the state and national level, not everyone is totally on-board with the extreme focus on STEM subjects. Some of these critics feel that elected officials and their business leader allies are trying to use the STEM education process to bolster the U.S. economy. There is no doubt that the jobs of tomorrow will mainly require high-skilled, technologically advanced workers. However, the education system may result in more qualified workers than there are jobs for them to fill. ",
