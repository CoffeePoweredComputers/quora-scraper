            "answer_text": "Well, the answer obviously depends on on how big the Earthquake is! Most people think that the strength of an Earthquake is measured on the \u201cRichter Scale\u201d - but this is no longer true, a second scale was introduced in the 1970s to replace the now-aging Richter Scale: the Moment magnitude scale. The Moment Magnitude Scale gives a value of: [math] M_w = \\frac{2}{3} \\log_{10}{M_0} - 10.7 [/math] Where [math] M_0 [/math] is a parameter called the Seismic Moment(we\u2019ll come back to that) The constants in this equation were chosen to give values of [math] M_w [/math] which are similar to the equivalent Richter Scale numbers. Now, when Earthquakes occur, energy is put into one of three places: Deformation of the rocksHeatRadiated seismic energyOnly a small amount of the energy is radiated away from the epicentre - but that is the energy which we can measure. Therefore we can put a lower bound on the energy released in an Earthquake by calculating just the radiated away: [math] M_0 = E_s \\cdot 10^{-4.8} [/math] Where we see our Seismic moment again, and [math] E_s [/math] is the radiated energy. So, we apply some algebra, and rearrange: [math] M_w = \\frac{2}{3} \\log_{10}{M_0} - 10.7 \\to M_0 = 10^{\\frac{3M_w}{2} + 16.05} [/math] Substituting that in: [math] E_s = 10^{ \\frac{3M_w}{2} + 11.25} [/math] And therefore, the energy [math] E_{Earthquake} [/math] must be bigger than this number (but we haven\u2019t quantified how much), so we have: [math] E_{Earthquake} > 10^{ \\frac{3M_w}{2} + 11.25} [/math]  Ok, so how much energy is that? Google tells me that there was a Magnitude 5.2 earthquake off the coast of Chile at 7:18 UTC today (M5.2 - 92km NW of Copiapo, Chile) Therefore, this (fairly minor) Earthquake released: [math] E > 10^{19.05} J [/math] That comes out as: [math] E > 11.22 \\times 10^{18} J [/math] The largest nuclear detonation in history (the Tsar Bomba, 1961) released [math] 2.7 \\times 10^{17} J [/math] This minor Earthquake, which happened this morning (relative to me, at least), released more energy than 42 of the most powerful nuclear devices ever built. And that\u2019s a lower bound of the total energy release in the Earthquake. The energy released in the Earthquake which caused the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami (~9.1 magnitude) is the equivalent of at least 29 million Tsar Bombas.  Earthquakes release vastly more energy than anything humans have been able to create. So lets address the second part of your question: what would happen if that energy was directed at a common object, like a car or person? Well, we kind of already have an answer to that. And it\u2019s not pretty. Remember, so far I\u2019ve been using the Tsar Bomba as a comparison - the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated. But, we want to know the effects on \u201ceveryday objects\u201d - and the Tsar Bomba was tested in a remote part of Siberia. However - the US did use nuclear weapons in Japan in 1945. The Tsar Bomba has about 1600 times the combined energy of the two weapons which destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So, our 5.2 Chilean Earthquake was at least the equivalent of 42 Tsar Bombas, which in turn is equal to about 3200 times the energy released above Hiroshima in 1945. So: One Magnitude 5.2 Earthquake is equivalent to One Hundred and Thirty Four Thousand Little Boys. And how much damage did one of those bombs do?  Shit. So one bomb destroyed a city, and you want to know what a hundred thousand of them would do to a car!? This amount of energy is enough to level entire countries, let alone individuals.  Conclusion: Earthquakes are fucking scary, man. ",
