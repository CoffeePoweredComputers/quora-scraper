            "answer_text": "I went to a Catholic school for eight years where, every Tuesday or Thursday, we went to church as a class. On one such occasion, in the 3rd grade, one of my black classmates reached out to give a girl in the row behind us the sign of peace (a tradition in Catholic mass where you shake hands with the people around you and say \"Peace be upon you\", to which they respond \"And also with you\"). This part of the mass is meant as a sign of community and solidarity, but when my classmate reached out to the girl standing near us, her mother drew her away and said \"Don't touch him - he's dirty.\" While racism has been linked to low IQ and conservative beliefs, I believe that most people are racist because we are taught to be racist, both explicitly and implicitly. I grew up in an environment where discussion of race and racism was either used in a disparaging manner - \"All those black kids just don't know how to work hard.\" - or dismissed as a thing of the past - \"Racism doesn't even exist anymore. We haven't had slavery for years!\" - and those were the attitudes I carried with me through most of my childhood. It wasn't until I managed to escape that environment that I realized these misconceptions were baseless and extremely biased. This realization held true for many other prejudices as well - sexism, classism, and homophobia, among others. I started that transition a little over 7 years ago, but there are still moments when I need to check the poisonous ideology I was raised with. I consider myself lucky to have been able to distance myself from the people and the institutions that encouraged that sort of thinking, but I recognize that many people never have the chance to move out of those environments, or if they do, they choose not to take it.  On some level, I understand the aversion to change - after all, I was in this world for 14 years before I began to change my beliefs. For starters, educating yourself can cause major conflicts in your personal life. I, for one, know that learning to respect other humans has driven a huge wedge between me and my parents, as well as large sections of my extended family. Taking a stand against discrimination can cause a lot of disagreements, particularly if your community does not share your beliefs.  It also takes a substantial amount of time and effort to be an effective activist or ally. I have spent more hours than I can count consuming a wide range of media on various movements, but I know I still have plenty of room to improve. Even if you have taken it upon yourself to become a better human being, it is not a short process - there is a lot of learning involved. You also have to move past the belief that the struggles of other people \"have nothing to do with me\". Many racists and other forms of bigots have been taught that those who are unlike you are not worth your attention and do not deserve your empathy.  The thing that was important for me to realize as a child was that the culmination of every difficulty I experienced in educating myself on these issues did not hold a candle to any of the difficulties experienced by those whose experiences I was educating myself about. None of these difficulties make bigotry excusable.  I think the main reason people are racist is that they are taught to be so - they exist in environments that support and maintain racist ideology and action. It was not until I effectively moved out of my house, went to a new school, and placed myself in an entirely new group of people that I was even exposed to ideologies that respected other human beings.  It's not that I never questioned the things I experienced - when my friend was told he was \"dirty\", I tried talking with a lot of people about why that woman would say such an awful thing - but since nobody was willing to discuss race as a fact of the present, I was just left with a sad, uncomfortable feeling instead of any clear answers. I felt similarly about how people told me \"the poor deserve to be poor\", even as we worked to collect food and money for them, and about how girls were a minority in the advanced math classes I took. However, since the community I existed within labeled problems of the present as problems of the past, learning about them was made difficult.  Leaving home for high school was the best thing that ever happened to me, not because of the classes I took, but because I learned how to be a better human - a more important subject than any class. When people tell me that \"Oh, you know, some people just don't change\", I can point to myself as an example of someone who could, and I can hold hope for the other people I come across who still cling to the idiotic beliefs that I was raised with.

            "answer_text": "Some people have such low self worth they actually need to look down in others to make them feel better about themselves. Take a family of rural hayseeds. They have no running water, a dirty home, very little food and even less income due to being welfare recipients. Now, they're at the very bottom of the totem pole. However, when they see a family of Black Americans with both parents being college graduates and six figure incomes, what do they think? They think they are better than the well to do Black family because they're White. Never mind that their poor, lack ambition and can't afford decent clothes or a car. The Black people are beneath them simply because they're Black. These are the people who voted for racism and bigotry to run rampant in America. \u201cOh people are getting deported? So what?! They don't belong here anyway!\u201d They forget their ancestors were once immigrants as well. Poor immigrants. It's a very sick mentality. And shameful. These people actually believe they are superior due to the color of their skin. They're usually miserable and unhappy toward every aspect of their lives. Instead of facing their issues and finding proper solutions, they'd rather focus on something they feel is easier and makes them happy: racism. They choose to be racist because: 1. It's all they know. 2. It relieves them of the responsibility of facing reality: they wind up in bad situations because of their choices. No one else's. 3. They are such low, pathetic individuals they literally cannot face reality. Therefore, minorities are used as scapegoats. The hatred they exhibit is actually a reflection of self hating, narcissistic psychopathy. They may believe they are good, decent people. Yet, due to their mistakes made throughout history and during the last election, everyone else is suffering. They choose to be racist because they believe hatred will make them powerful. It won't. It never does. All it does is rob everyone of peace of mind, joy and safety. It robs everyone. Including them. Sadly, their minds are too clouded with poison to realize it. Consequently, they are always the last to know. Tragic. ",
