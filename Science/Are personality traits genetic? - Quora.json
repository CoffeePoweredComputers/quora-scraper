            "answer_text": "Q. Are personality traits genetic? -If genetics plays a role in shaping personality, one will find out that personalities of children should be similar to their parents. Identical twins who are raised together by same parents should have same personality; those identical twins\u2019 personality should be similar to their parents. -If you collect enough identical twins data without bias, you will find out that many identical twins who are living together since birth (same environment, same home, same school, same parents, same bedroom, etc.,) have different habits, different behaviors, different characters, different personalities, different interests, different thinking processes and even sexual orientations, etc. -Because personalities are not determined by genetics, even identical twins can have totally different personalities. -The identical twins will have similar physical structures according to same genes. But they will have different characters, personalities, intelligence and thinking processes because those traits are not determined by genes. -One can observe whether above behaviors are genetic or not by studying identical twins. If those behaviors are genetic, identical twins will have same behaviors. If not, one will find different behaviors in identical twins. Actually, some behaviors can be observed since very young. If one observes very different behaviors within the same identical pair, personality traits are not genetic although they are present since very young. Some people explain the reason of different behaviors within same identical twins pair by interaction with environment after birth by those twins. But the explanation is not satisfactory enough. -In present day science of genetics and evolution concept, it cannot explain how the identical twins have different personalities, different I.Qs, different characters, different interests, different sexual orientations, etc. Someone will see a lot of explanations with different mechanisms. But those different mechanisms can't explain the initial differences during the first 3- 5 years of ages. Genetics can only give identical external physical appearances. Genetics cannot determine so called internal characters. Those internal characters are determined (inherited) by different unique soul or spirit. -Although science cannot explain the cause of differences in internal characters between identical twins, extreme differences between children and their parents (i.e. very, very far from the tree), those differences can be explained by rebirth concept. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, each and every human being has own unique soul and when that human being dies, most of the souls has continual repetitive cycle of birth and death called samsara (not just in human world, also in other living worlds) according to his karma. In Buddhism, karma specifically refers to those actions of body, speech or mind that spring from mental intent (\"cetana\"), and bring about a consequence or fruit, (phala) or result (vip\u0101ka). -If that particular soul comes back to human world as rebirth, that particular human being will have distinct personality, I.Q, E.Q, behaviors, etc., according to his daily routine doings, habits. Those characters are not derived from his own parents, according to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism. -So one human being will have personality, intelligence distinct from his father and mother. In other words, if one pair of parents produces a lot, a lot of children, the parents will find that their children will have so many distinct personalities and intelligence different not only from the parents but also among the siblings. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, although the identical twins have identical physical appearances due to identical genes, each has different intelligence (I.Q), personality, character according to actions and habits, etc from previous individual's lifetime. So one will see different personality, character, intelligence and talent between identical twins. It must be miracle to see those identical twins have same or identical so-called internal characters between them because they have different souls. -And those extreme differences will be more and more common in society like USA because USA is the land of immigrants and rebirths may (or may not) occur in family of different cultures, different concepts, different values, etc, because one cannot select to rebirth in family with same culture, race with previous one. -But science will not accept that kind of answer because science has no concept of soul and science denies concept of rebirth. -Which concept is right? -One needs to look into identical twins studies without bias. Thousands of twins pairs were studied by scientists in the past. Or one can ask directly to those twins or their parents if you have friends with them. - - What about the effect of birth order on personality? 1. Birth Order and personality Birth order refers to the order a child is born, for example first born, second born etc. Birth order is often believed to have a profound and lasting effect on psychological development.Alfred Adler (1870\u20131937) was one of the first theorists to suggest that birth order influences personality. He argued that birth order can leave an indelible impression on an individual's style of life. According to Adler, firstborns are \"dethroned\" when a second child comes along, and this may have a lasting influence on them. Younger and only children may be pampered and spoiled, which can also affect their later personalities. Additional birth order factors that should be considered are the spacing in years between siblings, the total number of children, and the changing circumstances of the parents over time.One modern theory of personality states that the Big Five personality traits of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism represent most of the important elements of personality that can be measured.In his book Born to Rebel, Frank Sulloway suggests that birth order has strong and consistent effects on the Big Five personality traits. He argues that first-borns are more conscientious, more socially dominant, less agreeable, and less open to new ideas compared to later-borns.Since the 1970s, one of the most influential theories to explain why firstborns frequently score higher on intelligence and achievement tests than other children is the confluence model of Robert Zajonc. This model states that because firstborns mainly have adult influences around them in their early years, they will spend their initial years of life interacting in a highly intellectual family environment. This effect may also be observed in siblings who, although later born, have a sibling at least five years senior with no siblings in between. These children are considered to be \"functional firstborns\". The theory further suggests that firstborns will be more intelligent than only children, because the latter will not benefit from the \"tutor effect\" (i.e. teaching younger siblings).From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi... - 2. Birth Order and personality The Birth Order Book: Why You Are the Way You Are is a 1982 non-fiction book by Dr. Kevin Leman on birth order and its potential influence on personality and development.First Born: First born children are described as leaders that are often perfectionists that desire approval from those in charge. Leman also states that first-borns are \"typically aggressive\" but are also often people pleasers.Middle Child: Middle children are sometimes diverse in that they are \"guaranteed to be opposite of their older sibling\" and often have the feeling that they are ignored in favor of their older and younger siblings. They are also described as having personalities that lean towards being secretive and can often serve as peacemakers between their older and younger siblings.Last Born: Leman describes the last children as \"social and outgoing\" but also the \"most financially irresponsible of all birth orders\". He also comments that they have the potential to be manipulative as well as charming.From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th... - 3. Birth Order and personality The idea that first-born children are smarter can be traced back to Francis Galton, a 19th-century scientist who worked in psychology, biology, and anthropology, among other fields. He noticed that a lot of his English scientist colleagues were first-born sons, and proposed that their intellectual success came from the resources and attention poured into them by their families. (First-born sons are the heirs, after all.)The evolutionary view of birth order effects is that siblings have to compete for their parents\u2019 attention and favor, and they find different ways to do that. The oldest are physically stronger and mentally more developed than the younger siblings (at least while they\u2019re all still children), so it behooves them to be aggressive (and bossy?). The later-born siblings need more help from others, and so become more extraverted.From https://www.theatlantic.com/heal... - 4. Birth Order and personality -According to philosophy of modern science, the children's brains are like blank slate at birth. They will act with their environment and those actions and reaction will form their personalities during growth. Almost all first born children will have similar environment and they will act according to similar environmental stimulation. Therefore, those first born children will have similar personalities in later life. The same philosophy can be applied for middle born or last born children. So they reach conclusion that the same birth order children will have same personality traits. -According to the philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, if so-called souls or spirits or minds are not released from cycles of life (except for those who are liberated or reached nirvana), some of them will come back to human life again. Those who come back to human world may bring their previous repeatedly actions as habits, behaviors, personalities with them along. So those personalities are according to previous personalities of particular souls, not according to birth order, in Theravada Buddhism view. The same environment (encountered by same birth order children) will not have too much influence in those (same birth order) children. Their previous personality traits are too much stronger to be changed by same environment. So the same birth order children will not have same personality traits, according to the Theravada Buddhism. - 5. Birth Order and personality ...... a couple of recent studies of large samples suggest that birth order does not matter when it comes to personality, and barely matters when it comes to intelligence.In a study published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from the University of Leipzig and Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, both in Germany, looked at more than 20,000 adults from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, comparing siblings both within the same family, and people with the same birth order across families.\u201cAll in all, we did not find any effect of birth order on extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, or imagination, a subdimension of openness,\u201d the researchers write.......... another study published this summer in the Journal of Research in Personality looked at 377,000 U.S. high-school students, and also found little evidence for personality differences based on birth order.The researchers looked at the Big Five personality traits\u2014openness, agreeableness, neuroticism, conscientiousness, and extraversion\u2014and predicted that \u201cfirstborns (versus laterborns) should be higher in Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and the dominance aspect of Extraversion, whereas laterborns should be higher in Agreeableness and the sociability aspect of Extraversion.\u201dOver this entire huge population, they found that firstborns did tend to be a little more conscientious and dominant, and less sociable, but also that they tended to be more agreeable and less neurotic (which goes against the stereotype). But the effect size of this finding was tiny\u2014so tiny that if they hadn\u2019t looked at hundreds of thousands of people, it wouldn\u2019t have been significant at all. When it came to intelligence, firstborns did have an advantage\u2014of one IQ point. As a comparison, another study found that some adolescents\u2019 IQs changed by as much as 20 points within four years.\u201cBirth order is often invoked as an important variable to explain the development of personality and intelligence within and across families,\u201d the researchers wrote in the high-school birth-order study. \u201cWe would have to say that, to the extent that these effect sizes are accurate estimates of the true effect, birth order does not seem to be an important consideration for understanding either the development of personality traits or the development of intelligence in the between-family context.\u201dFrom https://www.theatlantic.com/heal... http://www.pnas.org/content/112/... https://www.urbo.com/content/it-... - 6. Birth Order and personality Only child An only child is a person with no siblings, either biological or adopted. The term only child is generally applied only to those individuals who don't have siblings.In Western countries, only children can be the subject of a stereotype that equates them with \"spoiled brats\". Even today, only children are commonly stereotyped as \"spoiled, selfish, and bratty\". Susan Newman, a social psychologist at Rutgers University and the author of Parenting an Only Child, says that this is a myth. \"There have been hundreds and hundreds of research studies that show that only children are no different from their peers.\"In China, perceived behavioral problems in only children has been called the Little Emperor Syndrome and the lack of siblings has been blamed for a number of social ills such as materialism and crime. However, recent studies do not support these claims, and show no significant differences in personality between only children and children in larger families.A 1987 quantitative review of 141 studies on 16 different personality traits failed to support the opinion, held by theorists including Alfred Adler, that only children are more likely to be maladjusted due to pampering. The study found no evidence of any greater prevalence of maladjustment in only children.In his book Born to Rebel, Frank Sulloway provides evidence that birth order influences the development of the \"big five personality traits\" (also known as the Five Factor Model). Sulloway suggests that firstborns and only children are more conscientious, more socially dominant, less agreeable, and less open to new ideas compared to laterborns. However, his conclusions have been challenged by other researchers, who argue that birth order effects are weak and inconsistent. In one of the largest studies conducted on the effect of birth order on the Big Five, data from a national sample of 9,664 subjects found no association between birth order and scores on the NEO PI-R personality test.From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On...

            "answer_text": " This is an everyday situation at home,when we hear a phrase \"like father like son\".... Is it so simple? Does all the characters from father gets passed on to son?.. To know answer to this question we must know abt genes. Genes or genome is the instruction manual of how we should be built from the scratch. It is there inside our cell nucleus and it governs everything in our life. Right from our attitude, temperament, habits, behaviors, illness etc everything depends on it. We get our genes both from our mother and father. And we pass it on to our progeny. Think of the genes as living creatures... The aim of these tiny creatures is just two: to survive at any cost and to pass itself to the next generation,which it accomplishes via the body surrounding it. Whatever we do in life, revolves around this two things... The method adopted for this challenges doesn't matter for gene; that comes under ethics, and that's where religion, culture, morality comes into play. Gene don't have any ethics. So, the question is does every character in a gene gets passed on? No. The character that gives an evolutionary advantage over others in a group gets passed on. In a forest full of predators, a human who is an endurance runner has higher chance of survival. Others gets preyed easily. So his genes gets passed on. This is what is called Darwin's theory of natural selection' or 'survival of fittest'.. It takes many generations to happen. How does one human suddenly became an endurance runner? Probably via random changes in gene(mutation) or exchange of genes between the parent's chromosome(cross over). So, why this happens? Survival. How it happens? Natural selection.... Another way of transmission of character from one generation to another in a short span of time is via epigenetics. Here the gene is not changed. But the expression of gene is changed(phenotype). Suppose a fetus develops in a malnourished mother, it acquires certain protective mechanisms against it. Later in life, when exposed to normal nutrition, the person gets obese. When this obese person gives birth even in a normal nutritional state, the offspring carries the obese gene and even it transmits it to the next generation too. Why this happens? Modern science doesn't know yet. How it happens? Epigenetics... So, there is no simple answer to the question of whether all characters pass on to next generation. Even it is passed down there is no surety that the character will be expressed(incomplete penetrance).. And environmental triggers plays another important role in gene expression(Nature or Nurture?) So, all we can say Genes is not equal to character/skills Genes + Environmental triggers + Chance = Character/skills. ",

            "answer_text": "EVERY trait is some combination of heredity and environmental influence.  We do know that some basic components of temperament- like reactivity, anxiety levels, ability to self-calm, and other things- are inborn.  I know when I've bred litters of puppies each one has its own temperament from day one, and they show some basic breed traits in those temperaments as well.  We are not dogs- what we choose to do with ourselves remains our choice and humans are enormously plastic- but parents of multiple children will usually tell you that some of their child's personality was set from day one. I have a half-brother, and due to my being ten years older than him and a bunch of circumstances involving primary custody and my having gotten the hell out of Dodge the moment I was able, we actually were raised in quite different circumstances.  We recently reconnected after ten years apart, not having seen each other since my father's funeral and not having really known each other for longer.  We are *amazingly* similar in personality, sense of humor, and interests- despite not being twins and not even sharing the same mother, we look and think astonishingly alike. So I don't believe it can be quantified, but we already know at least *some* is hereditary if not genetic in the strictest sense- genes code for proteins, not behaviors. ",

            "answer_text": "Surely natural instinct is evidence that genes can indeed influence behaviour? Your example of caring for children is a good one. Different genes seem to demonstrate markedly different methods of parenting within different animal species.So if we accept that natural instinct exists and it is passed on through genes then Yes, I think we can conclude genes influence behaviour. Since different human populations have different genetic make up then logically it makes sense that different populations would have different natural tendencies to particular behavioural traits.  However genetics is not the only contributor to individual behaviour. I suspect that learning and upbringing make a much more significant contribution to most behaviours than genetics.  Identifying how much of a behaviour is genetically determined and how much is environmentally determined is much more difficult to establish.  What you are also doing is making a case for stereotyping. Excellent. I've missed all the jokes starting \"An Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman walk into a bar .....\" ",

The difficulty lies in that particular conundrum of nature versus nurture. In most studies involving twins separated at birth for some reason there are often remarkable differences in personalities. But that is not always the case. Similarly, if nature were at play one would expect all siblings in a family to have similar personalities but that is rarely the case either. In my research what I have found is what I refer to is a lack of congruency within the DNA in so far as personality development is concerned. This is where the genetics may be at play but either the input from the outside world to each person may be different or each person within the same DNA pack interprets information differently. Example: Two brothers may be told to be good boys. One of them may view this as a correction because he has not been being good, while the other may view this a positive in the sense of encouragement to continue to be good. Another example might be what a psychologist friend of mine called two left teat babies, which is to say that the children are so similar at birth they will become completely dissimilar as they grow up. Both want exactly the same thing when there us only one of them. The best determination I think is that we cannot totally separate either nature or nurture from the equation because, generally speaking, we do not have absolute control over how much outside input is absorbed by the child from birth to around age 10 when the personality is 75% in place. I guess I have not really answered your question. I will use the old fall back point of saying \u2026. it depends. ",

My wife , her one sister and one brother have gotten the behavioural traits of their mother ; while the other sister and brothers the qualities of the father . This is natural because of biological reasons . The qualities of both the parents are bound to reflect in the offsprings . But personality can be upgraded also . The environment in which you study , you work , the people you work with , the position you hold , the responsibility you are to discharge , your area of work , the people whom you are to associate with on daily basis all contribute in moulding your personality . But whatever musk you are required to wear because of the circumstantial necessity , your basic character remains the same ; it can't be wiped out ,it can't be erased ,it can't be washed away . It can be very much understood from the life of Ex - President Dr APJ Kalam who was like a child even during his tenure as the President of the country. ",

            "answer_text": "All of them \"have some genetic basis\".  This does not mean they do not have environmental influencers, but every personality trait has a genetic basis. The general rule of thumb that seems to be emerging is that for many simple traits, about 30-70% of a personality trait is genetic and the rest is environmental. This becomes hard to tease out when a very large number of genes act in concert to determine a behavior or personality trait. As with any rule of thumb, this will have many points on both sides of the distribution. Interesting examples:-Dopaminergic receptor variants and financial risk taking behavior:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2634960/ -Additional dopamine related \"novelty-seeking behavior\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8528256 You have a large number of variants of neuromodulatory genes, so combinatorially there are a large potential number of interactions that could drive the genetic baseline for lots of interesting traits (e.g. happiness). Basically if you can modulate a behavior with a drug, it has some genetic basis. ",

            "answer_text": " As science has proved, humans' traits are influenced by both nature and nurture - nature being the genetics and nurture, the environment we're brought up in. Here's an example: According to the latest discoveries, some violent criminals have been diagnosed with carrying some specific genes in charge of provoking criminal acts. (check the link below)\u2714\ufe0fBBC: Two genes linked with violent crime As it was mentioned in the article above, carrying those genes can't determine that they're certainly going to be criminals, because again the atmosphere they're brought up in matters to a large extent, which means you might carry those genes yet being brought up by moral parents can control those genes and as a result, the way you behave.  Another example is kindness or better say, the ability of being sympathetic or caring. It's been proved that some hormones like oxytocin are in charge of being sympathetic. Some even have named it the \u201clove hormone\u201d. (Check out the the link)\u2714\ufe0fLivescience: 11 Interesting Effects of Oxytocin Now if your body is congenitally able to secrete more of it, you're going to be more sympathetic than someone who's kinda deprived of that compared to you, but again if you've been brought up by bad parenting or if you had a hard time in your childhood, you might not be able to manifest the ability of kindness written on your genes. \u2714\ufe0fIn a nutshell : How we think, feel and react is influenced by our brain's chemistry and structure which are formed based on our genetics AND the environment we've been exposed to since childhood till now.

No.***Why can't a monkey learn to behave like a human?*** A huge part of this is genetics, as you state.  And your monkey comparison is a perfect example of why genetics is always \"involved.\"Can we conclude that different human populations may have different behaviours?  Almost certainly.Can some populations be more prone to follow rules?  Yes.  Criminals, as a population, for example, have a higher rate of psychopathy.  Psychopathy has a genetic component. Why I answered your question:So the thing I like about your question is it touches on the concept of heritability used in quantitative genetics. When geneticists answer questions like \"how important is genetics compared to the environment?\" we will always refer to a concept called \"heritability.\"  The most important thing about heritability is that it is an estimate and it is population or context specific.  Your question touched plenty of the population-specific part.  It's important! Here is a review of heritability (and a defense of its use):Heritability in the genomics era: concepts and misconceptions. For a viewpoint that is much more critical of using heritability for behavior traits (not one that I share, but there is a lot of good information and points made).  This review also emphasizes the myriad of ways in which something can either appear to be genetic, when it's not really; or the complex manner in which genes can interact with other genes or the environment:Heritability in the Era of Molecular Genetics: Some Thoughts for Understanding Genetic Influences on Behavioural Traits ",

I believe we have the power to overcome our vices by looking inside. I believe if you get high off a certain feeling you can ignore it. Overcome and defeat the temptations inside all of us. The strongest Buddhist is not someone with the best genes and chemicals, it is someone born with the worst who had the power to defeat themselves.  The hardest journey is when you can\u2019t look inside to defeat desires. For me, I had to wait till hacks were off a certain region to stop my spending of houses and clothes. But I am disappointed in myself, as I should of defeated it within me. I know I got this feeling from hacks and they are to blame, but I wasn\u2019t strong enough. With other mind hacks I have been tested and strong enough, I had one that gave me no emotion, one that gave me good feelings when I was bullied, one that judged people all the time etc. I defeated those and others, .I overcame and ignored feelings from hacks. I used my thoughts and beliefs to remain good. Just like someone can overcome their feelings from genes, so genes shouldn't all be personality.  So yes a lot of your personality is in your genes, but if you have bad genes you can overcome them. You can use your development to change. It is a mixture between, chemicals, genes and nuture that make your personality. I do believe in genetic healing in the law and taking away genes that harm, but my theory stands for those who can't access it or afford it. ",

            "answer_text": "Some intersting answers already, so I'll try not to repeat them: Your genetic makeup does affect you to a certain extent, but perhaps less so than manz people think. You genes won't decide whether you would be a successful business-person, just because your parents may be. But your genes can certainly influence the probability than you may have the predisposition towards certain areas of talent (or lack of it). One if my sisters is very artistic. Visually artistic, and this is the area she studied and the area she works in. I am as artistic as a banana. If I draw a stick figure people ask what the scribble is supposed to be. Another sister of mine studied accounting. I have to take a calculator to add up figures (sigh). So why aren't we all talented in the same way? I mean, we all have the same genes, right? Wrong. If we had the same genes, we'd be identical twins. And we aren't. Perhaps it would be more accurate to suggest that our genes lay down a set of broad tendencies, which are then supplemented by what we learn, our experiences and how we grow up. I could probably be good at maths if I had developed the slightest interest in it at school. But maths was always the most boring topic and I was always happy the lessons were over. So genes don't automatically affect our behaviour, but they certainly oay an important (if rather general) role in what areas we may be better at than other people. But there is a LOT of learning to develop these talents or to compensate for the lack of talent. Also, each child is an individual, carrying a different \"cocktail\" or their parents' genes, unless they are identical twins. So it can easily happen that siblings develop in entirely different ways and develop entirely different interests. It's important, I think, not to overrate the effect of our genetic background. I'm not saying that we can simply learn everything. Even if I practice a lot, I probably won't be able to fly on my own. My genes have neglected to provid me with wings. Tough. I just have to live with that. Also, I'll never be an olympic gymnast. I'm not bendy enough... Again: thanks genes. ",

            "answer_text": "You may have heard that identical twins raised apart have similar personalities (perhaps we should say they *are* similar personalities).  By \"personality\" here I refer to traits measured by personality tests -- extrinsically vs intrinsically motivated, degree of risibility, this sort of thing (excluding things like what card games they know, what languages they understand, etc).   What's less well-known is that identical twins raised in the same household are just as similar, psychologically, as identical twins raised apart.  Or put differently, identical twins raised apart are just as similar (personality-wise) as identical twins raised in the same household.   The same is true of fraternal twins: they're psychologically similar when raised apart, and no more similar when raised together. What about two adoptive kids raised in the same household?  When they're adults, they'll be no more similar psychologically than two random adults picked up off the street.   So a significant share of your personality is in fact genetic -- that's what a survey of psychological studies show.   People have all kinds of reactions to this.  We tend to think people raised in the same household are similar, but once they leave home, similarities in personality are largely due to genetics. If you're curious about this, I suggest you read Harris's _The_Nurture_Assumption_.  Read the book -- don't read reviews written by people who haven't read it :( ",

If you look at the degree to which parents and children are similar to each other compared to how much unrelated people vary from each other, you can compute a percentage value. In mathematical language, you divide the covariance between parent and child by the total variance among parents and children, and multiply by two (because one parent accounts for half of your genes) to get a heritability value. You can use twins or siblings in a similar fashion. Problem is that this is just a measure of similarity between relatives. Heritability estimates for height and weight are commonly very high (roughly 90%) but we know that height and weight are strongly influenced by diet. People in the 19th Century were generally shorter and a lot thinner than people now and that change was not due to genetics. Similarly, IQ values have been increasing by roughly 3 points per decade even though the heritability of IQ is thought to be very high (Flynn effect). That said, people tend to closely resemble their relatives for psychological attributes. Identical twins tend to score very similarly on tests of intellectual ability and less similarly in tests of personality attributes.  If you are interested in heritability of a given trait, just put the word heritability followed by the name of your trait into Google and you will get lists of results from twin and family studies. But keep in mind that heredity isn't destiny. ",

            "answer_text": "Genes cannot themselves control our traits. It is the environment that controls which genes are expressed and hence our traits. That is because genes do not have any control over themselves, and so genes and DNA cannot directly control our traits. Below are a few quotes from Dr. Bruce Lipton's 'The Biology Of Belief' which explain why the environment plays more of a role in our traits than our genes, and then what role you can play. It\u2019s not that Darwin denied the existence of God. He simply implied that chance, not Divine intervention, was responsible for the character of life on Earth. In his 1859 book, The Origin of Species, Darwin said that individual traits are passed from parents to their children. He suggested that \u201chereditary factors\u201d passed from parent to child control the characteristics of an individual\u2019s life. That bit of insight set scientists off on a frenzied attempt to dissect life down to its molecular nuts and bolts, for within the structure of the cell was to be found the heredity mechanism that controlled life. The search came to a remarkable end fifty years ago when James Watson and Francis Crick described the structure and function of the DNA double helix, the material of which genes are made. Scientists finally figured out the nature of the \u201chereditary factors\u201d that Darwin had written about in the nineteenth century. The tabloids heralded the brave new world of genetic engineering with its promise of designer babies and magic bullet medical treatments. I vividly remember the large block print headlines that filled the front page on that memorable day in 1953: \u201cSecret of Life Discovered.\u201d Like the tabloids, biologists jumped on the gene bandwagon. The mechanism by which DNA controls biological life became the Central Dogma of molecular biology, painstakingly spelled out in textbooks. In the long-running debate over nature vs. nurture, the pendulum swung decidedly to nature. At first DNA was thought to be responsible only for our physical characteristics, but then we started believing that our genes control our emotions and behaviors as well. So if you are born with a defective happiness gene, you can expect to have an unhappy life. My final stop in conventional academia was at Stanford University\u2019s School of Medicine. By that time I was an unabashed proponent of a \u201cnew\u201d biology. I had come to question not only Darwin\u2019s dog-eat-dog version of evolution but also biology\u2019s Central Dogma, the premise that genes control life. That scientific premise has one major flaw\u2014genes cannot turn themselves on or off. In more scientific terms, genes are not \u201cself-emergent.\u201d Something in the environment has to trigger gene activity. Though that fact had already been established by frontier science, conventional scientists blinded by genetic dogma had simply ignored it. My outspoken challenge of the Central Dogma turned me into even more of a scientific heretic. Not only was I a candidate for excommunication, I was now suitable for burning at the stake! In a lecture during my interview at Stanford, I found myself accusing the gathered faculty, many of them internationally recognized geneticists, of being no better than religious fundamentalists for adhering to the Central Dogma despite evidence to the contrary. After my sacrilegious comments, the lecture room erupted into shouts of outrage that I thought meant the end of my job application. Instead, my insights concerning the mechanics of a new biology proved to be provocative enough to get me hired. With the support of some eminent scientists at Stanford, especially from the Pathology Department\u2019s chairman, Dr. Klaus Bensch, I was encouraged to pursue my ideas and apply them to research on cloned human cells. To the surprise of those around me, the experiments fully supported the alternative view of biology that I was postulating. I published two papers based on this research and left academia, this time for good. (Lipton, et al, 1991, 1992) I left because, despite the support I got at Stanford, I felt that my message was falling on deaf ears. Since my departure, new research has consistently validated my skepticism about the Central Dogma and the primacy of DNA in controlling life. In fact, epigenetics, the study of the molecular mechanisms by which the environment controls gene activity, is today one of the most active areas of scientific research. The newly emphasized role of the environment in regulating gene activity was the focus of my cell research twenty-five years ago, long before the field of epigenetics was even established. (Lipton 1977a, 1977b). It can often be a challenge to control or change the outside environment, but fortunately, there is another intangible environment where we can play a role. Our thoughts, emotions, and sensations are also a part of the universal environment, albeit they are non-physical, but then again the physical universe is also not physical. You can find out how to affect that environment of thoughts, emotions, and sensations to transform and heal your situations by clicking here. ",

Certain behavioral patterns and mannerisms may be passed down through the generations. If the family had an illness and the parent(s) were a carrier, then the illness could affect the self-esteem of the child. I think that the personality of an individual is largely determined by the physical environment one lives in. People have a tendency to absorb their concrete surrounding, so they can also pick up on the personality traits. Ultimately, I think that personality is determined based on the individual\u2019s perception. ",

We can not say with certainty what percentage of behavior/character is due to genes or environment. We only take the squared variance ( difference ) from the mean of all behaviors. And this is not set in stone either. For instance, children are only assigned 25% of there IQ to genes and the rest of the variance is environmental/nurture. This changes dramatically as one ages and at my age 85% of the variance in my IQ measurement is genetic. I would venture to say that character is also subject to these wide swings in measured variance of one's lifetime. Do not be fooled by people who tell you that genetic or environmental forces are this, that and the other thing as Ideological axes are ground in this subject often.  ",

For example, I cannot extract oxygen from swimming water because I lack gills, because I lack the genes for making gills (and whatever other organs would be required to make this all work). The idea that behaviors can just be learned arbitrarily is nonsensical.  Different organisms have different learning capacities, including the possibility of very little learning capacity.  Teaching a worm to press a lever for food is not likely a behavior you can teach by learning. As for behaviors we have that are not learned, there are of course simple things like coordinated hand grasping.  Why are we able to synchronize all 4 fingers and thumb clasping onto something so perfectly?  Well it turns out it is bio-mechanical combined with instinct.  When catching a ball, or learning to catch a ball, the only thing you are \"learning\" is timing and aim.  Closing all fingers at the same time during the catch is not something you \"learn\" it is just an instinctive reaction.  For example, never in the history of humans \"catching things\" has a human failed the catching attempt because they only used *some* of their fingers to clasp the object -- it just doesn't happen.  So such a behavior is not learned, it is completely innate, and therefore related to our genes, somehow. ",

Keep in mind that genetics are the substrate, not the sculpture, genetics is the material (marble, wood, ice, styrofoam) of an artists block, and the experiences of a lifetime can be analogized as the work of the artist, the chisel making an imprint on the material.   No matter how old we get, no matter how much our experiences change us, we're still formed of the same basic axiomatic personality we had when we were born. Our environment makes an indelible impression on our personalities, with of course a limit to how much that can be changed.... there is a finite amount of material.   It gets even more complex when we consider the fact that we can use our brains to re-evaluate or change our behavior with no outside influence. That's just a superpower we have as a rational animal.  You start with the same material, you finish with the same material, but events in your life can change the shape of it, and you can change the shape of it yourself.

Certainly there are behavioral consequences for being male, but it only partly makes sense to say that SRY \"governs\" behavior. Men differ a lot in how they behave, and being male is much more than just behavior! While a change in a single gene may have specific behavioral consequences (for example Angelman Syndrome), but that doesn't mean that the gene is \"for\" a specific function or a specific disorder. If the question were phrased, \"In what ways do genes influence behavior?\", then you could read up on behavioral genetics--a search engine would be a good place to start. ",
