            "answer_text": "In my reading in world history, some nation had to be first to develop civilization, ahead of the others. After that first nation started, any nations that were accidentally closest to this nation \u2014 by physical proximity \u2014 benefited by a social interaction with the first advanced culture. In my reading, the first nation to develop modern culture was Sumer (near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, as we read in the Book of Genesis). The Sumerians were the first to develop writing \u2014 as far as historians can tell. We have dated their baked clay cuneiform tables up to 6,000 years old. Nations close to Sumer have been called by historians, the \u201cNear East\u201d which includes India. It is interesting that nearly all of the Holy Books of World Religion began here. Persia became a world Empire when she conquered the Near East and absorbed its cultures. Greece became a world Empire when she conquered Persia and absorbed Near East cultures. Rome became a world Empire when she conquered Greece absorbed Near East cultures. Europe became a global force when she picked up the pieces of fallen Rome and stood on the shoulders of the global culture of the Near East. In the West, this is easily illustrated by the honored place of the Old Testament in Western culture. Outside the West, I find it significant that the earliest Chinese script shares many characters in common with Egyptian hieroglyphics. There are many factors \u2014 yet I believe that the factor of WRITING was the key factor that we can materially trace, that shows the earliest examples of civilization that the rest of the world ultimately followed \u2014 at varying paces. There\u2019s my reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Societies that are manned with people with positive and realistic attitudes will know and accept that the only thing constant in this world is change. Therefore, they will adapt quickly resulting in fast changes. Societies that have members who are stuck in the rut of religious rituals, rites and rules, who cannot accept or adjust to newer concepts will be slow or stagnated. The world is changing everyday. Indians are learning this slowly but we are lagging behind because we are obsessed with religion. ",
