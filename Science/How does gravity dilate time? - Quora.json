            "answer_text": "You asked a simple question, but appear to have received many a complicated answer. This is great if you're incredibly well versed in astrophysics or quantum mechanics, but, given the simplicity of your question, I would assume you/folks curious about the same to not be so. It is actually incredibly simple. First of all, to answer your question directly? Gravity does *not* dilate time. It just doesn't! \u201cNo!\u201d you surely shout in frustration, \u201cthis cannot be so! Time dilation exists. And time dilation is strictly regulated in the presence of gravity. Therefore, how does gravity causes time dilation?\u201d Instead, it is as simple as this: It is one and the same. \u201cGravity\u201d - meaning space itself - and \u201ctime dilation\u201d are two separate yet intertwined processes of the same exact thing. You've surely heard tell of \u201cspacetime\u201d, right? Well, there you go! Spacetime is one big bundle that results in 4d -four dimensional- space *and* time as we know them to surely be. There\u2019s good \u2018ol up-down, left-right, back-forward, and then time: past/present/future. But that bundle is inexplicably linked together as one, such that when energy/matter (since they're one and the same) comes together to distort that little 4D bundle, the implications take place across *ALL FOUR* dimensions\u2026 and doing so all at once, as one! This\u2026? Well, this results in the warping of 3D space -GRAVITY- and the extra little 1D time -TIME DILATION-! So then, it is *NOT* gravity that causes time dilation. Gravity is just a consequence of the same process as causes time dilation - the two are both the same as being reactions to something else, and not instead an action (gravity) and the reaction (time dilation). So think of gravity and time dilation together! Matter/energy causes *BOTH* to get warped around it. Matter/energy wrecks havoc on 4D spacetime, and the consequence for 3d space is gravity, whilst the implications for 1d time are time dilation. Now then, acceleration/movement also causes time dilation: In essence, the opposite of a mass bending spacetime inward would be to \u201cstretch\u201d it, or, since we can't really have negative mass, this means acceleration across it. Yet again, however, it is much the same deal as before: Acceleration causes implications for both aspects of spacetime: You move across/accelerate through 3d space, and then suffer much the same for 1d time. Since they are both still linked - space AND time - we indeed see the exact opposite implications for time as we do for space when it comes to movement and matter. Space is \u201cthinned out\u201d rather than \u201cbunched together\u201d with movement, and so time moves faster rather than slower. But gravity does *NOT* cause time dilation directly! Indeed, think of it this way, as well: Acceleration causes time to move \u201cfaster\u201d, right? Well, gravity is an accelerating force! If this were so - if *gravity* causes time dilation - then a black hole would not find time to be slowed to nothing at all, but just the reverse. But that's starting to get a little bit confusing. So again, it is as simple as the fact that space and time are one and the same. Warping space yields gravity. Warping time yields time dilation. Matter warps spacetime as one, and then movement/acceleration causes the opposite effects to it. Gravity and time dilation are both direct consequences of warping spacetime, rather than gravity causing time dilation directly. ",

            "answer_text": "How does gravity dilate time? Time dilation under varying strengths of gravity is a mechanical property of atoms. It is a mechanical effect governed by the principles of atomic gravity. Each element has a natural frequency of vibration and this natural vibration is used to calibrate atomic clocks. In atomic clocks the natural frequency of atomic vibration changes as the acceleration due to gravity changes. Even a pendulum type clocks vary due to the principles of atomic gravity. Atomic Gravity Summary The principles of atomic gravity are based on atomic nuclei motion which are easy to understand and easy to apply across many fields of scientific research and interests. It is a must triple read for anyone interested in innovation to how gravity works and to how gravity interlinks across the sciences. Understanding the principles of atomic gravity gives anyone trying to unify gravity and quantum behavior an ideal chance for success. Gravity at the atomic scale happens 24/7 inside us and all around us here on earth and is ubiquitous throughout the observable universe. Nature itself has followed a set of unified principles without question or hesitation for many millennia and it is only recently that academic science has obtained the opportunity to capitalize from what nature has known since the beginning of time. Most importantly the principles of atomic gravity are the missing link to unifying the four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear) of nature. The natural sciences are now linked and understood under a single umbrella of principles. The three natural laws of atomic gravity are demonstrated in a multitude of existing experimental data sets and in both current and past observations. This co-relationship between the laws of atomic gravity and observation is something to be expected. Below is a simplified summary of the principles presented for easy learning. Remember a triple read may be necessary. Three Laws of \u201cAtomic Gravitational Fluctuation\u201d (AGF) AGF 1 (Type 1) Consider a system of a planet and it's one orbiting moon. Physical Factors: 1) The total mass (gravity signature (GRS)) of each structure. 2) The distance between the central gravitational points of each structure. 3) The relative velocity of each structure. Now consider a single atom on the surface of the planet. The nucleus of the atom is shifted relative to its central point toward the central gravitational point of the planet. As the moon transits over the atom, the nucleus of the atom, contained inside its electron sphere shifts towards and tracks the moon relative to its transiting velocity. The slight shift of the nucleus is relative to its own central point and away from the central point of the planet; toward the transiting center of the moon, tracking the moon\u2019s transit and then resettling back to its original position prior to the moon's transit. This effect on the atom is called atomic gravitational fluctuation type 1 (AGF 1). Note: During the moon's transit the energy transfer from moon to atom does not utilize nuclear fission, fusion or any external electromagnetic radiant energy input. It is a simple force concentrated in each atom which twice daily moves millions/billions of tons of ocean water. The force also does not break the chemical bond of water molecules\u2019 by such a low frequency of atomic gravitational fluctuation induced by the moon's daily transit. Atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF 1) occurring in any gravitationally bound planetary and moon system interacts within the constraints of the structure of each individual orbiting body. Each atom\u2019s nucleus fluctuation is dependent on its position within the atomic environmental structure (AES) of either the moon or the planetary body and the relative AGF 1 inputs. Interaction is more observable in large structures of atoms in their fluid state (Within chemical or rheological properties) within the interior, on the surface, or in any atmosphere present within each system. Atmospheric fluids of great relative depth will demonstrate a more robust accumulated system reaction to the external AGF 1 energy input. Systems like the Sun, Saturn, Jupiter, and Neptune all demonstrate this characteristic making atomic gravity a unifying principle in astrophysics. Atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF 1) in each atom in the atmosphere, at the surface, or in the interior of a planet is constantly influenced by the relative alignments to its Sun or moon(s) and any additional planetary systems or areas of matter contained within its solar system. Observations indicate that individual solar systems demonstrate the influence of atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF 1) interaction with its central galactic black hole and with all other areas of gravity signature bound into the galactic structure. AGF 1 demonstrates the far reaching influences to both the very small and the very large. Experimental Note: Feb. 2018 a new portable atomic clock experiment shows time dilation is a mechanical property of atoms supporting the principle of atomic gravitational fluctuation . \u201cFor The First Time, a Portable Atomic Clock Has Been Used to Measure Gravity\u201d . This atomic clock experiment indicates that academia is finally learning and experimenting with the principles of atomic gravity even know the teams interpretation of the observations requires improvement. The principles of atomic gravity goes head to head with Einstein on this one! Another example of atomic gravity in action is the measured weight change of a constant mass under varying accelerations due to a change in gravitational field strength. Since the number of atoms that form the mass is constant the weight change is happening at the atomic scale. Check out this cool YouTube video to better understand the difference between mass and weight:  Note: Behavior of AGF 1 in gravitationally bound systems separated by voids of space induce a relatively low frequency of AGF within each atom, however the accumulated results are easily observable when occurring within the correct atomic environmental structure (AES) conditions, like in our oceans and atmosphere. Tidal force is the metaphor used to explain this type of energy (AGF 1) transfer. AGF 2 (Type 2) AGF 2 utilizes the same principle occurring in AGF 1 \u2014 that being the nucleus of the atom is shifted relative to its central point by a localized kinetic energy input. The kinetic input utilized to produce AGF 2 in atoms, can occur in all gravitationally bound atomic environmental structures (AES) which exist in a void of space. AGF 2 is a well understood observable influence which creates a multitude of effects within the Earth\u2019s structure. Waves produced by throwing pebbles into water or the sound of a singing bird are a few examples. This process is currently well understood and is easily observed and measured. Acoustic gas thermometry experiments are making great strides in observing this principle. Note: Behavior of AGF 2 within individual AES systems contained by voids of space (Planet Earth and the Sun are two examples) generally induce a midrange frequency of AGF within each atom in the system when compared to AGF 1 \u2014 the kinetic input tends to be of a localized nature, like the ringing of a bell or the shaking of the ground. Sound waves and seismic waves are a few metaphors used to generally describe this type of energy (AGF 2) transfer. Vibronic spectroscopy is a method used to study the kinetic energy analysis of energy fluctuations introduced to the quantum atoms. The energy fluctuations introduced by vibration (kinetic energy) to the quantum atom is equivalent to the analysis of atomic gravitational fluctuation; type 2 (AGF 2). Experimental Note: A recent publication (July 2018) from the Department of Physics, Center for Theoretical Physics, Columbia University describes sound wave and gravity interactions. The Columbia University\u2019s team analysis of the sound waves show the principles of atomic gravity are essential to improving the understanding of interconnected physics in the natural world. This recent publication indicates that academia is finally learning and experimenting with the principles of atomic gravity\u2026.. however the interpretation of the observations has some room for improvement. AGF 3 (Type 3) AGF 3 utilizes the same principle as AGF 1 \u2014 that being that the nucleus of the atom is shifted relative to its central point by a kinetic input induced into the nucleus from electron flow. As electrons flow into or through a system of appropriate atomic environmental structure each atom has induced AGF introduced. Each nucleus\u2019s rate of fluctuation is dependent on its position within the atomic environmental structure AES, and the relative amount of electron flow through the structure. In general, increasing electron flow through a similar AES will also increase the radiant energy and sound waves emitted. This process is currently well understood and is utilized and controlled in many electrical products and systems. AGF 3 effects are easily observed in the many types of light bulbs and in natural phenomenon. Note: Behavior of AGF 3 within individual (AES) systems , generally induces a high frequency of AGF within each atom in the system when compared to AGF 1 \u2014 occurring both naturally and by design and is controlled by electron flow or lower energy density input from electromagnetic radiant energy (light spectrum). The relative (compared to electron flow) reduced energy density input occurring from electromagnetic radiant energy will induce a lower intensity of AGF in the atom. The aurora australis and aurora borealis are natural examples. The heating element in a kitchen toaster is manmade example. \u201cExcitation\u201d of the atom is the metaphor used to generally explain this type of energy (AGF 3) transfer. Note: Luminescence, fluorescence, phosphorescence, and photoluminescence are a few examples of categories of AGF 3 which occur when lower energy density input interacts within specific atomic environmental structure (AES). Atomic emission spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy are some methods used to study the electromagnetic radiant energy emission or absorption initiated by energy fluctuations introduced to quantum atoms. The energy fluctuations introduced by electron flow or electromagnetic radiant energy interactions with the quantum atom are equivalent to the analysis of atomic gravitational fluctuation; type 3 (AGF 3). The Pound\u2013Rebka experiment conducted in 1959 at Harvard University is a well known experiment that focuses on the change of the resonant frequency of atoms due to a changed gravitational field strength demonstrating this change in atomic resonant frequency is a mechanical property of atoms not related to general relativity but directly related to the principles of atomic gravity. Again the principles of atomic gravity go head to head with Einstein ! :) \u201c It is true that many are still being taught that space with the lowest energy density known and time with no energy density at all has the ability guide the orbits of the stars and planets.\u201d Diagrams The following diagrams illustrate nuclei kinetics inside the atom due to atomic gravitational fluctuation. However, it should be understood that it is a visual representation of the actual movement, utilized for easier understanding of the principle, and not to be used as an exact mathematical model of the behavior. Note: The mathematical unifying equation is still up for the taking and I can and will help anyone or team interested with this challenge. The following illustrations are a simple visual representation of atomic gravitational fluctuation in action. Three Atoms in deep Space (AGF 2)  The nucleus of each atom is attracted to the center of the system. Three Atoms on the surface of the Earth (AGF 2)  The nucleus of each atom is attracted to the center of the earth. Three Atoms on the surface of the Earth within the Moon\u2019s Gravitational Influence (Interaction of AGF 1 & AGF 2)  The nucleus of each atom is attracted to the center of the moon, in conjunction with the attraction to the center of the earth. Three Atoms on the surface of the Earth within the Moon\u2019s Gravitational Influence (Interaction of AGF 1 & AGF 2)  The nucleus of each atom is attracted to the center of the moon, in conjunction with the attraction to the center of the earth. Single Atom in Space with no external gravitational influence  The nucleus shares the central point of the atom\u2019s electron sphere in this hypothetical situation, of an atom alone in space with no external gravitational influence. The truth is that AGF 1 reaches out to all atoms within a galaxy and between gravitational interactive galactic structures. Note: The shape of an atom\u2019s electron sphere is minimally altered when alone in space. When its twin is a part of an atomic environmental structure (AES) like a moon, planet, or star, then the twin\u2019s electron sphere is altered relative to its position within that atomic environmental structure (AES). Generally as you move inward toward the core of any moon, planet, or star, pressure and temperature increases and each atom's structural response is relatively altered. Applying the simple principles of atomic gravity leads to a path of discovery and innovation. The ocean tides daily flow and ebb is now understood at the atomic scale. The simple principles can be applied to help understand observations in the atmospheres of the sun, Jupiter and Saturn. My favorite is applying the principles to solve for the storms of Neptune. Nuclei kinetics and Einstein's Equivalence Principle at the atomic scale. \u201cZERO-G\u201d Flight at the Atomic Scale Many people have experienced the sensation of weightlessness created in zero-g flights inside aircraft cabins traveling through Earth\u2019s atmosphere. However the active physics enabling this sensation in the human body has been little understood. To understand what is going on at the atomic scale requires an understanding of atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF). So to gain a perspective let\u2019s send an atom on a similar ride through the atmosphere. Isaac Newton\u2019s third law of motion states: \u201cWhen one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.\u201d The effects on the atom at all points along the ride demonstrate a unification with Isaac Newton\u2019s third law of motion. The effects shown on the single atom going on the ride can be applied to the many atoms that make-up the entire structure of a human body. These ubiquitous atomic fluctuations in the body\u2019s structure are shared by all people who experience acceleration or deceleration in everyday activities. Atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF) occurs within calculable parameters and conforms to what we feel during each experience. Each atom that makes up the typical human body responds the same as to the single atom shown on its flight. So climb aboard and let\u2019s take a ride to \u201cZero-G\u201d. Atom in the parked Aircraft  The atom is held to the seat by the Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d The nucleus is held directly below the center of the electron sphere Aircraft accelerating up into the Atmosphere  The atom is held to the seat by the Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d in conjunction with the resultant force \u201cB\u201d produced by the aircraft's upward acceleration \u201cA\u201d into the atmosphere. The nucleus takes up a position between forces \u201cG\u201d and \u201cB\u201d during the upward acceleration. Aircraft in level non-accelerating flight  The atom is held to the seat by the Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d The nucleus is held directly below the center of the electron sphere. The same effect demonstrated by the atom in the parked aircraft. The only acceleration in play is Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d Aircraft accelerating downward equal to \u201cG\u201d  The atom are now floating above the seat when the force \u201cB\u201d imitated by the downward acceleration \u201cA\u201d of the plane is now equal and opposite to Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d at that point in altitude with respect to the gravitational central point of the Earth. The nucleus is now at the center of the electron sphere. The duration and smoothness of the \u201cZero-G\u201d experience is determined by several factors. First \u2014 the aircraft's limitation to its maximum operating altitude \u2014 limits the duration at \u201cZero-G\u201d experience within safe flight parameters. Second, the pilot\u2019s skills in maintaining downward acceleration equal to the Earth's increasing gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d relative to decreasing altitude. Maintaining the appropriate acceleration downward is a technically difficult maneuver that incorporates the abilities of aircraft and pilot. International space station (ISS) \u2014 the same \u201cZero-G\u201d sensation felt for only brief cycles during the aircraft's parabolic flight is experienced 24/7 on the ISS. The nuclei of each atom that makes up the structure of the human body will remain at the center of the electron sphere during orbit on the ISS. The changing distance and relative velocities to the central gravitational points of the earth, moon, and sun during its orbit induce only micro atomic gravitational fluctuations. Humans have evolved in conjunction with Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d \u2014the human body and its functions (eyes, muscles, digestion, etc...) quickly fail in \u201cZero-G\u201d in space (E1). Applying the principles of atomic gravity will help solve the physical issues in future space travel. AGF Generalization The human body consists of a multitude of atomic structure. Each atom is uniquely connected structurally \u2014 however each nucleus reacts the same to external accelerations at the atomic scale. Isaac Newton\u2019s three laws of motion are unified with atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF) principles. The principles of atomic gravity unify electromagnetism, gravity and kinetics. When riding in a vehicle and that vehicle comes to a sudden stop \u2014 atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF) throughout the structure of the body occurs. The following diagram is of a single atom \u2014 which is part of the body\u2019s structure \u2014shown with the accelerating forces acting on it. This single atom and its behavior can be applied to the overall atomic structure of the body. This example demonstrates a stopping deceleration that is equal to the acceleration of Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d.  During non-accelerating forward motion \u201cM\u201d the nucleus is held to point \u201cA\u201d by Earth\u2019s gravity acceleration force \u201cG\u201d \u2014 during a smooth deceleration \u201cD\u201d \u2014 prior to stopping \u2014 the nucleus smoothly curves around the center of the electron sphere to point \u201cB\u201d then smoothly curves relative to the center of the electron sphere \u2014 back to point \u201cA\u201d upon stopping. These ubiquitous atomic movements in the body\u2019s structure are shared by all people who experience acceleration or deceleration in everyday activities. Atomic gravitational fluctuation (AGF) occurs within calculable parameters and conforms to what we feel during each experience of changing accelerations. In this energy balanced scenario\u2014 the nucleus follows curve \u201cC\u201d from point \u201cA\u201d to point \u201cB\u201d and back to point \u201cA\u201d \u2014 Curve \u201cC\u201d is correlated to the brachistochrone curve. An atomic scale explanation to why use of the wheel is the most efficient mode of contact land travel. Vibronic spectroscopy is a method used to study the kinetic energy analysis of energy fluctuations introduced to quantum atoms. The energy fluctuations introduced by vibration (kinetic energy inputs) to quantum atoms is equivalent to the analysis of atomic gravitational fluctuation; type 2 (AGF 2) Utilizing vibronic spectroscopy relative to various acceleration inputs and relative to various atomic environmental structure (AES) mediums will lead to a better understanding to curve \u201cc\u201d in all scenarios\u2019. Section Conclusion The ubiquitous effects of atomic gravitational fluctuation on each quantum atom applied to atomic structures is necessary to understand the natural mechanism controlling gravity and the experience of acceleration or deceleration in everyday activities. When taking a ride on public transit or an amusement park roller-coaster \u2014 a passenger experiences atomic gravitational fluctuation within the body\u2019s structure. The public transit or roller-coaster effects usually occur in a quick succession of dips, curves and stops when compared to the smooth acceleration required to maintain an extended zero \u201cG\u201d experience in an aircraft. We all experience and share gravitational fluctuation effects at the atomic scale daily. Biological life evolves and conforms within the principles presented and successful life on earth has evolved to be effective \u201cenergy balanced atomic anti-gravity beings\u201d with respect to the unique structure of each species.
