            "answer_text": "One reason cell growth is limited is \u201cdiffusion\u201d (surface area-to-volume ratio). The cell is designed to handle nutrient and waste transport in and out of the cell according to its size and this transport action is directly affected by the growth of the cell, which is where the surface area-to-volume aspect comes into play. When the cell grows too large the rate of diffusion suffers and the cell can become toxic with waste and want for nutrients which can lead to cell death. So, diffusion doesn\u2019t really limit the size a cell can grow to but rather it functions within the specific surface area-to-volume ratio limitation of the particular cell. There are exceptions however. What limits cell size ? ",

            "answer_text": "As a cell increases in size, its volume increases at a faster rate than its surface area. Therefore, there is less surface area for diffusion to support the greater volume. The smaller a cell is, the closer its surface area to volume ratio is to 1, maximizing diffusion to support the volume. ",
