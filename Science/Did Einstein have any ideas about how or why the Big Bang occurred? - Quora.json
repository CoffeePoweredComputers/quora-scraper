            "answer_text": "Yes. He believed that an all powerful creator created the universe, not necessarily in an instant in time, and it was his (Einsteins) job to find out how he did it. Hence, his work that consumed the latter part of his life in trying to find the Grand Theory of Everything. Unfortunately, despite using every bit of his intellect, Einstein never came close to figuring it out. There was a reason for this. The trouble is with human reasoning. We don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know. This may seem like an obvious statement. But let us assume that there are many forces and fields in, and around, our universe, of which we have no idea, and cannot even imagine. Let us consider one possible force. Taking the simplest atom, hydrogen: what keeps the electrons in motion. I am not talking about relative masses and energies, I am talking about motion, or dynamic forces. You see, the atom is a machine in a universe full of machines. And all, yes all, machines have losses. So, for an atom to be stable for billions of years, it requires dynamic forces, external to the actual atom. And of course, this applies to every atom in the universe. The implications of this are profound. It means that our universe is actually controlled by forces outside of it. Now, Einstein had some ideas about this, but the idea means that it is impossible to come up with a Grand Theory of Everything, using forces of which we are presently aware. But if anyone could ever come close to figuring things out, it would have been Einstein, maybe collaborating with Nikola Tesla, James Clerk Maxwell, and Isaac Newton. ",

            "answer_text": "No, in fact Einstein was quite surprised by the revelation of redshift. Prior to Hubble\u2019s discovery of redshift and additional galaxies, the prevailing belief was that we lived inside of a static, (single) island galaxy universe. Einstein introduced his non-zero constant into GR in an attempt to explain a \u2018static\u201d universe that didn\u2019t collapse under it\u2019s own weight. When he found out about Hubble\u2019s discovery, he set his constant back to zero and claimed stated that the introduction of his non-zero constant into GR theory was his \u2018greatest blunder\u2019. Today that non-zero constant is associated with \u2018dark energy\u2019. When Einstein was first introduced to Lemaitre\u2019s \u201cbig bang\u201d concept, and the notion of \u2018space expansion\u201d, he called it \u2018abominable physics\u2019 and he initially rejected the concept. Only after meeting with Lemaitre did he eventually come to accept the model. ",

            "answer_text": "That is one of those big philosophical questions that has no answer and never will. Have read number of biographies of Einstein and he was never big on answering why questions unless it directly related to the determinism of cause and effect. He was a believer in God at some point in his life but his insights on that are no more profound than anyone else. He once suggested that quantum theory based on probability didn't sit correct with him because he believed that God \u201cwouldn't play dice with the universe.\u201d However, that doesn't tell you why it all started.
