            "answer_text": "Simple extinction coefficient is a measure of the rate of transmitted light via scattering and absorption for a medium. However, in analytical chemistry, the quantity \u03f5 (epsilon) is called the molar absorptivity (\u03f5molar) or extinction coefficient.Molar absorptivity refers to the characteristics of a substance that tells how much light is absorbed at a particular wavelength. Whereas the specific absorption coefficient refers to the absorbance of light per unit path length, usually expressed in cm, and per unit of mass concentration. The molar absorbtivity coeffecient refers to the absorbance of light per unit path length and per unit of concentration expressed in \u201cmoles per liter.\u201d The term molar extinction coefficient (\u03b5) is a measure of how strongly a chemical species or substance absorbs light at a particular wavelength. It is an intrinsic property of chemical species that is dependent upon their chemical composition and structure..The molar extinction coefficient is frequently used in spectroscopy to measure the concentration of a chemical in solution. This quantity measures the inherent property of a substance to absorb radiation at a specific wavelength..  You can use the Beer-Lambert Law to calculate a chemical species\u2019 \u03b5: As per Beer -Lambert law, the quantity of light absorbed by a substance dissolved in a fully transmitting solvent is directly proportional to the concentration of the substance and the path length of the light through the solution. A =\u03b5Lc Where: A is the amount of light absorbed by the sample for a particular wavelength\u03b5 is the molar extinction coefficientL is the distance that the light travels through the solutionc is the concentration of the absorbing species per unit volume\u2026The \u03b5 of a solution can be determined by technique called SPECTROPHOTOMETRY, is a method to measure how much a chemical substance absorbs light by measuring the intensity of light as a beam of light passes through sample solution. The basic principle is that each compound absorbs or transmits light over a certain range of wavelength\u2026For simple cases, The solution of a substance is prepared of particular concentration(say 1 molar) then its absorbance is determined over a range of wavelengths(say 300 to 600)nm by varying through small increments like 10 or 5 units i.e starting e.g at 300 nm and checking absorbance then changing wavelength to 305 or 310 nm and measuring again absorbance for same solution till say 600nm depending upin range choosed..now plotting Absorbance against varying lamda following curve on top is obtained\u2026on this curve there is lambda corresponding to which absorbance is maximum called Lambda max..Taking this lambda and setting spectrophotimeter at this lambda\u2026Now prepare various concentarions of the same solutions(say 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4 ,0.5,0.6 0.7\u2026molar) solutions and determining absorbance of each of these solutions of different concentrations at lambda max obtained from above curve\u2026..since A =\u03b5Lc L is known and on plotting Absorbances against corresponding concentarions will give us a staright line passing through origin\u2026.From the slope of this graph epsilon can be calculated\u2026. by measuring slope of the graph\u2026And L is known from the lenth of cell or quvett(quartz or glass) used for solution\u2026HENCE FOR SIMPLE SOLUTIONS MOLAR EXTICTION COEFFIECIENT CAN BE CALCULATED EASILY\u2026hope u r satisfied",
