            "answer_text": "A very common misconception is that concentration gradient is the fundamental driving force of diffusion. While concentration gradient is the driving force of diffusion in a single-phase medium, it is not the true driving force in a multi-phase medium. In any medium, the chemical potential gradient is the fundamental driving force. I\u2019ll explain this with a simple example: When you eat a chili pepper, your tongue feels like it\u2019s on fire when it comes in contact with capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers. How do you neutralize the burning effects of chili peppers? A common solution is to drink alcohol or something rich in fat (e.g. whole milk or chocolate). This works because capsaicin is highly soluble in alcohol and fat, whereas it\u2019s relatively insoluble in water (so drinking water is ineffective to tame the spiciness). Now let\u2019s say there\u2019s a tank with two halves, separated by a membrane that allows for the diffusion of capsaicin molecules only. The left side contains a large volume water, and the right side has a small volume of cream (fat-rich). The water phase initially has a high concentration of capsaicin, while the cream has none. This is the hypothetical tank:  It\u2019s quite obvious that because capsaicin is fat-soluble and relatively water-insoluble, it will flow across the membrane from the higher to lower concentration. When the phases have reached equilibrium, there will be more capsaicin in the cream than in the water. Because the cream has a lower volume, the concentration of capsaicin in the cream is greater than the concentration in the water. In other words, the capsaicin traveled up the concentration gradient, diffusing from a lower concentration to a higher concentration. If we\u2019re tracking chemical potential instead, the chemical potential in each species is the same at equilibrium. So while capsaicin has diffused up the concentration gradient (which seems counterintuitive) it has diffused down the chemical potential gradient due to its preference for the fat-rich cream over the water. To generalize this, chemicals diffuse down their chemical potential gradients, while they may diffuse up or down their concentration gradients. Therefore, the chemical potential gradient is more fundamental as a driving force for diffusion. The exception to this is diffusion in a single-phase medium, in which concentration gradient is acceptable as a surrogate for chemical potential gradient. ",

            "answer_text": "Your assumption is wrong. The chemical potential, that is the change in free energy per mole of substance, refers to the change in free energy not just for chemical reactions but for phase changes and transport as well. It covers a multitude of processes such as osmosis, evaporation, surface tension, and more. It refers to the change in free energy of a molecule when it goes from one state to another. The two states could be physical or chemical. ",
