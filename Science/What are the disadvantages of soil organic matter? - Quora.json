A nicely balanced soil has organic material (humus), soluble minerals, insoluble inorganic mineral content such a silica/sand, water and air. I\u2019ve got students to work out how much of each way back by drying out and toasting over a bunsen etc. If soil was ALL organic then when it gets wet it gets soggy ,sodden wet with little air spaces possible. It won\u2019t drain well and may become anaerobic easily. Any nitrogen compounds forming from decaying organic components would be converted by bacteria to elemental nitrogen gas and lost. As peaty compost you are getting pretty close to having just organic matter. But in nature it forms soggy bogs. In greenhouse bags you can grow things quite well since the depth is not huge and the drainage is thus easier. Feeding dissolved minerals (fertiliser) is of course essential. As pot compost it has the disadvantage of being difficult to re-wet if it gets dry (a spot of detergent can help!) plus it has little weight compared to John Innes soil-based composts so your top heavy plants then fall over when they get dry.
