            "answer_text": "Ilya Taytslin already pointed out that exoplanets have been discovered that orbit neutron stars and white dwarfs, in which the diameter of the planet is larger than the (more massive) object it orbits. However, some might argue those shouldn\u2019t be considered \u201cstars\u201d, but former stars, since they no longer undergo nuclear fusion. If so, then the smallest stars that qualify would be red dwarfs. Even the smallest red dwarf is much more massive than any planet \u2014 but it is not that much larger in size: diameter can be as little as 20% more than that of Jupiter. As for planets, they can get a good bit larger than that: 2\u20134 times the diameter of Jupiter. So it is certainly POSSIBLE. I don\u2019t know if they have actually FOUND such a system, however. I know they found one last year where the planet is ~70% the diameter of its star, but I don\u2019t know of one where it\u2019s actually >100%. Most likely scenario might be a \u201chot Jupiter\u201d, orbiting extremely close to a red dwarf star, since the heat causes their atmosphere to swell to abnormally large sizes. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are talking about mass, and that is the usual sense of the word in dealing with celestial bodies, it is not possible. The only thing more massive would be another star, whether in active fusion, a white dwarf, or a neutron star, i.e., a defunct star. ",
