            "answer_text": "Applications of Piezoelectric Crystal The applications of Piezoelectric-crystal include the following. The best application of piezoelectric crystal is an electric cigarette lighter.The common application of a piezoelectric-crystal energy source is to create a tiny motor.The piezoelectric-crystals are embedded within the shoe sole of a shoe to generate electrical energy for every step. This could be applied within the instruments like cell phones, torches, etc.Thus, this is all about piezoelectric-crystals. From the above information finally, we can conclude that in the future, piezoelectric crystallized road technology can be used to protect the border roads. This technology uses a sensor to find the enemies permeation. If this technology comes to reality there will be a chance to be an electricity production plant. ",
