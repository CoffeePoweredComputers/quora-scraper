Regularly buy them some age appropriate science books; describe how science is the search for why things work the way that they do. Buy them some science oriented toys. Get them interested in dinosaurs, early humans, etc. Ask them to figure out things, like how the ancient Egyptians built those pyramids, or how Stonehenge was built. Take advantage of happenings to tell them about how things work (e..g., solar or lunar eclipses). ",
