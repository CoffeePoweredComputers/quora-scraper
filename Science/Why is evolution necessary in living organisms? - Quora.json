            "answer_text": "First of all, it is not really organisms that evolve: they undergo mutations during their lifetime that may be transmitted to their offspring, and over time, change the characteristics of the population. The main explanation for why evolution occurs, is that without the variety it introduces between individual organisms of a population, the species is very likely doomed for extinction. The environment may seem stable, but over linger timescales it is an ever-changing backdrop, that poses new challenges to successive generations. Continental drift, volcanic eruptions and meteorites can effect climate change, so in the long run, nothing stays the same. So organisms that create perfect copies of themselves are vulnerable to extinction. And if there ever were populations of such organisms, they have lost out in the struggle for their continued existence. Only populations in which the organisms made errors in copying their genetic information contained within their resulting variety those lucky few who could cope with the changed environment they encountered, and in which their forebears would have been hopelessly lost. There was no foresight, no planning, only happenstance. This is why species should be expected to evolve over time. In short: evolution inevitably evolves evolvability. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not \u201cnecessary\u201d in the sense that it is a prerequisite, it is \u201cnecessary\u2019 in the sense that there is no way to avoid it (though there are strategies to mitigate/retard its effects). It\u2019s pretty simple: If an organism can reproduce, then it can reproduce imperfectly. Imperfect reproduction of genes (the stuff the determines what\u2019s inherited) is called \u201cmutation\u201d. Some mutations \u2014 however rare \u2014 will make it more likely that the bearers of the mutation will survive, reproduce, and pass on the mutation in their genes. Organisms more likely to survive and pass on their genes will tend to produce offspring with their mutation. The survival-enhancing mutation will become more common. That seems pretty logical to me. If it doesn\u2019t to you, find the flaw. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s evolution. ",
