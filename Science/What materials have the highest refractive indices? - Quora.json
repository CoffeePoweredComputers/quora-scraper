            "answer_text": "The refractive index(RI) cannot be compared without first knowing the frequency of the incoming radiation. It is decided based on the ratio of speed of light in both media, the medium's permittivity and the final direction of propagation.  Under natural conditions, the record highest refractive index is 4.05 for the element Germanium, but in the IR range only. It drops to lower values in the visible region and others. There was a man-made meta-material with a whopping positive RI of 38.6 aimed at skin cancer treatment developed in 2011. The frequency to achieve this number is around 0.35 THz.[1]   Another meta-material with the most extreme refractive index is -109 (negative index, but the highest achieved as of 2015).[2]  Even a well-tailored man-made structure is limited to a frequency range for its best refractive performance.

            "answer_text": "This question is meaningless without specifying what frequency or wavelength you're interested in.  Dispersion (optics) For optical wavelength ranges, many semiconductors have very high refractive indices (around 4).  Up until UV, most metals actually have an imaginary refractive index because they have a negative electric permittivity.  By using wavelength-scale structures, you can create meta-materials with extremely high, extremely low (less than 1), imaginary and even negative refractive indices near a specific frequency but not in other frequency ranges.  But these very large or well-tailored refractive indices are only in a narrow wavelength range, and will have to come with some high loss in some other frequency range (i.e. germanium has high IR refractive index but very high loss in the visible range). For RF and lower frequencies, you can find ferroelectric materials with extremely high refractive indices (on the order of 10 or higher). ",
