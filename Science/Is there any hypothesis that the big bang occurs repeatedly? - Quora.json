            "answer_text": "I clicked \"answer\" and was just about ready to type \"No\", and nothing else when inspiration hit. Thinking about this question, my response emerged from the following thought: Is there any way for someone to tell what happened before you were born or after you die?  Of course.  You can look for information.  You can look for birth records, death certificates, history books, etc.  Information is evidence.  Information is generated by the process of you being born, living, and dying.  But even information must be stored in something.  A fluctuation of the energy level of some particle?  Suppose it were possible to store information such as the number of the universe we're currently in, in whatever is the most infinitesimally small thing, and that thing were able to survive the Big Crunch and spring anew in the new universe unchanged.  Suppose further that we discovered a way to encode this information such that it is universally available -- no need to be found in one particular spot in the new universe.  The problem is that the new universe would have to similarly evolve to a point where something could learn to interpret the information stored by the previous universe inhabitants.  Let alone make sense of it.  Could it be that the \"cosmic background radiation\" is encoded information that we just don't know how to decode, for example?  Could it be that the \"dark energy\" is packets of information?  Are black holes portals from past/future universes that other beings are trying to communicate with us through?  It gets a bit absurd... So you're stuck.  Even if we are able to somehow encode some information in a way that we believe will be decipherable by future universes, how can we be sure?  Like the efforts to identify universally recognizable signage indicating \"DANGER\" to place on or near nuclear waste, or the beautifully encoded plaques we've placed on deep-space probes.  How can we be sure that whoever gets it will be able to understand it?  Any probe we've sent out surely won't survive the Big Crunch.  And if we choose to just encode the number of our universe, the software engineer in me wonders \"would we start from zero or one?\" ",

            "answer_text": "Well that's if you believe in the elasticity or contraction of the universe. This is a resounding debate at the moment. New data and theories regarding dark energy have changed our view of either an entropy expanding, or elastic expansion. We now see that there are other possibilities. I believe the elasticity Theory is now one of five such theories. Now, if it were true, that the universe will expand to its limit and then contract back to a single gravitational singularity, then absolutely the potential for another big bang is there. It is theorized that our big bang wasn't the first. Now, would it repeat itself? In the Grande sense yes. But if you mean in a finite sense such as another Milky Way, Sun, Earth....no. At least not that we have been able to deduce thus far. String theory suggests that all particles are connected, therefore if this holds true even in a singularity, than it is possible for matter to reorganize in a way it did before. But I don't see that being likely, I don't believe that string theory is that uniform, to suggest this, it would suggest we have no choices, just destiny. Everything is preordained (by a deity or otherwise). I don't choose to believe that. Not that I refute the Theory, because I don't have a means to disprove it. Just that I would rather pursue other viable theories first. ",
