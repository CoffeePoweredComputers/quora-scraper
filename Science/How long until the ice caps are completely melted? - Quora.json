Here are some other alarmist climate predictions you probably missed: 1. \u201cDue to global warming, the coming winters in the local regions will become milder.\u201d Stefan Rahmstorf, Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, University of Potsdam, February 8, 2006 **** 2. \u201cMilder winters, drier summers: Climate study shows a need to adapt in Saxony Anhalt.\u201d Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Press Release, January 10, 2010. **** 3. \u201cMore heat waves, no snow in the winter\u2026 Climate models\u2026 over 20 times more precise than the UN IPCC global models. In no other country do we have more precise calculations of climate consequences. They should form the basis for political planning\u2026 Temperatures in the wintertime will rise the most\u2026 there will be less cold air coming to Central Europe from the east\u2026In the Alps winters will be 2\u00b0C warmer already between 2021 and 2050.\u201d Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, September 2, 2008. **** 4. \u201cThe new Germany will be characterized by dry-hot summers and warm-wet winters.\u201d Wilhelm Gerstengarbe and Peter Werner, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), March 2, 2007 **** 5. \u201cClear climate trends are seen from the computer simulations. Foremost the winter months will be warmer all over Germany. Depending of CO2 emissions, temperatures will rise by up to 4\u00b0C, in the Alps by up to 5\u00b0C.\u201d Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, 7 Dec 2009. **** 6. \u201cIn summer under certain conditions the scientists reckon with a complete melting of the Arctic sea ice. For Europe we expect an increase in drier and warmer summers. Winters on the other hand will be warmer and wetter.\u201d Erich Roeckner, Max Planck Institute, Hamburg, 29 Sept 2005. **** 7. \u201cThe more than \u2018unusually \u2018warm January weather is yet \u2018another extreme event\u2019, \u2018a harbinger of the winters that are ahead of us\u2019. \u2026 The global temperature will \u2018increase every year by 0.2\u00b0C\u2019\u201d Michael M\u00fcller, Socialist, State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Environment, Die Zeit, 15 Jan 2007 **** 8. \u201cHarsh winters likely will be more seldom and precipitation in the wintertime will be heavier everywhere. However, due to the milder temperatures, it\u2019ll fall more often as rain than as snow.\u201d Online-Atlas of the Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft, 2010 **** 9. \u201cWe\u2019ve mostly had mild winters in which only a few cold months were scattered about, like January 2009. This winter is a cold outlier, but that doesn\u2019t change the picture as a whole. Generally it\u2019s going to get warmer, also in the wintertime.\u201d Gerhard M\u00fcller-Westermeier, German Weather Service (DWD), 26 Jan 2010 **** 10. \u201cWinters with strong frost and lots of snow like we had 20 years ago will cease to exist at our latitudes.\u201d Mojib Latif, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, 1 April 2000 **** 11. \u201cGood bye winter. Never again snow?\u201d Spiegel, 1 April 2000 **** 12. \u201cIn the northern part of the continent there likely will be some benefits in the form of reduced cold periods and higher agricultural yields. But the continued increase in temperatures will cancel off these benefits. In some regions up to 60% of the species could die off by 2080.\u201d 3Sat, 26 June 2003 **** 13. \u201cAlthough the magnitude of the trends shows large variation among different models, Miller et al. (2006) find that none of the 14 models exhibits a trend towards a lower NAM index and higher arctic SLP.\u201d IPCC 2007 4AR, (quoted by Georg Hoffmann) **** 14. \u201cBased on the rising temperature, less snow will be expected regionally. While currently 1/3 of the precipitation in the Alps falls as snow, the snow-share of precipitation by the end of the century could end up being just one sixth.\u201d Germanwatch, Page 7, Feb 2007 **** 15. \u201cAssuming there will be a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere, as is projected by the year 2030. The consequences could be hotter and drier summers, and winters warmer and wetter. Such a warming will be proportionately higher at higher elevations \u2013 and especially will have a powerful impact on the glaciers of the Firn regions.\u201d and \u201c The ski areas that reliably have snow will shift from 1200 meters to 1500 meters elevation by the year 2050; because of the climate prognoses warmer winters have to be anticipated.\u201d Scinexx Wissenschaft Magazin, 26 Mar 2002 **** 16. \u201cYesterday\u2019s snow\u2026 Because temperatures in the Alps are rising quickly, there will be more precipitation in many places. But because it will rain more often than it snows, this will be bad news for tourists. For many ski lifts this means the end of business.\u201d Daniela Jacob, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, 8 Aug 2006 **** 17. \u201cSpring will begin in January starting in 2030.\u201d Die Welt, 30 Sept 2010 **** 18. \u201cIce, snow, and frost will disappear, i.e. milder winters\u201d \u2026 \u201cUnusually warm winters without snow and ice are now being viewed by many as signs of climate change.\u201d Schleswig Holstein NABU, 10 Feb 2007 **** 19. \u201cGood bye winter\u2026 In the northern hemisphere the deviations are much greater according to NOAA calculations, in some areas up to 5\u00b0C. That has consequences says DWD meteorologist M\u00fcller-Westermeier: When the snowline rises over large areas, the bare ground is warmed up even more by sunlight. This amplifies global warming. A process that is uncontrollable \u2013 and for this reason understandably arouses old childhood fears: First the snow disappears, and then winter.\u201d Die Zeit, 16 Mar 2007 **** 20. \u201cWarm in the winter, dry in the summer \u2026 Long, hard winters in Germany remain rare: By 2085 large areas of the Alps and Central German Mountains will be almost free of snow. Because air temperatures in winter will rise more quickly than in summer, there will be more precipitation. \u2018However, much of it will fall as rain,\u2019 says Daniela Jacob of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.\u201d FOCUS, 24 May 2006 **** 21. \u201cConsequences and impacts for regional agriculture: Hotter summers, milder plus shorter winters (palm trees!). Agriculture: More CO2 in the air, higher temperatures, foremost in winter.\u201d Dr. Michael Schirmer, University of Bremen, presentation of 2 Feb 2007 **** 22. \u201cWinters: wet and mild\u201d Bavarian State Ministry for Agriculture, presentation 23 Aug 2007 **** 23. \u201cThe climate model prognoses currently indicate that the following climate changes will occur: Increase in minimum temperatures in the winter.\u201d Chamber of Agriculture of Lower Saxony Date: 6 July 2009 **** 24. \u201cBoth the prognoses for global climate development and the prognoses for the climatic development of the Fichtel Mountains clearly show a warming of the average temperature, whereby especially the winter months will be greatly impacted.\u201d Willi Seifert, University of Bayreuth, diploma thesis, p. 203, 7 July 2004 **** 25. \u201cAlready in the year 2025 the conditions for winter sports in the Fichtel Mountains will develop negatively, especially with regards to \u2018natural\u2019 snow conditions and for so-called snow-making potential. A financially viable ski business operation after about the year 2025 appears under these conditions to be extremely improbable (Seifert, 2004)\u201d. Andreas Matzarakis, University of Freiburg Meteorological Institute, 26 July 2006 **** 26. \u201cSkiing among palm trees? \u2026 For this reason I would advise no one in the Berchtesgadener Land to invest in a ski-lift. The probability of earning money with the global warming is getting less and less.\u201d Hartmut Gra\u00dfl, Director Emeritus, Max Planck-Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, page 3, 4 Mar 2006 **** 27. \u201cClimate warming leads to an increasingly higher snow line. The number of future ski resorts that can be expected to have snow is reducing. [\u2026] Climate change does not only lead to higher temperatures, but also to changes in the precipitation ratios in summer and winter. [\u2026] In the wintertime more precipitation is to be anticipated. However, it will fall more often as rain, and less often as snow, in the future.\u201d Hans Elsasser, Director of the Geographical Institute of the University of Zurich, 4 Mar 2006 **** 28. \u201cAll climate simulations \u2013 global and regional \u2013 were carried out at the Deutschen Klimarechenzentrum [German Climate Simulation Center]. [\u2026] In the winter months the temperature rise is from 1.5\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C and stretches from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Sea. Only in regions that are directly influenced by the Atlantic (Great Britain, Portugal, parts of Spain) will the winter temperature increase be less (Fig. 1).\u201d Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Press Release, Date: December 2007/January 2013. **** 29. \u201cBy the year 2050 \u2026 temperatures will rise 1.5\u00baC to 2.5\u00b0C (summer) and 3\u00b0C (winter). \u2026 in the summer it will rain up to 40% less and in the winter up to 30% more. German Federal Department of Highways, 1 Sept 2010 **** 30. \u201cWe are now at the threshold of making reliable statements about the future.\u201d Daniela Jacob, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, page 44, 10/2001 **** 31. \u201cThe scenarios of climate scientists are unanimous about one thing: In the future in Germany we will have to live with drier and drier summers and a lot more rain in the winters.\u201d Gerhard M\u00fcller-Westermeier, German Weather Service (DWD), 20 May 2010 **** 32. \u201cIn the wintertime the winds will be more from the west and will bring storms to Germany. Especially in western and southern Germany there will be flooding.\u201d FOCUS / Mojib Latif, Leibniz Institute for Ocean Sciences of the University of Kiel, 27 May 2006. **** 33. \u201cWhile the increases in the springtime appear as rather modest, the (late)summer and winter months are showing an especially powerful warming trend.\u201d State Ministry of Environment, Agriculture and Geology, Saxony, p. 133, Schriftenreihe Heft 25/2009. **** 34. \u201cWarm Winters Result From Greenhouse Effect, Columbia Scientists Find, Using NASA Model \u2026 Despite appearing as part of a natural climate oscillation, the large increases in wintertime surface temperatures over the continents may therefore be attributable in large part to human activities,\u201d Science Daily, Dr. Drew Shindell 4 June 1999 **** 35. \u201cWithin a few years winter snowfall will become a very rare and exciting event. \u2026 Children just aren\u2019t going to know what snow is.\u201d David Viner, Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia, 20 March 2000 **** 36. \u201cThis data confirms what many gardeners believe \u2013 winters are not as hard as they used to be. \u2026 And if recent trends continue a white Christmas in Wales could certainly be a thing of the past.\u201d BBC, Dr Jeremy Williams, Bangor University, Lecturer in Geomatics, 20 Dec 2004 **** 37. The rise in temperature associated with climate change leads to a general reduction in the proportion of precipitation falling as snow, and a consequent reduction in many areas in the duration of snow cover.\u201d Global Environmental Change, Nigel W. Arnell, Geographer, 1 Oct 1999 **** 38. \u201cComputer models predict that the temperature rise will continue at that accelerated pace if emissions of heat-trapping gases are not reduced, and also predict that warming will be especially pronounced in the wintertime.\u201d Star News, William K. Stevens, New York Times, 11 Mar 2000 **** 39. \u201cIn a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn.\u201d Nature, T. P. Barnett et. al., 17 Nov 2005 ***** 40. \u201cWe are beginning to approximate the kind of warming you should see in the winter season.\u201d Star News, Mike Changery, National Climatic Data Center, 11 Mar 2000 **** 41. \u201cMilder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms but could cause an increase in freezing rain if average daily temperatures fluctuate about the freezing point.\u201d IPCC Climate Change, 2001 **** 42. \u201cGlobal climate change is likely to be accompanied by an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, as well as warmer summers and milder winters\u20269.4.2. Decreased Mortality Resulting from Milder Winters \u2026 One study estimates a decrease in annual cold-related deaths of 20,000 in the UK by the 2050s (a reduction of 25%)\u201d IPCC Climate Change, 2001 **** 43. \u201cThe lowest winter temperatures are likely to increase more than average winter temperature in northern Europe. \u2026The duration of the snow season is very likely to shorten in all of Europe, and snow depth is likely to decrease in at least most of Europe.\u201d IPCC Climate Change, 2007 **** 44. \u201cSnowlines are going up in altitude all over the world. The idea that we will get less snow is absolutely in line with what we expect from global warming.\u201d WalesOnline, Sir John Houghton \u2013 atmospheric physicist, 30 June 2007 **** 45. \u201cIn the UK wetter winters are expected which will lead to more extreme rainfall, whereas summers are expected to get drier. However, it is possible under climate change that there could be an increase of extreme rainfall even under general drying.\u201d Telegraph, Dr. Peter Stott, Met Office, 24 July 2007 **** 46. \u201cWinter has gone forever and we should officially bring spring forward instead. \u2026 There is no winter any more despite a cold snap before Christmas. It is nothing like years ago when I was younger. There is a real problem with spring because so much is flowering so early year to year.\u201d Express, Dr Nigel Taylor, Curator of Kew Gardens, 8 Feb 2008 **** 47. \u201cThe past is no longer a guide to the future. We no longer have a stationary climate,\u201d\u2026 Independent, Dr. Peter Stott, Met Office, 27 Jul 2007 **** 48. \u201cIt is consistent with the climate change message. It is exactly what we expect winters to be like \u2013 warmer and wetter, and dryer and hotter summers. \u2026the winter we have just seen is consistent with the type of weather we expect to see more and more in the future.\u201d Wayne Elliott, Met Office meteorologist, BBC, 27 Feb 2007 **** 49. \u201c If your decisions depend on what\u2019s happening at these very fine scales of 25 km or even 5 km resolution then you probably shouldn\u2019t be making irreversible investment decisions now.\u201d Myles Allen, \u201cone of the UK\u2019s leading climate modellers\u201d, Oxford University, 18 June 2009 **** 50. \u201cIt\u2019s great that the government has decided to put together such a scientifically robust analysis of the potential impacts of climate change in the UK.\u201d Keith Allott, WWF-UK, 18 June 2009 **** 51. \u201cThe data collected by experts from the university [of Bangor] suggests that a white Christmas on Snowdon \u2013 the tallest mountain in England and Wales \u2013 may one day become no more than a memory.\u201d BBC News, 20 Dec 2004 [BBC 2013: \u201cSnowdon Mountain Railway will be shut over the Easter weekend after it was hit by 30ft (9.1m) snow drifts.\u201d] **** 52. \u201cSpring is arriving earlier each year as a result of climate change, the first \u2018conclusive proof\u2019 that global warming is altering the timing of the seasons, scientists announced yesterday.\u201d Guardian, 26 Aug 2006. **** 53. \u201cGiven the increase in the average winter temperature it is obvious that the number of frost days and the number of days that the snow remains, will decline. For Europe the models indicate that cold winters such as at the end of the 20th century, that happened at an average once every ten years, will gradually disappear in the course of the century.\u201d (p. 19), and \u201c\u2026but it might well be that nothing remains of the snowjoy in the Hautes Fagnes but some yellowed photos because of the climate change \u2026 moreover an increase in winter precipitation would certainly not be favorable for recreation!\u201d (p38) Jean-Pascal van Ypersele and Philippe Marbaix, Greenpeace, 2004 **** 54. \u201cShindell\u2019s model predicts that if greenhouse gases continue to increase, winter in the Northern Hemisphere will continue to warm. \u2018In our model, we\u2019re seeing a very large signal of global warming and it\u2019s not a naturally occurring thing. It\u2019s most likely linked to greenhouse gases,\u2019 he said. NASA, GISS, 2 June 1999 **** 55. \u201cWe have seen that in the last years and decades that winters have become much milder than before and that there isn\u2019t nearly as much snowfall. All simulations show this trend will continue in the future and that we have to expect an intense warming in the Alps\u2026especially in the foothills, snow will turn to rain and winter sports will no longer be possible anymore.\u201d Mojib Latif, Leibnitz Institute for Oceanography, University of Kiel, February 17, 2005 **** 56.

If it continues and no strong action is taken, it will cause world famine, world chaos and world war, and this could all come about before the year 2000.\u201d **** 83. July 9, 1971, Washington Post: \u201cIn the next 50 years fine dust that humans discharge into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuel will screen out so much of the sun\u2019s rays that the Earth\u2019s average temperature could fall by six degrees. Sustained emissions over five to ten years, could be sufficient to trigger an ice age.\u201d **** 84. June, 1975, Nigel Calder in International Wildlife: \u201cThe continued rapid cooling of the earth since WWII is in accord with the increase in global air pollution associated with industrialization, mechanization, urbanization and exploding population.\u201d **** 85. June 30, 1989, Associated Press: U.N. OFFICIAL PREDICTS DISASTER, SAYS GREENHOUSE EFFECT COULD WIPE SOME NATIONS OFF MAP\u2013entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if global warming is not reversed by the year 2000. Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of \u2018eco-refugees,\u2019 threatening political chaos,\u201d said Brown, director of the New York office of the U.N. Environment Program. He added that governments have a 10-year window of opportunity to solve the greenhouse effect. **** 86. Sept 19, 1989, St. Louis Post-Dispatch: \u201cNew York will probably be like Florida 15 years from now.\u201d **** 87. December 5, 1989, Dallas Morning News: \u201cSome predictions for the next decade are not difficult to make\u2026Americans may see the \u201980s migration to the Sun Belt reverse as a global warming trend rekindles interest in cooler climates.\u201d \u2014**** 88. Michael Oppenheimer, 1990, The Environmental Defense Fund: \u201cBy 1995, the greenhouse effect would be desolating the heartlands of North America and Eurasia with horrific drought, causing crop failures and food riots\u2026\u201d(By 1996) The Platte River of Nebraska would be dry, while a continent-wide black blizzard of prairie topsoil will stop traffic on interstates, strip paint from houses and shut down computers\u2026The Mexican police will round up illegal American migrants surging into Mexico seeking work as field hands.\u201d **** 89. April 18, 1990, Denver Post: \u201cGiant sand dunes may turn Plains to desert\u2013huge sand dunes extending east from Colorado\u2019s Front Range may be on the verge of breaking through the thin topsoil, transforming America\u2019s rolling High Plains into a desert, new research suggests. The giant sand dunes discovered by NASA satellite photos are expected to re-emerge over the next 20 t0 50 years, depending on how fast average temperatures rise from the suspected \u2018greenhouse effect\u2019 scientists believe.\u201d **** 90. Edward Goldsmith, 1991, (5000 Days to Save the Planet): \u201cBy 2000, British and American oil will have diminished to a trickle\u2026.Ozone depletion and global warming threaten food shortages, but the wealthy North will enjoy a temporary reprieve by buying up the produce of the South. Unrest among the hungry and the ensuing political instability, will be contained by the North\u2019s greater military might. A bleak future indeed, but an inevitable one unless we change the way we live\u2026At present rates of exploitation there may be no rainforest left in 10 years. If measures are not taken immediately, the greenhouse effect may be unstoppable in 12 to 15 years.\u201d **** 91. April 22, 1990 ABC, The Miracle Planet: \u201cI think we\u2019re in trouble. When you realize how little time we have left\u2013we are now given not 10 years to save the rainforests, but in many cases five years. Madagascar will largely be gone in five years unless something happens. And nothing is happening.\u201d **** 92. February 1993, Thomas E. Lovejoy, Smithsonian Institution: \u201cMost of the great environmental struggles will be either won or lost in the 1990s and by the next century it will be too late.\u201d **** 93. November 7, 1997, (BBC commentator): \u201cIt appears that we have a very good case for suggesting that the El Ni\u00f1os are going to become more frequent, and they\u2019re going to become more intense, and in a few years, or a decade or so, we\u2019ll go into a permanent El Nino. So instead of having cool water periods for a year or two, we\u2019ll have El Ni\u00f1o upon El Ni\u00f1o, and that will become the norm. And you\u2019ll have an El Ni\u00f1o, that instead of lasting 18 months, lasts 18 years.\u201d **** 94. July 26, 1999 The Birmingham Post: \u201cScientists are warning that some of the Himalayan glaciers could vanish within ten years because of global warming. A build-up of greenhouse gases is blamed for the meltdown, which could lead to drought and flooding in the region affecting millions of people.\u201d **** 95. October 15, 1990 Carl Sagan: \u201cThe planet could face an \u2018ecological and agricultural catastrophe\u2019 by the next decade if global warming trends continue.\u201d **** 96. Sept 11, 1999, The Guardian: \u201cA report last week claimed that within a decade, the disease (malaria) will be common again on the Spanish coast. The effects of global warming are coming home to roost in the developed world.\u201d **** 97. March 29, 2001, CNN: \u201cIn ten year\u2019s time, most of the low-lying atolls surrounding Tuvalu\u2019s nine islands in the South Pacific Ocean will be submerged under water as global warming rises sea levels.\u201d **** 98. 1969, Lubos Moti, Czech physicist: \u201cIt is now pretty clearly agreed that CO2 content [in the atmosphere] will rise 25% by 2000. This could increase the average temperature near the earth\u2019s surface by 7 degrees Fahrenheit. This in turn could raise the level of the sea by 10 feet. Goodbye New York. Goodbye Washington, for that matter.\u201d **** 99. 2005, Andrew Simms, policy director of the New Economics Foundation: \u201cScholars are predicting that 50 million people worldwide will be displaced by 2010 because of rising sea levels, desertification, dried up aquifers, weather-induced flooding and other serious environmental changes.\u201d **** 100. Oct 20, 2009, Gordon Brown UK Prime Minister (referring to the Copenhagen climate conference): \u201cWorld leaders have 50 days to save the Earth from irreversible global warming.\u201d **** 101. June 2008, Ted Alvarez, Backpacker Magazine Blogs: \u201cyou could potentially sail, kayak, or even swim to the North Pole by the end of the summer. Climate scientists say that the Arctic ice\u2026is currently on track to melt sometime in 2008.\u201d [Shortly after this prediction was made, a Russian icebreaker was trapped in the ice of the Northwest Passage for a week.] **** 102. May 31, 2006 Al Gore, CBS Early Show: \u201c\u2026the debate among the scientists is over. There is no more debate. We face a planetary emergency. There is no more scientific debate among serious people who\u2019ve looked at the science\u2026Well, I guess in some quarters, there\u2019s still a debate over whether the moon landing was staged in a movie lot in Arizona, or whether the Earth is flat instead of round.\u201d **** 103. January 2000 Dr. Michael Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund commenting (in a NY Times interview) on the mild winters in New York City: \u201cBut it does not take a scientist to size up the effects of snowless winters on the children too young to remember the record-setting blizzards of 1996. For them, the pleasures of sledding and snowball fights are as out-of-date as hoop-rolling, and the delight of a snow day off from school is unknown.\u201d **** 104. 2008 Dr. James Hansen of the Goddard Space Institute (NASA) on a visit to Britain: \u201cThe recent warm winters that Britain has experienced are a sign that the climate is changing.\u201d [Two exceptionally cold winters followed. The 2009-10 winter may be the coldest experienced in the UK since 1683.] **** 105. June 11, 1986, Dr. James Hansen of the Goddard Space Institute (NASA) in testimony to Congress (according to the Milwaukee Journal): \u201cHansen predicted global temperatures should be nearly 2 degrees higher in 20 years, \u2018which is about the warmest the earth has been in the last 100,000 years.\u2019\u201d **** 106. June 8, 1972, Christian Science Monitor: \u201cArctic specialist Bernt Balchen says a general warming trend over the North Pole is melting the polar ice cap and may produce an ice-free Arctic Ocean by the year 2000.\u201d **** 107. May 15, 1989, Associated Press: \u201cUsing computer models, researchers concluded that global warming would raise average annual temperatures nationwide [USA] two degrees by 2010.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There is the \u201csettled science\u201d theory; Greenhouse Gas Blankets cause temperatures to rise, Polar ice melts, a tipping point is reached when methane gas is released from melting tundra and the earth fries. It was based on temperatures rising almost 1.5 degrees F between 1980 and 2000; the rise started abruptly in 1980 after 200 years of industrial revolution and burning of hydrocarbons without any rise at all. NOAA charts show this. This theory predicted that Ice at the North Pole would melt in 10 years and polar bears would die, becoming extinct. Actual data shows Arctic Ice had melted significantly before 1922 and increased after 1922 as CO2 increased. This contradicts the theory. Further, the sudden melting after 1980 with no sudden increase in rise rate of CO2 requires a second source of energy which was supplied by magma beneath the eastern Arctic Ocean. One very striking piece of data is the latest satellite photo of the Arctic for April, 2019. Hudson Bay and James Bay as well as the Arctic Ocean are completely frozen over. James Bay is 1/2 the distance to the equator!!! The Greenhouse Gas Theory does not predict this. Our planet has entered a falling temperature-increased ice era. In fact we have entered an ice age where northern areas will be covered with ice and snow and the ocean levels will start to fall from loss of water and cooling temperatures. Study the data - understand what it tells you. FACTS MATTER. ",
