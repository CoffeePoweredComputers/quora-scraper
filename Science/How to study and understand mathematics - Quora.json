            "answer_text": "Maths is one of those subjects which you can easily spend hours studying but end up none the wiser. However much you have studied, if you can not solve the problem on day of the test, you are lost. 1. Practice, Practice & More Practice It is impossible to study maths properly by just reading and listening. To study maths you have to roll up your sleeves and actually solve some problems. The more you practice answering maths problems, the better. 2. Review Errors When you\u2019re practising with these problems, it\u2019s important to work through the process for each solution. If you have made any mistakes, you should review them and understand where your problem-solving skills let you down. 3. Master the Key Concepts Do not try to memorise the processes. This is counter-productive. It is much better and rewarding in the long-run to focus on understanding the process and logic that is involved. 4. Understand your Doubts Sometimes you can get stuck trying to solve part of a maths problem and find it difficult to move on to the next stage. It\u2019s common for many students to skip this question and continue on to the next. ",
