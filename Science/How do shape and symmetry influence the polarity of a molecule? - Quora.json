            "answer_text": "A molecule is termed as polar if it possesses a permanent electric dipole. Examples of such molecules are H\u2082O, HCl, NH\u2083, and O\u2083 (ozone, mind you!). Shape and symmetry of a molecule are best understood by means of Group Theory applied to Chemistry\u00b9, i.e. with the help of some math. What we do is classify molecules based on their symmetry, namely the presence (or lack thereof) of certain elements of symmetry\u00b2. The classification of objects or molecules according to this originates the so-called point groups\u00b3. There are specific procedures to determine which point group a molecule belongs to. It is best to summarise them on a flowchart:  It turns out that only molecules that belong to the point groups C\ud835\ude2f, C\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude37, and C\ud835\ude34 have shapes such that originate a permanent electric dipole. Moreover, in the case of molecules belonging to the point groups C\ud835\ude2f and C\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude37, said dipole must lie on the main rotational axis C\ud835\ude2f. Examples: ozone, O\u2083, has the following molecular shape:  O\u2083 is said to be a bent (or angular) molecule; it belongs to the C\u2082\ud835\ude37 point group and is polar (its dipole moment is about 0.5 D). On the other hand, CO\u2082 is a typical linear molecule belonging to the D\u221e\ud835\ude29 group: this means it cannot be polar - indeed, its dipole moment is 0 D.
