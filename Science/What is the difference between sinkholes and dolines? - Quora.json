            "answer_text": "A doline, sink or sinkhole is a closed depression draining underground in karst areas. It can be cylindrical, conical, bowl- or dish-shaped. The diametre ranges from a few to many hundreds of meters. The use of sinkhole as a synonym for doline in the American literature has also created some ambiguity, because sinkhole is mostly applied in the sense of collapse doline or of cover doline. The morphological type called \u201cdolina\u201d in the international scientific literature is surely the most common, typical and representative landforms of the karst landscapes. In the international scientific literature the terms \u201cdoline\u201d and \u201csinkhole\u201d are both utilised in a very wide sense to indicate medium-sized closed depressions, normally not holding water, in karst areas. Anyway, while the word \u201cdoline\u201d is used mostly in Europe with a mainly \u201cmorphographic\u201d significance, the term sinkhole is utilised mainly in North America with a predominantly \u201cmorphogenetic\u201d meaning.

            "answer_text": "Sinkholes and dolines both are typical of karst terrain and form by the solution of carbonate rocks like limestone , dolomite etc. by the groundwater because carbonate are more likely to react with water .. both of these terms are very similar and interchangeable , sinkholes are essentially the depression form due to the collapse of underground holes/caves, while dolines which is funnel like depressions and bigger in dimension when compared to sinkholes, may form due to collapse and also due to the chemical weathering and erosion of earth.
