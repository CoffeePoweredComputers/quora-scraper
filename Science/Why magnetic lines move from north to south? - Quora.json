            "answer_text": "The magnetic field comes out of one end and loops around to the other. We call one side the north and one side the south because we have to call them something. The origin no doubt somehow comes from the fact that the Earth's magnetic poles are close to the geographic poles. Hense the north south monikers. The only puzzling thing is that the south magnetic pole is in the north and the north magnetic pole is in the south. That is the only way a little magnet's north pole would point to the north geographic pole. Just think about it. You have a little magnetic in your compass. It points north. So you call the end of the compass needle, the magnet, the north side of the magnet because it tells you where north is. Think about it this way. Just look at a compass. To use it you orient it so that you turn the compass to line up the north side of the dial with the needle. The little N is right next to the end of the needle. Therefore that is the north side of the needle! That is North you say pointing in the direction the needle points. But magnets don't point towards the north side of another magnet. They point to the south side of other magnets. So the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field is close to the north geographic pole. It seems backwards, but it makes sense. ",

            "answer_text": "The lines don\u2019t move. In fact, the lines aren\u2019t even real things, any more than the elevation lines on a topographic map, or isobars on a weather map are really there. They are visual representations of the relative values at different points. They are a mathematical construction, like a graph, to allow you to visualize the shape of the field. The field is drawn with arrows, but they show the direction that the field points. They do not imply that anything is moving. It\u2019s like the arrow on the sign of one-way street. It shows the direction of the street (and traffic on it) but it does not mean the street is going anywhere. Magnetic fields have direction because north poles are not the same as south poles. The choice of a north-to-south convention is essentially arbitrary, but for clear communication, it\u2019s necessary for everyone to use the same convention. As things stand, if you place a compass in the field, it will point in the same direction as the field line arrows. ",
