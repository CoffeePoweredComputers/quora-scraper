            "answer_text": "\u201cHow do atoms vibrate? Do they vibrate 2 dimensionally (back and forth) or do they vibrate 3 dimensionally (pulsating)?\u201d Atoms do not vibrate mechanically, though molecules do. A diatomic molecule can only vibrate by changing its bond length. This is back and forth, but 1 dimensional. Polyatomic molecule can \u201cbreathe\u201d (expand and shrink), flex, and otherwise periodically distort their shapes in various ways. When one speaks of atoms vibrating, it can be allegorical, like to a clock pendulum when describing an atomic clock. In this case, the magnetic direction of an electron oscillates, which is not a mechanical movement. ",
