Now if you are asking if it will hide it from someone metal detecting than no it will once again come up. Yes I can usually tell if it is lead in the ground (way to many bullets found here) but I will dig it up. I have had silver coins appear to be lead to the detector in the past because of soil balance or depth. I dig it all as any detectorist should. I have a pile I save and take it to the scrappers at the end of the year. Found over 40lbs once lol. It was used in sealing pipes back in the old days. And tons of old musket balls. Now if you are talking about smuggling gold around we also have machines that can tell what is in the middle. Go to any real scrap gold buyer. No need for a metal detector with a good spectrometer.
