Isaiah 9: 6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. 7 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this. Isaiah 11: 1\u20132 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse ( david) , and a Branch (Yahshua son of david) shall grow out of his roots: 2 And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD\u2026\u201d Mark 6: 2 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, Where did this man get these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are performed by his hands?

            "answer_text": "Clearly Jesus. At least he understood his role and background, and didn\u2019t make hilarious mistake, like when Mohammad claimed that Maria was a part of the trinity, in his silly Koran. He even abuse this Koran thing - which he claim is the direct word of \u201cAllah\u201d - to make silly, obviously non-divine points, like that people hang around for too long at his house, after finishing dinner. Jesus didn\u2019t fail that bad at his supposed role. Apart from that, the intelligence of Jesus when it comes to creating a universal morality, is far beyond that of Mohammad. It is hard - but not impossible - to argue with \u201clove your enemies\u201d, while it is simply natural and easy to be disgusted by the supremacist, hateful message Mohammad delivered. ",
