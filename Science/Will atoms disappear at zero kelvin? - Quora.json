            "answer_text": "On the absolute temperature scale, which is used by physicists and is also called the Kelvin scale, it is not possible to go below zero \u2013 at least not in the sense of getting colder than zero kelvin. According to the physical meaning of temperature, the temperature of a gas is determined by the chaotic movement of its particles \u2013 the colder the gas, the slower the particles. At zero kelvin (minus 273 degrees Celsius) the particles stop moving and all disorder disappears. Thus, nothing can be colder than absolute zero on the Kelvin scale. Physicists have now created an atomic gas in the laboratory that nonetheless has negative Kelvin values. These negative absolute temperatures have several apparently absurd consequences: although the atoms in the gas attract each other and give rise to a negative pressure, the gas does not collapse \u2013 a behavior that is also postulated for dark energy in cosmology.

            "answer_text": "I would say that if all movement stops there would no longer be a spin in the particles. If that happens then I would say that the electromagnetic energy would have stoped moving. And now its rerurned to it original form called aether. Wich is what i believe the original state of the universe began. Aether is a stationary frozen field born from the imbalence created in space as a result of the existance of nothing. Its as still as nothing (space) is. But this energy will still be in a condenced form. As a result of no spin this will leave no friction as a result of a spin. So the condenced aether will begin to condence even further but streight inward out of detection abilities until it reaches a criticle dencity and then it will explode. If there is not enough aether in the particle to reach this criticle dencity to explode then the aether (particle)will set in a dormant and stable unmoving mass until a heat sorce or electromagnetic flows from other areas of space arrives to re invigorate the particle to move again. Since all space has energy arriving from other locations of space then absolute zero can not me reached. Not even in a laboratory on earth. Which is the best that aperently can be achieved. Maybe between the gravitational fields of two galexies in there one might say fault line maybe can be near absolute zero temperatures. But the mear regeneration of new aether to replace the removed aether that went to its respective galaxies gravitational fields would creat heat or movment itself. So i dont think absolute zero can be achieved in a universe. But only in the regions between the big bangs (universes) can absolute zero exist. In the areas that have never expieriance the shock wave of a big bang. Once aether is effected by a big bang shockwave that area of space can never achieve absolute zero again. This theory is my personal ponderings which explain the big bang as a result of a Aether field that was originally at absolute zero because it would be as still as the emptyness of space itself. So the aether would be infinitly despersed. As a result it would be in utter balence with itself. Aether is gravity and time. At absolute zero time stands still. Once time begins it can not stop. ",
