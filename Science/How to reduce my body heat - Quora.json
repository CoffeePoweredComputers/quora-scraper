The slightest fluctuation in the core body temperature can result in severe medical emergencies often followed by *DEATH* Hot 44 \u00b0C (111.2 \u00b0F) or more \u2013 Almost certainly death will occur; however, people have been known to survive up to 46.5 \u00b0C (115.7 \u00b0F).43 \u00b0C (109.4 \u00b0F) \u2013 Normally death, or there may be serious brain damage, continuous convulsions and shock. Cardio-respiratory collapse will likely occur.42 \u00b0C (107.6 \u00b0F) \u2013 Subject may turn pale or remain flushed and red. They may become comatose, be in severe delirium, vomiting, and convulsions can occur.

If this is caused by fever , there may also be chills.Normal 36.5\u201337.5 \u00b0C (97.7\u201399.5 \u00b0F) is a typically reported range for normal body temperatureCold 36 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) \u2013 Feeling cold, mild to moderate shivering (body temperature may drop this low during sleep). May be a normal body temperature.35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) \u2013 ( HYPOTHERMIA is less than 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F)) \u2013 Intense shivering, numbness and bluish/grayness of the skin. There is the possibility of heart irritability.34 \u00b0C (93 \u00b0F) \u2013 Severe shivering, loss of movement of fingers, blueness and confusion. Some behavioural changes may take place.33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F) \u2013 Moderate to severe confusion, sleepiness, depressed reflexes, progressive loss of shivering, slow heart beat, shallow breathing. Shivering may stop. Subject may be unresponsive to certain stimuli.32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) \u2013 ( Medical emergency) \u2013 Hallucinations, delirium, complete confusion, extreme sleepiness that is progressively becoming comatose. Shivering is absent (subject may even think they are hot). Reflex may be absent or very slight.31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F) \u2013 Comatose, very rarely conscious. No or slight reflexes. Very shallow breathing and slow heart rate. Possibility of serious heart rhythm problems.28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) \u2013 Severe heart rhythm disturbances are likely and breathing may stop at any time. Patient may appear to be dead.24\u201326 \u00b0C (75\u201379 \u00b0F) or less \u2013 Death usually occurs due to irregular heart beat or respiratory arrest; however, some patients have been known to survive with body temperatures as low as 14.2 \u00b0C (57.6 \u00b0F)You wanna reduce your core body temperature? Good luck with that. That'll be called \u201cAttempted suicide\u201d At a core body temperature between 85 and 71 degrees F, an inability to move and a low blood pressure lead to coma. Below 71 degrees, muscles grow rigid, and the heart and breathing rate continue to decrease until the person reaches death. ",

            "answer_text": " I have a little raised body Temperature than the normal people do. Sometimes my husband complains that i radiate heatwaves during the nights.  Usually when the temperature hits below 27 i feel cold. Really cold. But at times, if I skip to bath or delay it, I cold feel my breathe getting hotter and II start to switch on the a/c again.  Actually on self analysis I found everything that cools you off immediately are harmful to u.  Drink a glass of cold water-- clogs food particles and makes me tired Sleeping under a/c -- absorbs all the water from ur body and leaves u dry. All these are gonna make your body burn more fat and calories to  produce heat. Here 'heat' means the little raised temperature i possess now. What do I do: Every morning I drink water mixed with half lemon juice and a quarter spoon of sweet basil seeds. We call as sabja seeds in India.limit my intake of spicy foodsSwitch to groundnut oil. Coconut oil serves the best but I don't like it's flavour. Prefer room Temperature. Mostly a fan. No a/c.Oil pulling. Once in a week.prefer juice without ice. And bathe in normal room temp water.                                                             So now I don't radiate heat so much. Also I don't drink much water. I drink when I feel thristy and mostly try to find an alternative for water. I always go for flavoured water or juice. But have the habit of eating lots of fruits and vegetables raw. I would also suggest u to use castor or coconut oil on ur scalp and massage it , once in a week.Don't try to bring down ur Tempe immediately.                                                            I have short breathness and asthma. You need to check if you have any respiratory issues and also for thyroid. The final point is... There is nothing wrong with your body. It's just a little special. Treat it that way",

Running water from over the head cools down not only the heat from the torso but also the head. Drinking plenty of water and fluids at least 8- 12 glasses a day. Boil 4-5 litres of water with a 2-3 tsps of Dhaniya seeds (Coriander seeds). And drink it daily. Or put a handful of washed Usheer / Khus / Vala roots (Vetiver roots) in the boiled water. Doesn't indicate fluids cold in temperature but those cold in potency. Eg. Teas infused with Chamomile or Rusmari (Rosemarius officinalis). Avoid coffee and hard drinks. Avoid spicy, pungent food. Aroma therapy- Using natural pleasant and cooling aromas at home. Eg. Chandan (Santalum album) fragrance. Tender coconut water, coriander leaves juice ( extract), pomogrenate juice in the morning empty stomach. Using curtains made of Usheer/Vetivera. Sprinkle it with water. Cool wind will flow through it continuously releasing a pleasant aroma.

Drinking orange juice or sweet lime is the best option. Tender coconut water and butter milk, both are very good heat reducing drinks.      Drinking Laggered Beer will also reduce the body heat but may add weight to the body. The last choice is wine. Drinking 1 ounce or 1 peg red wine or white wine every night will keep the body cool, skin shining and appearance young.  The secret of wine is richness of antioxidents in it which fight against free radical formation within body cells and there by ageing is very much curtailed, so, one will look very young even at the age of 80 years.
