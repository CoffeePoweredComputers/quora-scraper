            "answer_text": "There are so many options are there, but I will suggest 2. Engineering - If you have creative mind and if you think that you are very good in mathematics then you go for engineering. You can select any one branch of engineering as your career, depending upon your interest you can take admission for it.Computer/IT EngineeringElectronics EngineeringCivil EngineeringMechanical EnginneringElectronics and Telecommunication EngineeringProduction EngineeringEnvironmental EngineeringBiotechnology EngineeringChemical EngineeringTextile EngineeringAerospace EngineeringAgricultural EngineeringAutomotive EngineeringAutomobile Engineering \u2026\u2026\u2026.etc2. BSc/BCA - This is secondary option as a career. If you are not that much creative then this is best option for you. This is also not an bad option, BSc - offers theoretical as well as practical knowledge about different subject areas. These subject areas usually include any one of the main Science fields (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology) and other fields depending on the specialization a student opts. Pursuing a BSc course is most beneficial for students who have a strong interest and background in Science and Mathematics. The course is also beneficial for students who wish to pursue multi and inter-disciplinary science careers in future.BCA - It is one of the popular courses among the students who want to make their career in the IT (Information Technology) field. The duration of the course is 3 years and divided into 6 semesters. It comprises of the subjects like database, networking, data structure, core programming languages like \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018java\u2019. This course provides a lot of opportunities to the students who are interested in computer field and wants to work in the IT sector as programmer or software developer.",

            "answer_text": "If you are talking about formal education. 1 There are 4 years professional courses BE/BTech in Computer Science. These are offered by almost 6000 colleges in India (including the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). India produces about 10 lacs engineers every year. 10% of that are Comp Sc engineers. Salaries after finishing the course ranges from 2.25lacs/annum to 25 lac per annum (if you are a Comp Sc Engg from the top 4 IIT's) 3 There are also 3 year BSc and BCA courses available in India. These are not recognized out side India. So if you wish to do your MS or MBA abroad, you will need to the BE during your graduation or a MSc or MCA for 1 yr after BSc / BCA. Jobs after doing BSc/BCA are low end IT jobs (BPO companies). A good way to start learning programming is Scratch - Imagine, Program, Share This has been developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Then if you are interested in Robotics, you can try your hands on Arduino - Home micro-controller. Else if you just wish go the boring old way to learn programming then you can learn C, C++, Java & Visual Basic. This will help in making your programming fundamentals strong. Then you can move to PHP, python (web technologies) & android programming. ",

A helicopter can go vertical instantanuously for the necessary overview of what you are doing/learning/experiencing. After your 12th you first should climb to a higher level by reading some algorithmic studies (stead of the Nuts and Bolts of computing via the programming languages). You also find these via MOOCS in Coursera. An advanced example? Take the Nijenhuis and Wilf book on the Analysis of combinatoral algorithms. Combinatorics is a very useful subject anyway, because these problems are ubiquitous. ",
