            "answer_text": "Water. So much positive impact in our lives that we tend to forget the negatives. Basically, in the world of chemicals, water is the devil you know. Gives with one hand, takes more with the other. Number of kills Among all chemicals known to man, water has the most kills. The count is still rising, and will never stop. Method Water wants to kill you. If it doesn\u2019t do so directly, it will breed biological agents. Mosquitoes, piranhas, you name it. It will hire and/or collude with other chemicals to kill you. Many of these other chemicals wouldn\u2019t even be able to get to you without water. They may even be inoffensive when not dissolved in water. But water is a jealous chemical. Water doesn\u2019t content itself with sharing its glory. It\u2019s resourceful, and will actually find ways to get you by its own hand. Some of its tactics are phenomenons like drowning, choking and even a good old bash on the head, depending on what height the victim falls from. Frostbite is what happens when some angry molecules of water decide to crystallize irregularly inside cells, stabbing the cells from inside, killing the cells, and eventually the living being composed of those cells. Nobody wants to inhale water in its gaseous state, as they may not live to recount the experience. Speed of kills When some animal gets killed by a collision between head and ice, that\u2019s a fast death. There are slower things that may take years, like some kinds of diabetes. In general, water is slow poison. Did you know? 100% of living beings that have come into contact with water have died! Crazy ;) On a more serious note, water, and the causes and effects of its cooling and warming up in certain patterns, have resulted in several disasters so memorable that we attribute children\u2019s names to them.  TL;DR: Water wants to kill us, and will wage biological and chemical warfare to do so. I thought those were frowned upon by the world\u2019s leading administrations. Many times though, we are smart enough to mitigate the damage from these situations. When water feels we\u2019re being too smart, it wages physical war. Have you ever heard of a tsunami? Nobody wins or pulls a stalemate outta this one.  I don\u2019t wanna die like this! Quick, give me cyanide! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by most deadly. Lowest [math]\\text{LD}_{50}[/math] ? Most horrifying death? Most difficult to find an antidote for? Most dramatic death? If you\u2019re looking for chemicals with the smallest lethal dose, some contenders include tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, botulinum (the toxin that causes botulism), batrachotoxin (the poison from poison dart frogs), fentanyl, and VX nerve agent. Folks can argue about which is the \u201cmost\u201d poisonous, but when you\u2019re talking about stuff that can kill you with a microscopic dose, it\u2019s all splitting some very fine hairs. Most horrifying? Organomercury compounds, especially dimethylmercury, the stuff of nightmares. You can be wearing two sets of latex gloves and if a tiny drop touches your glove, you will die. But not right away, oh no. You\u2019ll die slowly, over a period of months, as your brain disintegrates. Dimethylmercury is manifestly incompatible with the hypothesis of a benevolent creator who loves his creation. Most difficult to find an antidote for? There\u2019s no known antidote for batrachotoxin, or for botulinum-H, an exotic variety of botulinum (the [math]\\text{LD}_{50}[/math] in humans is something like 9 or 10 nanograms; have fun getting to sleep tonight!). Cyanide is not as lethal in small doses as some of the other things on this list, but it too has no effective antidote. Most dramatic? Take your pick, hydrofluoric acid or chlorine trifluoride. Please, pick one; I won\u2019t have anything to do with either. HF destroys tissue so fast it obliterates pain nerves faster than you can feel it\u2026then, when it reaches your bones, starts turning the calcium in your bones to [math]\\text{CaF}_2[/math]. Your bones basically disintegrate. It\u2019s a very, very nasty way to die\u2026and it doesn\u2019t take a lot. But there\u2019s little that is more dramatic than chlorine trifluoride. This stuff bursts into flame on contact with almost anything: flesh, water, sand, asbestos. And you know what\u2019s really cool, for some value of \u201ccool\u201d that means \u201cterrifying nightmare fuel\u201d? When it starts to burn, nothing will stop it. Literally. There is no known fire suppression material. Oh, and the byproduct of that chemical fire includes\u2014wait for it\u2014hot hydrofluoric acid. Surprise! Bonus scary toxin: polonium-210. The Russians have used this for political assassination. A tiny, tiny speck of it introduced in the body causes a long, slow, agonizing death, kind of like our friend dimethylmercury, but you die of internal radiation poisoning rather than chemical poisoning. Bonus scary toxin #2: thallium. Like polonium, but chemical rather than radiation poisoning, which is more in keeping with the question, I think. The world is full of things that want to kill you. ",
