            "answer_text": "Chemical reactions are occurring everywhere around you, and in you. My definition of a chemical reaction is a process that involves atoms rearranging to create new ionic substances or molecules. As opposed to a physical reaction, boiling for example, is a physical reaction, not chemical. When you boil water at 100 degrees Celsius, you are merely breaking the forces of attraction between each water molecule, called intermolecular forces. You are not separating H2O into H2 and O2 but vaporizing H2O molecules to form water vapor. However, if you were to take a mixture of hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen gas (O2) and ignite the mixture, an extremely energetic chemical reaction takes place 2H2 + O2 yields 2H2O where the atoms actually rearrange themselves, creating new bonds and sharing their electrons with new atoms. They can be insanely complex, or they can be elegantly simple. They can be incredibly energetic, they can be incredibly fast, incredibly slow, colorful, endothermic, exothermic, there are a few reactions that will oscillate, although depending on your chemistry experience, might be a little too complex at this point. There are reactions that exist in equilibriums, where reactants form products and the products that are formed react to form reactants in an ongoing process called a dynamic equilibrium. If you\u2019ve ever cooked, you\u2019ve experienced chemical reactions, where you are decomposing molecules, combusting molecules. Everyday when you start up your car a chemical reaction is taking place. Gasoline, (although a mixture of many hydrocarbons, for simplicity, I\u2019ll refer to it as octane) a hydrocarbon with the formula C8H18 is ignited in the presence of oxygen gas, combusts, to form water vapor and carbon dioxide. While I\u2019m talking about combustion, any time you see fire, you are actually seeing the oxidation of a substance. All that means is a substance is giving up electrons to a different substance. In the gasoline example, the carbon atoms give electrons to oxygen atoms in an exothermic reaction. Anyway, sorry for rambling, I get excited when discussing chemical reactions, if you have any questions feel free to message me. Chemical reactions are truly fascinating. ",

            "answer_text": "A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes can occur. The substance (or substances) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change, and they yield one or more products, which usually have properties different from the reactants. Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called elementary reactions, and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism. Chemical reactions are described with chemical equations, which symbolically present the starting materials, end products, and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions. Chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration. Typically, reaction rates increase with increasing temperature because there is more thermal energy available to reach the activation energy necessary for breaking bonds between atoms. ",
