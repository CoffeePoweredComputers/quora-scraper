            "answer_text": "All of these metals react vigorously or even explosively with cold water. In each case, a solution of the metal hydroxide is produced together with hydrogen gas.   2X (s) + 2H2O (l) \u2192 2XOH (aq) + H2 (g)   This equation applies to any of these metals and water - just replace the X by the symbol you want.   For your your reaction, the following would occur (written form and balanced equation):   Potassium + Water \u2192 Potassium Hydroxide + Hydrogen   2K + 2H2O \u2192 2KOH + H2   The reason that Group I metals react with water is because they are trying to obtain a full octet (full outer shell of electrons).   The reactivity of alkali metals increases down Group I because the electromagnetically decreases down the group (i.e. the tendency to gain electrons decreases). This happens because as you move down the Group, the additional electron shell is responsible for the increase in size. Increase in the size results in the outermost electrons being further away from the nucleus - and as this distance negates the extra electron shielding and increase in protons - and so an overall decrease in the effective nuclear charge. Hence, they can be removed more easily. ",
