            "answer_text": "The Hi-Tec Virtual Reality Game is a driving force that could in the future define the evolutionary path of the human species.How does it work? One day you wake up and would think that you are going about your normal business.But suddenly you find yourself in a situation that is far from being expected and nothing is like what you have ever encountered in your life, before.Indeed, you will find out that now you have become a player in the world of the Virtual Reality.No one knows how it all got started, you don\u2019t know how you got there, and no one knows how to control it, or even how the game is going to end.You will need to figure out every step of the way. Most of all, you need to find out who you are up against to, and, you can certainly trust no one.However, the goal is clear: You need to get to the next level at all costs, or die.You are in it to win it!This could happen to an individual, to a group of people, a whole nation, or a whole species.As you know from playing these types of games, every level becomes more difficult and complicated and survival becomes more and more cumbersome, from one level to the next.Soon your dream of getting ahead and becoming more exalted and glorified would gradually only turn into a never ending nightmare.There will be a time when you realize that you can\u2019t get pass your opponents without getting crushed and terminated. This is when the game is no more thrilling and fun and you really want to get out of it.So you need to find out where you are standing. Have you been drawn into a Hologram, a Parallel World, or sucked up into Cyber Space, or left your body and have now emerged in another world controlled by extra-terrestrials, demons or angels.In other words, you would first need to come out of the game, while you are still in the game. Remember, you can\u2019t stop playing, because if you stop you will certainly die and perish. It might take some time until you figure it all out, but if you remain alert and determined; you might as well be able to take control of the situation.If you are lucky and become fully conscious of your state of being, you will suddenly realize that finishing this misery could be as easy as reaching out and pulling off a plug from the wall.However, you will need to find out for yourself what to do. In any case you will be glad when you realize that you are now ready to take control of your life and enjoy freedom in a way it is meant to be for you and others, in the first place. ",

            "answer_text": "Mainly the working of Oculus Rift mainly depends on Hardware:Oculus is producing (SDK) to assist developers integrate oculus rift with their games. There are two models of the Rift that has been made available; they did not go commercial though. The first model of the Oculus Rift was the Development Kit 1(DK1). This was the first shot of Oculus at virtual reality and the Development Kit 2 (DK2), (which offers improvements and advantages all round) has succeeded this model. As of now, the DK1 stands discontinued and DK2 serves as a replacement to the earlier. Head tracking The Rift uses various techniques to improve \u2018immersion\u2019 and one of the elementary methods is via \u2018head tracking\u2019. When you have a device that calculates the movement of your head and imitates that to produce an output, you deal with artificial intelligence at a different level. The task is not only daunting; it requires the best skills to express itself in all its senses. The beauty of the head-tracking device is that you no longer need to move the \u2018mouse\u2019 or the \u2018joystick\u2019 manually in response to the movement of the head. The Rift interacts with motion sensors in three-dimensional (3D) space. To take it to precise terms, the interaction is mainly in terms of acceleration on the three axes and rotation on the three axes. This concept in particular is common among various gaming consoles and the rotation axes and theacceleration axes are commonly abbreviated as 6DOF6. Nonetheless, latency is one aspect where VR is very particular. Unlike other devices, virtual reality gaming consoles have no place for latency and modern devices such as the Samsung VR holds account to that. Importing the unity integration package.You can visit Creators - Downloads | Oculus and then you can download the Unity 4 Integration and Oculus Unity Tuscany demo files. The Tuscany Demo file is a demo project, which you can open with unity directly, and you can start playing with it. The other file is the actual integration file, which we need for our custom project. Using Unity Pro and the Oculus Integration package is a great way to start developing for the Rift,even before you have one. Hope you might get clear from this tutorial @Virtual Reality Tutorial ",

            "answer_text": "Virtual Reality Gaming is an innovative gaming experience which is played in a 3D environment. The gamer wears a Virtual Reality Headset where the game starts playing on its screen. The challenge of making a game visually authentic is something that has become far easier for game production companies in recent years. With the introduction of VR it becomes even more viable, as the player can get caught up in a world that he sees as being completely and utterly real in 360 degrees. By choosing the right accent, the right language and the right period you can get voices that blend in seamlessly to the game\u2019s vibe. ",
