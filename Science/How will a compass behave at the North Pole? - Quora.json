            "answer_text": "It would break free from the glass prison you are holding it in and in certain cases you can hear it shout \"I'm home\". In case you are using digital compasses like the ones present in iPhones and android, you can see small pieces of your screen break and the digital compass coming out of your phone. Jokes apart: First, you should know that finding magnetic north is not always easy - the  spot is actually moving about 15kms northwest every year. Since it  was discovered in 1831, magnetic north has traveled many miles from its  original spot!       If you are holding the compass horizontally at one of the magnetic  poles, so that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the  compass, then there will be no preferred direction for the needle to  point. It may point in the last direction it was pointing as you walked  up to the pole. It may turn until friction slows it down if the needle  was spinning (you can get it spinning by using another magnet or by  turning the compass and letting friction spin the needle up). If you are  carrying anything magnetic at the same time, then the compass needle's  direction may point according to this other object's magnetic field.  If  you hold the compass sideways, one end of the compass's needle will  point down into the earth, and the other will point up.  If you hold the  compass at some angle between horizontal and sideways (which is most  ways of holding the compass, and it may be hard to get it exactly  horizontal), then the needle will point along the direction which is  lowest. Some compasses (the cheap ones) are built such that the needle  is supported on a sharp pin; the compass needle has a hemispherical cup  in the middle and the pin rests in the cup. The compass needle then may  wobble around and dip up and down even if the compass itself is held  flat. It may then dip and point down until the needle scrapes on the  compass face or the needle rubs on the edge of the cup. More expensive  water-filled compasses with special bearings won't wobble like this and  will behave as described above. ",

            "answer_text": "A magnetic compass needle tries to align itself with the magnetic field lines. However, at (and near) the magnetic poles, the fields of force are vertically converging on the region (the inclination (I) is near 90 degrees and the horizontal intensity (H) is weak). The strength and direction tend to \"tilt\" the compass needle up or down into the Earth. This causes the needle to \"point\" in the direction where the compass is tilted regardless of the compass direction, rendering the compass useless.There are established zones around the north and south magnetic poles where compass behavior is deemed to be \"erratic\" and \"unusable\". These zones are defined where H (the horizontal intensity) is between 3000 nT - 6000 nT (erratic zone) and H is less than 3000 nT (unusable zone). Experts in the field claim that if you have a good compass and are careful, you can get decent results through the \"erratic\" zone. However, when H is small (H < 2000nT), the daily variation in D can easily be greater than 10 degrees. TheCanadian Geological Survey has excellent information on their web site concerning magnetism and the north magnetic pole.However if you have a Dip needle  and it is well removed from local influences such as iron, magnetite and other ferromagnetic materials, a compass needle that is free to rotate in a vertical plane will point downward in the northern hemisphere at an angle from the horizontal along the line of the Earth's magnetic field. The instrument for measuring this angle is called an inclinometer, dip needle or, most frequently, dip circle   CF: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/faqgeom.shtml ",
