            "answer_text": "You may remember the planetary model of the atom, with the negative electrons orbiting the positive nucleus. If you look at the system in total, there\u2019s no net charge, and no dipole moment, as the electron\u2019s orbit is centered on the nucleus. If we add an electric field, this pushes on the electrons and pulls on the nucleus, distorting the orbit. The electron becomes lopsided in the opposite direction of the field. This means than there is a distance between the center of the electron\u2019s orbit (the average position of the electron) and the positive nucleus. This is the induced dipole moment. Now, this isn\u2019t technically accurate, as electrons don\u2019t actually orbit. The orbitals are actually regions in space in which the electron has a probability to exist. But from a statistical point of few, these can just be considered as clouds of negative electric charge floating around the nucleus. Again, in the presence of an electric field, the negative cloud gets distorted, and creates a moment as there is now a moment arm between the center of the cloud and the nucleus. ",
