            "answer_text": "Self-awareness is exactly what it says it is. It is awareness of something you consider to be a self. What is a self? That\u2019s a bit more complicated. Generally, people think that a human being is a self, and that the self contained in that human being\u2019s body is whatever they consider to be part of themselves. The problem comes when you consider something to be a part of yourself that you are not aware of, or you are aware of something within your consciousness, but you don\u2019t consider it to be a part of yourself. For example, there are thoughts that individuals have that they are not aware of. These thoughts often motivate actions or even take control of the body for a while. Are those actions part of the self, even though the self is not aware of the thought processes that motivate or manage those actions? Behaviors such as addictions are a good example of automatic behaviors that many people consciously don\u2019t want to engage in, yet they do despite their will. Then there is the awareness of other entities within the self. Often these other entities are perceived as intruders within consciousness. Are they a part of the self because they are only perceived by the individual, or do they represent an awareness of outside entities that have somehow, psychically become evident to the individual\u2019s consciousness? So a self can contain parts that the person is not aware of and can also exclude consciousness that appears to belong to a different self that only that person is aware of. My definition of self includes all that I am conscious of and also parts of me that I am not aware of but can infer by observing my behavior. So all my behavior that I do not consciously want to do, but my body does, I consider to be part of my self, even though I am not aware of the thought processes that motivate and manage those behaviors. Self-awareness is then awareness of the parts of myself that I can consciously observe. There is more to myself that I cannot be aware of. I do my best to try to infer the motivations and to understand my own behavior by observing my actions, but much of what I consider to be myself is mysterious to me and can\u2019t be directly observed. I also have experiences where I feel like I am channeling some other entity, but I believe these experiences come from the other parts of myself that I am generally not aware of. It feels like something else is controlling me, but I believe that the something else is actually parts of my brain I cannot observe. Self-awareness includes both direct observation of my thinking processes as well as indirect observation of my thinking processes that I cannot directly observe. I observe my own behavior to get information about my thinking processes that I cannot directly be aware of. I consider all the actions and behaviors of my body to be a part of myself. I think of my life as an attempt to integrate the different thinking processes that occur within my body, even though I can\u2019t directly observe all those thinking processes. My self-awareness includes both direct observation of my thinking as well as observation of my behavior in order to infer the thinking processes contained within my body that I can\u2019t directly observe.

            "answer_text": "There are three major ZONES of awareness that we, as SELVES, can have: Exteriorceptive AwarenessSight - the awareness of a visual field outside of our bodies and all that we can recognize as familiar or unfamiliar gestalten. Sight uses a projection area in the posterior brain wherein interpretations of images are made.Hearing - the awareness of words, vibrations, music, noise and random sounds that come though our ears in recognizable or unrecognizable ways. Hearing has a projection apparatus as does sight.Smell - the most primitive awareness that goes straight to the rhinencephalon without and projection area in between. It is the most accurate of the senses in that a single smell of isopropyl alcohol can make us feel like we are sitting in the kitchen while mommy puts this burning liquid on a boo-boo we have from falling off our rollar skates. Smell gives us the true \"taste\" of food because, taste is quite limited.Taste - taste only has 5 of all gustatory sensations.SaltySweetBitterSourUmami (a flavor found in meats)Touch - not only does everything we touch with our fingers give us tactile awareness but skin is the largest organ of our body. Everything that impacts or grazes or rests against the skin must be \"sensed\" to be aware of adjusting position of our clothing for maximum comfort.Interiorceptive Awareness:All thinkingAll paranoid thoughtsAll beliefs, in including Religion all the way to Atheism, are parts of mental awarenessSubconscious drivers about which we have little to no awareness have to be brought into awareness through psychotherapy or hypnotherapy.FantasiesImagined things about others or about a sensory input (like a creak in the floor boards is a ghost). Imagining is the most frequent thing our brain does and the problem is that we accept it for truth. Right now, I'm imagining that you wanted all this detail but that could be my tendency to give as much information as possible.Proprioceptive AwarenessAll feelings exist in the body and are imagined as being in your head. In American Sign Language, most feelings are made across the chest. The chest and stomach are the most common place for feelings to be. Even deep crying uses belly and diaphragmic muscles to let the sadness up more powerfully. The primary feelings are:Love (Chest, face, lungs\u2026 emptiness in chest when being blocked)Sadness (felt in eyes and stomach (women can feel sadness from their uterus\u2026and in pains in the stomach, throat and behind the eyes when being blocked).Anger (fists, tension in the trapezius, scapulus, pectoantibrachialis muscles\u2026. chest pain and pain in the temples, scintillating scotoma, and Migraines when being blocked).Fear (shoulders, throat, lungs, legs\u2026 pains in stomach, throat when blocked)Guilt (integumentary, tension in the head, eyes, wringing of hands, decreased depth of breathing and raised shoulders\u2026 projective rage and shame to others, with comfort in previous body areas when blocked).All sub-dermal, physical pain is found in proprioceptive awareness. I am an amputee. I suffer from phantom pain all of the time, even as I type this on my cell phone. I would have to have an electronic nerve blocker installed in the dorsal root ganglia of my spine in order to put an end to this pain. I can't afford the surgery AND I refuse to take strong pain meds because they cloud the mind that I use as a Certified Life Coach and in answering these questions. Internal pains allow us to be warned of illness or injury, just as skin (the sense of touch), lets us know that we've been burnt.All pleasure is a part of proprioceptive awareness. I needn't point out the areas for comforting others or providing sexual stimulation right to the level of the orgasm reflex arc.Now this relates to SELF AWARENESS only and not to the larger awareness of the self in the contextual surroundings or how we perceive (theoretically imagine others) or correctly perceive physiognomic Isomorphism (look this up). INTUITION in its truest is a congruent internal awareness in all three zones about a person or action in the environment. People say, \"Think about it!\" But this really means, \"Fantasize and imagine what is happening.\" People say, \"Trust your senses!!\" But this means, \"Even if something is an optical illusion you should head toward that 'oasis'.\" Lastly and famously, people say, \"Trust your feelings!!!\" But this means, \"No matter how paranoid or delusional or untrusting or suspicious or jealous or hurt you feel that your feelings are 100% trustworthy.\" In fact, trusting our feelings during a fight is something we seldom can do. INTUITION is the King / Queen of Self Awareness. ",
