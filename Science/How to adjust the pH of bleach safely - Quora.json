The fact that you apparently do NOT have any such supervision makes me think you\u2019d be better leaving it alone. I have pH solution curves on chlorine in water . . . somewhere, but nowhere I can lay hands on them quickly. But without them, you will face an unpredicted point at which your solution will suddenly began releasing chlorine gas. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t trust a fume hood in an environment where students are \u201cadjusting the pH of bleach\u201d without knowledgeable supervision. And yes, Virginia, there are cases of cheap-ass construction where fume hood vents are made of zinc plated carbon steel . . . or simply terminate in the attic. Neither of these cases would work out well for you, if you begin venting chlorine gas. And if the vent fan is ALSO carbon steel, and suddenly fails while you are accidentally venting chlorine gas . . . things may be even worse. Good luck; you need it! [PS. If you are a determined sort of dumb-ass . . . take your experiment OUTSIDE! At least that way, so long as you only use small quantities (100 ml of bleach or less), you probably won\u2019t hurt anyone! ] ",
