            "answer_text": "Q: What is the importance of the scientific method to physics? Aristotle, reasoning from his own casual observations during his life, about three centuries B.C., thought that objects rise or fall according to the ratio of four \u201celements\u201d of which they are composed\u2014fire, earth, air, and water. For example, earth, the heaviest element, and water, fall toward the center of the cosmos; hence the Earth and for the most part its oceans, will have already come to rest there. At the opposite extreme, the lightest elements, air and especially fire, rise up and away from the center. H thought these elements give all objects a \u201cnatural motion\u201d from which force is required to deflect them: A stone lying at rest on a table naturally remains at rest.If you let go of a stone it naturally falls toward the earth.Smoke naturally rises.The sun naturally rises in the east, crosses the sky, then sets in the west.Aristotle was utterly, completely wrong, but because he taught Alexander the Great, and because he attained great fame in his lifetime and through his writings, his views\u2014not only of motion, but of most other areas of nature (pretty much all equally wrong) were taken as gospel by nearly the whole world for nearly 2,000 years until Galileo put them to the test. In a few short months, Galileo shows that Aristotle had been wrong, and helped guide thinkers of the time to understand the value of what we now call \u201cthe scientific method\u201d which is nothing more or less than a set of tools and practices for testing belief against reality. The scientific method is essential not only to physics, but to all knowledge. Nothing can be known that isn\u2019t tested against reality\u2014even in principle. ",

            "answer_text": "The use of the scientific method is one of the main features that separates modern psychology from earlier philosophical inquiries about the mind. Compared to chemistry, physics, and other \u201cnatural sciences,\u201d psychology has long been considered one of the \u201csocial sciences\u201d because of the subjective nature of the things it seeks to study. Many of the concepts that psychologists are interested in\u2014such as aspects of the human mind, behavior, and emotions\u2014are subjective and cannot be directly measured. Psychologists often rely instead on behavioral observations and self-reported data, which are considered by some to be illegitimate or lacking in methodological rigor. Applying the scientific method to psychology, therefore, helps to standardize the approach to understanding its very different types of information. The scientific method allows psychological data to be replicated and confirmed in many instances, under different circumstances, and by a variety of researchers. Through replication of experiments, new generations of psychologists can reduce errors and broaden the applicability of theories. It also allows theories to be tested and validated instead of simply being conjectures that could never be verified or falsified. All of this allows psychologists to gain a stronger understanding of how the human mind works. Scientific articles published in journals and psychology papers written in the style of the American Psychological Association (i.e., in \u201cAPA style\u201d) are structured around the scientific method. These papers include an Introduction, which introduces the background information and outlines the hypotheses; a Methods section, which outlines the specifics of how the experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis; a Results section, which includes the statistics that tested the hypothesis and state whether it was supported or not supported, and a Discussion and Conclusion, which state the implications of finding support for, or no support for, the hypothesis. Writing articles and papers that adhere to the scientific method makes it easy for future researchers to repeat the study and attempt to replicate the results. ",
