            "answer_text": "The major difference between the two is the conveying of information. A signal is always talked about in terms of conveying some information about some phenomenon.  Wave is talked about in terms of transferring some energy. A wave can be considered a part of a signal, like a 1 MHz  sinusoidal signal will have a million sine waves per second.  Also, a signal can be talked about in terms of images , video, speech etc. Whereas, waves are classified in terms of the material medium in which they travel , like mechanical or electromagnetic. or the wavelength.

            "answer_text": "A signal is a function of wave. A signal could be a single pulse or a series of pulses that oscillate in a particular manner following the pattern of a wave. Whereas if you talk only about a wave it is the basic structure of periodic oscillations occuring with a set pattern and frequency . Eg. you know a sine wave and if you draw a sine wave you will draw only one cycle but when you draw a signal you will draw more cycles to denote the peaks and other things. Signal is always a function of wave. First we have studied waves then we have been able to classify signals on the basis of our knowledge of waves. Hope it helps. ",
