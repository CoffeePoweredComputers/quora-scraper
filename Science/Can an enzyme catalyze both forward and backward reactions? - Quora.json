            "answer_text": "Yes! In fact many do.      Enzymes increase the rate of the reaction, but do not alter the equilibrium. In practice, some enzymes catalyze the reverse reaction much more than others do.Consider: A+B react to form C+D. If the equilibrium lies far to the right (in english, the reaction goes to completion, perhaps liberating energy, so that c an d do not normally react to make a and b), then the enzyme will not significanty catalyze the reverse reaction. This is also true if C or D become unavailable. This happens if one or both are a gas that rapidly diffuses away, or if another enzyme rapidly removes it.     However, many reactions have an equilibrium that supports significant amounts of reactions in both directions. I am guessing that these have a delta g (free energy change) that is small.  Some reaction in glycolysis are like this. In these cases the enzyme catalyzes both directions. ",
