Now in defense of the question, there are many reasons why someone may search for that, the most important of which is - there is an easy way and the hard way to do everything. The people who do PhDs are usually not the ones who for example start great companies - remember Steve Jobs, Bill gates. So then why Phd? Some one may want to pursue an individual original contribution to humanity and not necessarily be overly encumbered in your direction or creativity by unnecessary things that come with the territory. Yes you can produce your masterpiece, but I am sure over the centuries many great works of individual contribution have been lost in the collective ADD of humanity. So you want to make sure your work gets the respect it deserves without becoming a slave to a crazy PHD advisor somewhere and/or going bankrupt in the process. Enough said. ",

The process is arduous for a reason, and contributing original content to any discipline is nothing to snuff at...think of all of the things you might consider \"easy\" subjects in undergrad (advertising, marketing, etc.). Now, think about how much there is about all of them. And now consider contributing some original content to any one of them. That's tough stuff. ",

Things that make a PhD easier are if you already have an excellent grasp of the specific area that a candidate would like to research, perhaps having completed a first class undergraduate dissertation or even a masters degree dissertation in that specific field which he/she can build upon for a PhD. Another helpful factor is having a fully engaged and supportive supervisor who had a detailed knowledge of the specific field. ",
