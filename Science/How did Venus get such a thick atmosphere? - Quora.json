            "answer_text": "It is speculated that at one time, billions of years ago, there was water. It could have been the accumulation of carbon dioxide that heated the planet and has since boiled off the water. Except for carbon dioxide and some nitrogen all of the other lighter gases have floated up to the top of the atmosphere and have been \u2018blown\u2019 away by a combination of the highly ionized upper atmosphere and the affect of the Sun\u2019s solar wind. The upper atmosphere is mostly sulfuric and sulfide compounds, that insulate the rest of Venus and add to the problem of high temperatures and high winds. So it is left with mainly a C02 atmosphere, very deep and with a pressure on Venus\u2019s surface equivalent to around 3000 feet below water on earth. There are approximately 1500 active volcanoes constantly adding to the amount of C02. ",

            "answer_text": "We have almost as much carbon dioxide as Venus. Ours is locked up in carbonate rocks like limestone. If Venus began like the Earth (possible since the early sun was fainter) it might well have had liquid water. Our carbonate rocks are mostly biogenic, but you don\u2019t absolutely need life to create them. But you do need water. If Venus had a carbon-dioxide cycle like earth\u2019s, it failed to keep the climate under control. As Venus warmed, water evaporated and when it got to the upper atmosphere, it photodissociated and the hydrogen escaped to space. Limestone broke down and the carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere. As more carbon dioxide was released, it got hotter, causing more breakdown - a runaway greenhouse effect. ",
