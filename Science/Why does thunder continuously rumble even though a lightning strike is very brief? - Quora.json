            "answer_text": "While a lightning strike lasts from a fraction of a second to a couple of seconds, the resulting thunder reaching an observer can last much longer. The strike is actually a series of strikes, the initial electrical discharge ionizes the air which reduces the electrical resistance so a series of discharges can follow. The air is heated where the charge travels which causes it to rapidly expand. This expansion amounts to a compression wave or sound wave, (really a series of them since the bolt pulses.) This compression wave radiates outward from the lightning bolt at the speed of sound in air, about 340 meters per second at sea level. Since the bolt is not a point source of sound, more like a (crooked) line source, the lightning bolt is simultaneously at a variety of distances from you. You see the lightning almost instantly since the light travels to you at the speed of light. Next the sound arrives at your location from the nearest point of the bolt as a crash, followed by more distant parts of the bolt arriving as a rolling thunder. So the sound waves are created almost simultaneously at the bolt, but the sound arrives at your location over an extended period of time. ",

            "answer_text": "Thunder continuously rumbles after a brief lightning strike because it finds surfaces to echo from. Hills, buildings, the ground, and even inversion layers and other temperature boundaries in the atmosphere. Directly below a lightning strike, all you might hear is an insignificant \u201csnap\u201d, until the thunder echoes back to you. ",
