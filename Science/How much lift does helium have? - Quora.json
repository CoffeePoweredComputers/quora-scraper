            "answer_text": "Short answer: 1 gram per litre. Unreasonably long  explanation: This can be answered by doing a buoyancy equation. To understand buoyancy, lets first start with the example of a boat in water. A boat floats because it weighs less than its same volume of water - water weighs 1kg per litre, so if anything has a density of less than 1kg per litre, it will float. If a boat (a very tiny boat) takes up the space of 1,000 litres, or 1 cubic metre, it and its cargo can weigh up to 1,000kg before it starts to sink. The same theory can be applied to gasses with different densities.Luckily for us, gasses have some very convenient properties. Fun fact #1-a \"mole\" is the standard measurement of a gas. 1 mole (6.02*10^23 atoms) of gas weighs x grams where x is its atomic weight as defined by the periodic table.i.e. 1 mole of hydrogen weighs 1 gram1 mole of helium weighs 4 grams1 mole of oxygen weighs 16 grams and so on... Fun fact #2-1 mole of any gas occupies the same volume as any other gas under the same conditions.Under Standard Laboratory Conditions (SLC) - sea level at 25 degrees celsius:1 mole of any gas occupies 24.5L.1 mole of hydrogen occupies 24.5L at SLC1 mole of oxygen occupies 24.5L at SLC1 mole of ANY gas occupies 24.5L at SLC. We can use these two facts to determine the densities of air and helium, and hence the buoyancy force. 1 mole of helium occupies 24.5L, and weighs 4 grams.1 mole of air occupies 24.5L and weighs 29 grams. So every 1 mole of helium weighs 25 grams less than 1 mole of air. This means that it can be 25 grams heavier (due to a payload) before it \"sinks\" i.e. becomes more dense than 1 mole of air. If you divide 25g/mol by 24.5L/mol you get 1.02 g/L.Every litre of helium is 1 gram lighter than every litre of air. So 1 litre of helium will weigh exactly the same as 1 litre of air if it carries a 1 gram payload. finished :) Source:1st year chemistry - Monash University1st year fluid mechanics - RMIT ",
