            "answer_text": "Hello, junior high usually refers to the period right before formal high school (typically ninth grade - twelfth grade, although some schools mark the start of high school as the tenth grade). Junior high typically consists of seventh and eighth grade, although the exact specifics vary slightly from region to region. Some areas don\u2019t refer to the grades I previously mentioned as \u201cjunior high school,\u201d but instead as just \u201cmiddle school.\u201d Senior high school (in the United States) is generally the final stage of a normal K-12 education, excluding all forms of higher education (college, university, etc.).

            "answer_text": "The original question was: What's the difference between junior year and senior year in high school? The answer I had planned to give was that in your junior year, you have about a year and a half left to create WOWs in your resume to make your best case for college versus in your senior year, you have a couple of months left to make your best case. But, when I clicked on the question, it changed to What is the difference between junior high school and senior high school? Someone \u201ccollapsed\u201d or changed this question. But, they are not the same thing! ",
