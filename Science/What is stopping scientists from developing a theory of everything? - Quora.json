            "answer_text": "There is not much stopping science at the moment, nothing but the mind and how it has been programmed in all spheres of life since birth, how the brain is wired. When we talk of the way the brain has been wired we are talking about a relationship between neurons and other things. The way the neurons are related is the way the brain has been wired. Therefore our character is molded by the relationship between neurons. You are exactly as you are because of the way your trillions of neutrons are related, immeasurable number of combinations, the combination that makes you is unique, but there are general characteristics and psychologists have pointed these out. So there are spiteful quantum mechanics as there are spiteful business people. There are racist police as well as racist chemists. The key word so far is relationship. We are what we are because of the relationship of our neurons, one can say what about physical disabilities of a good chemist. Well first of all neurons will have a relationship to try best survive with these disabilities, we see people with no hands painting and using a hammer with their feet. We know from quantum mechanics, from the leading minds of quantum mechanics that everything is information. Read up on it on this blog site, Institute of Knowledge A theory of everything therefore must be based on the properties of information, because everything is information. Everything is discrete, everything can be isolated, if nothing could be isolated it would be impossible to know anything, how would you isolate 2 + 2 = 4 and 2 + 7 = 9, you can only know the difference because to a large degree, though abstract concepts, 2 + 2 is very different from 2 + 9, difference implies property of discreteness, otherwise everything is unknowable if it could not be isolated, that is why we can differentiate between gravity and electro magnetic spectrum. We can isolate the properties of gravity from the electro magnetic spectrum. What is common to all information, then we are dealing with everything. What is common to all information is dealing with the theory of everything. But a mind has to be humble to understand this, perhaps what they where thinking is the theory of everything can never be a theory of everything unless they are misleading themselves and thereby limiting everything to their discipline. No, everything must remain as everything and cannot be limited by the wishes of some. From before the big bang, for the big bang to have occurred means there was a time before the big bang, everything has always been involved in a relationship with something else, relationships caused the big bang, relationships between information, some say matter just outnumbered anti matter and an imbalance that led to matter\u2019s victory. To call it an imbalance is wrong, because if it occurred it was meant to be, there will never be symmetry in the universe. All relationships will result in something unique than if there was no relationship. For example, if you are married you are in a relationship, you act differently. Just like when an electron is in a relationship it acts differently than when it is not in a relationship, same with protons, gluons, everything in a relationship is different from when it is not in a relationship. We can say the first law of everything is that \u201cevery relationship results in a loss of freedom\u201d. Loss of freedom need not be bad, we would not exist without that loss of freedom, we would break apart at the subatomic level without this loss of freedom. There is nothing much in the way of a Theory of everything, that we have a law means that it is real, the first law of everything is that every relationship results in a loss of freedom. Very a relationship with the road, lions have a relationship with their prey, they must follow their prey, the earth has a relationship with the sun and we should be glad otherwise planets would just be floating everywhere and uninhabitable, we need sunlight. We need to understand that the Theory of Everything is not one equation, it is a series of laws about what is similar with all information, it must be relevant to psychology, why are they moody chemists, its because of the relationship their neurons have with each other, it must also explain water, how water exists how oxygen and hydrogen atoms behave differently when they make water than when they are separate. A whole new discipline, and will take time to explore, not merely a single equation. But at least we have two laws of the theory of everything. The laws are more than just generalization of principles, some principles do not affect all information, like thermos dynamics, its principles can not explain all information, thermodynamics will never explain the envious economist.
