            "answer_text": "Constants that are not constant are called variables. So the constants we have are the numbers that have never changed. We used to think gravity was constant. Now we know gravity changes depending on where you are on Earth, and by the position of the moon and the sun. In fact, even the apple on your desk would alter gravity, along with the position of every atom with any mass anywhere in the universe. Since weight is a function of gravity, no two kilos were ever equal in the history of the meat market. But we\u2019re okay with it. Anyone can test any constant. You could measure pi [1] or the speed of light. Your phone and all technology that relies on physics are also constantly testing these constants. what we see as an immutable set of laws that we observe in our puny field of vision. That\u2019s the reality of physics. These laws are not immutable in the least. What they all have are degrees of truth, and by truth here we mean a certain alignment with the behavior we observe externally. So when we measure 1 kilo on a scale for, say, postage purposes, we find that our understanding of weight and the technology we use to weigh it is in good enough alignment with the real world consequences of the weight. If we were to load a plane with too much mail, it would be dangerous, but the scales we use are good enough to let us avoid that. Of course, if we were a baker, or a drug dealer, or a experimental physicist, a postal scale is probably not good enough. In physics, everything is always possible, but we are also constantly observing everything all the time. So when things change, we make a note of it and make adjustments, just as we would if our car broke down. In this way, science is very much a technology and a vessel in and of itself. We have no guarantees it will take us where we want to go forever. But chances are, we\u2019d probably die first before that happens \u2014 and by that I\u2019m referring to science breaking, not your car. But at the same time, we\u2019re guaranteed science, and your car, will improve within our lifetime.  [1] In practice there are two pi\u2019s. There is the mathematical construct, and then there is the measurable value. Mathematicians have the right to criticize the misuse of pi in physical examples, except, physically, we can still measure a relationship regardless of how the same relationship could be abstractly formulated and derived through pure math. And the fact that there is a number that can be used to measure how much wallpaper we need to cut to wrap cleanly around a pillar makes pi real. And if anything, the fact that there is a number that bridges this abstract-concrete divide is profound. Advanced mathematicians will easily dismiss how mathematical intuitions are acquired first, because it\u2019s irrelevant to their thinking now. But be it counting apples or measuring circles, the physicality of numbers are taught first. Pi is taught as the relationship between two distances, both which are intuitively measurable and physical. We are free to progress past such intuitions, but that still does not make them wrong \u2014 just, less accurate (which is inline with the nature of scientific progress). ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question. I will try to answer it from several points of view. First of all, we have to make the distinction that the laws of physics that we have can only be verified inside what is known as \u201cthe Observable universe\u201d. Acording to Special Relativity, we can only get information from the observable universe. With this information, we can verify or deny the laws that scientists postulate about physics. As we know that the actual universe is bigger than the observable universe and that the observable universe is growing as time flows, there is always the possibility that at some moment we will find something new that doesn\u00b4t obey the laws of physics, but this is only a posibility caused by the limitations of the information we can receive (caused, ironically, by another physics law) By the other hand, as Dhiraj Khanal wisely answered, the observations that we have made on the observable universe tells us that the Fundamental interaction forces have the same behaiviour at least in every measure we have made. As he also mentions, we have barely made measurements and research in about 1% of the observable universe, so it may not be enough proof to generalize that the laws of physics are constant in the complete observable universe. There has been moments in our history where, due to new information received, we find that the laws we thought described all of the objects of a certain field of study don\u2019t describe a determined fenomena. There are some important examples, as old as when we discovered that Newton\u2019s Gravitational theory didn\u2019t predict the precesion of Mercury\u2019s orbit or as recent as the experimental proof of Neutrino Oscillation (2015 Nobel Physics Prize) that contradict the standard model of particle physics. So in a certain way, the laws of physics \u201care not constant\u201d through time and also, at a given moment of time, there might be a space region that we don\u2019t have information about where a lot of physical laws may not be satisfied, but that we don\u2019t have information from that place, as a consecuence of our technology for getting information or beacause another physical law forbids us of that (Observable universe or the inside of a blackhole, for example) Also we have to ask ourselved, from a philosophical point of view, we must question if we can generalize information in physics as we do in Mathematics. For example, when we want to prove that a set of objetcs, even an infinte set, satisfies certain property, we prove that any given object of that set satisfies it and say that, as there was nothing particular about that object and we just used that fact that it was a member of the set, every other member of the set satifies the property as well. This is a logical inference rule normally known as generalization. We can do that with mathematical objects because they are abstractions of thought that, in a lot of cases, do not have a direct relationship with the \u201cmaterial world\u201d. Regarding the material world that physics study, we can not generalize in the same way because, even when we are establishing a law about a universal object of nature such as an elementary particle, there is a chance that all of the objects of wich our law says something are not the same (It has happend with quarks, electrons, neutrinos, etc). Philosophically, generalization in physics is not really simple. ",
