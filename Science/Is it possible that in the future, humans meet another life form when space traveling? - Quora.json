The more we travel, the more likely it is to find either evidence or even contact with another intelligence. At the moment, contact is impossible unless they come to us, and the sheer size of the universe makes this unlikely unless they have a civilisation that covers major sections of the galaxy. We are separated not just by distance, but also time, thanks to the relativistic effects of the speed of light. There could be a thriving civilisation just 1% of the width of the Milky Way galaxy away from us, yet we will have no indication of their existence for a thousand years if they have just developed high technology.

It is possible for all of the air in the room to suddenly concentrate in a sphere, leaving a vacuum everywhere else. While quantum mechanics predicts that strange things are possible, and do happen occasionally at the extremely small scale, they are exponentially less likely as we approach the scale of a room. If there is a 1:56 quintillion chance of something then that something is possible. But in science probability is key. Almost nothing is impossible, because impossibility is an absolute. But any number of wild ideas a wildly improbable. There is the famous example of a teapot in orbit around the Moon. It could be! But no one believes there is a teapot in orbit around the Moon. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not impossible so therefore it is possible. I think it\u2019s very likely that microbes will be found on Mars if we send enough missions to look in a variety of places. I have always been a bit curious about Valles Marineris, a very deep gash in Mars that I think may be more conducive to lifeforms because of its greater atmospheric pressure and temperature. But I would not expect to find multicellular life there. Then there are various moons of Jupiter and Saturn for which there is good evidence of liquid water underneath a frozen shell. Those may be where the first true animate ET life-forms are found. And the cool thing is these are in our backyard. We just need to summon the will and resources to send the missions. As for technologically developed ETs, they are probably not to be found in the Solar System but again, it is not impossible. ",

Bacteria is a life form so small we may not see it\u2026 we have already found what may be a such form chemistry on Mars we think might\u2026 But, not sure certain, I believe the case. In our universe known we think all life is fundamentally CARBON base atom in form chains\u2026 but, there could be SILICON based \u2026 OR other wise? Earth us but a tiny, very tiny, hardly a speck of dust in just our own galaxy in a Universe of potentially billions or more galaxy. If we could go at the speed of light of 186, 000 feet per second+ it would take a hundred thousand light years just to go end to end our spiral galaxy length sides. And, maybe, just MAYBE we might bump into a life form chemistry like ours, or be other wise. There doesn't HAVE TO BE another but we human things are made of curiosity to play with the Theory of Probability to not be bored with nothing to imagine to give us a reason to exist. ",

The ships would be flying for millions of years through the galaxy (galaxies)and would be artificially superintelligent. To put humans on the ships would be limiting of the missions goals. Human would eventually travel later, after the artificial intelligence does necessary pre-research. Maybe that is how life came to Earth, or how human life came to Earth. In me you have the first human who declared himself to have reached human superintelligence. The future will open endless possibilities, from uploading of human minds onto computers (I have a idea how it could work, of course), to world peace and the world government.

Can we say the Alien is as smart as we are? By the way, this is impossible. We humans are the only intelligent beings in the Milky Way Galaxy. The next intelligent beings live a million galaxies away and much too far to travel to get here right by us. Too far makes it impossible. If they were close by we would be looking at them today -  ",
