For a 3-dimensional position space wavefunction  the normalization condition would be , so  has units of inverse volume and  has units of square root of inverse volume, e.g. m. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends what degrees of freedom you look at. Describing your entire system with a density matrix if you want to observe only a certain quantity of the system you take the partial trace on the system - meaning you restrict your system to the degrees of freedom you look at. If not the wave function of your entire system is given by the Kronecker tensor product of all degrees of freedom that your system has. As the vector spaces involved can be quite strange the total unity can be something rather strange as a product - if it can even be well defined. ",
