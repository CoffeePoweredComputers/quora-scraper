            "answer_text": "Sure, especially if there are a lot of photons. There is a plan to produce an ultra-slow positive muon beam from thermal muonium atoms by first exciting the 2p state and then hitting it with a second laser to ionize the atom. This works. See http://www.riken.jp/ap/conf/pbar08/abst/matsuday-abstract.pdf As you suspected, this is hard for excited states whose lifetime against deexcitation by photon reemission is very short \u2014 like the 2p state \u2014 but other states (like the 2s state) can be metastable due to various conservation laws, leaving plenty of time to zap them again. Unfortunately, said states are also harder to excite from the 1s ground state for the same reasons. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, an atom in any state can generally absorb a photon. The only exceptions are when a conservation law is violated. For example, it is impossible for an atom to absorb a photon to transition from an s orbital to a d orbital, because that would violate conservation of angular momentum (the s state has zero angular momentum and the d state has an angular momentum of 2\u210f2\u210f, while a photon only carries an angular momentum of \u210f\u210f - not enough to make up the difference). If an atom were in a particular excited state and isolated, it would stay in that excited stay for a few nanoseconds. However, atoms are usually in a mixture of states, including the excited ones, due to its interaction with the environment. So, when a photon of the right frequency strikes an atom there is always some chance of triggering a transition from an excited state to a more excited state. In fact, the field of nonlinear optics relies on this process.  ",

These involve jumps between respectively the second and third shell, and those further out. Note that hydrogen would not actually have any spectral lines in the visible range if not for jumps between n=2 and those of higher energy (the Balmer series), as the others fall either in the infrared or the ultraviolet.

            "answer_text": "Yes, it can. All the emission lines you see in a spectrum Lyman, Balmer, Paschen also are absorption lines in the right circumstances. In high temperature environments you have a higher probability to have many atoms excited. There a photon absorbtion would raise the energy level. At some temperature all the electrons will be stripped from the atom this way and you get a plasma. ",
