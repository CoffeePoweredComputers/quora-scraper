It isn't even based on things happening after other things happen. It doesn't seem to require space or time at all, though it can happen in space and time. This is why it's so annoying. ",

            "answer_text": "It's because the measurements of the universe are \"fuzzy.\"  The basic particles of the universe don't have a precise location or a precise momentum until they get measured.  Similarly if you ask, how many particles are in a box, there isn't a precise answer.  The answer is probabilistic. ",
