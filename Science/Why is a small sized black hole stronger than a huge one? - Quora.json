            "answer_text": "You can get it from the very definition of a black hole. A black hole is tiny space that contains enormous amount of matter with a very small volume. So, from a generalized point of view, let us consider two rooms: one huge room and another relatively smaller than the former. Now if we store the same amount of matter in both the rooms, then which one will have a greater density? Obviously the smaller one as density meand masd per volume. Now, in the same way a smaller black hole keeps a huge amount of mass in a very small space, therefore its density is very high. So,its gravity will be greater than that of the large black hole. So, the smaller one will be stronger. ",

            "answer_text": "Who said?  This is so not true.  Bigger black holes, larger mass, larger gravity.  It's just that, in smaller black holes, the distance from the singularity and the event horizon is small. Ergo, the tidal forces will tear us apart much quickly after we pass the horizon.  In larger black holes, this distance is very big and it takes a very long time to reach singularity after passing the horizon. It will take hours before we're torn apart.  Both of them have the same destructive abilities. ",
