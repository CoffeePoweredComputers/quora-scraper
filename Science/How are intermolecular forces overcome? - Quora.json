            "answer_text": "Intermolecular Forces are the forces between the two molecules, and can be classified under dipole-dipole (Hydrogen bonds falls under this), ion-dipole, or London Dispersion forces. These forces dictate the melting and boiling point of a substance. Think about it: molecules of a solid are very close together, liquids are less compact, and a gas are very far apart. If a substance has higher intermolecular forces, it will be harder to break those interactions to get the molecules farther apart; In order to break those interactions, we must add energy, as that increases the movement of the molecules (kinetic energy). If enough Heat is added to a substance, it will move fast enough to be able to overcome its intermolecular forces, and when that fully occurs, phase change happens (all molecules must break their bonds before a phase change for any molecule can occur, this is latent heat). So to answer your question, adding thermal energy to a substance will increase its kinetic energy, effectively \u201covercoming\u201d its intermolecular forces, so it will undergo a phase change. ",
