            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been quite some time, but the scariest movie I\u2019ve ever seen was \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d. I\u2019m not sure if I can come up with eight reasons, but I will do my best to list those I do have: This movie arrived at a time when the internet was just beginning to be widely adopted.The marketing campaign (brilliantly) incorporated a website that perpetuated the movie\u2019s plot as if it had actually happened, so many (myself included) initially thought these were real life events.I remember sitting alone in my home office watching the many \u201cinterviews\u201d on said site that were quite unnerving.This movie was the epitome of what\u2019s called the \u201cfound footage\u201d style, but the film makers took that to another level - incorporating the \u201cfound\u201d aspect into the plot, as in this footage was \u201cfound\u201d after its creators disappeared.The TV ads for this movie are the first that I recall showing audience members jumping in real fear. Although I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been used before, this seemed like a fresh approach at the time.The actors were all unknowns who, for all anyone knew at the time, were indeed college documentarians. Their performances were natural and convincing enough to fool thousands of unsuspecting movie goers (myself included).I wanted to see this movie more than anyone in my immediate cirle, so I ended up going to the theater alone to watch it. The theater was virtually empty, as I had a flexible schedule and could go at off peak times.This is the first movie that kept me up for several days afterwards, visions of shaky cam horrors dancing though my head.Hope that answers your question to your satisfaction.
