            "answer_text": "What is the chemical formula of Ozone? O3. Which means that the ozone molecule comprises 3 atoms of oxygen. So the mass number of ozone is 48 (16*3). 1 Mole of Ozone = 48 grams = 6.023 * 10^23 atoms of ozone. So 4.8 gm of Ozons contains 0.6023 * 10^23 atoms of ozone. So total number of oxygen atoms in 0.6023 * 10^23 atoms of ozone = 0.6023 * 10^23 * 3 = 1.8069 * 10^23. ",
