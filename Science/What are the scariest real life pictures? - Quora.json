            "answer_text": " DISCLAIMER: What you're about to read and see are very disturbing. If you upset easily or are bothered by very graphic images and content, DO NOT PROCEED. You've been warned. The above beautiful face was that of Sylvia Likens, an innocent, sweet, and kind 16 year old girl. Read on to find out why authorities consider her case to be the \u201cmost cruel, worst crime ever committed in the history of the state of Indiana\u201d, a proclamation which still stands today. Her parents were part of a traveling circus, so, in July of 1965, Sylvia's father asked an acquaintance of his, whose daughters were friends with his, if she would look after Sylvia and her younger sister until the following November. The woman's name was Gertrude Baniszewski.  Baniszewski (pictured above) received monthly payments for boarding Sylvia and her sister. At first, Sylvia made friends and got along with the neighborhood children. She was quiet and shy, but very loving. During their first few weeks at the residence, Sylvia and sister Jenny were not subjected to discipline. In fact, they rarely were scolded at all. Then, one week, Gertrude's payment didn't come through from Mr. Likens, so, to vent, she took her anger out on the Likens sisters, beating their bare buttocks' with hard, wooden paddles. One time, they were both beaten 15 times each for eating too much food at a church luncheon. This was nothing. Soon, mostly all the abuse was directed towards Sylvia and not her sister, Jenny. She would be starved regularly, and continued to receive whippings, except the paddle now had nails driven through it, and her wounds began to get infected. However, Gertrude wouldn't listen, nor did she care (Likens even began eating discarded or rotting food out of garbage cans from her starvation). Not long after this, Sylvia became subject to humiliation. Gertrude would ask her embarrassing, suggestive questions in front of her boys and the neighborhood children about sex, what she's done with boys, and if she'd ever had anal sex. Gertrude had even forced Sylvia to wrestle local teenage boys, and she would be repeatedly kicked and thrown against the walls. The punches to the gut resulted in an untreated fractured rib. On one occasion, after being accused of stealing candy, Sylvia was humiliated, being called a \u201cwhore\u201d and receiving hard, brutal kicks to the genitals. Over the last two months, Sylvia was subject to all kinds of disgusting things. She ended up bound on a dirty mattress naked in the basement, where kids from the neighborhood would repeatedly rape her, many times in front of Baniszewski, as she watched and mocked Sylvia aloud. Gertrude also, convinced by her delusions that Sylvia was a prostitute and whore, would take scalding hot needles and cauterize words into her flesh and stomach (see photo below\u2026. WARNING: GRAPHIC). Baniszewski, on another occasion, felt that Sylvia should never be allowed to experience sexual pleasure for the rest of her life, so she heated up a fire poker stick until it turned fire - orange, and she seared her clitoris with it. The branding was so painful, Sylvia blacked out, while the kids kept raping her. She was eventually impregnated, as the boys would carelessly ejaculate inside of her. Baniszewski would also casually put cigarettes out on Sylvia's flesh out of boredom, regardless of how loud she screamed through her dirt - covered gag. Throughout the ordeal, Likens was relentlessly humiliated. Baniszewski branded the words \u201cIm a prostitute and proud of it\" on Likens' abdoment (also in photo below). Sylvia died of a subdermal hematoma, malnutrition, and shock. Neither girl sought help because they figured nobody would believe them, and that it would make their situation worse. When Sylvia finally succumbed to her injuries, and when Baniszewski could no longer wake her up by beating her in the face with books or dousing her in scaulding hot water, she phoned the police. When police arrived, Baniszewski led them to the basement, where they found Sylvia tied to her bed, in her own urine and fesces, emaciated and mutilated.   The police found over 300 cigarette burns on Sylvia and at least 150 different bruises and lacerations. Jenny, her younger surviving sister, was coached and threatened by Baniszewski and her daughter Paula that if she doesn't tell the police exactly what they said to say, she'd be treated just like her sister. She agreed and did so, lying to police about the entire affair to cover for Gertrude. However, before she left the station with Gertrude and Paula, she whispered into the detective's ear \u201cget me out of here and I'll tell you everything\u201d. Due to this statement, police had probable cause to arrest Gertrude and her family members, all of whom participated in some form to Sylvia's torture, within hours of discovering her body. The autopsy found cuts, burns, severe bruising, broken bones, and serious muscle and nerve damage. The damage to her clitoris and the constant rape resulted in her vagina being swollen shut. Likens' fingernails were found ripped off, and most of her outer layer of skin was cut and peeled off. The pain was so horrific that Sylvia had bitten off her lip in several places. After the arrest and court proceedings, including Baniszewski's denial of guilt over and over again, the courts found her and most of her children, including neighborhood kids, guilty. Both Gertrude and Paula were sentenced to life. However, they had a retrial (of course). The judge in the retrial changed the verdict for Gertrude to voluntary manslaughter because he felt the extensive media coverage from the previous trial impeded a fair hearing. Baniszewski was to serve between two and 20 years. She did six, and was paroled for \u201cgood behavior\u201d. She changed her name and lived basically happily ever after as a born - again Christian now known as Nadine. Below is a photo of Baniszewski laughing in court as they describe Sylvia's injuries.  I always wondered if Sylvia abandoned God at anytime during this futile experience. Gertrude died comfortably in bed, snuggling under her covers. ",

            "answer_text": "Instead of one, I\u2019ll give you a few. These photos thoroughly disturb, and demonstrate either the barbarism of man, or nature and circumstance. the scariest photos are those that show scenes of violence, death, or distress. Therefore, viewer discretion advised. Here are some photos that scare me the most: Cameraman killed by race car engineAt the U.S. national Hot Rod Races in Indianapolis, cameraman Joe Rooks was filming the race when one of the cars crashed near him and its blower flew down the track and struck him in the back, killing him. A photographer caught the moment before, during and after impact.    Kurdish rebels executedThis photo captures the moment that nine Kurdish rebels were shot by government forces. You can see in the photo that the first eight have been shot and are falling and the last one awaits his fate. Just imagining what was going through that last man\u2019s head is enough to make my skin crawl.  Captain Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n L\u00e9m\u2019s executionA war correspondent caught the exact moment the bullet from a pistol pierced the skull of a north Vietnamese officer during the Vietnam war. The expression on his face is one that\u2019s in unbelievable pain, and I find it one that\u2019s hard to forget.  Thammasat University lynchingThis photo depicts a leftist student, Wichitchai Amornkul being beaten with a folding chair while hanging from a tree. Royalist mobs lynched and killed many students like him during the Thammasat U massacre.  Strange fruitThis photo depicts two young African American men hanging from a tree after being lynched by a mob. This photo haunts me. Seeing the two lifeless bodies dangling, and the all-white crowd smiling and pointing like what they\u2019ve just participated in is a good thing makes me sick. This was taken in the U.S. South in the 30s. The two men were accused of having raped and robbed a white woman, a story that sounds very much like the case of Tom Robinson from the novel To Kill a Mockingbird. This photo also inspired a song by Billie Holiday, that is quite haunting once you realize the real meaning. You can find it below the photo.  Attempted murderThis photo was taken in Moscow, and shows the moment a victim had a filleting pike stuck into his gut by an attacker. The look of disbelief on the victim\u2019s face saddens me. If you look in the background you\u2019ll see that the accomplice of the murderer is keeping another man occupied so that he ignores the attack. What also baffles me is that this happened in broad daylight, with a photographer able to see it. This photograph was also very well timed to be able to catch the exact moment the attack occurred.  StalingradThis is a photo of dead German soldiers from the battle of Stalingrad. You can see the pile extends all the way to the back of the photo, and for all we know even farther. The death toll was one of the highest in WW2, and seeing these frozen and lifeless bodies stacked like garbage is quite disturbing and scary.  Sunken manThis is Odjegba Okene. He was a cook on a South African Transport ship when it faced rough waters and sunk. Some divers went to the bottom of the ocean where the ship had touched down, intending to recover dead bodies. While going through the ship, they found him in an air pocket where he\u2019d been stuck for 3 days, chest deep in sea water and darkness. Although it has a happy ending and he was rescued, this pictures always creeps me out because it shows me an exasperated man, so happy to know he\u2019s surviving, but also shows how terrible his ordeal must have been. Not knowing why you're alive, if you\u2019re going to get out alive, plus having sea water blanketing most of your body is a very terrifying scenario. The video of his rescue is very interesting as well, and can be found on Youtube.  Accident on the fire escapeThis is a photo that captures the moment that a young mother and her young child fell to the ground when a fire escape collapsed during an apartment fire. A firefighter had tried to rescue them but as he stepped on to the escape, it broke under their weight. The child actually survived because his mother\u2019s body broke his fall. This photo is chilling to me because the woman in this photo died a few seconds after this was taken.  Jewish test subjectThis is a photo from Dachau concentration camp during the Second World War. It shows a Jewish prisoner during one of the many experiments that Nazi doctors performed to test the effectiveness of various military prototypes. In this picture, they\u2019re testing the effect of oxygen deprivation on the human body, because Luftwaffe pilots could face this issue. The Jewish prisoner has passed out from deprivation, or could possibly even be dead. Another common test was to immerse Jews in cold sea water to see how long they could survive. It\u2019s unbelievable and sickening that anyone could treat a human this way.  ",

            "answer_text": "Without context, these pictures may not seem so scary. But the real horror lies in the stories behind them. Each one of those images sends a chill down my spine, paralyzing my body, and hijacking the words in my head.  As they were suffocating to death, the prisoners of Auschwitz left those scratches on the walls of the gas chambers. They signed with their fingernails on the death of humanity. Between 1942 and 1944, hundreds of thousands of Jews were brought from all across Europe to Auschwitz - the Nazi\u2019s most infamous extermination camp. Located in Southern Poland, Auschwitz was the closest to hell on Earth. It was built and then expanded as part of the Nazi\u2019s plan for the complete annihilation of the Jewish people in Europe - the plan they named \u201cThe Final Solution to the Jewish Question\u201d. Here, killing was industrialized. And murder had a new definition.  Upon arrival, those who were deemed unfit for work would be immediately sent to the crematorium. Pregnant women, children, the elderly, and the mentally ill had no right to breathe anymore\u2026in the eyes of the Nazis.  \u201cMen to the left. Women to the right\u201d. SS officers\u2019 greeting for the new arrivals to the death camp. In his emotional and heart-wrenching book \u201cNight\u201d, Elie Wiesel recalls the day on which he arrived in Auschwitz. That morning, Elie\u2019s family was torn apart. His innocence was murdered after witnessing what he\u2019d thought to be beyond impossible. He watched his mother and sister being taken away from him\u2026forever. He was only 15 years old. His sister was 7. Standing there, helpless, he gazed at the top of the building to which they were being taken. Flames were coming out of the chimneys. Little did he know at the time that those flames would later feed on the flesh of his mother and sister. Or perhaps, he didn\u2019t want to believe it.  \u201cNot far from us, flames were leaping up from a ditch, gigantic flames. They were burning something. A lorry drew up at the pit and delivered its load-little children. Babies! Yes, I saw it -saw it with my own eyes . . . those children in the flames.\u201d Elie Wiesel. Documented in these disturbing images are the moments of separation. On the right is the path to the gas chambers. On the left, the road to enslavement, hunger, and torture under the mercy of hope for a long-awaited liberation.  \u201cNever shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky\u201d Elie Wiesel. Refusing to believe what he just saw, fearful that his mother and little sister would face the same destiny, Elie tells his father \u201cI do not believe that they could burn people in our age, humanity will never tolerate it. ...\u201d To which his father replied, in a broken voice\u2026  \u201cHumanity? Humanity is not concerned with us. Today anything is allowed. Anything is possible, even these crematories. . . .\u201d Frightened that he, too, might be thrown into the flames, Elie says\u2026  \u201cFather, if that is so, I don\u2019t want to wait here. I\u2019m going to run to the electric wire. That would be better than slow agony in the flames.\u201d His father doesn\u2019t utter a word. Those moments of horror would be engraved in Elie\u2019s memory. The first days in Auschwitz changed him forever.  \u201cNever shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never\u201d. To prevent mass hysteria, before entering the gas chambers, inmates were told that they\u2019d be getting into the shower. Some of them were even given a soap and a towel. They then stripped off their clothes while the executers stripped off their humanity. Only when the gas was released did the victims realize that death was imminent. They had no other choice but to scratch the walls with their fingernails in a desperate attempt to survive. Perhaps they can make it back to the outside - back to the world that let them down. But it was all in vain. Twenty minutes later, the pain was gone.  \u201cI pinched my face. Was I still alive? Was I awake? I could not believe it. How could it be possible for them to burn people, children, and for the world to keep silent? No, none of this could be true. It was a nightmare. ... Soon I should wake with a start, my heart pounding, and find myself back in the bedroom of my childhood, among my books. ..\u201d More than 1 million people were killed inside Auschwitz in the span of four years. As many as 15,000 were burned every single day. As one historian puts it: \u201cYou have to stop being human in order to believe that they were burning people alive in the middle of the twentieth century\u201d. The atrocities committed inside the walls of Auschwitz will always be a stain on humanity. r/AskHistorians - Are the nail marks made on the walls Auschwitz gas chambers real or not? Are they part of the reconstruction or were they made by tourists? Night (The Night Trilogy, #1) Auschwitz concentration camp - Wikipedia ",

This picture was taken before a 2 year old named James Bulger was killed. It depicts them taking him away from his mum while she was distracted. This case was well known because his 2 kidnappers and murderers were very young. They sexually assaulted him, dropped iron bars on his head, kicked and punched him. They tied him to a rail track where his body was cut in half. Reports say that he died before he was struck by the train. After this the parents had to move around after receiving death threats from vigilantes and protestors gathered because of this senseless act. They were released with restrictions years later. Their identities may be released later on after one of them was convicted of being in possession of child abuse images. Honestly..  This depicts a couple selling their children\u2019s body parts as food during the famine in the Soviet Union.   This is a picture of Mademoiselle Blanche Monnier.

She was 49 when she was found, she died aged 64. Her mother died of a heart attack after mobs gathered to punish her..  This is a picture of Ricardo Lopez also known as the Bjork stalker. The famous stalker who tried to kill the Icelandic singer Bjork after he went insane regarding her relationship with Goldie. He created some form of a mini bomb through post.

Take this creepy photo for example. Looks like something you\u2019d see in POW camp, not a mental health facility. Island of the Dolls  South of Mexico is Isla de Las Munecas (Island of the Dolls). The true history of this island is difficult to discern, as it balances both verifiable fact and legendary folklore. The quick and dirty version is that a young girl drown on the island and, sometime after, a doll rose to the surface. The owner of the island, Don Julian Santana Barrera, presumed the doll had belonged to the little girl. He hung it in a tree as a show of respect for the young girl. The gesture was to no avail, however, as her spirit continued to haunt him. In response, he hung even more dolls to appease her. Barrera passed away in 2001, and the island has become a popular tourist attraction, where visitors come to hang even more dolls. Victoria  If you look at family photos from the Victorian era, you might not realize that many of those featured are actually dead. Not just dead now, but actually dead at the time the picture was taken. Indeed, it was common practice to get pictures with the newly-deceased to have one final memory of them before they were laid to rest. Many of the pictures are done so well that you can\u2019t even tell. This girl here? Totally dead. SWING This photo is creepy in that is prompts a whole slew of questions. Here are just a few: Is that a child up there?How did that child get up there?Why is that child up there?If not a child, then what the heck is it and, again, how did it get up there?Can we put Nickelback up there?The world needs to know! Masked Woman  It\u2019s just basic human nature. This one is our favorite. Like the previous photo, this one prompts so many questions. Judging by the lack of leaves on the trees in the background, this picture must have been taken at a time when the days are shorter, which means the nights are longer. Still, around Halloween, there are usually more leaves on the trees, so this wasn\u2019t a Halloween costume. Perhaps a play? Perhaps just a very deeply disturbed person with a friend who was willing to take a picture. Freals, if Facebook was around back then and this was posted, Zuckerberg would likely have shut the whole thing down. It\u2019s that creepy. Clown Zero  At Awaken Haunted Attraction, we like to keep our fingers on the pulse of current trends. Unless you have been living six feet under for that past few months you have seen that the clowns have organized and are unleashing a coordinated sortie with the sole aim of scaring the living crap out of all of us. Clowns can do this. You know why? Because people hate clowns. You know why people hate clowns? People hate clowns because of this clown. This is Clown Zero. Thanks creepy-ass clown. Family Portrait  Perhaps you have intuited it already, but we really are sensitive people here at Awaken Haunted Attraction. We are hard working, productive members of society. We have families. If you cut us, do we not bleed?! So, while we have an affinity for the grotesque, we don\u2019t make fun of people\u2019s appearances. We are all in this together, right? I mean, except for these people. Have you ever seen a family portrait where every single member of the family looks like they would not think twice about twisting your head off your neck? Us either. Creepy. Baby Monitor  If you are a parent, you know the joy and struggle of raising a child. That child is the most precious gift you have ever been given. You can look into her eyes until she falls asleep in your arms. The slightest cry is enough to heighten your senses to levels unknown by your pre-parent self. In fact, we often install video monitors in our children\u2019s room so that we can even keep an eye on them when they are sleeping that deep sleep that only children can muster. Every now and again, you may wake up in the night and take a peek at the monitor to make sure she is fine and all snuggled up, just like little Miriam here who is\u2026 HOLY HELL! Scarecrow  When the harvest moon is coming, and the cool breeze blows through the corn, we can reflect on the lowly scarecrow. His job, all season, has been to keep the birds from getting in the crops. Then, there is this fella. He looks like he has been there for a few seasons, now. His legs have fallen off, but his pelvis is still hanging in there. We aren\u2019t totally sure what is up with the hood and, frankly, we are not sure we want to know. We are just going to assume it was a really good scarecrow and not, you know, something else. Post-mortem photography was a trend in Victorian England to preserve the image of a family when a loved one died.  Two parents pictured with their deceased daughter. Post-mortem photography became common in Victorian England when the rise of early photography coincided with the short life spans of individuals. They were also known as \"memento mori\" photos, meaning \"remember you must die.\" As photography was still rare, the death of a family member was often the first time a family considered taking a portrait. They did this to commemorate the dead, and to have an image of the deceased \u2014 probably their only one. A shadow is all that remains of a man incinerated by the atomic bomb that dropped in Hiroshima in 1945.  The shadow of a man left by the atomic bomb dropping on Hiroshima, Japan. When the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6th, 1945, it incinerated humans so quickly that \"shadows\" of them were left imprinted on surfaces. The above photo, \"Human Shadow Etched in Stone,\" depicts a man who sat on a flight of stairs outside of the Sumitomo Bank in Hiroshima, Japan, about 800 feet away from the atomic bomb when it detonated. He was so close to its detonation point that he essentially vaporized. This sort of shadow is also known as a \"death shadow.\" In the 1950s, the US government made fake towns and filled them with mannequins for nuclear testing.  Mannequins set up in the desert of Nevada for nuclear testing. Dick Strobel/AP Sometimes, real life can be scary enough without the supernatural. In the mid-1900s, in order to test the impact of an atomic blast on populated areas, technicians created fake towns known as \"doom towns\" in the desert of Nevada and blew them to smithereens. In fact, the US dropped a 16-kiloton bomb on one of them to determine if wooden-frame homes, cars, and mannequins \u2014 in place of people \u2014 could survive a nuclear blast. The French neurologist Duchenne de Boulogne pioneered the use of medical photography in his experiments.  One of Boulogne's subjects, captured during one of his experiments. Duchenne de Boulogne was a French neurologist who pioneered research into the electrical stimulation of muscles. He used photography to accurately illustrate his findings. The photographs that came from his experiments look like the patients are undergoing some form of torture. William Hope, a pioneer of spirit photography, took this photo of a couple and an alleged female spirit around 1920.  A photo of a couple that Hope said depicts a young female spirit. William Hope became known as a pioneer of spirit photography (photography whose goal was to was to capture ghosts and spirits in photos), and later as a medium: families wanting to get in touch with their deceased loved ones sat for his photographs. This photo, taken in England in 1963, is of a supposed ghost known as \"The Specter of Newby Church.\"  The Specter of Newby Church. When Reverend K.F. Lord took this photo in 1963 inside the Newby Church in North Yorkshire, England, it was met with skepticism: many believed the apparition was merely the result of a well-done double exposure. Lord maintained that the spectre in the photo wasn't doctored. Sybell Corbet took a photo of the library at Combermere Abbey, which seems to depict the late Lord Combermere sitting in his favorite chair.  The photo of the library in Combermere Abbey taken in 1891. As the story goes, amateur photographer Sybell Corbet took this hour-long exposure of the empty library in Combermere Abbey at the same time that Lord Combermere's funeral was taking place four miles away. However, the apparition that appears to be sitting in the deceased Lord's chair is suggested to be Lord Combermere himself. The notion that he returned to his library so quickly after passing is nice, though. The interior of the Capela dos Ossos in Portugal is made up entirely of human bones.  Capela dos Ossos in Portugal. Dan Taylor Watt/Flickr While Capela dos Ossos in \u00c9vora, Portugal, looks like a normal chapel from the outside, the inside is covered entirely with human bones and skulls. Built in the 16th century by a Franciscan monk who wished to transmit the message of \"memento mori\" \u2014 a Latin phrase that means \"remember you will die\" \u2014 the Capela dos Ossos contains nearly 5,000 human skeletons that came from nearby cemeteries. The chapel also includes two desiccated corpses hanging from the walls by chains, one of which belongs to a child. The Akodessewa Fetish Market in Togo sells talismans related to voodoo magic.  The Fetish Market. Julius Cruickshank/Flickr The Akodessewa Fetish Market in Lom\u00e9, Togo, is the largest Voodoo market in the world. It carries all the supplies needed for various charms and rituals, from human skulls and dead monkeys to armadillo skin and parrot beaks. While some may find the market unsettling, Voodoo is a religion that is often misunderstood. While many think it is violent, Voodoo believes that every creature is divine, alive or dead, and that there is both a visible and an invisible world, and that these are connected. In Vodoo, death just means transitioning to the invisible world, while remaining present in spirit. Museo de las Momias, a mummy museum in Mexico, contains over 100 remarkably preserved mummies.  Museo de las Momias. Russ Bowling/Flickr The Museo de las Momias came to be after a grave tax, which was implemented in 1865, caused the city of Guanajuato to dig up any bodies related to family members who couldn't pay it, in an effort to extort them. Because of the dry conditions of the soil, when the bodies were dug up they were incredibly well-preserved. The city decided to keep the mummies in an ossuary underneath the cemetery in case loved ones could eventually pay the grave tax to rebury them. The horrible practice didn't end until 1958, and by then the ossuary had gathered enough mummified, disinterred bodies to become a museum, which is a popular \u2014 albeit slightly distasteful \u2014 tourist attraction today. The \"Island of Dolls\" along the canals of Xochimilco in Mexico is full of hundreds of abandoned dolls that were apparently a tribute to the spirit of a drowned girl.  The \"Island of Dolls\" in Mexico. Esparta Palma/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY 2.0 The legend of the \"Island of Dolls\" tells of a resident of the area named Don Julian, who visited the island and met the spirit of a girl that had drowned there. She haunted him, and compelled him to hang hundreds of dolls from the island's trees in her honor. Then, 50 years after he hung the first doll, Julian apparently drowned in the exact same spot she had. ",

            "answer_text": " This one always gets me. This is a capture from a long distance video camera pointed at the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco as a fellow named Gene Sprague commits suicide by falling backward into the Bay. The Golden Gate Bridge is a monument to engineering and art, and has long been a \u201cMust See\u201d sight for any tourist in San Francisco. Any day when you go there you can meet people from all over the world who have come to admire the Bridge, as well as the views you can get from there on a good weather day. It\u2019s so identifiable as San Francisco that it\u2019s included in nearly every movie that takes place in that city that I can think of, including Dark Passage, Vertigo, Dirty Harry, A View To A Kill, Star Trek IV, Zodiac and Inside Out. The 1.7 mile long suspension bridge is like a red, steel heart of the city with cars and people pumping through it every day. But the Bridge is also a symbol of death. It\u2019s a cenotaph to the more than 1,600 people who are known to have committed suicide from it since it opened in 1937. It\u2019s conceivable that more people have jumped unseen in the night or during deep fogs and their bodies washed out to the Pacific. Gene Sprague\u2019s suicide was captured by a film crew that was working on a documentary entitled The Bridge that was released in 2006. The film shows several people jumping to their deaths, including Gene Sprague, and includes interviews with their families and friends. The film crew did try to intervene when they caught someone on camera they felt might jump, and they actually worked with local authorities to prevent six jumps, but they captured more suicides, which are in the final cut. Gene was seen walking up one side of the bridge and then returning on the other side, taking up over an hour and a half of time. His movements didn\u2019t betray his purpose to them, and the filmmakers said they followed him as he just looked like an interesting guy. When I look at this image I wonder how alone, pained and hopeless he may have felt, and yet also at how brave he was to have been able to take that leap. Physically, I can feel my feet also get a little cold each time I see that image of Gene falling backward to his death, knowing the carnage of the impact that comes after that frozen moment. I wonder if he would have been dissuaded from falling off the Bridge if he\u2019d known he was being filmed for a documentary and that his suicide would be immortalized on film and could be easily found on the internet? I\u2019m also curious if he regretted his decision during the four to five second drop to the waters of the Bay. Time yourself to five seconds and see how many thoughts you can have even in banal moment of your life. We know that other people who have jumped off the Golden Gate did regret their decision. In September of 2000, 19-year-old Kevin Hines jumped from the Bridge and immediately thought, \u201cWhat the hell did I just do? I don\u2019t want to die[1].\u201d He was headed to the water head first, but was able to reposition his body to allow for his legs to take the brunt of the shock of the impact and to minimize the damage to his head and upper body in the hopes that he would live. While he was badly injured with a broken ankle and a damaged spine, Kevin survived impact. He was lucky, as had his body rotated another centimeter, doctors say he would have crushed his entire spine. After he hit the water he went an estimated 70\u201380 feet below the surface and used his arms to swim to the air. He struggled to keep his head above the waves and he was swallowing water, but then by further luck he stayed afloat thanks to either a dolphin or sea lion who swam by and propped him up until a Coast Guard crew was able to arrive and pull him from the water. Fifteen years earlier Ken Baldwin, 28, jumped off the Bridge. Ken has said that he \u201cinstantly realized that everything in my life that I\u2019d thought was unfixable was totally fixable\u2014except for having just jumped[2].\u201d Having leapt, he experienced a kind of shock therapy where he grasped his situation with a sharper clarity. Luckily for him, while still taking a wallop from the water, he also survived and was rescued by the Coast Guard. Before he jumped, Kevin sat on the bridge crying by himself for 40 minutes. About those 40 minutes, Kevin later recalled that, \"I actually had a pact with myself, this is something that many suicidal people do. If one person says 'Are you OK,' 'Is something wrong,' or 'Can I help you?' I was going to tell them everything and beg them to help me\u201d. Eventually a woman did walk up to him, but only to ask him to take a picture of her with his camera. \u201cI was like, \u2018Fuck this, nobody cares\u2026 So I jumped.[3]\u201d While I\u2019m certain that I would not have asked Kevin to take my picture if I were to see him in that state, I\u2019m not sure if I would have intervened in any other way. My gut reaction would probably be to think that a crying stranger wants to be left alone, and if I were to ask how they are they might tell me to get bent. But, on second thought, considering the location and the history of that bridge (someone jumps about every two weeks) maybe I would have tried to talk to him and try to walk him off that bridge. Was Gene, like Kevin, hoping some stranger would be his own temporary guardian angel and reach out to him with genuine concern as he walked the Bridge for 90 minutes? Did he even give off any signals that he was in a suicidal state, or was he psyching himself up to make the jump? Gene\u2019s story is complete, and what his last thoughts were during that long drop are a missing piece. Below are Ken Baldwin (left) and Kevin Hines (right). Both still suffer from depression at times, but they have sought, and continue to seek, help, and are alive to add to their narratives.  The Bridge continues to stand, and is scheduled, after decades of lobbying, to have a safety net installed in 2023 to prevent further jumps.

The Chinese women were undefended, their menfolk powerless or absent. The war, still undeclared, had no clear-cut goal or purpose. Perhaps all Chinese, regardless of sex or age, seemed marked out as victims.\" On New Year's Day, over a toast he [General Iwane Matsui] confided to a Japanese diplomat: \"My men have done something very wrong and extremely regrettable.\" Nanjing Massacre - Wikipedia  (a) Dilawar's mugshot from Bagram prison; (b) Forensic photo of Dilawar's pulpified legs. Dilawar (born c. 1979 \u2013 December 10, 2002), was an Afghan taxi driver who was tortured to death by US army soldiers at the Bagram Collection Point, a US military detention center in Afghanistan. Dilawar was a 22-year-old Pashtun taxi driver and farmer from a small village. He was 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) tall and weighed 122 pounds (55 kg). At Bagram, Dilawar was chained to the ceiling of his cell, and suspended by his wrists for four days. His arms became dislocated from their sockets, and flapped around limply whenever guards collected him for interrogation. On the day of his death, Dilawar had been chained by the wrists to the top of his cell for much of the previous four days. A guard tried to force the young man to his knees. But his legs, which had been pummeled by guards for several days, could no longer bend. The damage his legs took equalled that of being driven over by a lorry. It would be many months before Army investigators learned that most of the interrogators had in fact believed Mr. Dilawar to be an innocent man who simply drove his taxi past the American base at the wrong time.

            "answer_text": "  Blurry and a bit incomprehensible, the photos don\u2019t look like much when first perceived, but then you look a little harder, and notice that the lights that should be on the ceiling, are almost on the walls. That the people in them are bracing themselves trying to counteract the forces that are being acted upon their bodies while they make one last call, or send one last text. On April 16th, 2014 four hundred and fifty people plunged into the sea when the ferry, MV Sewol capsized. That in and of itself is disturbing, but that isn\u2019t what is so abhorrent about these images. Let\u2019s first explore why this ship capsized; It was illegally redesigned when the ship was purchased from Japan to add two additional floors. This increased the number of passengers it could carry by one hundred and sixteen people. It also increased the weight by two hundred and thirty nine tonnes. This also shifted the center of gravity of the ship by one foot, eight inches, and gave it a left-right imbalance. These design changes were inspected, and approved by the Korean Register of Shipping.  Next, on the day that it departed it was carrying 2,142.7 tons of improperly secured cargo despite it\u2019s maximum allowable weight being 987 tons. The ballast tanks were not properly maintained, and they were short filled at only 791.2 tons. The former captain informed the new captain of stability issues that he attributed to the removal of a side ramp, but was told he would be fired if he kept objecting to the issues. There had been requests made for the repair of the ship\u2019s malfunctioning steering system fifteen days earlier, but the repair was never made. The safety training budget for the ship\u2019s crew was $2.00, the cost to buy the paper certificate. While navigating the Maenggol Channel the third mate, Park Han-kyul ordered the helmsman, Cho Joon-ki, to turn the ship from 135 degrees to 140 degrees. There is some conflict over what happened after this among them. During this time, the captain was not on deck, but rather in his private quarters. Park says that she further ordered a change of course to 145 degrees, but then noticed that the ship was listing to port. She then claimed that she order the wheel turned to port, but Cho replied that the wheel was not working.. Cho claims that he never received the order to turn to 145 degrees, and that the ship was still turning to the right even though he was holding the wheel. To counteract the continued turn he turned the wheel twice to the left amounting to a five degree turn. Due to the ship continuing to turn they then reached the 145 degrees that Park stated. He says that at this point Park ordered that the ship be steered \u201cin the opposite direction\u201d, so he furthered steered to the left another ten degrees. The court concluded that Cho steered the ship in a fifteen degree turn for forty seconds, and then was alarmed at how fast the ship was turning to the right when Park ordered the turn to 145 degrees, attempted to countersteer to the left. When Park gave the order to turn \u201cin the opposite direction\u201d he assumed she meant the right, causing the bow of the ship to turn to the right rapidly. With the ship being turned so sharply from 135 degrees to 150 degrees, it listerd hard to the right throwing the unsecured cargo to that side. The additional weight made the ship lose all of its restoring power, and catastrophe is inevitable, the ship will capsize. All of that is dreadful on it\u2019s own, but the most egregious part of it came next. As the ship began to sink, an alert went over the PA telling the passengers to \u201cstay put\u201d. Among those passengers, 325 students from Danwon high school on a trip to Jeju Island. Waiting for instructions in their cabins, putting on life vests when another alert came across the intercoms, the began making their calls, their texts, and one recorded a seventeen minute long video that documents their terror.  At the same time, the captain and fifteen members of the crew proceeded to abandon ship leaving everyone on board to drown. These images are those students condemned to death by humans that they entrusted with their safety.  Out of four hundred and fifty people, one hundred and seventy two survived this. Two hundred and fifty of the dead were students from Danwon High school. They believed that people were coming to help them. They believed that there was someone in charge. They believed it, until no one came, and water began flooding the corridors. Clambering up into furniture, bracing themselves against the heavy tilting of the ship they started to think that they were alone. When the door of the cabin was over their heads they finally understood. No one was coming, and they had to save themselves. \"I'm really scared,\" a student says. \"Is it really sinking?\" another asks. \"Wow, they're giving us life vests.\" \"I'm getting out of here,\" one says. \"Me too, me too,\" says another. A student says: \"We have to survive now.\" \"We're all finished. I have to leave some farewell words before I die,\" says another. One says, \"Mom, I love you.\" These were words captured on that seventeen minute long video. You can find parts of it here;  But keep in mind when you watch it, it isn\u2019t a movie, and those kids are going to die.  Flowers instead of students sit in these chairs at Donwan high school where they held an honorary commencement for the 250 students that died in the ferry disaster. All the crew that abandoned the passengers and the captain will serve 5\u201336 years in prison, the longest term being given to the captain. It should be noted that three crew members, Park Ji-young, Jeong Hyun-seon, and Kim Ki-woong, stayed behind and helped passengers escape. All three died. What about these images should scare you? That you cannot depend on another person to survive even if it is their job. Not only might they abandon you, they might tell you to do something that will ensure your death as they did with these students. What if the crew told the passengers to come up on deck as soon as they knew there was a problem? They might have been able to survive in the water the forty minutes that it took for rescuers to arrive. Instead they told them to futilely put on their life vests, and to stay below deck in their tiny cabins. When the ship capsized and they tried to make their way out, students that survived watched their classmates get washed back into the ship while trying to escape. One student described watching a wave sweep her classmates back inside the sinking boat. She said that she and a group of students managed to move along a horizontal stairwell towards an escape hatch. But as she jumped out, water swept over their escape route. \"There were many classmates in the corridor and most of them were swept back into the ship,\" she said. They ordered them to stay put, they abandoned them, and it could happen to you. This isn\u2019t the first time, the first disaster, or collection of bodies that can be attributed to absolute cowardice, fear, self preservation over responsibility, and it can happen to you. Keep that in mind the next time you think you are in danger, and someone in charge keeps telling you that everything is fine. It may not be.

A ghostly figure was caught on camera in London standing outside Parliament on New Year\u2019s Eve.   The Cooper Family Hanging Ghost As scary as it looks, this picture has been shrouded in mystery for years now and it is probably one of the most peculiar ghosts caught on camera. The story goes back to the mid 1950s taking place in Texas. The Cooper family had just moved into an old house that they bought and were really excited about it. So, they thought of preserving this memory by taking a picture of the whole family in their new home. But little did they know that there was someone else joining in on their celebration \u2013 a spooky figure hanging upside down from the ceiling  The Hospital Demon This photo was captured by a nurse on a surveillance camera at an unknown hospital. The images shows a dark, crouched figure (resembling a demon) standing on top of a patient\u2019s body who was lying in bed. The nurse also noticed the black figure walkingup and down the body of the patient. The patient had died within a few hours of the black figure's appearance. As creepy as it may sound, demon-like figures have been reportedly seen at a hospitals. Some say hospitals are the breeding ground fordemons, its where they lurk about, waiting for the next soul to die so they can drag them to hell.  The Amityville Ghost In the early morning hours of November 13 1974, Ronald DeFeao Jr. , fatally shot his father, two brothers and sister. The bodies were found face down on the respective beds with no signs of bullet wounds on the corpses or any struggle. And even thoughthe neighbors lived close-by, none of them heard sounds, screams or noises. Mr. DeFeao claimed that ghosts were present during the events and had guided him into eliminating his siblings though his original intent was just to execute his father. The home at 112 Ocean Avenue eventually went up for sale and was later purchased by George and Kathy Lutz. Though they were told by the realtor about the tragedy, the Lutz\u2019s were so enamored with the home, pool, garage and 4,000 square feet of waterfront that they immediately made an offer. The next 28 days followed a set of horrific paranormal activities that would shock the Lutz family. From the possessed suicidal dog to the image half headed demon on the wall, green slime running off of keyholes and spirits staring blankly through the bedroom windows, the Lutz family constantly encountered a ghostly presence in the doomed house. Finally, when they could take it no more, they were forced to evacuate the house in a hurry. They called in investigators to study the place, all of whom claimed to have felt a strange presence in the house. One of the investigators happened to click a photo of the boy ghost peeking out of a room.   The Ghost of Oak Grove, Kentucky. Also known as The Ghost Bridge , it is surrounded by several different versions of the story. But only one of them can be verified. The ghost roaming the bridge is of an unfortunate wife who was thrown off the bridge into the water and killed by her soldier husband in the 1960\u2019s. One story also mentions that on a certain night you can see her decomposing body walking the area under the bridge or on top of the bridge. It is said that if you happen to turn your car off on the bridge it will not start again unless you push it off the bridge or till the sun comes up!  The Ghost at The Waverly Hills Sanitarium, Kentucky. Coughing up blood, over crowded, understaffed, bizarre unethical twisted treatments, \u201cWelcome to Waverly Hills Sanatorium\u201d \u2013 a medical facility that was once dedicated to treat patients suffering from Tuberculosis, long before the modern cure was discovered. Without the antibiotics, the hospital provided the only known cure at that time \u2013 fresh air and sunshine, and thus the patients spent the majority of their time in the solarium-like porch ways. There were many other unethical ways that were used to treat patients which were downright dangerous and only 5% patients survived the treatment. It is believed that as many as 8000 patient dead bodies were carelessly thrown down a chute and then taken out of the building through an underground tunnel. This method of disposing the bodies was kept confidential by doctor\u2019s orders who wanted patients to be unaware of the quantity of dead bodies. But with the discovery of the antibiotic, that could successfully treat and cure tuberculosis, the sanatorium was closed down. Many believe that the spirits of the patients still roam about the hospital in search of answers. The most famous being of a nurse named Mary Lee who happen to contract the disease. But the story takes a horrific twist when she was found hanging from a light apparatus in Room 502. Some believe she took her life after she found out that she was was pregnant with the child from one of the doctors and unmarried. Tragically her body lay undiscovered for a long time. The picture below is of the ghostly figure captured on camera, who is believed to be of Mary Lee\u2026.forever roaming the corridors of the hospital groaning in pain.   The Healer White Lady of Worstead Church, Norfolk,UK. In 1975, Diane and Peter Berthelot along with their 12-year-old son visited the Worstead Church. Peter snapped a picture of his wife praying in silence on one of the church benches. After development, off course, a friend of Mrs. Berthelot was shocked to see a white shadowy figure sitting right behind her andpointed it out. The figure in the photo appears to be wearing light-colored, old-fashioned clothes and a bonnet. The following summer, The Berthelots would return back to the Worstead Church with the photo and inquire about it with Reverend Pettit, who happened to be the church vicar. He told them about the legend of the White Lady who is known to be a healer making an appearance near someone who needed healing. Diane suddenly realized that the time the photograph was taken, she was quite ill and taking strong antibiotics. The ghost of the White Lady dates back well over 100 years. According to one story, on Christmas Eve of 1830 a man boasted a challenge to the White Lady. He said he would climb to the top of the church\u2019s belfry and kiss her if she would appear. So up he went. When he failed to reappear after a time, however, friends went to search for him. They found him in the belfry, cowering in a corner, terrified. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her,\u201d he told them, \u201cI\u2019ve seen her\u2026.\u201d And then he died.  The Tulip Staircase Ghost The story behind this picture was that on Sunday 19th June 1966, an old retire couple from Canada \u2013 decided to visit the Queen\u2019s house due to the much speculation and hype of being haunted. While he was standing near the Tulip staircase, the old man took a picture of it and when it was later developed, there was a ghostly figure ascending the staircase in pursuit of a second and a third other ghostly figure on top of staircase (which is not quite clear in the photo) The camera roll was examined by researchers and they found no evidence of any kind of tampering done with the roll. At the time the photograph was taken (between 5.15pm and 5.30pm) the old man\u2019s wife claimed that was standing with him and confirmed there was nothing on the stairs. The staircase itself was closed with a rope and \u2018No Admittance\u2019 sign. Strange shadowy apparitions and unexplainable noises of footsteps have been constantly reported near the Tulip Staircase by both staff and visitors. There have also been sightings of a pale woman who is seen wiping blood from the bottom of the staircase. She is believed to be the ghost of a maid who came over the highest banister and died at the foot of the stairs 300 years back. One can also sometimes hear creepy disembodied chanting of children which seem to be coming from within the Queens House.  The Ghost of Freddy Jackson As a squadron of the Royal Air Force assembled together to take a group photo in 1919, no one realized that they would find Freddy Jackson accompanying them in the picture taken by retired RAF Officer Sir Victor Goddard. Freddy Jackson was a mechanic for the Royal Air Force who served on-board the H.M.S. Daedalus. He was brutally killed two days earlier by accidentally strolling into a spinning propeller blade; which caused instant death. His funeral was held the very next day. But eerie as it may sound, Freddy Jackson returned just two days later as a ghost for one final time to be a part of the group photo. Several of the other men in the photo confirmed that it was in fact Jackson\u2019s face in the background of the picture.  The Backseat Driver In 1959, Mable Chinnery went to the cemetery to visit the grave of her mother along with her husband. She took some photos of the gravesite and then turned and took this picture of her husband sitting alone in the car\u2019s passenger seat. The film was developed and this came out: Somebody sitting in the backseat wearing glasses, clear as day. Mrs. Chinnery swore that the \"backseat driver\u201d was none other than her own mother whose grave site she was standing next to when she took the picture.  The Cemetery Ghost Child This picture was taken by a woman named Mrs. Andrews while on a visit to her daughter\u2019s grave at a cemetery in Queensland, Australia in the 1940s. The daughter, Joyce before the age of 17. Mrs. Andrews saw nothing unusual while taking this photograph of her daughter\u2019s tombstone. But when she got it developed, she was shocked to see the apparition of what looked like the ghost of a young girl sitting on the grave. Mrs. Andrews was unable to recognize the child nor believed it to be the ghost of her daughter in her youth. Upon further investigation, paranormal researchers found the gravesite of Mrs. Andrews daughter to be near the graves of two infant girls. The ghost in the picture seems to be aware of Mrs. Andrews presence as she is seen looking directly at the camera. Poor soul\u2026so young.  I refused to believe in ghosts so I could sleep in peace!

            "answer_text": "There are several pictures that comes to mind and to describe why I find them scary I have to go back in time to when I saw it: September 11th, 2001, I had just turned 11 years old 10 days prior to this day. I was at Crabapple Middle School in Roswell, GA. I had already gone to my science class with Mrs. Moss and was in my Social Studies class with Mrs. Bernstein, a native of Manhattan with a very thick New York accent. However, when class commenced Mrs. Bernstein was not in class. She was outside on her cell phone while a teacher\u2019s aide was teaching class for us. When she came into the classroom her face showed a courageous attempt to maintain a neutral expression of calm and composure but I as well as the other classmates knew something was wrong with her but didn\u2019t know what. Either way, we didn\u2019t pay much attention to her. It was class as usual. Fast forward to the end of the day, on the way home on the school bus I begin to hear kids talking about New York getting bombed and that we are at war. However, kids being kids, they were saying it in a joking and exaggerated matter because at that time they were truly rumors. Reason being: our school administration decided not to show nor tell the student body what had taken place that day while we were in class. With that said, I literally had no clue whatsoever as to what happened earlier in the day. Finally, my sister, my friends and I get off the school bus and we walk to our apartments. When me and my sister get to our apartment my classmate joins us until his mom gets off of work. We get inside and immediately turn on the TV. We are greeted by this scene on CNN:  When we saw this we didn\u2019t understand what was going on but soon realized that the rumors we were hearing on the bus had some validity. We were only seeing plumes of smoke but we saw the statue of liberty in the footage on the CNN news feed so we all knew it was definitely New York City and something very bad had took place. Then, CNN was showing footage from earlier in the day that looked like this:   After about 20 minutes of watching the news there are kids outside everywhere in the neighborhood talking about what happened and several kids who didn\u2019t have cable came to my apartment to watch the news to see what was going on. We were kids who lived far away from New York, in the outskirts of Atlanta, GA and had no clue what the WTC or Pentagon was. Most of our parents were not home to explain what was going on given we lived in a rather low income area and our parents were still at work. Despite the news footage that my friends, my sister and I were watching I didn\u2019t feel the least bothered until I saw this:  Not too long afterwards they showed footage of this:  I was utterly mortified. I can\u2019t describe how terrified I was. I was only 11 years old but I was smart enough to know that people who jumped from the top of a building the tall had ZERO CHANCE of surviving. I was watching people die on live TV. The worst part was that CNN wasn\u2019t showing pictures of the people jumping. They showed video of people jumping and/or falling from the top of those buildings. They even showed video footage of two people who held hands to their ultimate doom:  The rest of the day is a blur. I remember my mother coming home and she cried and was scared because my oldest sister was attending a university in Washington, D.C., which is where the Pentagon was hit. As for me, I had nightmares for months. I couldn\u2019t shake the sight of those people hanging out of a skyscraper so desperate for air\u2026\u2026.desperate to escape fire and heat\u2026\u2026..desperate to escape a death that they had no chance of escaping that they decided to take back the little control they had in a god-awful situation and end the situation on their terms. If I ever have children I hope and pray they never have to witness a REALITY so grim and horrific as what I witnessed on the news on 9/11/2001. ",

            "answer_text": "I answered this again in another thread, just BE WARNED - SOME OF THESE ARE CREEPY AF especially number 10. Here I go from one of my favourite posts with some extra backstory with them for extra creepiness: 1. REGINA KAY WALTERS  The last recorded photograph of Regina Kay Walters before being raped and murdered by Robert Ben Rhoades. 2. UNKNOWN MURDER VICTIM  This woman was found dead and partially mummified in a tent near a trail in California in 2006. The picture at the link is a mugshot taken about 6 months earlier, traced from her fingerprints. The name and information she gave at the time of her arrest were false. The words NO GO, NO EAT, NO DRINK, MURDER were found posted on the outside of her tent. She kept a journal that suggested that she had purposefully starved herself to death. Her identity is still unknown. 3. COOPER FAMILY FALLING BODY PHOTO  The story goes that sometime in the 1950s the Cooper family of Texas bought an old house and moved into it. On their first night there, the father took a photo of Mom and Grandma posing with the two kids at the dining room table. Everyone was happy and smiling. They were living the American dream. But when the photo was subsequently developed, they saw, to their horror, that what looked like a body falling or hanging from the ceiling had materialized behind them. It hadn't been there when the father took the photo. So where had it come from? Was it an apparition of a deceased former tenant of the house? No one knew. 4. SMILE DOG  This is from a creepypasta story about an image that drives people who view it insane. Though, it\u2019s a creepypaste but image is still scary. 5. GOOGLE MAPS IMAGE OF APARTMENT BALCONY IN FRANCE  Basically google caught some tall, brown figure resembling an alien creature stood next to the bike, looking directly at the camera. The creature had large piercing eyes and what appeared to be long hair. 6. THAT TIME A KILLER POSTED THE COORDINATES TO HIS VICTIM ON 4CHAN  It\u2019s very creepy because it is true. Basically he posted all about the murder on an online board of 4chan. Creepy and crazy. 7. THE LAST JEW IN VINNITSA  The Last Jew in Vinnitsa is one of the eeriest images that I have come across. The look on the man\u2019s face and the blurred faces of some of the soldiers and the story behind it. 8. COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR CLASS PHOTO  This is not that creepy if you see it, apart from the fact these teenagers in the picture shot up their school back in the 90s and killed some of their former students. 9. YOUNGEST MOTHER IN THE WORLD  Pictures of Lina Medina, youngest mother in the world. She gave birth to her child at 5 years and 7 months. 10. Russian man turning up 29 dead children into dolls   This man dug up 29 dead children before mummifying them and turning their corpses into dolls in the flat he shared with his oblivious parents. Anatoly Moskvin, 52, admitted to the horrific crimes in court, where he told distraught parents: \u201cYou abandoned your girls, I brought them home and warmed them up.\u201d The Russian man mummified the dead children and dressed them in stockings, girls clothing and knee length boots to make them look like dolls, applying lipstick and make-up to their faces. If that is not creepy enough - In another grisly twist, he wedged music boxes inside their rib cages. Moskvin also marked the birthdays of each of his dead victims in his bedroom. ",

            "answer_text": " This might look like an innocuous photo but it hints at a dark, insidious period in American history. This young woman was a radium dial painter. In the early 20th century, radium was used by manufacturing companies to create a glow-in-the-dark paint. Young women, many of them teenagers and in their 20s, were hired by the thousands to paint the tiny numbers with radium so they would glow in the dark. In order to get the most precise lines, the women were instructed to utilize a practice known as lip-pointing. The women would place the radium-covered brushes between their lips before painting the strokes. This would be repeated again and again to ensure the brush tip was always pointed. The women had no idea that the element they were using was dangerous. On the contrary, they were told that it was good for them. Radium had been shown to shrink tumours in some patients, so the prevailing public opinion was that the element was a wonder drug. It didn\u2019t take long until some of the women began suffering horrific effects from radium poisoning. The element targeted the bones, so their teeth would begin to rot inside of their jaws, and the girls\u2019 skeletons were disintegrating inside of them. There are reports of women having parts of their jawbones fall out into their mouths, and stories of dentists who, with the slightest pressure, were able to fully remove a patient\u2019s jawbone. Some women had disfiguring tumours grow on their faces. The pain that these girls suffered is hard to imagine. To make it all the worse, the companies responsible misled the women; when reports came out regarding the harmful effects of radium, the companies went to great lengths to try to discredit the scientists, the characters of the women affected, and to hide medical reports that contradicted their narrative. When I see photos of the dial painters and think of the pain that so many of them suffered, it just makes me so sad. It is awful to think of the human suffering caused as a result of ignorance and willful neglect. It is hard to know the exact number of women who died as a direct result of radium poisoning. There are 112 confirmed deaths but the actual number who died as a result of their exposure is thought to be far higher.    If you would like to learn more about this chapter in history, I would recommend Kate Moore\u2019s book The Radium Girls. ",

Wiles and published in Life Magazine with the caption: \u201cAt the bottom of the Empire State Building the body of Evelyn McHale reposes calmly in grotesque bier, her falling body punched into the top of a car\u201d. The picture was given the title \u201c The most beautiful suicide\u201d  2: These German prisoners of war had to watch a film on the atrocities of the Holocaust, and it provoked a variety of responses. Perhaps most tellingly, some of the soldiers are plainly horrified by the events and seem not have known the extent of the Nazis\u2019 violence.  3: In the West, Japan\u2019s brutal fight against China during World War II isn\u2019t well known, but this photo demonstrates the aftermath of a devastating Japanese air raid on Shanghai\u2019s South Railway Station. This child lost his mother, but luckily, his father survived the attack and later rescued him.  4: In Odessa, Ukraine, a woman became lost in the catacombs under the city after spending New Year\u2019s Eve of 2005 drinking down there with her friends. She was never found until another group of teens supposedly stumbled across her body.  5: I am pretty sure almost everyone knows the story behinde this one . Blanche Monnier was planning to marry a man her mother didn\u2019t like. When she disappeared one day, most people assumed she had run off with him. However, 25 years later, someone tipped police off that her mother was holding her hostage, and when they entered the home they found Blanche bound and starved in the attic.  6: Jim Jones was a cult leader who amassed a huge following and later instigated a mass suicide at their Jonestown compound in Guyana. Only few have a sense of the devastation of this tragedy until they see a picture of the aftermath.  7 :Serial killer Harvey Glatman would pose as a photographer to lure women into his home where he would later rape and murder them, taking pictures the whole time. This photo shows one of the women, Judith Dull, who became his first victim in 1957.  8: This photo shows a rubber worker in the Belgian Congo staring at the severed hand and foot of his 5-year-old daughter, who was killed because he didn\u2019t meet his quota for the day.  9: In 1985, Omayra was trapped under debris from a mudslide in Columbia. She spent 60 hours waiting for someone with the equipment to move the debris that kept her partially submerged, but sadly she died waiting for help, comforted by her helpless family.  10: This photo taken in the Soviet Union during a severe famine shows a Siberian couple selling body parts, which the photographer claimed were those of the couple\u2019s own children. Hunger leads people to make drastic actions.  ",

            "answer_text": "This is Jeff Rader.  In this picture you see a cool-looking young man in a concert or party, standing still with a drink in his hand and a cigarette dangling from his fingers. In the background there\u2019s a huge, raging fire burning everything around. This guy\u2019s demeanor seems oddly calm and nonchalant about what\u2019s happening around him. So what\u2019s really happening here? It was February 20, 2003 in West Warwick, Rhode Island; at a popular nightclub called The Station Nightclub.  That night was very busy at the nightclub, 400 people attended the event and a rock band named Great White was hosting. Great White asked special permission to use indoor Fireworks (Pyrotechnics) in the nightclub for their show, even though it was dangerous. When Great White started their performance, things went terribly wrong. The indoors fireworks went up and they accidentally caught the stage on fire.  The fire quickly spread across the entire nightclub, the people inside tried desperately to escape but many people didn\u2019t make it. 100 people died and 230 people got badly burned. It was a life-changing event for many.  The connection to Jeff Rader  Jeff Rader went to the Station Nightclub that night with a few friends, he seemed quite excited to see the show. Jeff stood very close to the stage, where the fire broke out  But for some reason, Jeff wasn\u2019t fazed at all by the fire. He didn\u2019t try to escape like anyone else in the building, instead he just stood there acting like it was normal. He helped his friends and a few people escape, but he never left the building himself. His friend took this final picture of him. Who knows why Jeff remained so calm and never tried escaping. Maybe he didn\u2019t realize how bad the fire really was, maybe he didn\u2019t take it seriously or perhaps he just accepted it and went on like it was normal. Less than a minute after this picture was taken, Jeff was dead. Who knows what happened in those final seconds. Maybe the toxic fumes quickly killed him, or maybe it was the spreading fire that burned him to death. Jeff didn\u2019t make it, and that final picture of him quickly before his death; captures the calmness and casuality he showed in his final minute, as he finished his drink and smoked his cigarette. EDIT: I\u2019ll clarify a few things just in case anyone will ask some questions: The person who took this picture didn\u2019t actually mean to capture Jeff in it, he was actually trying to take a picture of the fire. Jeff was standing there and he noticed it when he saw the picture. He didn\u2019t notice Jeff there. Jeff wasn\u2019t confused about the exits, there was literally a stage exit right behind him. He was pointing for people to leave through the exit, but he never left himself for some reason. ",

            "answer_text": "You better strap in boys and girls, I'm gon give you some good (bad) ones.  Someone\u2019s home security sensed that someone was at the door:  ` `  18 year old Silke Bischoff being held captive by bank robbers Dieter Degowski and Hans J\u00fcrgen R\u00f6sner on their way to the Netherlands in 1988. They held not only her captive, but everyone else on a bus. Eventually most of the people were released from the bus except Silke and one other girl. The worst part? Interviewers and reporters interviewed the abductors, offering them tea and coffee. A few reporters guided them on their way to the Netherlands as well to take away the girls that they picked. The reporters asked Silke, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like to have a gun held to your neck?\u201d This actual picture is when they spotted police behind their car and so the two got out, guns drawn, and had a shoot out with the police all while Silke was in the car. Silke died during the gun fight. Both the hostage takers survived\u2014R\u00f6sner getting life in prison and Degowski a free man after 24 years. He\u2019s out and about today. ` ` Diana Bryant and her goddaughter plunge down 50 feet after a fire escape collapses.  Diana died, but the goddaughter survived only because she landed on her godmother\u2019s body. ` `  This picture was taken when Lyndon B. Johnson assumed the presidency on Air Force One, after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. In the front, Jackie Kennedy can be seen, sad and harrowed. Everybody has a grim expression when you look at all these people in the picture. Except, Lyndon B. Johnson has his head turned away\u2014towards Albert Thomas. Thomas gives him a wink and a smile not realizing that a photo was being taken. There is no found reason why.  ` ` This is a series of photos taken by two female Dutch hikers (Kris Kremers & Lisanne Froon) before their disappearance in Panama.   The pictures below are them moving deeper in the jungle.   After this, the pictures suddenly stopped. Eight days later, around 90 photos were taken in the early morning by Kremers it\u2019s believed; 87 photos were almost completely dark and are still out of public view today. Three of them, however, show this:  In the picture above, some speculate that a figure is standing on the middle right side of the image although it could have been a fern.   (Above) Perhaps a marker.  (Above) the back of Kris\u2019s head (bloody temple). With their phones, they tried to make over 80 distress calls. They were out there for over week, starving, thirsting, and lost. Lisanne\u2019s phone died on the 5th day. Kris\u2019s on the 10th. Some people think that they fell down a high slope and got disorientated which could explain Kris dead with a bloody head. Some suggest foul play or a chupacabra. More recently, bone remains were found in the place where they hiked. (I think one bone was part of a foot and another was that of a tooth or something) that matched most of the DNA of Lisanne\u2019s parents. It\u2019s odd how only some bones were found instead of full skeletons if it truly was only a situation of them getting lost. I believe foul play whether human or not had done something to them. That explains why only a few bones were discovered. Why would they be scattered for any reason if it wasn\u2019t? This is a human color it seems. EDIT: Yo.. Guys, I knew that when I made this answer, you were gonna like it. Even if that meant 4 or 5. But now we\u2019re climbing up at two thousand? That\u2019s incredible. No, stupendous. No, phenomenal. No, dumbfounding. No, bewildering. No, conspicuous. No, c o o l . Can we hit 3k upvotes? Do I deserve it? Let\u2019s go! EDIT #2: Aaand that\u2019s 3,000 upvotes. Like that! ._. woaw. This is my most upvoted answer now [yay/oh. my. god.], and I definitely don\u2019t take it for granted. Thank you everyone so, so much for reading these stories! Hopefully it teaches you to maybe not go jungle hiking in a foreign place with low cell-signal, or to leave within the first signs of danger, or even something as small as checking your surroundings better next time. Small things like this make the biggest differences, so stay safe out there! Or, even in there. :) ~Rhon Cotton p.s.

This disturbing photo shows that these two person selling the human meat. In 1920s when there was a famine in Russia this photo was taken. These two are husbands and wife and they are selling the meat of their kids. Which they killed just to sell the meat and eat something instead. Life sometimes can be so cruel? Isn\u2019t it? 2-An aerial view of Mass suicide at Jonestown  An aerial view of one of the most disturbing death photos ever taken.

            "answer_text": " See this picture. Nothing seems wrong, Right? But what if I tell you, this was shot just after the woman walked out of the courtroom, successful in avoiding prison term, fit for her, for a horrible crime. Hold your horses!  In the early hours of January 30, 2016, Katie Lomas, a 20-year-old mother drove straight to her ex Dean Heaney, 22 with whom she has a baby. The incident happened a month after, she broke up with him. On the evening of 29th day of January, Dean was out with his girlfriend Tara. On the same night Dean met up with Katie and there were arguments between the pair. At 4am on January 30 they left a nightclub in Stalybridge and Dean and Katie were sat in the backseat arguing throughout the journey. The car then approached a group of males who were in the road and Dean got out of the car and approached the males and they walked off. They then drove off and this is when the incident took place. The four males were present and Dean squared up to them. Katie got into the driver's seat and drove off at speed with the engine revving. She drove past the group of males but came back a second time. Callum Walsh, a witness at the scene, said the car was being driven at about 40 miles an hour and Dean was stood in the road. Dean was then seen to move in and out of the road as if he wanted to joust. A car then began to approach Dean in the opposite direction and as Dean swerved to avoid it he was hit by the Renault Captur driven by Katie. There was no braking by Katie but she came to a stop further down the road and she got out the car and said: \"What have I done\" Lomas had 43mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath - above the legal limit of 35mcg. Mr Heaney was taken to Salford Royal Hospital with head injuries and multiple fractures. He remained in intensive care until February 10. He suffered brain damage, a punctured lung, fractures to the ribs and ligament damage to which he still suffers from. He cannot work as a result of the accident and this has caused him great difficulty. Lomas, who had not even passed a driving test, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. She surprisingly admitted, lesser charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, drink driving and having no licence or insurance. During the proceeding, Steven Sullivan, defending Lomas, said,\u201dShe is of previous good character and at the time of this incident she was only a few days past her 20th birthday and quite clearly immature.\u201d \u201cWhen she got into the vehicle she had no idea what the consequences would be. The case is coming up to its first anniversary and she has a great deal of regret and remorse. If she could only turn back the clock, of course, she would. She is a mother and takes this responsibility very seriously\u201d \u201cShe is the primary carer of her son who has just started reception at school and the complainant can see his son whenever he wants to. She does not work but is a full-time mother to her son. She regrets her actions and had no intention to harm Dean and that will remain with her\u201d Unfortunately, Lomas\u2019s defendant succeeded in persuading the jury to deliver a judgment which was surely a travesty of justice. Lomas was given a two-year jail term suspended for 18 months and was ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work. She cannot apply for a driving license for two years and must take an extended driving test. The judge Miss Recorder Samantha Presland told her, \u201cI am going to give you full credit for your guilty plea, however, this is an extremely serious incident and both of you were very lucky\u201d \u201cIt happened in a moment of madness and temper however there is no evidence in your past that this is a pattern of behaviour - so I say this is reckless stupidity\u201d \u201cHowever, a car is a lethal weapon. I take note of the fact that you have been suffering for the past months waiting for this to happen and I do not think you are someone who is going to go out and commit a criminal offence. Three lives should not be ruined as a result of a reckless incident\u201d The reason behind the mercy awarded to Lomas, was that the judge didn\u2019t want to \u201dwreck\u201d the life of her young son, now aged four.  Now, the picture. Katie Lomas, who had looked stony-faced in the dock at the hearing, laughed with friends and gave the thumbs up during a callous celebration as she walked free. Below is her reaction, after coming out.  The evil smile on her face, sends chills down my spine. It is basically a criminal, overwhelmed after she avoided the punishment she deserved. Basically, the devil was free on the streets, to commit another sin.  Source: Drink-driving mum who left ex with brain damage grins as she is spared jail ",

When the word \u201cscary\u201d is being used, its not all about ghosts always. Could be tragedies, accidents, history. Let me give you some that will send shiver down your spines. You know \u201cPocho\u201d right?  an American crocodile who became world-famous for his relationship with Gilberto \"Chito\" Shedden, a local area fisherman. Shedden had found Pocho dying on the banks of the Reventaz\u00f3n River, and took the crocodile in whilst nursing him back to health. The crocodile refused to return to the wild and chose to stay with Chito instead. The pair became famous after they began performing together. Well this is a good example of good friendship but not everyone is lucky to have one.    Well those are not fake. Not yet scared? Well that\u2019s just a warm up.   This is the tragic final photograph of a Lebanese teenager taken moments before he was killed when a car bomb exploded in central Beirut. In the horrifying photograph, Mohammad al-Chaar, 16, pictured wearing a red jumper on the left, can be seen posing with his friends - with a gold-coloured visible in the background. Moments after the photograph was taken, a bomb inside the car was detonate Never be a daredevil:      The unfortunate incident took place at the 62-storey Huayuan Hua Centre, one of the tallest buildings in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province, on Nov. 8. A Chinese daredevil fell to his death while attempting to take an \u201cextreme\u201d selfie. I\u2019m not going to name him to keep things confidential but I know you know him. Lastly, I know you know this one but I\u2019m not gonna say anything to this as this one really brings trauma to those that will see it. Kindly stop scrolling if your only here out of curiousty.

            "answer_text": "There are real life pictures which are very scary to watch. You're soon ahead of most scary pictures ever taken in History. 1.Crime scene of the Hinterkaifeck murders in Germany where a family of six were slaughtered with something like a pickaxe.  2.Believed to be photo of a shell shocked soldier during World War I.  3.An American soldier being air-lifted out of a Vietnamese jungle, supposedly.  4.Picture of what has been called a doll, captured by a Google street car.  5.Self-evident enough. A lonely chair. At the bottom of an ocean.  6.Captured in the Amityville horror house by Gene Campbell who was investigating the strange occurrences. The entity is believed to be the ghost of a boy who died in the house several years ago.  7.Remains of an abandoned mental asylum in California.  8.Back when Halloween costumes were meant to scare the hell out of people.  9.Blanche Monnier who was held captive and starved. For 24 years. By her family.  10.Photograph of a suicide, accidentally captured by an amateur photographer.  11.An abandoned theme park in Japan.  12.Claw marks of Jewish prisoners on the wall of a gas chamber in Auschwitz.  13.Last picture of Regina Walters, captured by her kidnapper before killing her.  14.This photo taken in the Soviet Union during a severe famine shows a Siberian couple selling body parts, which the photographer claimed were those of the couple\u2019s own children. Hunger leads people to make drastic actions, but this is simply unthinkable.  15.Maria de Hoya passed away from tuberculosis at 21-years-old. During her illness, her doctor, Carl Tanzler, fell in love with her. After she died, he kept and mummified her body. He kept her corpse for seven years before he was finally caught and imprisoned.  16.In 2012, James Holmes entered an Aurora, Colorado theater and opened fire on the audience. He later told authorities his apartment was rigged with explosives. Thankfully, the bomb squad managed to neutralize the threat \u2014 and capture this haunting picture.  17.In 1947, the Thomas family went out for a picnic near the Hansen Dam in Los Angeles, when their two children disappeared. This photo captures Mrs. Thomas\u2019s reaction to seeing the drowned body of her daughter. Her son would be found dead soon after.  18.During the 1960s, Edward Paisnel would frequently don a rubber mask, break into homes, and rape and torture women and children. This picture was the only evidence police had until he was finally caught with his mask during a routine traffic stop in 1971.  19.Most people have seen this famous photograph of a monk lighting himself on fire, but many people don\u2019t know the story behind it. He was actually protesting the South Vietnamese government\u2019s discrimination against Buddhists in the early \u201960s.  20.In the West, Japan\u2019s brutal fight against China during World War II isn\u2019t well known, but this photo demonstrates the aftermath of a devastating Japanese air raid on Shanghai\u2019s South Railway Station. This child lost his mother, but luckily, his father survived the attack and later rescued him.  21.We know that the pioneers of the American West hunted buffalo to near-extinction, but this photograph of a mountain of buffalo skulls taken in 1870 shows how extensive and drastic the hunting really was.  22.This photo was taken seconds after the U.S. dropped the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki. The bomb at Hiroshima had already caused massive destruction, but it\u2019s likely that this photographer still didn\u2019t know the danger they were in.  23.Soviet doctor Leonid Rogozov was on an expedition in a remote part Antarctica in 1961 when he realized he was suffering from appendicitis and would die if his appendix wasn\u2019t removed. As the only doctor on the expedition, he had to perform the surgery on himself, and miraculously, he recovered just fine.  24.The ornately arranged skeletons of Rome's Capuchin Crypt, circa 1900.  ~The End By Madhan RS Source: Internet Thank you..!!

            "answer_text": "Only one I wrote about this a few days ago. I will not write about it again. Because it actually terrified me. My eldest son who passed away away 4yrs ago always took selfies on the way to work in the morning. He would send them to his daughters. This one particular day, it was just as the sun was rising. He was on a back country road in Alabama. He took the picture and instead of sending it to the girls, he sent it to me and his younger brother, and his uncle. I know what everyone knows what the grim reaper looks like. In the car with my son was the grim reaper. Cloak, cycle, hood and all. It looked like it was in the back seat right behind him. There was no trick of light because there was no light yet. Only the light of the phone. There was nobody else on the road, cars or truck's. When he sent the picture to all of us it was about http://5am.so there was no time he could have altered it is any way. Needless to say it terrified me. I called him right away. From his voice I could tell he was afraid. You must understand first, my son was used to seeing and actually talking to spirits. Always in my family it would start around the age of two. There is one of us in every generation who can see, feel, or sense things. It has been going on for generations. We have two types of American Indian blood in us. In both my sons cases there is more from other tribes. Cherokee and chipawa are mine. They also have Blackfoot and Delaware. This in my opinion plays a role in our blessings or curse. At any rate my brother and some of his friends analyzed the picture they thought it was a reflection in his sunglasses. It couldn't have been there was no other light . My son kept telling me that he was going to die by the age of 40. I would tell him not to say things like that too me. He loved god and Christ, but He was angry with god for something that happened at our church. About a year and a half later after the picture. He called me he always called me from his job, every couple days. This night he called was Thursday. He told me things he had never shared with me before. He also said he was having such bad headaches sometimes he wanted to kill himself. But he said that I never had to worry about that, because he knew God would not forgive him for it. I told him he needed to talk to god again, and stop being angry at him. He told me he loved me and I said I loved him. That's the last time I spoke to him. He died at work on Saturday morning. Of a massive heart attack. He was the superintendent on his job. He was seated at his desk, going over blueprints, and one of his crew said he laid his head down on the desk. When he didn't look back up. The crew members went to him .they tried to resuscitate him but it was too late. His prediction was right. He was 40yrs 6months and 5days old. I will not tell this story again. But I believe in my soul when he saw the reaper, God was telling him to prepare himself. God bless you and keep you safe always. ",

            "answer_text": "Scary & Heartbreaking - Noma Disease Warning Graphic Content  Sketch of infant with Noma (Tumblr) Those who see the following images will be disturbed, disgusted, horrified and possibly offended. I apologize in advance. However, Noma is a horrific, devastasting disease that primarily affects malnourished and ill African children. The saddest part, is that the disease with its extremly high rate of mortality, is preventable. Poverty, illness, lack of education and political unrest hamper the ability of local goverments and international organizations who can provide reliable food source, improved hygene and medical assistance. Noma (cancrum oris) is an orofacial gangrene affecting malnourished children and mainly observed in tropical countries, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. The mortality of noma is high and the survivors harbor such facial deformities that they are often rejected from society and family life. Noma is an old companion of humankind. Described by Hippocrates and medieval authors, the disease was common in Europe and the United States for centuries.[1] In 1649, noma was included in the first book about neglected diseases, Observationes Medicae de Affectibus Omissis, by Arnoldus Bootius.[2] By the end of the 19th century, noma gradually disappeared from European and U.S. hospitals due to increasing improvements in the welfare of the population.[3] In the rare noma cases that crossed the paths of bacteriologists in the 20th century, no conclusive findings about the causative microorganisms were made until Stewart concluded in 1912 that noma was not a specific infection, but rather an opportunistic one caused by normal oral flora.[4] Shortly after the introduction of sulfonamides and penicillin in the 1940s, it appeared that treatment with antimicrobial drugs reduced the mortality of noma from around 85% to approximately 15%.[5] By contrast, a clear concept with regards to reconstructive noma surgery was developed only 50 years ago.  Photo: Face Eating(NOMA) Disease Spreads In Nigeria (Viewer Discretion) The majority of reported noma patients are children 2\u20137 years of age living in sub-Saharan Africa. Noma cases occur primarily in countries with extreme poverty and low measles vaccination rates.[6] The true global incidence of noma is unknown with estimates ranging from 30,000 to 140,000 individuals.[7] Currently, good methodological reasons support the opinion that an estimated incidence of 30,000\u201340,000 is closer to the actual reality. With a survival rate of 15% and a life expectancy of 40 more years, a global prevalence of 210,000 noma survivors is estimated.[8] Many cases are not discovered due to weak health care systems, lack of knowledge about noma, stigma, and neglect. Children often die without a diagnosis, treatment, or even a record of their death, as the disease primarily affects the poorest children in remote areas where there is no reliable recording of births, diseases or deaths, and where health care workers do not recognize noma. Risk factors for noma are increasing due to rising economic disparities, higher food prices, more hunger and malnutrition, climatic changes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and national and international neglect.[9] The mortality rate from noma is estimated to be 85% as most children receive no treatment. Noma has a multifactorial etiology. A prerequisite is malnutrition, often related to extreme poverty, but other factors are concomitant diseases and poor oral hygiene resulting in gingivitis. Malnutrition is closely correlated with immunity, which may lead to a nutritionally acquired immune deficiency syndrome.[10] This condition is particularly prevalent in children who were preterm and low birth weight babies.[11] Depending on the region in Africa, these infants represent up to 25% of births. The age of the onset of noma corresponds nutritionally to a period of vulnerability coinciding with the period of weaning, with underweight infants particularly at risk. Importantly, weaning corresponds also to the age of the onset of debilitating and immunosuppressive diseases, such as the first malaria crisis or measles.[12] Social factors play a role in the onset of noma, particularly in large families where the mother has grand multiparity and an inadequate nutritional status. The link between the number of past pregnancies and chronic malnutrition in children with noma suggests that it could be related to maternal malnutrition during pregnancy.[13] This may increase the risk for prematurity or low birth weight infants, thus promoting a vicious cycle of repetitive infections and chronic malnutrition and opening the door for noma onset. Various diseases have been described in association with noma, such as malaria, typhus, measles, chickenpox, tuberculosis, and HIV infection. Measles and malaria are the most frequently reported illnesses that precede noma.4,5,17 These diseases often occur during the weaning period and have serious immunosuppressive effects.[14] Insufficient oral hygiene can facilitate the onset of a necrotizing gingivitis characterized by the presence of some periodontal pathogens and sometimes resulting in the development of noma.[15]  My Favorite Disease, Noma Noma is a gangrenous disease affecting young children that rapidly destroys the soft and hard tissues of the face and leads to a massive loss of substance with obvious esthetic prejudice and functional sequelae.[16] The starting point of noma is defined when facial edema appears in addition to necrotizing stomatitis (infection of mucus membranes), accompanied by a typical halitosis often considered as pathognomonic.[17] This stage is short and lasts only a few days. Following the appearance of necrotizing stomatitis and facial edema, a necrotizing infection extends rapidly within a few days into the intraoral mucosa, the facial muscles, the skin, the maxilla, and the mandible.[18] A bluish discoloration of the skin indicates underlying necrosis coming to the surface. A peculiarity of this gangrene is that it appears to have a self-limiting character ending in a well-demarcated necrosis. On some occasions, the body appears to be able to resist and halt the expansion of the gangrene at a certain stage. Interestingly, some children do not receive treatment and develop relatively small lesions, while others experience huge facial destruction despite appropriate medical treatment.[19] This may be due to differences in the degree of impairment of their immune systems. After demarcation of the gangrene, the necrotic tissue starts to slough. At this stage, many patients die due to sepsis. If they do survive and the body has eliminated most necrotic tissue by sloughing, suppuration or sequestration, signs of wound healing appear.[20] During this stage, granulation tissue forms, wound contracture occurs, and both mucosa and epithelium start to grow from the margins of the wound over the granulating surface. Depending on the tissue defect and the health of the patient, this healing process may take weeks or many months. The wound healing process may lead to intraoral constricting bands hampering normal mouth opening (trismus) and, in severe cases, to fibrous or even bony ankylosis of the jaw.[21] The dramatic result of this condition is the fact that it will impair the nutrition of children who are already undernourished. Only approximately 15% of children survive acute noma.[22] Most survivors present with facial deformities and trismus or ankylosis of the mandible, resulting in eating problems, oral incontinence, speech difficulties, and social isolation. At a later age, these contractures often lead to growth disturbances and result in further facial disfigurement and functional impairment.[23] The psychological impact of surviving noma can be easily understood, but it has been rarely studied.  My Favorite Disease, Noma Primary prevention of noma can be achieved by economic development, but only if this development ensures that parents can feed their children adequately.[24] Food security programs may be less desirable, but they are effective. However, these preventive measures are political and public health issues. Primary medical prevention of noma consists of measles vaccination programs and the prevention and treatment of concomitant diseases, such as HIV and malaria.[25] Secondary prevention, including the detection and treatment before visible symptoms is difficult and requires surveillance programs in areas of famine and poverty where limited resources are already stretched to the limit by other health priorities. Noma is not a common disease, but typically occurs with other neglected diseases and malnutrition. Noma should not be targeted alone, in contrast with vertical programs aiming to eradicate specific health conditions, such as the nearly successful eradication of guinea worm infection.[26] Rather, noma should be included in neglected disease, poverty, malnutrition, and health education programs. Treatment consists of three main elements: antibiotics (amoxicillin and metronidazole); hydration and nutritional support; and treatment of concomitant disease/s and deficiencies to prevent death.[27] The choice of these antibiotics is empirical, and not based on culture results and determination of resistance. Little is known about the presence of multidrug resistant microorganisms in the extremely poor communities where noma is found. Local wound care is mandatory with frequent wound dressing, the simple removal of slough with scissors, and extraction of sequesters.[28] At this stage, the differential diagnosis includes leprosy, leishmaniasis, cutaneous tuberculosis, squamous cell carcinoma, cleft lip, yaws and trauma, which may present as facial deformities mimicking noma.[29] Surgical rehabilitation of noma sequelae is directed at the functional and cosmetic improvement of the face. The basic principle is to release the trismus or ankylosis and to replace lost tissue by transferring local tissue flaps and, when the loss is substantial, from other parts of the body. At present, this is mainly provided by nongovernmental humanitarian organizations or European hospitals.[30] The social impact of surgical rehabilitation is rewarding with better chances for education, employment and marriage after surgery.  Noma (disease) - Noma Disease Noma remains a neglected disease in tropical medicine, in local health policies and in neglected tropical disease programs. None of the many institutional reports, for example, from the World Health Organization (WHO), has included noma in their estimations of the global burden of diseases, although a recent first and rough estimation of the burden of the disease of noma (1\u201310 million DALYs) qualifies the disease to be fully recognized as a neglected tropical disease.[31] The continued existence of noma is evidence that the most vulnerable children lack the basic right to food. In 2012, the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee cited children affected by noma as an example of the effects of severe malnutrition and childhood diseases as follows: \u201cNoma, the face of poverty, represents the worst violations of the rights of the child.\u201d[32] Footnotes[1] Hippocratic Writings[2] Arnoldi Bootii, ...

A mummy discovered on a ship  This mummified ship captain was found on an half-sunken ship, which had floated for seven years after his death. Night Visits  Someone\u2019s doorbell was detecting visitors over a span of several days, always in the middle of the night. Her Last Picture  This is the last known picture of 18 year old Jolee Callan. Right after this picture was taken, her boyfriend shot her twice in the head and pushed her off the cliff. Crossroads  This picture was taken during the terrorist attacks of 9/11, when many people were forced to choose a death by burning, or by jumping from the Towers. Shell-shocked Soldier  This photo of a shell-shocked soldier during World War 1 never fails to give me the creeps. Nuclear Shadows  After the detonation of nuclear bombs in Hiroshima that ended World War 2, all that remained of many people was their shadow-imprint. Starvation  This photo was taken of a vulture stalking a dying Sudanese girl. The girl survived, fortunately, but she died many years later due to disease. The photographer was attacked by the the media who claimed that he should have done more, but he was not allowed to interact with anyone, and was under constant supervision of armed \u201cbody guards\u201d. Melting Faces  Wax figures salvaged from a museum in London that caught on fire in 1925.

Vegas Shooting  A couple posts a photograph at the Route 91 Harvest musical festival in Las Vegas right before a gunman killed 58 people. The woman in this photo, Denise Burditus, died in the arms of her husband later that night.  Man, those wax figures gave me the chills. Those things are nightmare fuel, right there. Jackson <3 ",

            "answer_text": "Do you recognize this picture?  It was on the news all the time in 2013.  How about now? The two men in the baseball caps that have been marked out.  All right, here is one more zoomed-out version of the picture. There is a running event going on. The two men in the picture are the 2013 Boston Bombers. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were brothers who, on April 15, 2013, set off two pressure cooker bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. The event, now known as the Boston Marathon Bombing, would take three lives and injure 264 people.  Three days later, the FBI released images of the two suspects (the pictures above) who were identified as the Tsarnaev brothers. This set off a harrowing chase right out of an action movie as the FBI moved to apprehend them. In Watertown, Massachusetts, the duo murdered a policeman and kidnapped a man in his car while having a shootout with police. The shootout resulted in the death of another policeman. However, Tamerlan was shot several times as well and ran over by Dzhokhar as he tried to escape in the stolen vehicle. The unprecedented manhunt for Dzhokhar began soon after as police cordoned off 20 blocks of Watertown. Eventually, Dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat in someone\u2019s backyard and apprehended after a dramatic shootout.  Upon questioning, it was learned that the brothers had also planned to detonate explosives in Times Square after being radicalized by extremist propaganda. Two years later, in April 2015, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was sentenced to death with the jury at his trial recommending death by lethal injection. In June of that year, in his first public statement, Dzhokhar would apologize to the victims and their families.  Today, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is on death row, incarcerated at ADX Florence, one of the most dangerous prisons in the world (alongside other notorious criminals such as El Chapo).  ",

            "answer_text": "Warning! Graphic images ahead \u26a0\ufe0f Let me ask you one question : What is more scarier than your own people planning for your death? This is Maryam Abdullah:  Her ambition was to become a doctor to help the people of Somalia. Her graduation day was on Sunday 17th October 2017. But sometimes life isn't fair. What happened that day shook the whole of Somalia and made headlines around the world. This is the complete story : A massive truck bombing killed over 500 and injured over 300 people in Somalia including youths, old people, doctors, nurses, children and infants.    Somalia\u2019s government has blamed the attack on the Al-Shabab extremist group, which often targets Mogadishu but has not taken the responsibility of the attack. Well, obviously, no one else causes destruction in Somalia other than this monsters called Al-Shabaab. Analysts have suggested that Al-Shabab, an ally of Al-Qaeda, may have avoided taking responsibility because it did not want to be blamed for the deaths of so many civilians. But the main question is; How did Al-Shabaab manage to pass the security checkpoint of one of the most protected areas in Somalia? According to a Somali intelligence official investigating the attack, an overloaded truck covered with a tarpaulin approached a security checkpoint outside Mogadishu early Saturday. This horrible incident happened 14th October 2017. The truck, covered in dust, aroused suspicion from soldiers who ordered the driver to park and get out. The driver, a man who the soldiers said behaved in a friendly manner, then made a phone call to someone in the capital. The driver then passed the phone to the soldiers to speak to a higher official who vouched for the truck and persuaded soldiers to allow it to proceed into the city, said the Somali intelligence official. Once through the checkpoint, the truck started to speed along the sandy, potholed road and raced through another checkpoint where soldiers opened fire and flattened one of its tires The driver continued before stopping on a busy street and detonating. BOOM!!! The blast leveled nearly all nearby buildings in one of Mogadishu\u2019s most crowded areas. The man who vouched for the truck has been arrested and is being held in jail, said the official. The driver probably decided to detonate on the busy street instead because several more checkpoints were ahead before the airport because their main target was the biggest airport in Somalia, the intelligence official said. \u201cAnother reason that he would not proceed further is the fact that security forces were coming after it,\u201d the official said. See the problem? The problem is not the soldiers. The soldiers were willing to risk their lives to save their people. But the main problem is the officials. Had the truck not allowed inside, it wouldn't have caused such a massive destruction. You know what is worse? Maryam\u2019s father came from America that day only to be welcomed by the death of his daughter!!! What a shame! What a shame!! What a shame!!! Just imagine, over 500 killed and more than injured!!! I can't imagine the plight of the victims injured and those families that lost their loved ones. Rest in peace to all who lost their lives.

            "answer_text": "Three siblings were climbing Moro Rock in California\u2019s Sequoia National Park. Michael McQuilken, was a long-haired 18-year-old when this snapshot was taken on Aug. 20, 1975. His brother Sean was 12. \u201cWe thought it was something funny.\u201d Lightning struck. Both brothers survived the strike, although another hiker was killed. \u201cAt the time, we thought this was humorous,\u201d McQuilken recalled. \u201cI took a photo of Mary and Mary took a photo of Sean and me. I raised my right hand into the air and the ring I had on began to buzz so loudly that everyone could hear it.\u201d Not once did they consider that a lightning strike was imminent, he said. It hit the 12 year old very hard. Sean was one of at least three people hit directly that day by the triple-pronged bolt. Sean never recover well and committed suicide in 1989. Decades later, hair-raising photo still a reminder of lightning danger    Twice I seemed to be near lighting. The first time was an outward bound hiking trip where we needed to hike a ridge. The weather got nasty on the ridge and there was lightning close by. Guide told us to crouch down and sit on the balls of our feet.  The second time I was with husband and friend to view the 4th of July fireworks in Chicago. We went to the museum area which was the best place to view. It was a somewhat open space by Lake Michigan. We settled in for the show. Husband left to buy a coke, cheese fries and hot dog. Suddenly my friend said \u201clook to the west!\u201d and WOW there was a wall of black clouds hovering over the tall buildings. It\u2019s coming our way! A minute later we were hit by torrential rain and thunder and lighting. The thunder and lighting were right overhead of us! BANG! POW! I crouched down and sat on the balls of my feet. Others ran under trees or to the museum. The thunder and lighting was crazy loud but my hair didn\u2019t stand on end. Damn scary. No cell phones at that time. No way for anyone to announce that there was a severe storm on its way. ",

            "answer_text": "It's actually a story which was circulated around whatsapp 3 yrs ago well i still got that. Well to be truthful i don't believe it myself but you can just read it for entertainment.  Check this pic, nothing special right? Let me tell you the story about it from start then you decide. It's about a couple story from udaipur, That couple was married yr ago and the girl was in 5th month of her pregnancy, they did love marriage going against girl parents. The boy family was with their decision but the girl family was against them. The couple was living with boys family, they didn't had separate home, after 7 months the girl became pregnant and after hearing this news the girl family side got furious. Her family made her cousin brother stalk her everday. Girl got frustrated and scared due to this and decided to to file a police complaint and police arrested his cousin later when the neighbours gave the proof. After some time he got bailed out and 5 months passed liked this, one day the couple decided to visit a restaurant at late night (12pm) and they got out from there at 1:30am, it was late night night so they couldn't find any rickshaw so they decided to travel by foot cuz their home was just 4km away. After 5 minutes they thaught someone was following them so they turn around and two guys with masks put knife on their necks and told them to be quiet otherwise they will kill them, they took them to their car which was standing a bit far away from that place and they took them from there to a silent jungle like place, there they tied the husband to the tree and made him watch the murder of his wife while stabbing her 20 times in stomach and later also stabbed the husband to and went away. The boys parents filed a complaint at that night night and at morning their bodies was found, After 3 weeks the case was solved and it was found that the girl cousin was responsible for the crime along with one of his friend cuz he was mad when she filed a complaint against him. Now the weird part is, after exact one year from that crime the same thing happened to a couple from pune who was on honeymoon, they were found murdered in the same way and the case wasn't solved but the next yr same thing happened again at the same spot the same way and no suspect. They say that each yr a couple die in same way and is found at that spot. Now this picture? It was saved in one victim's mobile at the night of murder at same spot and the light there is the weird thing, cuz at that place there was no street light and it's completely dark at night and how was that picture clicked anyway when the boy was tied. Many believe it's the ghost of the pregnant girl who was killed there and she make other guys do those murders every yr at that place. Now your decision to believe it or not. ",

            "answer_text": "For me it must be the girl drenched in napalm in an attack at a school in the Vietnam war  Amazingly she survived the attack, and apparently still gives presentations about the circumstances leading up to the attack and how she and the other children were affected after the attack. Her nudity where it is clear she is severely burned all over, and even though she had stripped her self of the clothes, it was too late the skin was already drenched and soaking up the napalm and burning her. You can see the same level of pain in the boy in the foreground -left and it appears that the shirt and trousers have bonded to his skin. Scary the inhumanity of war, particularly when it is aimed at innocents as small as 11 years and below as the picture above shows all to plainly. There are certain parallels with the mass execution of the Jews in WWII German prison camps, of Auschwitz et. al. Read the book and watch the filmby John Boyle: \u2026\u201dThe boy in striped pyjamas\u201d where a na\u00efve 8 year old is taken to a camp by his war office father, not realising the events that were going on (come to that nor was his mother/ wife of the Officer of the Concentration Camp). Whilst that centres of the mass murder of the gas chambers there are strong links with the Horishima and Napalm events where the murders were en amsse and equally unpleasant. I know that this is a slight story popper, but there is a twist in film where the na\u00efve son if the Commandant, makes friends with one of the Jews in the camp with the fence dividing them. Bruno discovers that he can dig under the fence, and Schmoll come back the day with a set of prison clothes and a spade so they can dig under and go to find Schomll\u2019s father ( where it become clear the has been subject to the mass slaughter of the Gas Chamber. As a matter of irony due to their enthusiasm to find Schmols father they get rounded up and forced in to one of the chambers and murdered. Of course you see the change in the Commandants face to shock now he realises that he has actually killed his own son as part of his job. When you link that with archive footage of the massive graves that were discovered by the American forces these people were quite literally stripped naked and bulldozed in to burial pits or thrown in to crematoriums and burned. The story line is an important one and shows how very close Hitler came in his dream \u201c to rid the Earth of the Jewish Race\u201d. Indeed it was clear that was why he killed himself in the prison when captured. It also allows you to see how ware is seen both from adult and child points of view, knitted in with the propaganda of the day. Chris R- London ",

            "answer_text": " A wind turbine fire in the Netherlands. Four engineers were conducting routine work when a fire broke out. A short circuit was believed to have been the cause. Two of the team managed to escape, but two were trapped.  The two engineers were aged 19 and 21. The height of the turbine made it almost impossible for the fire services to reach them. Knowing that rescue for them is entirely impossible, the two men embrace.  One falls to his death. The other succumbs to injuries while he makes a run to the staircase down. It's probably not as scary as other images, but I've always wondered what was going through their heads as they realised nothing could be done. And, while I have known about these images for ages, its only until tonight when I was researching into it for more information that I realise their ages. 19 and 21. So young. So incredibly young. Edit: Stefan Gebhardt provided an excellent updates in the comments, which I felt warranted being included in my answer - thanks, Stefan! After reading some comments here are a few updates. One, the two guys were 67 meters high. The fire department who was there disnt (sic) have a crane high enough. Two, they were electricians, not engineers, and being a fully qualified electrician at 19 is not a big deal. Next, the first two who were saved jumped through smoke and fire into the staircase (sic), and made it out. The other two where in (sic) the wrong spot so couldn't do that. One of the two tried that eventually but was engulfed in flames and didn't make it, they found him later burnt on the top. When that guy didn't make it, the other guy decided to jump. Probably thought there's an ever so slight chance he might survive with multiple broken bones or so, compared to guaranteed death otherwise. I\u2019d also like to add that people are assuming this small place might have a helicopter. Few points to address here: Even if they did have a helicopter, the assumption is that it would take quite a period of time to get this there. These wind turbines are purposefully designed to be as far away from civilisation as possible. With the fire spreading as quickly as electrical fires can \u2014 they likely saw no hope.I don\u2019t know, but my assumption is that even if they did get the helicopter out, the men mightn\u2019t be tethered at all, so the gusts from the blades could throw them off anyway.",

            "answer_text": " Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels face when he found out that the LIFE magazine photographer Mr. Eisenstaedt was Jewish. What's scary about this picture was not because of his murderous look, it's the fact that even a high standing nazi propaganda minister couldn't tell the difference between a jew and a German until they were told so, yet they killed millions of Jews based on their ethnicity. The same Jew photographer clicked this photo. It's crazy to think that the society stood by what happened to the Jews yet we would do the same instead of risking our lives. Let's not forget that the nazis also used censorship in the media. The terms they coined to describe their various practices are not only deceptive but they are also chilling. Nazis never used the words \u2018kill\u2019 or \u2018murder\u2019 in their official communications. Mass killings were termed special treatment, final solution (for the Jews), euthanasia (for the disabled), selection and disinfections. \u2018Evacuation\u2019 meant deporting people to gas chambers. Do you know what the gas chambers were called? They were labelled \u2018disinfection-areas\u2019, and looked like bathrooms equipped with fake showerheads. Yet society knew that the Jews were being treated harshly and boycotted and yet they remained silent. Despite the nazis best efforts rumours spread. It wasn't until the war ended that the allies knew about the full extent of the cruelty of the nazis. In fact the German soldiers themselves were disgusted by the concentration camps footage. In fact the film recorded was never released as it was too horrible for us to watch. The Holocaust film that was too shocking to show  German prisoners of war held in an American camp watch a film about German concentration camps, 1945. Many civilians were also shown the atrocities committed in the concentration camps.  Hundreds of locals were taken around the notorious Buchenwald concentration camp in Weimar, Germany, just days after it had been liberated by American troops  Many were left in floods of tears after witnessing piled of bodies at the notorious Nazi death camp  Reports at the time said up to a thousand Weimar residents were marched to the camp, escorted by US troops, four days after the liberation so they could witness the atrocities that had been carried out at the camp.  One woman can be seen being carried away by two soldiers after collapsing while being shown evidence of the atrocities carried out at the camp Now don't get me wrong. There was a vast number of people who were appalled by the Nazis but those who resisted were few in number. The large majority\r of Germans, however, were passive onlookers and apathetic witnesses. They were too scared to act, to differ, to protest. They preferred to look away. Pastor Niemoeller, a resistance fighter, observed an absence of protest, an uncanny silence, amongst ordinary Germans in the face of brutal and organised crimes committed against people in the Nazi empire. He wrote movingly about this silence : First they came for the Communists And I did not speak out Because I was not a Communist Then they came for the Socialists And I did not speak out Because I was not a Socialist Then they came for the trade unionists And I did not speak out Because I was not a trade unionist Then they came for the Jews And I did not speak out Because I was not a Jew Then they came for me And there was no one left To speak out for me What scares me is not the fact that another dictator like Hitler will rise. What scares me is the fact that the people will stand by while these actions happen.  Jewish people protesting in Ellis Island against their deportation back in Germany, 1936. It showcases Otto Richter and his wife. Otto Richter escaped Nazi Germany and went to Belgium. Unfortunately Belgium was subsequently invaded by Germany on 10 May 1940, surrendered 18 days later, and was occupied by German forces until 1944. Many Belgians managed to escape to the UK during that time, but it is unknown whether Otto Richter was among those who survived the war and Belgium\u2019s occupation. I hope that the world never sees another Hitler. Yet knowing human nature there probably will be one. Please checkout my space Glimpses of World History for more history facts like this. ",

            "answer_text": " My money is on the images and stories of the Khmer Rouge genocide. Roughly 2 million people were killed in Cambodia between 1974 and 1979 under the thumb of Pol Pot - a full 24% of the population of Cambodia at the time. Unlike the Nazi genocide however, the Khmer took a certain sort of joy in this nightmarish fiasco. In Germany, gas chambers came about initially as a way to eliminate the psychological stress of SS soldiers during mass executions - the Khmer just got children to do it as they weren't old enough to realize the gravity of their actions. They were handed rifles and forced to kill thousands of people daily. The lucky citizens that avoided the bad end of a muzzle were worked to death, beaten and starved on a near industrial scale.  Then they took it up a notch\u2026 They performed all manner of medical experiments that would have made the Japanese Imperial Army green with envy and there is strong evidence that this continued into the early 1990's. \u201cA medic who worked inside S-21 told that a 17-year-old girl had her throat slit and her abdomen pierced before being beaten and put into water for the whole night. This procedure was repeated many times and it was carried out without anesthetics. In hospital of Kampong Cham province, child medics cut out the intestines of a living non-consenting person and they joined their ends in order to study the healing process.\u201d -Wiki  The Khmer ruled Cambodia for nearly 30 years with some estimates putting the population death toll at 4.5 million people (including the 75-79 genocide). All Cambodians.  This was all after nearly 40 years of fighting and civil war in southeast Asia. Yet, ask most people who Pol Pot is and they have no idea. Ask what S-21 was. No idea. Hell, ask where Cambodia is. This was an absolute holocaust largely ignored and forgotten by history. I recommend the movie \u201cThe Killing Fields\u201d. Additional sad fact: Haing Somnang Ngor, played Dith Pran in the movie and was a genocide survivor, having survived three terms in S-21 prisons. He was awarded the Academy Award for best supporting actor and was killed in a gang shooting in Los Angeles, 1996. ",
