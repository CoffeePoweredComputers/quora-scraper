            "answer_text": "All energy is motion. And motion is governed by newtons laws and relativity. Potential energy is a measure of how much force or motion can be generated by an object relative to another object. It is the energy of position. An object possesses simultaneously a number of different types of potential energy, related to each of the known forces and their interactions. Potential energy is converted to kinetic energy through the application of force. A ball held over the ground possesses gravitational potential energy. By releasing the ball, the force of gravity acts upon that ball converting its positional or potential energy into kinetic energy. Different forces will grant different potential energy values for different objects over different distances and under different conditions. But they all apply a force in order to convert potential energy into kinetic energy. ",
