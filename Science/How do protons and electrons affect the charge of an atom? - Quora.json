            "answer_text": "Well, clearly the excess or deficiency of electrons determines whether the species, the ION, is an ANION, or a CATION respectively. And given any atom, why could it not be an excess or deficiency of positively-charged nuclear particles? Most atoms have an EQUAL number of PROTONS, massive positively-charged nuclear particles, and ELECTRONS, negatively-charged particles of negligible mass that are conceived to whizz about the nuclear core. The sharing of electrons BETWEEN nuclei is responsible for the covalent bond. Mostly, metals are electron-rich species that tend to form positive ions\u2026i.e. [math]M + \u0394 \\rightarrow M^{2+} + 2e^{-}[/math] On the other hand, non-metals, from the right-hand side of the Periodic as we face it, are electron poor materials, they have high nuclear charge, and these TEND to be reduced, i.e. they accept electrons\u2026 [math]X+e^{-} \\rightarrow X^{-}[/math] Given the identity of the element, i.e. given [math]Z_{\\text{the atomic number}}[/math], we can immediately assign the nuclear charge, and thus the electronic charge\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The number of protons determines the amount of positive charge in the nucleus. The number of electrons determines the amount of negative charge surrounding the nucleus; in a neutral atom the numbers of protons and electrons match. If an atom gains one or more electrons, it becomes negatively charged; if it loses one or more, it becomes positive. ",

Also can we store information by somehow writing on what is inside of an atom? I hope this answers your question ",
