            "answer_text": "Jules Stoop is completely correct. But I would like to add some amplifying information. I want you to think about what the earth must look like from the moon during the lunar eclipse. To do that, you have to understand what caused the lunar eclipse in the first place.  Look at this picture. The lunar eclipse happens because the earth is directly between the moon and sun. The only people that can see the lunar eclipse are those on the night side of the earth. And to them, they will see a fully illuminate moon (AKA, full moon) approach the shadow area, eclipse, and then exit the shadow area. Therefore, lunar eclipses will always occur with a full moon. Now, imagine what you would see if you were on the moon. Of course, you would have to be on the illuminated side of the moon to see the earth at all. You would be looking at the night side of the earth, which means you wouldn't be able to see it at all, especially since it would be so close to the sun in the sky. You would see the sun slowly disappear as the earth covered it. More and more. Finally it reaches the point where the earth has completely covered the sun. At that point, you are seeing every night area on the earth. On the other side, everyone is in daylight, and they are missing the show. But the people on the very edge of the earth? They are all either in sunrise or sunset. That's right. You are seeing every sunrise and sunset on earth at the same time! I think it would look something like this:  So, why does the moon turn reddish-orange during the lunar eclipse? Because the only light that can make it to the moon will be that light which has passed through a sunrise or sunset on earth. And our sunrises and sunsets are what color? Reddish-orange.   Edit: I received a tweet reminding me there can be a \"blood moon\" that is not associated with an eclipse (thanks, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH (EpicJavster) on Twitter). It isn't normally called a \"blood moon\", but the moon can most definitely appear reddish-orange when it is very low on the horizon. Since full moons always rise at sunset, you could see a reddish moon at that time. But this, to me, is not a \"blood moon\", which \"traditionally\" refers to the moon during a lunar eclipse. What's more, the term \"blood moon\" is relatively new, so even \"traditionally\" doesn't make much sense. Therefore, you could call any moon that you want a blood moon. In any case, there isn't an astronomical significance to the \"blood moon\". ",

            "answer_text": "If you are referring to the \"Blood Moon\" or technically saying a total lunar eclipse, then it is about the positions of the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon, also atmospheric optics that causes the \"red\". A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly behind the Earth into its umbra (shadow). This can occur only when the sun, Earth and moon are aligned exactly, or very closely so, with the Earth in the middle. Hence, a lunar eclipse can occur only the night of a full moon. The type and length of an eclipse depend upon the Moon's location relative to its .  A total lunar eclipse has the direct sunlight completely blocked by the earth's shadow. The only light seen is refracted through the earth's shadow. This light looks red for the same reason that the sunset looks red, due to rayleigh scattering of the more blue light. Because of its reddish color, a total lunar eclipse is sometimes called a blood moon.   So when sunlight passes through the earth's atmosphere, it filters and reflects in such a way that the green to violet lights on the spectrum scatters more strongly than the red light.This results the moon to get more red light.
