            "answer_text": "In Judaism: God is One. The concept of a dualism (as in Zoroastrianism), an independent Satan, multiple gods (polytheism; paganism) or a trinity of three in one, are all unimaginable in Judaism. Also, any belief that an intermediary between humanity and God should be used, whether as necessary or even optional, is considered heretical.God is non-physical, indivisible and incomparable. Jewish tradition teaches that God is beyond human comprehension; and that it is only God's revealed deeds, as He interacts with mankind and the world, that we can begin to grasp. His names indicate His attributes and the ways in which He relates to us.God is omniscient (He is aware of everything), and infinitely wise.God created the universe and all existence, including time and space, in a deliberate, purposeful act of benevolent Creation. Link: CreationGod is the mover of everything. No molecule can move without the energy and direction with which God imbues it.God is eternal; and His ways are also eternal. He is not capricious, forgetful or fickle.God is just. He rewards good and punishes evil - whether in this world or in the afterlife.God is ethical and moral; and He expects us to imitate His ways.The God of Israel is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He is the guide of history, who delivered the Israelites from Egyptian slavery. Link: The ExodusGod is the source of law, who gave the Torah to the Israelites at Mount Sinai. Link: The TorahGod is immanent and personal, meaning that he relates to humanity and hears our prayers. This is the basis of the Psalms and our siddur (prayerbook).

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s contrary to him creating humans. It\u2019s more like humans created God. It is the biggest fantasy in human history that people hope is true because they don\u2019t find happiness in life, and so they set their hopes in afterlives and mythical aspirations so that they can find a purpose for themselves or justify their motives in life. The nature of God is almost comical. It\u2019s very funny to see people who are genuinely convinced that some fairy in the clouds or a bunch of sparkles in the sixth dimension created this massive universe and is controlling it. It\u2019s even funnier when they attempt to justify the suffering, like people dying when they\u2019re born, daily cases of rape, murder, shootings, everyday crime, unjust deaths, financial jeopardy, etc. They come up with a load of bull like they did something bad in their past lives, or something like \u201cIt\u2019s all God\u2019s plan\u201d. Like, they\u2019re for real lmao I\u2019m not atheist, but agnostic. Frankly if I was convinced God was real, I\u2019d take it. I just don\u2019t buy it so far. If I did, however, accept him, I\u2019d be confused about his nature. The world isn\u2019t a great place, it\u2019s quite unfair and cruel to most people actually. If he has control over this, I have no idea what he gets out of it. The nature of God, therefore, is just absolutely comical to me. We\u2019re just intelligent creatures who can identify our conscience and serve a limited lifespan in flesh on this huge mass of water and mud until we die and our bodies rot away. In this process we\u2019ve come up with fantasies of \u201cGod\u201d. It\u2019s very amusing. ",
