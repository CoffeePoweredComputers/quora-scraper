            "answer_text": "  The first image shows ribose, the second deoxyribose- note that in deoxyribose one of the hydroxyl groups is replaced with a hydrogen. Deoxyribose thus has one less oxygen atom, giving it its name. Deoxyribose is a component of the DNA backbone, wheras Ribose performs the same function in RNA- the differing properties of the two are part of the reason for DNA\u2019s higher stability. ",
