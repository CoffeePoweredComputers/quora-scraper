So do \u2018bleach\u2019 [sodium hypochlorite] and \u2018vinegar\u2019 [acetic acid], though in both cases the common meaning is actually a dilute solution of the substance in question. Words like \u2018flour\u2019 or \u2018sand\u2019 are not compound-specific, but are more general terms describing a category of substances and/or particle sizes. ",
