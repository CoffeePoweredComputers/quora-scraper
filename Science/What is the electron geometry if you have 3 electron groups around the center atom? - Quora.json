            "answer_text": "You want the electronic geometry if there are THREE pairs of electrons around a CENTRAL atom? Well, we describe a [math]sp^{2}[/math] system \u2026 and reasonably, the electron pairs, the ORBITALS, adopt a geometry that MINIMIZES electronic interaction \u2026 and thus we would predict by [math]\\text{VESPER}_{\\text{Valence shell electron-pair repulsion theory}}[/math] A TRIGONAL PLANAR geometry\u2026 And as you have nicely appreciated, electronic geometry MAY NOT correspond to molecular geometry\u2026 And so molecular [math]BCl_{3}[/math] with [math]sp^{2}[/math] hybridization, has trigonal planar geometry, i.e. [math]\u2220_{Cl-B-Cl}=120\u00b0[/math]; but dichlorocarbene, [math]Cl_{2}C:[/math] (a real molecule, but you would not be able to put it into a bottle, has a BENT geometry)\u2026[math]\u2220_{Cl-C-Cl} \\approx 110\u00b0[/math], that is the carbon lone pair of electrons, the which lies CLOSE to the parent carbon atom as a NON-BONDING lone pair, tends to compress [math]\u2220_{Cl-C-Cl}[/math] BELOW [math]120\u00b0[/math]...
