            "answer_text": "We (I.e. you, I or any human being) will never be able to move through space faster than the speed of light (in fact, not even at the speed of light, as we have mass), because of how spacetime is constructed (as explained by the Special Theory of Relativity). it has been suggested that we may be able to move from one point to another in a time that is (perhaps substantially) less than the time it would take us by travelling through space at the speed of light, by travelling through a wormhole. A wormhole is a particular solution to Einstein\u2019s General Relativity equations that would result in a section of space that would be \u201capart from\u201d normal space, joining two locations, such that the distance between the locations via the wormhole could be substantially less than the distance between them via normal space. However, the concept of wormholes is extremely contentious, and it is probable that they are just a mathematical exercise and could not exist. ",

            "answer_text": "Possibly when we accept that the speed of light is not a speed limit of the universe. The speed of light is always the same for every observer irrespective of their speed relative to an assumed stationary location. Therefore, it does not matter how fast the observer is moving relative to an assumed stationary location. They will not be able to go faster than the light relative to them. Speed is a relative concept, it is quite possible that there is something in the universe that is travelling faster than the speed of light relative to us know. In simple terms, we can go faster than the speed of light, but not light. ",
