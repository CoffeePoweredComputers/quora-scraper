            "answer_text": "To understand what dark energy is, we must understand the foundation of physics. what lays behind quantum mechanics, and the general relativity. What is the fundament of the four fundamental forces of nature Dark energy has the property of repulsive gravity. If you got dark energy in its most compressed form, and then let it expand, it is relishing tremendous amounts of energy. Dark energy has the power to expand a black hole outwardly. Dark energy can\u2019t exist freely in the universe, it could only exist in coexistence whit positive energy. If a particle is forced to relish its contents of dark energy, it will instantly starts to produce new particles in different sizes. A photon could probably be made of 50% dark energy(negative energy), and 50% positive energy. In the photon negative energy is sited outside, and positive energy is inside. This is like sphere inside a bigger sphere. The center in this particle is where the forces is divided. That is the spherically, gravitational center in the photon. since a high energy photon can split into a proton, and an antiproton, the photon must then be made of quarks, or quarks is the same as negative energy, hence dark energy. As mentioned, relished dark energy instantly decaying to all sorts of particles that moves in almost light speed, or light speed itself. If we can find a way to manipulate protons in a way that forces a separation of dark energy(negative energy) inside, and positive energy outside, we would extract energy directly from matter. I can only speculate about how this could be done. I think that gamma photons is one of the most common results of cracked protons. I also think that atoms whit greater atom numbers than iron could be a indirect natural cause of cracked protons. As mentioned, I can only speculate. I think that particle accelerators could be a god tool to investigate how to crack protons, and to measure the effects. ",

            "answer_text": "Totally! All you need to do is to make a supernova sticky and put it on a stick.  Allow me to explain. I am invoking Feynman's sticky bead argument, first used in connection with gravitational waves. If it can make a bead move, it's really transmitting energy that can be harnessed: just make the bead sticky and put it on a stick and the resulting friction will harvest its energy as heat.  In the case of dark energy, we have observed it primarily from the red shift of type Ia supernovae. If dark energy can move supernovae, and we can control supernovae, we can harness dark energy.  Of course, in practice, we can't harness supernovae, and anyway dark energy doesn't move anything human-sized, which is a roundabout way of saying we'll never build a convenient way of harnessing it (at least not before we've already reached the stars by other means). But you should keep your eye on the Casimir effect: I'd wager high stakes that it must have something to do with dark energy, and if so, it might just be possible to build something neat with it. ",

Dark matter has a gravitational effect just like visible matter so we could only ever harness gravitational potential from it as we already do with existing gravity potentials like hydroelectric dams and so on. Dark Matter may not even exist in a form where potential can be stored for later use and even if it did the significant problem remains of finding it. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! Can dark energy be harnessed... Well, we'd have to prove it exists first. Right now, we only theorize that such a thing exists because its absence would unbalance the universe.  But in the end, it might be possible. Not any time soon, mind you. Definitely not in our lifetimes. If dark energy behaves in a way similar to dark matter, it might not even be worth the effort. Dark matter is everywhere, but it's weakly interacting in that it doesn't interact with hardly anything and when it does, it does so through the weak nuclear force. ",

In order to harness the energy (any energy), we would need to find a way to either directly move things using this energy, or heat some liquid, or produce some electric current or... and before that, we would have to find a way to concentrate this energy so that there is enough of it on one place to do some useful amount of work. When it comes to dark energy, none of this is a reality today. One day? It's difficult to make predictions. Especially about the future. ",

It would be more like a jet where the dark matter would be sucked into the engine at an enormous rate and would be forced into some sort of nuclear reaction which would jettison it out much faster than it came in.
