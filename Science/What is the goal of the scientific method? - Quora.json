            "answer_text": "Human beings are terrible at objectively assessing the world around us. We didn\u2019t evolve to do so. We evolved to see things in a way that would keep us from getting killed and pass on our DNA. Consequently, we are full of intellectual blind spots. We are extremely susceptible to believing incorrect ideas for all kinds of reasons. We might believe something that isn\u2019t true because everyone else does, because our parents taught us it was true, because we feel like it\u2019s true, because we want it to be true, because we can\u2019t handle the truth, because the truth is too complicated for our intuition to grasp at first glance, because our senses are unable measure it on their own (without additional technology), etc etc etc. Testing the world around us allows us to keep our theories about it from going down a rabbit hole. Testing our ideas provides a safeguard against our own cognitive blind spots. Having other people criticize and review our ideas safeguards against our blind spots. Building on the ideas of others that tested things allows us to come to accurate logical conclusions that would be too complicated to come to on our own without building on their efforts. This allows humanity to move forward with life-changing technology and understanding through subsequent generations. Finally, subjecting our ideas to the testing also allows us to refine them to a level of precision which facilitates good decision making\u2014especially for complex issues\u2014possibly being the difference between life or death for thousands or even millions of people. In short, the scientific method helps us avoid multitude of pitfalls we have to contend with in our imperfect minds. In doing so, it helps us get closer to understanding the universe and reality more accurately, which leads to an increase in quality of life. ",

            "answer_text": "The goal of the scientific method is greater understanding or utility that can be verified in some way. Greater understanding can result in: o Improved technology mainly (example supersonic airflow). There are few uses for this understanding beyond building fast aircraft. o Improved understanding mainly (example black holes). There as almost no uses for this understanding outside of cosmology. o Predicting future events for utility (example storms and earthquakes). Here it doesn't matter if we understand weather, just as long as we can predict it. o Predicting the results of experiment for the purpose of understanding (example gravity wave detection). Here it continues to validate a century old theory. o Organizing our knowledge base - example are in fossil discovery and bio taxonomy. Out of that knowledge base can come great utility or almost no utility, depending on the subject. We have almost no use for classifying stars in another galaxy, but great use for classifying bio organisms. Verification is a valued goal in science. It is not necessarily a goal in art or philosophy. The basic question is this: Does it work? \u201cIt\u201d refers to a theory or a body of knowledge or observation. One example: bear sitings. Should a biologist use only professional sitings or any sitings by the general public? The question to ask is \u201chow well does it work, and for what purpose?\u201d general public sitings might estimate bear population more accurately, but professional sitings might explain bear behavior better. The data might be collected before any conclusions are drawn. In General Relativity, the theory was formed before evidence for gravity lensing - a solar eclipse observation - was gathered. Just one observations was sufficient to validate an entire theory. In other cases, theory must be born out by practical application. For supersonic aircraft, theory is known to be correct only if the aircraft flies. No matter how good the theory looks on paper, if it fails in practice, it is not good theory. Conclusion: Science and technology are tremendously diverse. The goals, methods, and conclusions drawn are completely different from field to field. The \u201cMake it work\u201d goal in engineering often verifies theory and gets better results than the \u201cGet in published and cited\u201d goal in the pure sciences. However the \u201cMake it work\u201d goal can be almost impossible. We cant tap into a black hole and draw energy from it any time soon. ",
