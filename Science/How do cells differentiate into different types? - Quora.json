            "answer_text": "Trafalgar did a good job identifying why cells differentiate, so I will attempt to broadly explain how cells differentiate.Cells are in constant communication with each other and their environment via proteins and small molecules. Cells have receptors on their cell surface allowing them to respond to particular signals, but not all cells have the same types of receptors (and therefore not all cells can respond to the same signals). In the blastocyst stage of development (a few days after fertilization of the egg), there exists an epiblast layer of cells that can essentially become all the tissue types of the body. These cells from the epiblast are known as embryonic stem cells, and they are pluripotent in that they can differentiate into the three germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, mesoderm) making up all the tissues and organs of the mammalian body. The pluripotent stem cells in the blastocyst must differentiate during gastrulation (during development), in which there are 3 different germ layers in the developing embryo (which represent three tissue types that will eventually develop). This is perhaps the single most important event during mammalian development, and it is at this stage that the cells of the developing embryo begin to differentiate and form organs and tissues [1] .  Differentiation in general (during gastrulation and later on during mammalian development) is driven by mechanical cues (gradients of mechanical stress in the embryo as it changes shape), by cell adhesion cues (from the extracellular matrix and with other cells), by soluble cues (proteins or other molecules that can bind to receptors on the cell surface), by oxygen tension (the gradient of soluble oxygen), or other soluble or insoluble signals. These cues can signal a cell to change its phenotype and differentiate [2]. Differentiation in general begins with a cue that can transduce its signal inside the cell. Cues can be transduced in the cell by receptors on the cell surface (that transverse the cell membrane) that are activated and change their shape upon binding of the cue to the receptor [3]. In some cases, the cue can directly pass through the cell membrane and signal to the nucleus or to other intracellular proteins or molecules, but most cues are too large to pass through the membrane and require a cell surface receptor to transduce the signal to the inside of the cell. Once a receptor is engaged by a cue at the cell surface, intracellular proteins and messengers are recruited to the part of the receptor on the inside of the cell. These intracellular proteins and messengers bind to the receptor, recruit other messengers, and eventually activate a sequence of events that brings the signal to the nucleus of the cell (where all the DNA is stored). Once at the nucleus, these intracellular signals can activate transcription factors, which are proteins that are specialized to bind to DNA at specific sites and turn on the expression of certain genes. Conversely, signaling from cues outside the cell can also turn off particular transcription factors and repress the expression of certain genes by similar transduction pathways. The transcripts (mRNA) of the genes that are turned on or off by the signaling cue at the cell surface can then be translated into proteins that either are sent to the cell surface (as receptors or cell-secreted proteins) or stay inside the cell (as transcription factors, signaling proteins, structural proteins). Additionally, cell signaling and signal transduction can affect the genome by chemically modifying the histones that wrap the DNA (more details can be found in my previous answer on histones, What is histone acetylation?).  Differentiation can be thought of as a cellular process that begins with an initiating event and leads to changes in gene expression that cause a stem or progenitor cell to specialize its function.

            "answer_text": "This is a major question, and the focus Of thousands of research labs for all sorts of reasons.   Overall, the processes of embryogenesis and fetal development are fairly well understood.      A short version is that those early cells are totipotent or sometimes pluripotent (can turn into different cell types).  The very first cells (zygote, and when it divides a time or two) have mRNA from the original egg cell.   Differences in this mRNA influence gene expression in these early cells, as do the influences from surrounding cells.   These differences in gene expression lead to more differences in gene expression, as well as influencing the types of cells they turn into.   Some of these cells begin to migrate to other parts of the new organism.   Eventually, this forms tissues and organs. A surprising fraction of human development is just growth after the parts are largely formed. The heart is very early (circulation is essential) and the final stages of lung development are about last (not needed till birth).     This is a gross oversimplification, and without pictures. It does however, give you a general concept if what is happening ",

            "answer_text": "All cells have what is called Genomic Equivalence, simply meaning that when they are first created their DNA is all the same and has the potential to give rise to the same things. However, this does not happen because different factors within the cell express what genes are turned on and transcribed. Such factors can include protein binding motifs, enhancers, repressors, and other transcription factors that can regulate which, and when, genes are transcribed. All of these factors working together is known as Combinatorial Control, because it is not just one factor acting on the cell, but many. From this, the cells differentiate through different stages, or more specifically from Zygote to Competence, to Specification, to Determination, and finally to Differentiation. Depending on which stage of the process they are in, cells can reverse from what they are differentiating into if they receive inappropriate signals from the environment. However, once they reach determination, cells cannot change their fate. They are said to be autonomous by this point. Prior to this, the initial cells are totipotent, meaning they have the capability of giving rise to any cell type. Just depends on the signals they receive! ",

A classic example is the eye of the octopus, which looks very like the vertebrate eye but arises from different tissues. It is worked out by careful study of developing embryos, in simple creatures where this is visible.   The source of any system or organ is probably a frozen accident, developed gradually from simple beginnings and retained because changing it would be too big a leap for Natural Selection to manage.  Books about embryology should tell you more, or maybe DVDs.  I can't advise you as to which are best. ",
