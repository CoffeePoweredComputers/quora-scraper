The way we measure temperature is a little tricky. Students of physics are so accustomed to using maths that they forget; Maths is the language of Science. But Science is not Maths. When it suits us, we use the maths. We cannot change the science to suit the maths. That was the fatal error of everyone before Tycho Brahe, the jerk and Kepler, the eternal loser. Does it make sense to you if I say that your height is -1.7 m. Nice joke for ur immature friends but a rather silly one. But does not have to be always silly :p All you gotta do is shift the zero.  If I know that most of my measurements are going to be above 20 ml, it could be more convenient for me to start measuring from the 20 ml mark. I would record 22 ml as 2 ml. 27 ml as 7 ml. Sometimes we do not need to know about the 20 ml below my Zero. But it may come into the picture if any measurement is less than the 20 ml mark. Still, I can manage by using negative numbers. 15 ml becomes -5 ml in my new system. And so on and so forth. This is essentially how Degree Centigrade works. Most people do not have to deal with large variations in temperature. So, the ice point became the Zero. The steam point was assigned the value 100. Than we divided the thermometer into 100 equal marks and had ourselves a scale. It is a good scale. Most atmospheric phenomenon happens in this range. It is flexible in the sense that if temperature is below the ice point (like below our 20 ml mark), we can use negative numbers. It worked fine until some stickler decided to invent the Kelvin Scale. The Kelvin Scale is exactly like the Centigrade scale. If your temperature increases by 2 degree C, it increases by 2 degree K exactly. Except, they shifted the Zero of the measurements to the bottom of the glass. The bottom of the glass is at -273.15 degree C. Zero K.  Because we are used to thinking of the Centigrade Scale, we can imagine minus values in Kalvin scale too. But it is not defined like that. Zero degree K is the coldest temperature theoretically possible. You cannot go below the bottom of the glass (What was my name before my parents were married? :) . There is water or there is no water. They say temperature comes from motion of the particles in the material. The more the motion, the higher the temperature. Zero K is when everything is at a stand still. You wanna go below, talk to Harry Potter or Voldemort.. Lol.. May be both ;)  ",

            "answer_text": "Rigorously speaking, temperature is defined as the reciprocal of the thermal beta. Thermal beta is a more fundamental quantity. Without going into the maths, systems with a positive temperature will increase in entropy as one adds energy to the system. Systems with a negative temperature will decrease in entropy as one adds energy to the system. Ordinarily, entropy increases with adding of the energy hence negative temperatures are not commonly reachable. But there are systems which have a maximum amount of energy they can hold, and as they approach it, their entropy decreases. It is a Quantum phenomenon. There are a few examples where this has been observed, most commonly in laser systems. Gas with negative Kelvin temperature was created in a lab by Physicists in Germany in 2013. In terms of feeling hotness, negative Kelvin temperatures are higher than any temperature known. Here is short 10 sec video explaining this:  And here is a fun video explanation:  ",
