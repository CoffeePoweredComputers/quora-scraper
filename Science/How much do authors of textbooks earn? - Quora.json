            "answer_text": "With a publisher it's negotiable and, in my experience, your best bet is to dicker HARD to raise their standard percentage (whatever's in the contract they first offer you) on the first x number of books sold.  Then INSIST on double that percentage for sales beyond that.  You want to research the likely sales figures (how many courses are taught nationally in your subject matter, how well-liked is the \"standard\" text, what will your text have that isn't in the competition, what instructor supports will you do, etc, etc....?  Instructor supports (instructor manual, sample test questions, computer visuals, demos, whatever...) are often done gratis - given to instructors who adopt the text for even one semester  and updated by you whenever you update the text. If you are confident that your text fills an unfilled niche, and particularly if the publisher has sought you out to write the text - bargain HARD.  The couple of hours you spend negotiating can more than double the payback you'll get for every hour you spend planning and writing. If your book is a winner, you will think about that negotiation with every royalty check you get (and regret every 1/2% you gave away. ",
