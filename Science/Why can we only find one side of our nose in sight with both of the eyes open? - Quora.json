            "answer_text": "You can see both but most people have a dominant eye. In order to prevent double vision, your brain chooses to ignore one side.  To find the dominant eye do this simple test.  Put yours hands straight in front of you and make a triangle out of the thumbs and index fingersLook through the center of the triangle at an object in the distance with both eyes open. Close one eye at a time, the image will stay in the center with the dominant eye and it will be off center with the non dominant eye",
