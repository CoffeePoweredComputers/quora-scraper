            "answer_text": "I have read the first four answers and found them wanting. Chemical bonding has nothing to do with \u201cgaining, losing, or sharing\u201d electrons. For example. If you take a glass of salt water and allow or cause the water to evaporate. You will have left behind in the glass a small pile of white salt (NaCl) crystals. All of the ions involved (Na+, Cl-) are bonded to one another in those crystals by what are called \u201cionic bonds.\u201d A whole mess of ionic bonds formed right there in the glass! So, what electrons were \u201cgained, lost, or shared\u201d in the formation of those bonds? The answer is none. Albert Einstein once said \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.\u201d This association \u2026 between chemical bonds and electron transfers or shares is an oversimplification. If you take hydrogen and oxygen and react them, they do so explosively. The reactants are held together by covalent bonds, that is by two nuclei being attracted to the same electrons (a \u201cshare\u201d in the jargon of bonding theory. The products\u2019 (H2O) atoms are also held together by covalent bonds. The number of electrons \u201cshared\u201d in the reactants and products is exactly the same, so you can see this idea of electrons being \u201cgained, lost, or shared\u201d when bonds are formed is overly simplistic and not helpful at all.

            "answer_text": "It depends on how many electrons are in the outermost energy shell. If there is a single electron, as with sodium, then it will tend to lose its electron in molecular bonding and bond as a positive ion. If there is but one electron missing, as with chlorine, an electron will be borrowed to form a negative ion. Heading in from both directions\u2014two or more electrons or two or more missing, the tendency move towards covalent bonding with more and more equal distribution of the \u201celectron cloud\u201d (i.e., the probability density of the bonding electrons tend towards more even spread). [This is a bit of an oversimplification as there are also factors such as the size of the atoms.] ",
