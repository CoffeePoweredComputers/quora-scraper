            "answer_text": "If the material you have is nitrite then you will get a redox reaction between I- and nitrite in which iodide (I-) is oxidized to iodine and nitrate is reduced as shown below. 6 I(1-) + 2 NO2(1-) + 8 H(1+) \u2192 3 I2 + N2 + 4 H2O When this reaction is run at pH < 3 the reaction mixture will turn yellowish to brown. Not color change is observed with nitrate. ",
