            "answer_text": "Depends on your skills and time. Generally, it is not advised with some exceptions. As an average medical student, you are unlikely to match into ophthalmology and anesthesia while working during school, as these are competitive specialties. Studying is already 40\u201380 hours a week depending on your efficiency. Usually most people are on the higher end. Also, working isn't going to be worth your time, unless it pads your CV, such as work study medical student tutoring or paid clinical research. During residency, you could moonlight. In my opinion, as a medical student, my time is worth more than most jobs available. Hence, if this does not add to my resume, the job or gig should fulfill these requirements, generally speaking: Make more than $100/hr is my personal cutoff, considering the value of my time (I turned down a 6 figure job in tech to go to med)Be flexible to my scheduleWon't drain all my time or affect my health (namely sleep)There are very few options out there that fit this criteria, but I have found one niche that provides this - rental business. Other passive income sources should work. However, that generally would require upfront capital. I also fix things up if I have time and save as much as I can by living frugally. I don't lose money to rent. Generally a simple frugal life will save $100/hr or more. Sometimes I take extra software gigs if they are quick. You could also try sperm donation or plasma donation. The sperm banks love attractive medical student sperm. ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to answer this on behalf of my friends and colleagues who went to medical school. In the UK, it is only really possible to have a part time job during the first three years of a 5 year course. This is because medical students are expected to have an 'on-call' commitment during the final two years and the summer break is shortened. On the whole, my friends who worked tended to either do part-time bar work (the disadvantage being that this often involved late finishes prior to lectures the following day) Other friends gained work as nursing auxiliaries (unqualified nursing assistants) The advantage of this is that it allows the student to gain an insight into aspects of health and social care that they they may not have previously appreciated. I can honestly say that I think that this enables them to gain an empathy which they might not otherwise have. My friend Dan, who is now a senior Orthopaedic specialist, worked for many years in my department. He was able to choose flexible shifts and made friends and gained an insight and knowledge which he relies on even now. ",
