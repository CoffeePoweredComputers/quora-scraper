            "answer_text": "The velocity of shockwaves is a non-linear effect, and varies as a function of several variables, some of which are the material properties of the medium in which the wave is propagating, and the others depend are the properties of the source. The theory of shockwaves is an extension of continuum mechanics beyond the elastic regime. The elastic regime is characterized by small and slow perturbations to an otherwise static system. Recall Hooke\u2019s law: F = - k x. Hooke\u2019s law is the lowest order contribution in a power series. Consider the example of a spring, which is the canonical example of a linear restoring force (i.e. Hookean behavior). Assuming the spring is built out of some infinitely strong material, the restoring force should grow indefinitely as the spring is extended to its maximum (finite) length, which is clearly not characterized by the linear -k x description. This example shows how materials will generally exhibit non-Hookean behavior in the large-displacement regime. This example demonstrates one of the many confounding factors that make a simple characterization of the velocity of shockwaves impossible. However, as shockwaves propagate away from a (finite) source, their amplitude will, in general, decay because of geometric attenuation. After some finite time, these waves will become small enough that we can treat them to a good approximation by Hooke\u2019s law. Formally, we do not call these waves \u201cshock waves,\u201d as they are well-described by linear elasticity: we call them \u201cacoustic waves.\u201d In this case, a good characterization of velocity is possible based only on the local material properties of the Earth, which, over large enough distances, only depend on the radius from the Earth\u2019s center. These velocities are well described in the \u201cPreliminary Reference Earth Model.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There are 2 types of waves that emerge from earthquakes: Body waves and surface waves. Body waves are faster and in turn are of two types: P & S waves. Earthquakes do not occur below 700km inside Earth, and most of them occur in the top 200km inside Earth. Here, P-waves are the fastest, and travel at around 7-8 km/s. S-waves travel at around 3-4 km/s. But the more disastrous surface waves travel even slower than S-waves.   ",

The primary waves are the first waves to arrive at a location. They tend to travel at 8 kilometers a second, or well over 26,000 kilometers per hour. The secondary waves can travel at nearly 5 kilometers per second, or 18,000 kilometers per hour. Lancaster quake - how fast do seismic waves travel? ",

So I\u2019ll assume you instead mean compressional or P wave, the fastest of normal (linear) seismic waves. Compressional waves in the Earth\u2019s crust travel 2 to 6 km/sec, with velocity generally increasing with depth. In water, 1.5 km/s, and in air, about 0.3 km/s. Most of the seismic wave energy, however, is in the slower shear waves and sometimes surface waves, which are mostly shear energy. ",

Different waves have different wave speeds in different materials. Typically in earth crust, the compressional waves propagate with 6.0 km/s, they become faster in earth mantle. Shear waves are slower than compressional waves. Surface waves are even slower and their speeds depend on their periods, in another words, they are dispersive. ",
