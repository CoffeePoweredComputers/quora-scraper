            "answer_text": "Of course. If you mean \"throughout history\", I'd dare say that most of the famous scientists you can name were Christians. Isaac Newton is one of the greatest scientists of all time, many say THE greatest scientist of all time. He invented calculus, formulated the Laws of Motion and the Theory of Gravity, invented the refracting telescope, and made important contributions to astronomy, they physics of light, and other fields. He was also a Bible-believing Christian who wrote books defending the Bible from atheist attacks in his day, most notably, \"History of the Ancient Kingdoms\", and a commentary on the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation. Louis Pasteur was a Christian who spent most of his career refuting the evolutionary theories of his day. Roger Bacon was the first person to clearly describe the \"scientific method\", i.e. the idea of formulating a hypothesis and then constructing an experiment to test it. In the same book where he presented this, he also called for a number of reforms to education, including more teaching of math and science ... and more teaching of the Bible, especially study of the Bible in the original languages. Johann Kepler said that the job of a scientist was to \"think God's thoughts after him\". Etc. It's hard to judge more recent scientists because we don't have historical perspective to evaluate their work. That said, names that come to mind: Werner von Braun headed the US space program and was in charge of the project that ultimately led to the first moon landing. He was a Bible-believing Christian. Raymond Damadian invented the MRI. Another Christian. Arthur Eddington. Made contributions to theory of relativity. \"Eddington Limit\" on the luminosity of stars is named after him. John Fleming. Contributions to electronics. Discovered the \"right hand rule\" which describes how electricity flowing through a wire generates a magnetic field. Max Born. Quantum physics and nature of the atom. Werner Heisenberg. Formulated the \"Heisenberg Indeterminancy Principle\", a foundation of quantum physics. Ernest Walton. First person to split an atom. Joseph Murray. Pioneered transplant surgery. (If you consider medical research to be a \"science\".) Well, there are hundreds of them. I could go on and on. ",

            "answer_text": "Are there any reputable Christian scientists who have made significant contributions to their fields of study? This is a joke question, right? There would be no modern science if it weren\u2019t for the Catholic Church! 5 Of The Most Influential Catholic Scientists You Didn\u2019t Know 1. Roger Bacon (1219-1294) The \u201cGrandfather\u201d of the Scientific Method He was an English Franciscan and a highly regarded academic both in his times as well as historically. Pope Clement IV asked Bacon for his recommendations on improving ecclesiastical studies, and the result was Bacon\u2019s Opus Maius, Opus Minus, and Opus Tertiae. Experience and experimentation were keys to the study of science and theology. This might seem obvious to us, since we were taught some variant of the basic scientific method in elementary school: hypothesis, prediction, testing, analysis. This idea didn\u2019t originate with Roger Bacon, but he advanced it so much so to be \u201cconsidered to be a forerunner of the modern scientific method\u201d (Woods, Jr., How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization, p. 94). He put mathematics as the basis for understanding the natural sciences, enabling him to correctly calculate the calendar and make advances in the study of light/optics. Future scientists used Bacon\u2019s work as a foundation, and no scientist works today without at least some variant of the scientific method. Although he was considered centuries ahead of his time, Bacon didn\u2019t get everything right; he was imprisoned for one of his works. Nevertheless, we can learn from his example and humility: he obediently accepted the orders of his superior when he was told to stop publishing. And, to answer questions on his orthodoxy, he wrote another work, De nullitate magiae, to set the record straight. In the life of Roger Bacon, science, faith, obedience, and academic endeavors were not mutually exclusive. 2. Fr. Roger Boscovich, S.J. (1711-1787) Advancing Geometrical Measurements in Astronomy Imagine finishing a college degree, and upon graduation, being offered a job as a professor. This is what happened to Fr. Boscovich\u2014such was his genius. Boscovisch studied many fields: atomic theory, optics, math, physics, architecture, and astronomy. Before being ordained a priest in the Society of Jesus, he published eight scientific dissertations in the field of astronomy and used geometry to calculate a planet\u2019s orbit. A crater on the moon is named after him! Fr. Boscovich quickly caught the eye of Pope Benedict XIV, himself a scholar. The pope summoned Fr. Boscovich to Rome and tasked him with fixing the cracked dome of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. His theory worked, preventing any further damage to the dome. Fr. Boscovich\u2019s Theory of Natural Philosophy was a landmark work in his day, and continued to be admired in subsequent centuries. Added onto that impressive list of accomplishments is a book of poetry on the Blessed Virgin Mary. As a whole, he was an incredibly learned man who stayed true to the Catholic faith and let it inform his scholastic endeavors. \u201cHis scientific work was not merely technical, but set into a larger human context, and located within a faith tradition.\u201d From Fr. Boscovich, we can learn that our faith can\u2014and should\u2014be the foundational principle of everything that we do. 3. Fr. Georges Lemaitre, S.J. (1894-1966) The Father of the Big Bang Theory Like the scientific method, the Big Bang Theory is so widely known and accepted that we forget its significance. In the early 1930s, a Belgian Jesuit gave the best answer to date on how the universe came into being. Fr. Lemaitre was a contemporary of Albert Einstein, and had the opportunity to collaborate with him. His groundbreaking theory was that \u201cthe universe expanded from an initial point, which he called the \u2018Primeval Atom,\u2019\u201d which ran contrary to the prevailing theory, that the universe was in a steady state. His theories were published in the early 1930s and met with skepticism. In spite of that, his theory changed the course of scientific thought. The modern-day Big Bang Theory differs from Lemaitre\u2019s original, but it rests entirely on his work. Pope Pius XII celebrated Fr. Lemaitre\u2019s discovery, claiming it to be scientific proof of the truth of the Catholic faith. Secular physicists are quick to point out Fr. Lemaitre\u2019s discomfort at the pope\u2019s excitement, as well as the following quote from Fr. Lemaitre: \u201cAs far as I can see, such a theory remains entirely outside any metaphysical or religious question. It leaves the materialist free to deny any transcendental Being\u2026 For the believer, it removes any attempt at familiarity with God\u2026It is consonant with Isaiah speaking of the hidden God, hidden even in the beginning of the universe.\u201d Fr. Lemaitre\u2019s reasons for that involved different factors, but none of them involved scorn for religion or an incompatibility of faith and reason. On the contrary, Lemaitre didn\u2019t see a conflict between faith and reason. He lived out his life as a priest, continuing his research until his death. 4. Dr. Thomas Hilgers Enriching Marriages through Science The Catholic Church has always stood against artificial contraception (see Humanae Vitae), and the firestorm that resulted from Humanae Vitae was largely characterized by dissent and negativity. Lost in the maelstrom was an incredibly positive development: the Creighton Model Fertility Care System, created by Dr. Hilgers and his associates in 1968, completely in line with Catholic teaching. Dr. Hilgers founded the Pope Paul VI Institute for the Study of Human Reproduction where physicians, surgeons, and nurses have studied and developed this method into NaPro Technology. It is a far cry from the \u201crhythm method,\u201d and far more precise\u2014tracking observable signs in a women\u2019s body to determine times of greater and lesser fertility. It \u201cworks cooperatively with the procreative and gynecologic systems. When these systems function abnormally, NaPro Technology identifies the problems and cooperates with the menstrual and fertility cycles that correct the condition, maintain the human ecology, and sustain the procreative potential.\u201d NaPro is more effective, more personalized, and more treatment-based than artificial contraception. The advancement of NaPro Technology in matters of infertility have resulted in many babies, including my own son, one niece, and two nephews, thanks be to God! Both the NaPro doctor and surgeon that we worked with had bulletin boards crammed with baby announcements. A blessing for families, the Church, and the world! Dr. Hilgers\u2019 perspective is something our culture could learn a lot from: fertility is not a disease, something to be avoided at all costs. In addition, it\u2019s a practical and pastoral application of St. John Paul II\u2019s Theology of the Body. By using NaPro, a married couple can live out Jesus\u2019 vision of self-giving love: free, total, faithful, and fruitful. 5. Fr. Robert Spitzer, S.J. (b. 1952) Physicist & Apologist In an age where secular relativism reigns, the Catholic faith needs good apologists to defend her in the public square. Fr. Spitzer holds a doctorate in philosophy and many, many other degrees. Why has this particular scientist been influential? He upholds the Jesuit priest-scientist tradition; showing that the arenas of faith and reason are not opposed to each other. And, during his time as a professor at three Jesuit universities, he had the opportunity to provide a solid, Catholic approach to reason. Finally, he has engaged in the public debate on the topic of faith and reason. In 2010 he participated in a CNN panel discussion on that very topic, alongside prominent atheist-scientists. (15) That same year, he published a book entitled New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of Contemporary Physics and Philosophy\u2014a work of science, not theology. He also founded the Magis Center of Reason & Faith. I heard Fr. Spitzer speak years ago, and what I noticed most was his awe. His talks delved into physics and philosophy and tied each back to theology. The cosmological details of the universe are the handwriting of God, fashioning a world for us. The meaning of those details points to a Love far beyond numbers and equations. With Fr. Spitzer\u2019s considerable knowledge in physics and philosophy, all the doctoral level studies, books, and articles he published, he didn\u2019t lose his awe for the Creator of everything that he studied. The secular argument that the Catholic Church is at odds with science is simply false. The history of the Church and her members attest to that\u2014Bacon, Boscovich, Lemaitre, Hilgers, Spitzer, and countless others. \u201cMethodical research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with the faith, because the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same God.\u201d Faith and science have a symbiotic relationship, not an adversarial one. Faith enriches scientific endeavors, and scientific discoveries \u201cinvite us to even greater admiration for the greatness of the Creator, prompting us to give him thanks for all his works and for the understanding and wisdom he gives to scholars and researchers.\u201d 11 Amazing Catholic Scientists You Should Know 1. Copernicus (1473\u20131543)  Remember Copernicus?! The Catholic priest who practiced medicine and then went into astronomy developing heliocentrism. He discovered that the earth is not the center of the universe, not even of this solar system. He is believed to have entered the priesthood later in life. His contributions to astronomy revolutionized the field and the world. 2. Albertus Magnus, O.P. (before 1200 \u2013 1280)  What\u2019s a list of major intellectual achievements without a Dominican or two on the list?! Fr. Albertus Magnus is the patron saint of the natural sciences and a Doctor of the Church because of his great work in in physics, logic, metaphysics, biology, and psychology. 3. Georges Lema\u00eetre (1894\u20131966)  Fr. Lemaitre with his colleague, Albert Einstein. Belgian priest and father of the Big Bang Theory. Fr. Lemaitre was a contemporary of, and based his work on Einstein\u2019s Theory of General Relativity. Lemaitre also spent time serving as the Director of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. 4. Gregor Mendel (1822-1884)  Gregor Mendel was an Augustinian Friar who was the founder of the modern science of genetics. Yep! The study of genetics was started by a Catholic priest. If you have taken a science class and had to learn the terms \u201crecessive\u201d and \u201cdominant\u201d it is thanks to Fr. Mendel. 5. Giuseppe Mercalli (1850\u20131914)  Priest, volcanologist, and director of the Vesuvius Observatory who is best remembered today for his Mercalli scale for measuring earthquakes which is still in use. Yes, the scientific inquiry of Catholics knows no bounds, even volcanoes and earthquakes have been studied. 6. William of Ockham (c. 1288 \u2013 c. 1348)  Have you heard of Ockham\u2019s Razor? He is the Franciscan Scholastic who wrote significant works on logic, physics, and theology; known for Ockham\u2019s Razor. Yet, another Catholic priest\u2019s whose work had a huge impact on the natural sciences. 7. Giovanni Battista Riccioli (1598\u20131671)  Jesuit astronomer who authored Almagestum novum, an influential encyclopedia of astronomy. He was the first person to measure the rate of acceleration of a freely falling body; created a selenograph with Father Grimaldi who now adorns the entrance at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. Catholic priests remembered at the Smithsonian! 8. Francesco Maria Grimaldi (1618 \u2013 1663)  There are a lot of Jesuit priest-scientists! Fr. Grimaldi was an Italian Jesuit priest, mathematician and physicist who taught at the Jesuit college in Bologna. A crater on the moon is named Grimaldi after him. 9. Nicolas Steno (1638-1686)  Nicholas Steno made great strides in anatomy and geology. He eventually became a Catholic Bishop. Various parts of the body are named after him: Stensen\u2019s duct, Stensen\u2019s gland, Stensen\u2019s vein, and Stensen\u2019s foramina. He is also the founder of the study of fossils. 10. George V. Coyne, S.J. (born January 19, 1933)  George Coyne, S.J.wiki image  Mount Graham International Observatory (MGIO) is one of the observatories used for the Vatican\u2019s scientific inquiries. How about somebody current? Fr. Coyne is a Jesuit priest, astronomer, and former director of the Vatican Observatory and head of the observatory\u2019s research group which is based at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. Since January 2012, he has served as McDevitt Chair of Religious Philosophy at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, NY. 11. Fr. Stanley Jaki (1914-2009)  Stanley Jaki, O.S.Bwiki images Fr. Jaki was a Hungarian Benedictine priest and Distinguished Professor of Physics at Seton Hall University, New Jersey. He most notably taught that science developed out of Christianity and he bridged the divide in the manufactured division between science and faith. You can read about his teaching in the book Science Was Born of Christianity by Stacy Trasancos. One of the best ways to become more acquainted with the Catholic Church\u2019s position on science and faith, is to read the encyclical Humani Generis as well as Fides et Ratio. The next time someone accuses the Church of being anti-science, be sure to share the great scientific advances that have occurred throughout history thanks to Catholic scientists, including a great many who were priests.

I have known engineers who were IBM employees who were life long Christians, and took leadership roles in their church. I play in a music group founded by men who played during their lunch hour while working as scientists for GE labs. They were also churchgoers. It's good to remember that today the vast majority are believers in my country. You might not like it, but it is what it is. Atheists celebrate their astonishing growth, but they are still a tiny minority, their rapid growth notwithstanding. Will they grow to a significant level in the future, or will they just fizzle out and gradually return to their barely significant five percent status? You may believe what you want, but obviously we shall have to wait and see. Faith has a track record of going up and down again and again over the decades. How discouraging it can be to learn from history that what we are seeing today has happened many times before, and, one can assume, will happen again in the future. Believe it or not. ",
