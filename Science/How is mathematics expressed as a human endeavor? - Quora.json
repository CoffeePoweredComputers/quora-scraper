            "answer_text": "I am not sure what the question really means. But maths is an arts subject. It can be applied but it is mostly studied for its own sake. Why this may not be appreciated is that there were many occasions in the past where a type of maths was created to solve a particular world problem, usually involving money, power, war sponsored by the aristocracy. But once started a branch of mathematics would take on a life of its own and studied how far it could be taken independently of any real world considerations. Although much of the maths developed in the past and still of relevance to-day was studied out of curiosity. Research mathematicians and many who use maths in their jobs, e.g. software engineers, make substantial use of the creative parts of their brains. It is not all about cognitive reasoning, indeed this may, in fact, not be the most important part. ",
