            "answer_text": "Naming of all living beings Scientifically is highly essential due to the following reasons: Every recognized species on earth (at least in theory) is given a two-part scientific name. This system is called \"binomial nomenclature.\" These names are important because they allow people throughout the world to communicate unambiguously about animal species. Scientific names are used to describe various species of organisms in a way that is universal so that scientists around the globe can readily identify the same animal. This is called binomial nomenclature, and many of the scientific names are derived from the Latin name of the organism. The scientific name or the binomial nomenclature has a number of advantages over using the common names. Organise and classify - the organism can be easily categorised, this really helps making it easier to understand the characteristics of a specific organism in an organised chart. ",

This science has to cover all the insects so far identified, otherwise it will not be complete. Scientific names are given for identification purpose. Classification of insects is done under Taxonomy. ",
