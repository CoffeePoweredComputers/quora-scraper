            "answer_text": "Wow! I have to say that is a pretty biased assumption. Plus what a nit picky generalization. Why do all Biden supporters ask inconsequential questions that really do not matter in the big scheme of things? There are a lot of people who do not always wear masks and social distance. Several Democrats as well as Republicans have been seen without masks. There is controversy between the experts about what exactly is safe or unsafe with COVID. Individuals are responsible for their own health and safety. If wearing masks is effective in preventing the virus, then by all means wear one if you feel safer. However, the best way to stop spread of the virus is to stay home if you are sick. The CDC has already proven that Lockdowns are not effective, they are detrimental to our health and economy as well. Besides, it is just like vaccines. Some people do not believe in them. No reason for those who get vaccinated to get angry because if the vaccine works, they will not get sick. The unvaccinated person might but that is a chance they took, just like the chance we take every morning when we wake up and hit the road to drive to work. People die in car accidents at a greater rate than from viruses. We don\u2019t stop driving do we? If masks keep you from getting sick, then wear them in good health. Do not worry about others and their freedom to choose. You will not get sick, so\u2026.trying to control others and tell them what they can and cannot do goes against our very foundation of Liberty. I only wish the same people who are infuriated over masks had the same concern for the destruction going on now for over 4 months by ANTIFA and BLM in major cities all over the USA. I guess destroying people\u2019s homes, businesses, lives and livelihoods is not as important as Trump supporters wearing masks. Think of all the senseless murders of innocent people that have occurred due to this rampant destruction by Self-proclaimed trained Marxists as they attempt to take over our country through bullying and intimidation.

            "answer_text": "Why do things never change? They don\u2019t because instead of addressing the reasons people are not wearing masks and social distancing people make it about politics. Just look at the ignorant answers on here blaming Trump for people not wearing masks or social distancing. I saw dozens of people not wearing masks who were under 45, black, white, Hispanic, some older people, some walked into Walmart and then when they got passed the lady at the front door took them off. My neighbors hate trump, are in their late 30\u2019s and think masks are a waste of time. She told me straight out they are a waste of time and a placebo to make the masses think they are protected when they are not. How about the fact that many young people don\u2019t masks because they feel even if they get sick it won\u2019t adversely affect them. How about those who don\u2019t think the masks work to keep them from getting covid so they refuse to wear them as it makes them uncomfortable. Others believe that Covid is not worse than the flu and that they do not wish to be inconvenienced. Some believe that only the elderly and the sickly need to stay home and hide so the rest of us can go about out lives unhindered. Still others have had Covid and believe they can not get it again so wearing a mask is useless. People see others not wearing masks and think what use is it for me to wear one if everyone isn\u2019t wearing it. There are dozens of excuses and none of them involve politics. Should we wear masks and social distance. Of course we should. You want to get others to do this then stop making it about politics and start addressing the reasons people don\u2019t wear them. ",
