            "answer_text": "Well it's the ques which gives u real importance of mathematics a language of science which made of logic . So here I suppose if u are 10th or 12th class student follow these steps to get the ans on ur own calculations :\u20141st write formulae of coulomb law ;charge=Ze &e2nd write formulae of centripetal force =mv^2/r^2 : note here ^This sign is for power e.g. 2^2=4, 3^2=93rd now where this centripetal and coulomb FORCE work why they exist for This mathematically equal equation 1 and 24th now at atomic level u must know that every rotating particle must follow(unielectron model ) BOHR 2nd POSTULATE:- conservation of angular momentum and quantization of energy levelNow u got combined equation of 1 and 2 then solve it with equation u got from 4th stepNow u must find the velocity of electron then find radiusLast step = again use quolomb law for potential energy and for kinetic energy 1/2\u00d7mv^2. U must have value of v(velocity) and r(radius).For total energy add potential energy and kinetic energy. Now just put n=4 if u want to get energy in eV just divide ur ans from charge on electron.I write so much because I believe u would solve it if u cannot just find it from ur textbook .",
