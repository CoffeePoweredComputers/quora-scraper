            "answer_text": "We are closer than you would think. In scientific research, the cumulative works of the past forms the basis for all future scientific understanding. The scientists, of today, stand on the backs of giants, so to speak. Hopefully, no major errors were made for this model to work. However, some were. It is understood that exploring \u201ctotally new ground\u201d can involve the risk of offending the orthodoxy. Challenge to the old ways (of thinking) is especially essential to progress in the life extension field. Early on, I found errors in classification of an amino acid as non-essential. It is now classified as conditionally essential. This makes a big difference. Nutrition has been dismissed, off hand, as a cause for aging. However, MacGregor and Ames demonstrated how a vitamin deficiency could cause genetic problems after folic acid was accidentally left out of the nutrient mix for lab mice. Since then, I\u2019ve discovered so many additional nutrition related faults that I started a new branch of study: Microbolics. Microbolics is the study of bacterial metabolism in relation to the host human metabolism. Summary of the Biological Basis of Adult Wellness: All mammals make use of bacteria. We cannot live long without them. They help us to digest our food and provide many chemical intermediates that we cannot produce for ourselves. The interaction is codified in our genes. The human genome contains 25,000 genes. This is about half of the number of genes that would be needed if mammalian genes were to produce all of the enzymes and chemical intermediates used within the body. Human breast milk contains about 10% oligosaccharides. Human infants cannot digest these complex sugars. They are present in breast milk because they are targeted to feed the new bacteria colonizing the gut of the infant. If ten percent of nutrition is devoted to bacteria we can estimate that 10% of total body cells is the beginning figure for a human body\u2019s corporate working composition of bacteria. Over time, this ten percent climbs until ninety percent (or more) of the cells comprising the human body may not be mammalian. Logically, somewhere between birth and death there must be a tipping-point where the bacterial cells require more nutrition than the mammalian cells. Specific nutrition diverted to bacterial cells, therefore, means a lack of nutrition to mammalian cells. How this process could work was unclear in orthodox teachings. Since orthodox science has done little work on the purpose of the human lymph system. It was left to discover that the purpose of the lymph system is to deliver (mostly nutrient based) components in a form ready to be used to build structure and peptides. In the course of this process, amino acids \u2026could be stolen from structure to provide for immediate need elsewhere. Could this be the process that ultimately results in debility? I believe it is. It appears we begin life as home to no bacteria and end life as a home to a lot of them. Is direction of specific nutrition directly to the mammalian cells and bypassing bacterial cells the right track to solve aging? I think it is. ",

            "answer_text": "Our maximum lifespan is programmed into our genes. And we have never actively changed our genes, so we have not increased this lifespan. But this moment is coming soon. The idea of genetically improving our children is catching up:UK takes step toward 'three-parent babies' It will initially be used to fix severe genetic disorder, but once people become more comfortable with this idea, the other changes will follow. And it is not very hard to increase maximum lifespan that way. Sometimes knockout of a single gene is enough:Single gene change increases mouse lifespan by 20 percent But the problem is will take over a century to test if such treatments works on humans. Even if first genetically enhanced children will be born in this decade, it will reach age 120 in the XXII century. It is more probable that other means of life extension will become more popular sooner, but for the next 100 years or so we will remain unsure how effective they are. ",
