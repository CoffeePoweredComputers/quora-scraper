            "answer_text": "One of the best things to repel and control any type of crawly infestation in your home (ants, mites, cockroaches, fleas etc) is a product called Diatomaceous Earth. It's essentially fossil-powder, for lack of a better word. Not only does it dehydrate small creepy critters (literally by absorbing a majority of the oil from the insect\u2019s body), the particles are so small that they're abrasive even to the smallest of insects (like mites) which will speed up the process of drying them out by damaging their hard exoskeletons, allowing the absorbent qualities to work better. Also, Peppermint Oil and Cinnamon Oil are good for repelling most ant species, but won't kill them (unless you douse them in it and they drown lol). ",
