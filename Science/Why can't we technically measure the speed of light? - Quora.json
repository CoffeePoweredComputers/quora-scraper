            "answer_text": "Hmm.. We can, but instead we chose to measure the meter. It used t o be true that we: Defined a \u201cmeter\u201d and measured length by directly comparing a chosen object\u2019s length to a standard reference object length, and we defined a \u201csecond\u201d of time with a comparison to a reference atomic clock.To observe the speed of light, we would most likely measure distance and time, then divide. Note that these are measurements of fundamental quantities, and the result is a calculation. So what we really always did was \u201ccalculate\u201d the speed of light.Note that in step 2 we have three quantities: distance, time, and speed. Two of them are measured by comparison to primary standards. For length, we had to physically build/grow a man made object and declare: \u201cThis bar (or King\u2019s leg, or standing wave in a laser) shall henceforth be known to be the true meter in length.\u201d Now, we have simply chosen the speed of light as a second primary standard while keeping our standard for time. There are three variables still involved, and we switched the roles. If you like, you can now do an experiment where you \u201cmeasure\u201d (calculate actually) how long is a meter. The meter sort of gets demoted in it\u2019s role because it is now calculated from speed and time. Since the speed of light is accepted as a fundamental constant this should give a more reliable standard for length than the laser we built, or the King\u2019s leg. We are keeping time as a primary quantity because we trust that atoms (possibly cesium) oscillate very reliably. So now you choose: Which one do you want to measure? The speed of light or the meter? If you choose the speed of light you must use a meter stick built based on the older standards. If you use one built based on the new standard, then you are using circular logic to get your experimental results. Even worse, you are not defining the meter the same way I do. Uh oh we are still using those old meter sticks in physics lab every week! ",

            "answer_text": "Before 1983, it was perfectly possible to measure the speed of light. It was measured countless times in hundreds of different ways, with varying degrees of accuracy. There was no technical reason it could not be measured. All you had to do was set up a precisely measured distance and precisely measure the time. The more precise your measurements, the better your answer. That all changed in 1983, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) redefined the meter as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of [math]\\frac {1}{299 792 458}[/math] of a second. That effectively defined the speed of light as 299 792 458 m/s, exactly\u2014a defined constant. Now, you can say that although it is defined as a constant, it might be a little pointless to measure it any more, but hey, it couldn\u2019t hurt to check it once in a while, right? Wrong. It is not only pointless to measure, but it has also become impossible to measure. How would you measure it? You can\u2019t do it the old way, by a precisely measured distance and a precisely measured time. Because if you get any answer other than 299 792 458 m/s you have not measured the speed of light, you have proven that you didn\u2019t precisely measure the length of the path, or that you didn\u2019t precisely measure the time. The only possible right answer is 299 792 458 m/s. ",
