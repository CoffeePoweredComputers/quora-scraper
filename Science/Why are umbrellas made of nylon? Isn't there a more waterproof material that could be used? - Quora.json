            "answer_text": "Good one. Nylon or any plastic for that matter is not permeable when they are of full construction. For example your plastic glass, hard hats etc. But an umbrella is not made from solid plastic sheet (extruded sheet like your shopping bags). Umbrellas are made from fabric. Almost always woven fabric. Any woven fabric has pores in the weave through which water seeps through. To protect from water seepage they provide a fine layer of coating on the umbrella fabric, most often a PolyUrethane (PU) coating. This layer acts as waterproofing. Nylon is light in weight, can withstand sunlight exposure etc, is a cheaper and more flexible yarn and abundantly available. Hence nylon is popularly used. There are other materials too however. ",
