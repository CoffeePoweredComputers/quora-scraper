            "answer_text": "There is an atmosphere with some density and a pressure to help maintain it liquid. The average temperature of the total ocean is nearly constant and relatively warm except for very deep water and some ocean currents. These currents help distribute heat around our planet. The ocean is constantly replenished by rain and snow melt. We have seasons due to the tilt of our earth. The moon is responsible for many things on this earth some of which indirectly affect our water. There is weather and a constant (so far) water cycle from ocean to clouds to precipitation. Generally we have a temperate climate over most of the earth. Water is a bit different than many solids when it is in an ice form. It expands therefore ice floats. If it didn\u2019t, ice would sink to the bottom stay as ice for a longer time. The earth would soon be covered in ice. We have an electromagnetic shield caused by (perhaps) our liquid core swirling (also causing tectonic plates to move). This shield keeps the solar wind from blowing away water over a long period of time. Perhaps this is what happened to Mars\u2019 water. Tectonic subduction causes the earth to be alive geologically and volcanic. Most of the gas that comes from volcanoes is water to be added to all the other water. We have the right mixture of gasses in our upper atmosphere - for now. Carbon dioxide and methane are slowly but surely changing how our earth will be within a hundred years or so. We have a warm sun about the right distance away from us. You should watch Earth From Space a DVD by NOVA as you drop a few ice cubes into your drink. ",
