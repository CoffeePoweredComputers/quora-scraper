            "answer_text": "Because we are not cows! We may seem to think , and behave like cows sometimes, but that\u2019s a mental thing, not a digestive one. The human digestive system has lots of enzymes, and acids to break down and assimilate all kinds of different foods, but we do not have the enzymes needed to break down cellulose. Cows, Goats, Sheep and other animals that graze on many organic foods do have the enzymes needed to break down cellulose. However, food with cellulose in them is quite healthy and important in your diet. This is why it\u2019s good to eat high fiber foods. While the enzymes we do have in our bodies are turning the other food into nutrients, the fiber provides the bulk that the leftover foods need to keep on moving through your system. I keep a carton of psyllium husks in my supplements cabinet, and add a teaspoon or two into my frequent smoothies, because many times the juices, ice, and \u201cmilk\u201d do not have fiber, and my systems needs the fiber. The fiber provides the bulk that makes you feel full faster, and then moves more quickly through your digestive system eliminating and sweeping the waste out of your small intestines and colon. If you are pursuing a very high protein diet, I would recommend that you do add some very high fiber carbohydrates, because they don\u2019t add many calories or sugars, but do keep you from ending up with sometimes brutal constipation.

            "answer_text": "Digestion has lots of components. Amylase sin saliva start breaking down certain types of polysaccharides, then food goes to the stomach where it is mixed with peptidases and acid. From there, the acidic slurry passes out of the stomach and is mixed with alkaline bile salts and surfactants/emulsifiers that aid in absorption of fats. From there, bacterial flora in the gut get a chance to break down what they can. Cellulose, like most plastics, is simply very stable and resistant to acid (except at high heat). The enzymes we produce for digestion don't do anything to it, nor does anything in bile. If it were not for the bacteria in our gut, cellulose would be just as inert to the human GI tract as Teflon. However, there are a variety of bacteria in the gut with cellulase, an enzyme that can break down cellulose. Because of the way cellulose forms packed clusters of rigid fibers, it's actually very difficult for enzymes to access and break down. In the human gut, bacteria do break it down (into glucose), but the process is slow enough that most cellulose just passes through the GI tract unchanged -- what we call \"dietary fiber\". Herbivores address this problem by having much longer digestive tracts, sometimes with multiple compartments, filled with cellulose-digesting bacteria which allow for the cellulose to be broken down over a longer period of time fermenting in the gut. Insects also generally rely on microorganisms to breakdown cellulose on their behalf. ",
