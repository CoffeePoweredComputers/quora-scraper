            "answer_text": "So I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about francium chloride with a formula of FrCl. While this compound does make sense theoretically, it physically cannot exist. First of all, francium is extremely volatile, any contact with water will make it explode. However, chances are, a piece of francium won\u2019t even be able to make it to water before it splits into different elements! Its half life is approximately 20 minutes and that\u2019s for its most STABLE isotope! This means that even if a compound did form, it would be extremely short lived and would probably only exist in a laboratory and for a very short period of time. To recap, francium is quite rare. It is short-lived because of its unstable nucleus. And even if it did make a compound of FrCl, it would be extremely short-lived and low in number. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is, an absence of Fr. There is no r4eason why you could make a chloride if you had some francium, but you would not keep it very long because of its radioactivity. You would make it in solution, and the chances are it would be all gone before you could crystallise it. The element has a half-life of 22 minutes, and it has been claimed there is less than an ounce of it in the crust of the earth, so get separating. The more stable isotope is a decay product of actinium, so t is continually being made and decaying. ",
