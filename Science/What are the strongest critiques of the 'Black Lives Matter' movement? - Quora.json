            "answer_text": "The Lies. If you are black, the odds of you being shot by a police officer are unbelievably small. You are significantly more likely to be killed by a black criminal. Yet when cops shoot said black criminals, the riots ensue. And if you present said rioters (who the left claim are protesters) with evidence that the criminal they\u2019re rioting over was a criminal, it goes from \u201cJustice for X\u201d to \u201cthis ain\u2019t about one man. It\u2019s a movement!\u201d. In other words, the members are convinced they can do no wrong, even if a specific protest is based on a false narrativeThey are violent. They just are. Not blacks. Not all BLM protesters. But after watching the protests here\u2019s how they tend to go. The start of the protest is multi ethnic and multi generational. From young white millennials to black pensioners, local congressmen, students, workers, etc. Then as the night goes on, the crowd transforms to almost exclusively under 30 year old blacks and only blacks. Then the crowd changes from \u201cno justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cblack lives matter\u201d to \u201cburn that shit down!\u201d and \u201cyo they beating up all the white people!\u201d.The fact that the protests are blatantly anti police, yet because it comes in the wake of a shooting, you get shut down if you say so. A friend of mine (a black friend) used to be in BLM. Used to go on the protests after killings and call for body cameras and trials\u2026which she still does. But she got scared. Why? Because if you hung around long enough, you\u2019d see the crowd transformation I talked about in point 2. Black youths (usually unemployed) start to show up. They bring switchblades, pocket knives, the makings of a Molotov cocktail and the occasional gun. She didn\u2019t like that. She stuck around for one that saw riot police coming in during the riot to have bricks and such thrown at them, the occasional Molotov being thrown. Cars were being pushed on their side or vandalised, people were breaking into stores and stealing TVs, DVD players, Xboxes (no books obviously). How was this helping anything? This isn\u2019t about racial justice, it\u2019s about opportunism. \u201cWell, those people clearly aren\u2019t true black lives matter supporters\u201d you say. Yeah they are. Don\u2019t fool yourself, they absolutely are. They showed up for the protest but stuck around and looked to make a buck from the problems.Black Lives Matter attacking white people. Now, if I recall this particular \u201cprotest\u201d as liberals call it was started after a black police officer shot a black armed suspect as he pointed his gun at the officer. This is not a rarity for a BLM \u201cprotest\u201d. Chief Flynn after Nov. 6 police commission meeting This is a sane person providing a pretty good analysis of the whole \u201cblack injustice\u201d thing. I don\u2019t have the stats here but if I recall the breakdown of black killing victims are something like 90% blacks killed by blacks, 6% blacks killed by cops and 4% by whites, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m off there. That\u2019s a rough breakdown of it. What I want to know is how a group that calls itself Black Lives Matter has chosen to focus on the 6% of black shooting victims of police rather than the 90% of blacks shot by other blacks. It seems to me that if black lives mattered, surely 90 black lives are more important than 6. This is not to say you should ignore those 6, but at least include the other 90! When asked, BLM give some weak response like \u201coh we\u2019ve protested inner city crime before\u201d. Yet they protest the people whose job it is to stop inner city crime. It\u2019s a messed up organisation/movement and this is without touching on the whole socialist policies their leaders advocate for ",

            "answer_text": "I have one critique of the black lives matter movement. It is in my view the only legitimate critic of the movement. If there was a \u201cwhite lives matter\u201d movement, or an \u201cAsian lives matter\u201d or \u201cfathers matter\u201d, or \u201c blah blah blah matters\u201d movement, it would still be the same objection I would have. I object to the assumptions that are implied in crying black lives matter: that Blacks are under a unique threat.People in general act as if black lives don't matter.My only critique of the black lives matter movement is that it is based on a false premise. Are black lives under a unique threat? The numbers indicate that blacks are victims of homicide more frequently than people from other races.  This data seems to justify the necessity of the black lives matter movement. Afterall, if there are more blacks killed than people of any other race, it means there is a problem. By that logic, a \u201cmale lives matter movement\u201d is justified. I doubt anyone would look at the data and believe there should be protests over the disparity in homicide victims between the sexes. Furthermore, most blacks who are homicide victims are killed by other blacks. Of the 2925 blacks murdered in 2018, 2600 (almost 90%) of them were committed by other blacks. The black lives matter movement not only avoids such discussions, but sees the mention of black on black crime as disingenuous, and a distraction from the main issue. Hence, despite the numbers indicating that the major threat to black lives comes from other blacks, the movement focuses on the 10% of cases when a black is killed by people of other races. The movement seems to be a black lives matter when taken by other races movement. Even if you think the major issue is inter racial killings. You'll expect, given the data that there would be a \u201cwhite lives matter\u201d or \u201cLatino lives matter\u201d movement. The number of whites killed by blacks (514) is more than double the number of blacks killed by whites (234). You can find the data for inter racial killings here. I do not believe the disparity in numbers is because whites are under a unique, racially motivated threat. However, the black lives matter movement is based on the assumption that that blacks are under a unique racially motivated threat. The data doesn't support that assumption. When you consider the rate of police killings of civilians, a disproportionate number of blacks are killed.   First, if the mere existence of a disparity justifies the need for a black lives matter movement, a \u201cmale lives matter\u201d movement is warranted too. It should be obvious that there are more variables than just race that need to be considered.  I don't think anyone would jump to the conclusion that because the police kills far more men than women, the killings are motivated by gender, yet there are many that jump to those kind of conclusions with regards to race. There are studies that indicate that there is no racial bias involved in a cop\u2019s decision to pull the trigger. At least four careful studies have done this\u2014one by Harvard economist Roland Fryer, one by a group of public-health researchers, one by economist Sendhil Mullainathan, and one by David Johnson, et al. Not only is the central claim of the black lives matter movement \u2014that racist cops target blacks \u2014false, the claim is usually extrapolated to other parts of society. Many in the black lives movement would not object to the claim that: cops target blacks, this shows that America is racist. The claim about racist cops isn't true, and the conclusion that the country is racist is not supported. Do people act as if black lives don't matter? I think its obvious that society at large doesn't act as if black lives don't matter. People are generally more outraged by the brutal death of a black man than for the death of a white man. There is more media coverage when a black person is killed. Its more likely that you can name more black people who have been killed by cops than white people who have been killed by cops. Most news outlet spend more time covering stories involving a cop killing an unarmed black person than they spend for an unarmed white person. This proves that the black lives matter movement is based on a false narrative, that people act as if black lives don't matter. Coleman Hughes gives some stories that drive home the point. Each story in this paragraph involves a police officer killing an unarmed white person. (To demonstrate how commonly this happens, I have taken all of them from a single year, 2015, chosen at random). Timothy Smith was killed by a police officer who mistakenly thought he was reaching into his waistband to grab a gun; the shooting was ruled justified. William Lemmon was killed after he allegedly failed to show his hands upon request; the shooting was ruled justified. Ryan Bolinger was shot dead by a cop who said he was moving strangely and walking toward her; the shooting was ruled justified. Derek Cruice was shot in the face after he opened the door for police officers serving a warrant for a drug arrest; the cops recovered marijuana from the property, and the shooting was ruled justified. Daniel Elrod robbed a dollar store, and, when confronted by police, allegedly failed to raise his hands upon request (though his widow, who witnessed the event, insists otherwise); he was shot dead. No criminal charges were filed. Ralph Willis was shot dead when officers mistakenly thought that he was reaching for a gun. David Cassick was shot twice in the back by a police officer while lying face down on the ground. Six-year-old Jeremy Mardis was killed by a police officer while sitting in the passenger seat of a car; the officer\u2019s intended target was Jeremy\u2019s father, who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat with his hands raised out the window. Autumn Steele was shot dead when a police officer, startled by her German shepherd, immediately fired his weapon at the animal, catching her in the crossfire. Shortly after he killed her, bodycam footage revealed the officer\u2019s despair: \u201cI\u2019m f------ going to prison,\u201d he says. The officer was not disciplined. For every black person killed by the police, there is at least one white person (usually many) killed in a similar way. The day before cops in Louisville barged into Breonna Taylor\u2019s home and killed her, cops barged into the home of a white man named Duncan Lemp, killed him, and wounded his girlfriend (who was sleeping beside him). Even George Floyd, whose death was particularly brutal, has a white counterpart: Tony Timpa. Timpa was killed in 2016 by a Dallas police officer who used his knee to pin Timpa to the ground (face down) for 13 minutes. In the video, you can hear Timpa whimpering and begging to be let go. After he lets out his final breaths, the officers begin cracking jokes about him. Criminal charges initially brought against them were later dropped. None of these victims led to protests. They received less media coverage and chances are you don't know most of there names. On the other hand, stories of blacks killed by police spark a lot of outrage. There is a lot of media coverage. Shirts are printed with the names of the victims. Conclusion There are many policies which would solve the policing problems to a large extent. Ending qualified immunity, demilitarizing the police, ending the war on drugs amongst others. There is no doubt that racism exists. However, the whole black lives movement is based on a series of untruths. ",

            "answer_text": "I am fascinated by the reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement, and after some discussions with very observant friends I\u2019ve realised something quite important about what\u2019s going on. BLM poses a challenge to the entire progressive narrative of our time. Firstly, BLM is an obviously valid movement. It began as a very simple public indication of racial persecution. There\u2019s no valid criticism of that. Black people have suffered injustice, continue to do so, and that ought to be appreciated and corrected. However, there is a sting in the tail\u2026 Black Lives Matter necessarily invokes identity politics, and this is where the modern social narrative begins to crumble under the weight of the BLM\u2019s claims on justice. Black people are defining themselves in contrast to other people and refusing to have that identity degraded. BLM says to white guys like me \u2018you are not us, you cannot be us, and you do not speak for us\u2019 - and they are right. But such claims are hardly acceptable in this day and age. Imagine if someone of exclusively Caucasian physical characteristics were to declare that they identified as black? Imagine what the reaction from the Black Community would be if someone decided they were going to live as a black person because that\u2019s who they are and any opposition to that is trans-racio-phobic? What\u2019s wrong with people of \u2018other races\u2019 becoming what they know themselves to be? How dare cis-racial communities be so exclusivist and ignorant such that they deny the fact that \u2018race\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 is entirely equivalent to \u2018sex\u2019 and \u2018gender\u2019? What is \u2018race\u2019? What is \u2018blackness\u2019? In what way do they differ from the chromosomal kaleidoscope and spectrum of human physical existence that we have already transcended and fluidly traverse in judgement-free power? Why should any person be saddled with their \u2018birth race\u2019, and refused recognition by those who just so happen to have the segregational social power to declare who is and who isn\u2019t something because they were apportioned certain physical phenotypes without any intention being involved? Hence, \u2018\u2018All lives matter\u201d, because the assertion that \u2018Black\u2019 lives are somehow different in a way that is exclusively defined and defended from ideological incursion is antithetical to the progress of western social norms and serves as a stark reminder that identity is something that is not merely an individual matter but a corporate one. \u2018\u2018All lives matter\u201d (whilst superficially serving as a self-evident and egalitarian statement) is ironically acting as a sort of silencer of black pride and the pain that is associated with it. Blackface is becoming illegal in a world where Drag is celebrated. The resilience and resistance of a community to the efforts of outsiders to force them to conform to conditions defined by that out-group is undermining all sorts of efforts by all sorts of other movements to dissolve boundaries and remove distinctions. Black Lives Matter is drawing lines of contrast that modern cosmopolitans have long been uncomfortable with. In a moment of righteous anger they have rebelled against something even bigger than race relations, and no mechanisms of amelioration exist that do not threaten the interests of others. Black Lives Matter has dared to say who is who and what is what. Black Lives Matter, in the name of equality and cohesion, has violated the new sacred code of non-resistance. Black Lives Matter have refused to let others take what belongs to them - their identity - and redefine it in a way that renders all lives equally individual and thereby homogeneous. Black Lives Matter has, in pursuit of justice, put a dark stain on the rainbow tapestry of today\u2019s progressive ideals. Oh, the irony. What shall we do, when \u2018they\u2019 are not \u2018us\u2019 and boundaries are being built rather than blurred?  Hence, blackness is what everything else determines it to be edit: in no way is this article intended to be \u2018x-phobic\u2019. It is making the point that the \u2018-phobic\u2019 terminology itself emerged from certain groups defining themselves exclusively. If anything, everyone is \u2018\u2018xenophobic\u201d, sheerly by virtue of the fact of conflict. People want people to have \u2018\u2018common sense\u201d, but we all want to decide what that is. As a friend of mine, one of the most tolerant and peacemaking people I know once said: \u201cI oppose only those who oppose others\u201d. Later I believe he saw the infinite irony of the statement.

If you\u2019re White, Native, Asian or Hispanic/Latino and you kill you a black person there will be outcry, riots, protests, mass media coverage, social media posts and great speeches from professional race baiters e.g. Maxine Waters, Don Lemon and Al Sharpton. In a nutshell, there will be a backlash. But where\u2019s that same anger and rage when a black person kills another black person? The silence from BLM whenever there\u2019s black-on-black crime is deafening. The same can be said for Planned Parenthood, black babies are aborted at rates higher than any other racial group. In fact, almost 20 million black babies have been killed since Roe v. Wade (1973), and black women make up only about 13% of the female population yet at the same time 35.6% of all abortions in the U.S. are performed on black women. So again, I ask \u2026 where is the noise from BLM activists?Black Abortions by the Numbers Poor role models = if you\u2019re against violence then fine but please don\u2019t use people like Linda Sarsour and Snoop Dogg as role models of your movement. This is the same Linda Sarsour who tweeted this not too long ago: \u2026 and this is the same Snoop Dogg who spent years glorifying crime and violence in the black community and only recently made a video of himself doing this:  Looking up to these sort of people means that your movement automatically loses all credibility. Internal racism = this also drives me up the wall with BLM. Their members are mostly black liberals and they have shown nothing but contempt towards black conservatives, who have been referred to as \u201ccoons\u201d, \u201cUncle Toms, \u201ccoconuts\u201d, \u201chouse negro\u201d, \u201csellout\u201d, the lot. Thomas Sowell, Ben Carson, Stacey Dash, Omarosa Manigault and Sheriff David Clarke are examples of people who have been treated with such vitriol. This is racism, period. The new feminism = I called it ages ago. BLM is the new feminism, it began with good intentions but the movement allowed itself to get hijacked by bigots and eventually become a hateful, divisive group. Going around saying things like \u201cWhat do we want? Dead cops! When do we want it? Now!\u201d threatening white people with violence and beating them up simply because they\u2019re white and coming up with asinine demands for white people like them giving up their homes for black people is doing little to further their cause.Poor tactics = Protesting and raising awareness on social media are good but will only take you so far, there has to be some sort of follow up after that \u2026 but it seems as though the BLM leaders don\u2019t have a Scooby\u2019s on what to do afterwards and more often than not, they go back to square one. A movement without any real tactics or strategies is doomed for failure.",

            "answer_text": "Hooooooh boy, I can already see the \u2018you\u2019re a racist\u2019 comments and BNBR violations coming by the truckload, but I\u2019ll bite. Just lemme grab something I posted elsewhere\u2026 Their protest do more often than not turn violent.There isn\u2019t data on how often violence happens with BLM. But at the biggest ones, Fergusson and Baltimore, things got really bad. At my college, people got assaulted for not participating or for disagreeing. Students got put on suspensions and had charges filed. I saw these people up close and they could not have left a worse impression. 2. BLM presents a false narrative. 90%+ of black homicide deaths are done by other blacks, and that\u2019s inlcuding all the unknown assailant races as nonblack. Out of the 5\u20136k/yr, black people who die by homicide, only about 400\u2013500 die by cop gunfire. Anticipating a busy year for cops and a slow year for homicides, the cop kill count barely cracks 10% at MOST. Where are the marches against the gangs and the hoodlums? Where are the demands to make that madness stop? Why aren\u2019t they crucifying gangstas in public opinion? Why aren\u2019t they DEMANDING crackdowns on those? 3. BLM uses terrorist playbook and methods. Cries of \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d don\u2019t help matters, because it sounds a lot like threats of violence and rioting \u2014 \u2018to hell with civilized society, give us what we want or blocks will burn\u2019, and more than once, they have. Terrorism can be defined as using fear to force political outcomes, then that is terrorism. 4. BLM deals horribly with allies In the way it treats the idea that all lives matter, well, according to Black Lives Matter, saying that is racist. Unironically. That is a splendid way to come off as stupid. I know exactly what they mean, that some people who are claiming all lives matter to take away from the distinctly black aspects of racialized violence in the USA, but a better handling would be \u201call lives, even black lives, have value\u201d instead of shouting down all who disagree or attempt to elaborate as racists. And in their manifesto, they seem to make a point of calling anything that isn\u2019t about them or in support of them as ultimately being white supremacy. Not even joking. That\u2019s the with or against fallacy at work, and it is scary what people do with that kind of thinking. When most people say all lives matter, it\u2019s not to detract from the value of black lives, but as more a \u201cwell duh of couse they matter\u201d. And try telling them that blue lives matter (fun fact: ~20% of all cops are black despite blacks being 15% of the US population), and you\u2019ll get some pretty amazing rage. 5. The way they deal with law enforcement issues makes things worse. It is the fact that police officers have been murdered by supporters and sympathizers of BLM, to my knowldge, all the perpetrators have been black. This is only going to make relationship WORSE, because now the cops really do have reasons to be fearful of people, especially black people. Their thinking is the last times they weren\u2019t hyperreactive and on edge, people were murdered and cities were burned. Like hell they\u2019re going to play nicer now. And in trying to appease BLM, they pulled back and crime exploded. This has ironically lead to the destruction of more black lives, mostly by other black people. Way to go! 6. BLM picks the worst people to get up in arms over. It also does not at all help that the people they choose to stand for after their slayings are some of the very worst possible choices. Michael Brown? Robber who picked a fight resulting in suicide by stupidity via cop. Freddy Grey? Thug with a rap sheet a mile long who killed himself trying to get hurt enough on purpose to sue Baltimore. The guy who got shot around the paramedics? Wife beater who, again, picked a fight first with her, then with the paramedics who got called, and then with the cops who got called. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Nearly every single day, black children, innocent ones, are killed by stray gang gunfire. Where the fuck are the rallies for them? Where the fuck are the protests? Where the fuck are the cries for justice and sanity? Oh wait, they were killed by black non cops, so their deaths really don\u2019t matter. 7. Their premise and ideology really is kinda racist. Lastly, imagine an organization called White Lives Matter, and what they do is protest where white people have been slain by people of color and call for an end to the targeting of whites. That would be called racist, and rightly so. I know why Black Lives Matter isn\u2019t really racist due to the power dynamics which necessitate things like it, but it does have more than a few aspects that rub people the very wrong way. Black Lives Matter has a noble goal which they insist on pursuing in the worst possible ways. And those are my issues with Black Lives Matter. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow! This is insane. I find it odd that the same issues that citizens of the United States of America that are classified as Black/African American have had since the inception of the US are the same complaints I hear in this thread by non-Black Americans. This actually proves the point of why the BLM movement exists and able to manipulate the collective. Where is all this backlash to get justice for the murder 17 year old Trayvon Martin and prosecute George Zimmerman? The murder of the 12 year old Tamir Rice and prosecute Timothy Loehmann? Hello!!! I cant hear you?!!! I really don't think European/Caucasian Americans and immigrants want to deflect and use so called \"black on black crime\" as the statistic to justify the slaying of BLM. If European/Caucasian Americans and immigrants were so concerned why aren't they in impoverished black communities and churches assisting with these issues? The impoverished Black community has been asking for help dealing with the drug problem since the 1980's and many groups have been established to stop the bs. Locking up a bunch of 12-18 year old corner boys doesn't solve the problem. The problem must be resolved from the source, what wealthy person is pushing the drugs into impoverised communities for these kids to fight for the pennies after wholesale? Matter of fact let's go to each dormitory on every Ivy League campus and see what drugs we find? I bet you'd find more drugs there than any street corner and 30% of the students would get locked up. Who's ready to test this theory? Hahaha! Crickets?!?! See, thats why it's best for European/Caucasian Americans and immigrants to STFU and listen this go-round. Non-Black people have dictated the lives of Black Americans for long enough and the government of the United States of America owes it to it's Black citizens since it's laws are what's crippled the wealth in the Black American community. It's disrepectful for non-Black Americans to open their mouths and dictate at this time. The very reason any immigrant or even Caucasion of non-British/Spanish decent is in the United States is because of the table that was built and milk and honey put on it by the work, intelligence, and skill of the American Black labor force that was never paid for their efforts. Women and Gays even owe it to American Blacks for being on the forefront of the fight to enact the Civil Rights act where the biggest beneficiaries of it are European/Caucasian women - smdh! European/Caucasian Americans and immigrants have received loans and access to capital to build businesses and own land since 1865. American Blacks were asked to lift themselves up by their bootstrap in which they did. American Blacks built some of the finest communities this side of heaven where they had the least crime and highest marriage rates between 1865 - 1965. American Blacks were hit again in the late 1960's once their communities were riddled with drugs that flowed from the caskets of dead soldiers that fought in Vietnam; and another influx from the caravans of immigrants that flowed into the US after the Civil Rights Act. American Blacks lost wealth in the 1970s as their communities were either redlined or turned into interstates for \"white flighters\" to have easy access to their jobs and entertainment in the city. So-called, \"Black on Black crime\" is a poverty problem created by the influx of drugs into impoverised black communities. You all need to understand history before running your mouth all willy nilly. Who's onboard to lockup the white collar criminals who's pumping this stuff in? If you are not about getting to the root of the problem STFU so you can hear the 400 year cries of American Blacks who's supported every other group in the US without very little support. This isn't a cry for help either since there's a middle to upper class group of Black America who are invisible to the collective yet prospered throughout the madness with no handouts. This is info for other groups to stop muddying the waters so American Blacks can take up their beef with state and federal governments who has added hurdles to their livelihood. If you dont like it, go back to your country of origin to field your complaints. Their weak ways are the reason people had to migrate for more oppurtunity in a land that was staged by American Blacks. Also, contrary to the history taught in the open, American Blacks are the longest standing settlers on the continental United States land, since 1526 when the first Blacks arrived, burned down the Spanish colony (San Miguel de Gualdape) and settled in with the natives. Stop with the deflection so we're able to listen, learn, love and protect each other. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll add my two cents. Imagine that someone just woke up from being in a coma for the last five years, and on their ride home, they asked why so many people were saying that black lives don\u2019t matter. When asked, they say that they\u2019ve arrived at that conclusion, because so many people (around here at least) have put signs in their windows saying: Black Lives Matter. The messaging implies that there is some large, powerful group of people who think the opposite... that black lives don\u2019t matter. There isn\u2019t.* There are a few crazies and internet trolls who think that while behind the anonymity of the screen and keyboard. Those people have been able to make their numbers seem inflated thanks to the way the internet and the media work, but they\u2019re still a really, really small, powerless group. According to the Anti-Defamation League, there are around 3,000 members of the most famous racist group, the KKK. Three thousand people in a country of more than 350,000,000. Three thousand people with little to no power in the real world, confined mostly to very rural areas, whose biggest accomplishments as far as helping their organization usually involve printing racist fliers and leaving them in people\u2019s mailboxes. My oldest daughter wanted to put a BLM poster in our window. I told her to go for it, and put a \u201cWorld Is Round\u201d poster up, too, since she\u2019s making posters that state the obvious, because a handful of crazies with internet access think the opposite. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the BLM movement has actually led to an increase in enrollment in anti-black racist organizations. Signs like this actually remind people that the KKK exists. It\u2019s like free advertising for them:  The best way to get rid of organized racist groups, in the modern era at least, is to treat them as what they are: small and relatively inconsequential. Acting like they\u2019re this looming menace over society just gives them what they want: unearned importance. But I\u2019m probably missing the whole point. I\u2019ve been accused of that a lot in the last few years. *Unless you really want to wade into the political thickets and bring up abortion, Planned Parenthood and its founder, and racial statistics when it comes to abortions.

            "answer_text": "Getting right to it. I know my opinion doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m white and male and hence, have no rights to an opinion of a different race. However, when you directly affect my life, I gain that right. There are a lot of reasons the movement doesn\u2019t work for many but I will only point to one since others have already answered good points. Tactics This is the biggest \u2018shake my head\u2019 moment. The idea behind every movement is to gather support from the masses. The masses are where the weight of the anger starts making progress. Yet, instead they piss off the people they need support from. At least half of the BLM people are unemployed or on some kind of state assistance, either EBT (food stamps) or welfare. So you would think that the people who work in public assistance that supplies them with money would be given a pass on anything that happens that is not related to them\u2026e.g. police shooting. Last week in Sacramento, just as State workers of California got off work and into rush hour, the BLM movement decided to protest the shooting of a criminal by blocking the highway. The people that are WORKING for the those people partaking in BLM are prevented from going home to their families. As someone who was also caught up in the traffic, I can say, fuck you. I didn\u2019t work all day so you can illegally block the highway and prevent me from getting to my family. The police were between the line of cars and the BLM protesters because, if they weren\u2019t, I have little doubt they would have been run over and those who did the running over would have been applauded. This is a terrible tactic for a movement trying to gain support. Don\u2019t piss off the people who you NEED. Each time it happens, more and more people jump off the BLM bandwagon and without the support, the movement will never accomplish what it originally wanted which is a righteous cause. The second piece to it\u2026PICK THE RIGHT PERSON to rally behind. Just because a black person was shot by the cops, doesn\u2019t mean you immediately jump up and start protesting. Pick the innocent man, not the criminal. The Ferguson shooting was stupid. The guy was a criminal AND he attacked the officer. Not a good person to rally behind. Too much support for the cop protecting himself. The cop who shot the black man running away\u2026that angered me. That is where my support was. The man was unarmed and just running. Because you\u2019re too lazy to chase him doesn\u2019t mean you get to shoot him. Rally behind him and you have my support. Pick and choose who to protest for. It has to make sense. Don\u2019t look at it as just black vs white. Recently the Sacramento shooting. The guy was a criminal. He was caught breaking into a truck and maybe a home. When confronted, he ran from the police. When he stopped running he turned to the cops with a black cell phone in hand. In the darkness of the evening, with flashlights the only light, they had to make a decision and based on the footage, the cops really believed he was armed (you can objectively tell by their actions of taking cover). Dont rally behind this idiot. If he wasn\u2019t breaking into property that was not hisIf he immediately surrendered when confrontedIf he didn\u2019t pull out his cell phone when he probably already believed cops are trigger happyThen he would probably be alive today. He made bad decisions because he started off in the wrong. His hands weren\u2019t clean. Don\u2019t rally behind him. The police chief (who is black) immediately provided the footage from the body cams and police helicopter to try and stem the tide of the cops vs black people argument. He went for full transparency but because it didn\u2019t fit into the narrative of cops shooting innocent unarmed black people, BLM still got all riled up by focusing on cops vs blacks instead of cops vs criminals. some blacks are criminals, but not all criminals are black. Take color out of it. I\u2019m all for peaceful protest. Do what you want, but don\u2019t interfere with my rights in your protest or I will fight back just as hard. ",

            "answer_text": "So, although others have answered this question very well, I\u2019m going to add another voice to the conversation anyway. Because there\u2019s much more at play here than can been seen on the surface. BLM specifically is combative, exclusive, and reactionary. All these characteristics cause problems, but, more importantly, none are likely to influence any desirable change. The biggest problem with any movement that possesses these characteristics is that, at best, they shine more light on the symptoms of the actual problem than they do on the problem that caused the symptoms. And likewise, participants in the movement often spend a great deal of time and effort working to take action to address those symptoms rather than their cause. The problem is not that any one person or more were killed wrongly by a Police Officer. The problem is how Police Officers operate (not necessarily due to any fault of their own, as individuals). And ultimately that Police Officers exist at all. That\u2019s not to suggest that they don\u2019t provide some valid services, but that by giving them \u2018too much\u2019 power they have become something more than what a civilized society needs (a civilized society needn\u2019t be policed); and that they therefore interfere with our societies ability to get on in a civilized manner. Further, the problem that BLM is attempting to address is rooted in prejudice; and prejudices can ultimately not be eradicated. They form as a natural response to a persons \u2018perception\u2019 of the world around them. Yes, some are highly irrational and dysfunctional, and some people foolishly fight to protect their right to be prejudice regardless, but ultimately \u2018prejudices\u2019 are normal and have purpose. If you can\u2019t eradicate prejudices in general, how do you address them? In regards to the Police, I suggest starting from scratch: replace Police with unarmed, but arms trained, Civil Servants who actually answer to the communities they serve. Don\u2019t give them the powers the Police posses now that make them dangerous. Don\u2019t give them the incentives to hurt rather than help people that the Police have now. And make it easy to identify and replace any of these Civil Servants who insist on harboring dysfunctional prejudices. -They have the right to maintain their prejudices, but they can\u2019t necessarily do the job they\u2019re hired for if they exercise that right. And they don\u2019t have a right to maintain their employment if they can\u2019t do the job they are hired for.- These civil servants could still keep guns in their trunks for \u2018special\u2019 occasions. And we could still have SWAT groups in heavily populated or dangerous areas. After all, we have firemen for when there\u2019s a fire right? But firemen don\u2019t run around hosing people down or \u2018axing\u2019 them when they get drunk, or when they get in fights with their family members, or when they have mental breakdowns. Use the right tool for the job, as they say. We need trustworthy and skilled people who are hired by the community to help it\u2019s members even when they aren\u2019t aware they need help. We need people who can safely intervene and resolve conflicts between members of our society. We need people who can investigate crimes. We need people who can do a lot of the things that cops do. But we don\u2019t need cowboys/gunslingers. We don\u2019t need uncivilized, or unskilled, and/or easily scared, gun toting maniacs wandering around our streets or highways on the \u2018prowl\u2019 for their next victim. Even good cops often take on this persona, the persona of a hunter, seeking out criminals, because that\u2019s often exactly what they are employed to do. So they see everyone as a potential criminal, and as their enemy; and any prejudice they may have will only worsen this uncivilized behavior. Nobody would complain if they were on the streets hunting for the next homeless person they could provide helpful services to (food, a blanket, a smile, a conversation). Nobody would complain if they were targeting old people while looking for opportunities to make unsolicited \u2018welfare checks\u2019. Nobody reasonable would complain if they were \u2018offering\u2019 people who appeared strung out rides to free rehab clinics\u2026 Ultimately, if they were actually out there just looking to properly help each and every person they encountered (even those committing or guilty of crimes), the prejudices they have would likely just help them do their jobs. But when their job is to appear \u2018nice\u2019 while treating everyone like a monster, an enemy, the outcome is not going to be civilized. Crimes, even those committed by those in power, are usually just symptoms of deeper problems. And, when this is true, those deeper problems can\u2019t be solved by seeking vengeance against those committing the crimes. Both BLM and the current US Criminal Justice system continue to perpetuate this uncivilized behavior. If you want solutions to your societies problems, look elsewhere. ",

            "answer_text": "Recently a San Antonio police officer was killed and three other officers were shot at in unrelated incidents which closely mimic the recent ambush attacks on law enforcement officers in Baston Rogue and Dallas by Black Lives Matter supporters, all in a single day. The vicious cycle of ambushes on police officers and the killings of unarmed black citizens, have led to unprecedented tension between law enforcement and Black Lives Matter activists.   The Black Lives Matter movement, which seeks to prevent the untimely deaths of people of color, has an indisputably noble goal, but do police officers really pose the most serious threat to the lives of African Americans, as we have been led to believe? While statistics on police shootings do reveal that young black men are disproportionately the victims of police shootings, crimes simply do not breakdown on proportionate demographic lines. Blacks constitute only 13% of the population, but they represent a majority of the homicide and robbery arrests. Over the past decade, 40% of those arrested for killing police officers have also been black. Some argue that a disproportionate number of black arrests does not mean that African Americans commit more crime, but is merely a result of living in heavily policed neighborhoods. While this argument has some merit, studies based on anonymously self-reported crime data also find that blacks are disproportionately involved in violent crimes. Given these disturbing disparities, it is unfortunate, but not entirely unreasonable, that African Americans experience a higher likelihood of being killed in a police shooting than a white person. If the mere disproportionate representation of black men as victims of police shootings is indicative of organized racism, why are Asians(adjusted for population) less likely than whites to be shot by police? Surely, no reasonable person would think that the police are more racist to whites than Asians. Undoubtedly there are individual racist officers, like the San Francisco police officer who sent text messages referencing African Americans as \u201cwild animals\u201d. Discrimination against blacks, such as being pulled over more often for traffic stops, does exist, but it is a result of unconscious bias by well meaning officers. As FBI director James Comey pointed out, \u201cThe two young black men on one side of the street look like so many others the officer has locked-up. Two white men on the other side of the street\u2014even in the same clothes\u2014do not. And that drives different behavior. The officer turns toward one side of the street and not the other.\u201d Police shootings are a serious problem in our society. According to The Guardian, \u201cIn the first 24 days of 2015, police in the US fatally shot more people than police did in England and Wales, combined, over the past 24 years.\u201d What is almost just as troubling as the shootings themselves is that the officers involved even in the most questionable shootings almost always go unpunished. In 2014, a SWAT team that maimed an infant by throwing a flash grenade into an infant\u2019s crib in a drug raid gone wrong did not face any criminal charges. In 2011, Officers Jay Cicinelli and Joseph Wolfe of the Fullerton police department beat a white homeless man to death under the pretext of arresting him. A jury acquitted both of them. Based on what we know so far, the shooting of Philando Castle is beyond senseless. Striving to hold these rogue officers accountable is laudable. But to suggest that every police shooting of a man of color is racist is a great disservice to white victims of police shootings, African Americans and law enforcement officers. Blacks are six times more likely to be victims of homicides. Heather MacDonald, a conservative scholar, points out that 12 percent of white and Hispanic homicide deaths are due to police officers, while only four percent of black homicide deaths are the result of police officers. The lower proportion of black deaths due to police shootings is because most blacksare killed by fellow citizens, overwhelmingly black, and not police officers. To make a serious dent in the mortality rate of young African Americans, we have to answer some very tough questions: Why are blacks so over represented in violent crime, both as offenders and victims? What can we do to address the some of the most serious issues facing the black community, such as poverty, low school graduation rate and single parent homes. The Baltimore Sun reported, \u201cBlood was shed in Baltimore at an unprecedented pace in 2015, with mostly young, black men shot to death in a near-daily crush of violence.\u201d How many of these lives could have been saved had we looked beyond the idea of homicidal racist cops out to kill young African Americans?

            "answer_text": "I would consider their biggest failing to be their frequent reliance on lies. I\u2019m talking about their own belief in lies to pump of their own outrage, their propagation of lies to generate outrage among others, and their use of lies to justify their demands for the punishment of the targets of their protests. I\u2019m not saying that this typifies what they do, but that doing it at all is a huge turn-off for some people who might otherwise be sympathetic. Examples: Their claim that Trayvon Martin was a cute little boy who was hunted and killed merely for daring to walk in a white neighborhood. (It was a mixed neighborhood, some of the neighbors who complained of thefts and break-ins by young black strangers to the neighborhood were themselves black. Evidence not admitted to the trial suggests Martin was a proficient street fighter. Evidence that _was_ submitted strongly suggests that Martin was the one who initiated the use of violence.)The claim that Eric Garner was choked to death. (He wasn\u2019t. He was choked into submission. Then he died of an asthma-induced heart-attack while negligent cops on the scene who didn\u2019t know of his asthma were skeptical of his complaints of inability to breathe.)The claim that Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown in the back while he was fleeing, and then while he had his hands up in surrender.(There may be more to the Freddie Gray case as well, but I don\u2019t know whether the allegations are true: Were Freddie Gray's injuries self-inflicted?)People can fall for lies; I, too, long assumed that the Michael Brown narrative was true, for example. But when falsehoods are discovered, it would seem that the BLM leaders would prefer not to hear of it. (Some of the original claims of abuse are so outrageous, you\u2019d think they\u2019d be glad to hear that things are not that bad.) Another serious critique is that, though the leadership\u2019s official position is that BLM opposes the assassination of random police officers, I\u2019m told that chants and cheers at demonstrations suggest otherwise. (I have not been at their demonstrations, so I have no way of knowing whether these are isolated events or typical of the protests.) A third critique is the overgeneralized nature of their accusations against police. It would be untrue and obnoxious to claim that the typical young black man is a criminal; yet BLM accuses the police as an institution of being racist even though the incidence of racist behavior among police may be no higher than the incidence of crime among young black men. (Yes, we have higher expectations for police than for people in general, but expectations do not change the inappropriateness of prejudice and over-generalization.) ",

            "answer_text": "The Black Lives Matter movement is about racism; not about black lives. If it were about black lives then the movement would logically focus on areas and situations in which a high proportion of black lives are impacted such as health related issues like obesity, diabetes and heart disease, and crime within predominantly black communities, not on situations in which proportionally much fewer black lives are at risk such as due to wrongful killings by police. The phrase \u201cblack lives matter\u201d is a sensationalist implication that black lives are not important to non-black police officers and non-black people, in general. It is intended to stir up emotions and it does that successfully, but, for many, not in a way that garners their support of the movement. The phrase \u201cblack lives matter\u201d is offensive to the many who work to protect the lives of those in predominantly black communities (and all communities) such as fire fighters, health care professionals, police officers, government administrators, lawmakers, soldiers and others because (with, admittedly, the exception of a few) they are trying very hard to protect and save the lives of black people (and all people) and some put their own lives at risk in doing so. There are specifically many black police officers who are killed in the line of duty due to violence in predominantly black communities. Their black lives matter, too. And there are many innocent black lives that matter which are lost due to violence in predominantly black communities. In August, 2016 eight year old Gabrielle Hill Carter was accidentally shot and killed in Camden, NJ due to gang (or other) violence. As far as I know, this did not make the national news like the police shootings of black men did nor is there any nationwide movement to stop the kind of violence that caused this innocent young girl\u2019s death.  On the same day that I heard about the murder of this girl I heard more of the recurring news about \u201cblack lives matter\u201d. The phrase \u201cblack lives matter\u201d which is about racism doesn\u2019t make me think of racism. It makes me think of the many innocent black lives lost due to violence in predominantly black communities. Hearing the sad news about Gabrielle Hill Carter and seeing her picture was upsetting to me and it confirmed my feelings that black lives matter. ",

            "answer_text": "One of my biggest criticisms and I am sure echos throughout the US is the destructive and costly rioting, violence, and aggressive nature, it does more to widen any ethnic or cultural gap that mend it. Sure it brings attention to issues, but the issues are often one sided, unwilling to admit there is only their side. If I were undecided or had racial issues but had not acted upon them, all this that the BLM movement has done would likely push me to the other side. I am sure enlistment into most white supremist groups is at an all time high and likely things will get worse before they get better. My second is the logic in black lives matter pertaining to cops or whites when many more unarmed whites are killed by cops than blacks which is understandable considering whites are 70% of the population and blacks are 13%. Also that blacks at 13% of the population are responsible for 50% of all homicides, this and the fact that 80% of all crimes including homicide are same race crimes. This means that in fact, blacks kill more blacks than any other racial group. At this rate, if black families only had 2 or less children per family, their population would decrease through no fault of anyone but there own. Black Lives Matter should be enficised more on blacks caring about their own enough to stop killing each other. My third is that all lives matter, cops kill more than just blacks, and many deaths are justified. There are bad cops out there, also stupid, fearful, poorly trained and genuinely good ones, blacks whites, women and other races too, BLM lumps them all into one, no matter the ethnicity or individual history, there are more racial groups than just blacks. Asians have surpassed whites in productivity and prosperity as well as education, but then they are more driven to achieve. Blacks have become the opposite, they, not all but many look down upon those who choose to achieve, leave the pack, educate themselves and adapt to Excell. Asians look up to those who achieve or attempt to and assist them, blacks seem to try and drag them down. Blacks who immigrate here do far better than those born here because for one they know first hand how much better it is here, they come here driven to achieve and have not yet been assimilated into our black mind set. The same goes for most immigrants in comparison to American born of the same racial group. ",

            "answer_text": "It can be argued, their approach and one specific demand.             A lot of individuals are upset that they are bypassing \"the old guard.\" The  likes of  the NAACP, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, John Lewis, etc. Some older individuals feel like the won't take the advice of experienced civil rights leaders and that it could be their downfall.  Criticisms from \"the old guard\" are more or less rooted in the absence of the church as well. The Civil Rights movement was held up by black Southern churches and up until recently if you had the churches, you had the black vote too. Like a growing number of millenials, the black millenials running BLM are increasingly secular and aren't rooting arguments in the bible. BLM is a complete 180 degree turn in terms of demeanor compared to past civil rights groups. I see a style of leadership and adherence to peaceful but disruptive protest similar to MLK. However, there's an anger, a justified anger, similar to the Black Panthers. I think the BLM is heavily influenced by how much social progress our nation and world have had when it comes to the treatment of Black people. They are just trying to get us over that next uncomfortable edge to address problems that need to be addressed. It's not about basic civil rights anymore but that doesn't make an issue any less pressing.  Now to the part I can completely disagree on. Several prominent members have basically advocated for the removal police an almost any capacity from black communities because of acts of brutality. This is a mistake. Some people are choosing to live by the mantra that we can \" 'fend for ourselves.\" There's a belief, from what I've seen, that the removal of officers from our communities will benefit us and that it's our responsibility to keep each other in check. I don't ascribe to that. It's ridiculous to think that as a community we'll just somehow look out for each other, it's borderline segregationist. They don't seem to have any plans to address poverty in black communities. We have to, as a nation, raise the overall economic standing of African-American to levels comparable to Whites and Latinos. Without addressing poverty we will not get very far. Poverty is the root cause of most inequality. Frustration will continue without addressing poverty and the wealth gap, even with the policing reforms they want. PS: I also don't like this culture of screaming dowm any argument, suggestion, or opinion that doesn't come from someone within the organization or that they may initially disagree with. A compromise or proposal made be suggested and it seems like individuals within BLM's may disagree with it and if it has any problems at all people shut the idea down for being racist because it's not exactly what they came up with. PPS: If I run for office, my Quora answer will probably bite me in the ass. ",

If BLM simply meant \"black lives matter\" then okay I\u2019d largely agree (although I don\u2019t love the message in of itself because in my mind just because you have a pulse doesn\u2019t mean you matter. Maybe instead of society telling young people that \u201cyou matter\u201d (leave that for Grandma) we should say \u201cyou can matter!\u201d), but moving on my main problem with BLM is that is also means... F*** the police.Abolish the police.BlackLivesMatter DC on Twitter Abolish free speech as it pertains to race, i.e. \"hate speech\"White people are racist by default and therefore need to shut up and listen to people with darker skin who may or may not be educated in politics.America was created by racists and therefore will always be racist.Republicans are racist.And ironically, the state is systemically racist therefore we must give more power to the state so it can take even more control over our education, housing, healthcare, food, transportation, etc.For one or all of those reasons, we shouldn\u2019t support BLM. H*ll is paved with good intentions. And to hammer home my point, when the Democrat Mayor Jacob Frey came before the almighty BLM protestors (the protestors weren't even nice enough to let him get up on the platform to address the crowd), he talked about his own \"brokenness\" and how the \u201csystemic racist system needs to be revamped\u201d and how the \u201cpolice union needs to be put in its place\u201d, but as soon as he disagreed with abolishing the police altogether, which is an absolutely absurd proposition unless you want these cities that are already overrun by gang violence to be controlled by them, then the BLM protestor shouted at him to, \"Get the f*** out of here!\" \n And then everyone started chanting SHAME as if we live in the literal Game of Thrones.  \n BLM is dangerously wrong here whereby if they succeeded in abolishing the police department we\u2019d actually see millions of black people dead in the streets as gangs fight it out in turf wars\u2026 black lives matter? Your right to be upset doesn\u2019t supersede my right to think. If you believe in the continued existence of police officers then join me in telling BLM to, \"Please go away.\" This answer is not a book so don't expect me to address all the reasons why you support BLM because it's irrelevant since BLM is not an inclusive tolerant movement that welcomes many points of view... as you saw in the video, if you disagree on something so ludicrous as \"defunding the police\" then you are being told to, \"Get the f*** out of here!\" Happily.

            "answer_text": "Frankly a lot of the message coming from BLM is a red herring, the reality is that vast majority of violent black deaths in America are not at the hands of law enforcement, or for that matter at the hands of white Americans. The ugly truth that most in the black community refuse to acknowledge or are ignorant of is that the majority of violent deaths of black Americans occur at the hands of other black Americans. Here are just a few stats outlining the problem Fewer than 400 people a year are killed by law enforcement, and 61 percent of them are white.Ninety percent of murdered blacks are murdered by other blacks.A law enforcement officer is 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is likely to be killed by a police officer.Black males have comprised 40 percent of law enforcement officer killers in the last decade, even though they make up six percent of the population.Four percent of all black homicide victims are killed by police officers.More than 6,000 blacks are murdered each year. Even though blacks are only 13 percent of the population, they are dying at a rate more than eight times that of whites and Hispanics combined.Up to 75 percent of black children are raised without fathers. Dallas police chief David Brown mentioned this in a recent press conference, saying that law enforcement is often unfairly expected to deal with many of these damaged individuals who turn to crime after growing up without discipline, guidance and role models.The DOJ has found that 85 percent of violence involving a black and a white is black on white.Now, no one is suggesting the problem lies with the average law abiding black American, any more than responsibility for crimes committed by white individuals lies with law abiding white citizens. Where the problem with Black Lives Matter is they are targeting the wrong group, they should be screaming for the heads of the small minority of individuals within their own communities that are committing the crimes and taking the lives of Black Americans. Looking at the above statistics, maybe what is needed is a \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d campaign to support the police. ",

            "answer_text": "I see two contrasting ideologies designed to serve the same agenda. When I was a kid in 2nd grade, we were actively taught black people were the same us as, only with black skin, and it didn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s the \u2018color-blind\u2019 perspective. The t.v. show the Jefferson\u2019s summed it up in the concept of regarding black people as Oreos. The hope was getting enough people to think this way would largely eliminate racism agains blacks, who would gradually assimilate into mainstream society and their social metrics improve. But it didn\u2019t happen fast enough and well enough, and it seemed active efforts (whether you\u2019re a MLK Jr. or Malcolm X fan) seemed necessary. I imagine black youth got a lot of negative messages growing up - that a lot of people \u2018hate\u2019 or view you as inferior because of your skin color, and blacks are often depicted as doing dismally in a range of social metrics. Basically, a black kid could infer from all this that being black means you\u2019re screwed. Plus the sense of vague, pervasive oppression. What to do? Now we\u2019ve got identity politics. Create the concept of the \u2018black community\u2019 to raise solidarity into a politically powerful unit and work for change. Give members a sense of pride and positive identity in \u2018belonging\u2019 to a proud group, a noble people who have endured and survived harsh oppression yet did not fall. A sense of meaning in pursing a higher purpose to achieve MLK Jr\u2019s dream and be \u2018free at last!\u2019 Understandable appeal. There are a few problems. In public schooling, separate but equal didn\u2019t go well. If the basis for treating blacks equally is that they're the same as us, how far do you want to go portraying them as different? Humans are inherently tribalistic; does portraying blacks as being in their own tribe others are excluded from sound like a good idea? Many people want to make neighborhoods more integrated to aid poor blacks, but from whites\u2019 perspective, if \u2018they\u2019 aren't like us, and we\u2019re in different \u2018communities,\u2019 and theirs has a grudge against ours, is that in our best interest? Oddly, I don't see a lot of discussion of how this tribalism-based mentality will deal with shades of gray (mixed race people). Famous ones like the first bi-racial President may get claimed (called black). I\u2019ve read some in the black community prefer lighter skinned members, so there\u2019s color-bias even within the so-called black community itself. I\u2019m solidly in the \u2018color-blind\u2019 camp, believing there\u2019s one race, the human race, that so-called races differ on minor cosmetic bases and we ought to downplay and ignore it as much as practical. But I\u2019m an aging white guy; maybe it\u2019s easier to think like that. I do wonder how much damage identity politics are doing to America. Shortly after the George Floyd video got out, there was a lot of sympathy toward blacks. Once the riots and looting started and the BLM bit got pushed stronger, I saw a backlash on Facebook. There\u2019s a balance between reaching out for help, and making some other people feel attacked. People who wish to be politically effective would be well-advised to master that balance. ",

            "answer_text": "UPDATED JUNE 2020 Great answer from Habib. Personally, I've had real concerns with North American police practices for decades and I'm not even black, so my emphasis is on how to reform very poor police procedures and organizational culture so as to benefit everyone, especially black folks. My biggest concern with the BLM movement is that its entire focus is on racism. It's not well known by the public that British police are far, far better trained than North American police. Not knowing that, it's natural to assume that the sole cause of shootings of unarmed black males is racism. The fact that black officers are often involved gets no attention but it's highly significant. Canadian Update June 2020. What I wrote about improper police procedures has become sadly relevant in Canada. A 26 year old native woman from BC, Chantel Moore, was killed by the RCMP officer she allegedly \u2018threatened\u2019 during a \u201cwellness check\u201d called in by her own family. In Brampton, a similar tragedy happened to 26 year old D'Andre Campbell, someone with known mental health issues who, being in distress, was even the one who called police! The police always say their officers were threatened and had no choice but to shoot to kill. This is nonsense. It always takes more time to draw, aim and shoot a weapon than it does to simply step back or even run away. At worst, they could train their tasers on their victims as they back away. In short, Police need to be trained to DISENGAGE before killing mentally ill people, or anyone who doesn't immediately comply with their orders for whatever reason. Making this solely a race issue may not be helpful. People of all colours are endangered by the poor training in crisis management of our police. But maybe the current BLM movement will be the catalyst we need to finally see positive change. TLDR: Until police procedures are changed, NEVER call the police to check on a loved one! Personal Story: I was on private property, rather depressed, so didn't answer calls. My mother called the police for one of those wellness checks and I didn't want to open the door; I said come back with a warrant. The police made it quite clear that they needed no warrant and WERE coming in, by force if needed. Being sane, I complied. But for someone unstable, they could perceive this police threat as worthy of arming themselves. Minutes later, they'd be dead. For a wellness check! We have to DEFUND the police and start funding mobile crisis intervenors to help people in distress, not kill them! There are also underlying cultural SAFETY issues.. In North America, we are taught from childhood that \u201cyou can never be too safe\u201d. Children aren't allowed to go to the playground unescorted and much of our thinking is fear-based. Franklin Veaux has written about how US political parties play fear like a violin and the media has a huge role in this. When a child is kidnapped, the coverage is huge, parents everywhere become fearful. There's never a single voice saying that the likelihood of your child bring kidnapped by a stranger is very low, less than the chance of being hit by lightning. So keep your children inside! Ok\u2026 Skip ahead 20 years. That child is now a police officer. S/he's been told his whole life \u201cdon't take chances, you can't be too safe\u201d. And the (totally innocent) black suspect has something in his hand! Start shooting! Now! In short, we need far, far better training of police in a new atmosphere of \u201cyou CAN be too safe\u201d and \u201cI'm NOT afraid of black people.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, they enjoy using an analogy ,like a house on fire, and the other houses around it are fine, and people from other houses would tell the firefighters , \u201cMy house matters too, all house matters\u201d A false analogy. The one realistic analogy is not only is that one house on fire, but plenty dozens more are on fire. Because all lives are suffering. Wanna know why all lives are suffering? Because not only black lives are killed around the world. Asians are being killed , middle eastern are being killed , natives are being killed, Hispanics are being killed. You think discrimination only happens in America? Fuck no, it's everywhere , it existed since the dawn of time. And it WILL continue to exist , because of its necessary existence Do NOT give me that BS that other lives are not taken just because you don't see them. Did you just discover that all lives are in pain and suffering? Just by living, people hurt others without even realizing it. So long as humanity exists, hate will also exist. There is no peace in this world. War is just a crime paid for by the pain of the defeated. But that doesn't mean that peace is not possible. Permanent peace is not possible ,but a temporary one is. Oh? So only those shown on the media are true? Anericans love to think the world revolves around them. They love to think they are the center of the world. I have an African friend , wanna know what he thinks? He actually thinks majority of Americans are hilarious, fighting over this one man's death, and think the African Americans in America are the only ones suffering,whereas Africans have witnessed more suffering than they ever did. Stop playing the role of a victim. As Gautama Buddha mentioned before , and I quote \"Pain is inevitable ,but suffering is optional\" There will be pain , there will be inequality, there will be injustice , there will be conflicts , there will be wars. HOWEVER, you can choose to cling on them , by blaming all the downfalls in your life on them. Or you can rise above by not letting them to dictate your life. You can't change the world. You think raising awareness would do anything? No, the conflict will continue , the inequality, the injustice , the cycle of hatred will continue. As I mentioned earlier , creating peace and bring about justice. From what most people who supported the \"black life matters\" movement. Yes, it is noble of you ,wanting to bring justice upon this world. That's justice indeed HOWEVER, there will ALWAYS be someone who will say \"What about my family? My friends? My country?\" Such as people from war-torn countries like Syria , or the middle East countries , who suffered the same fate as your country, torn apart by meaningless conflict. How is it fair to only allow you people to preach about peace and justice? In the end, you and I seek the same thing. We are trying to establish the peace we all desired so much. You and I are not so different after all. We each act according to our own sense of Justice. The justice the terrorists delivered to America and the rest of the world is no different from what you all are trying to do to each other in America. The pain of losing something dear to you is the same. And we all know the pain all too well. You have your justice . . .And they have theirs. We are all but ordinary men, driven to seek vengeance under the banner of Justice. However, if there is justice in vengeance, then justice will only breed more vengeance and trigger a cycle of hatred. We are living in the middle of such a phenomenon right now. We know what the past has been, and we can predict what the future will be. That is history, as we know it. So we cannot help but believe that human beings are incapable of understanding each other. This world is ruled and governed by hatred since the dawn of time. In this world, wherever there is light, there pare also shadows. As long as the concept of winners and oppressors exist, there must also be victims and losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars, and hatred is born to protect love. When a man learns to bear love, he must also bear the risk of hate. The causality and interdependence of these opposing forces means that peace can only be for those who wins at the expense of the losers, the weak. Humans desire peace , yet on the other hand create conflict as well. That duality is mankind for you. What will you do then? Will you repeat the same cycle again, just like our ancestors , and continue this cycle of hatred? Or will you rise above and stop this madness once and for all? So . . . Tell me, enlighten me! How would you confront this hatred in order to create peace?   ",

            "answer_text": "I would argue that the biggest issue is that it is people being enraged by the symptoms, and few people are actually looking at the actual causes. And fighting the symptoms without treating the disease is a losing battle.  There are many movements that are like that. Occupy Wall Street was also like that, outrage at the symptoms, but no real focus on the mechanisms. Another example: Defunding the police. Which actually means not cutting the police entirely, but funding them less, and funding other stuff instead. What exactly are we funding instead? Other stuff. How does that solve the problem exactly? Should we perhaps talk about that, about exactly what we want to do? And how we decide on that?  Why is it that people have to stand around in the street and break shit to be heard? Why is the democratic process so broken that people don't feel like they can realistically improve anything through normal means? Is having people protest in the streets really the best way to do things? Is it like a show of hands type of voting? Why cant we do normal voting on how we want policing to be done? Do you ever get to vote on any of the stuff that matters? Or just on some politician\u2019s face? Did you vote for the recent bailouts? Or do you remember which politician campaigned on handing out huge bailouts? Or how did it happen without anyone in the population having a say about it?  If we go to the root causes of stuff, we might be able to change something. If we fight against the symptoms of broken systems, without addressing the systems themselves, we are not going anywhere.  You can fire the \u201ccouple of bad apples\u201d cops, and the broken police system will ensure that new ones appear to replace them. You can destroy the whole police department, and rebuild it from scratch. And if you are using the same method, measures, goals etc to build the new one as for the old one, you will recreate the same thing. ",

            "answer_text": "The movement at its core is good, but some of the members really aren't. The BLM movement is a movement wherein protester protest the violence some cops have shown towards the African American community and racial injustices in our society. There work highlights instances of violence and tries to inform the world that there are racist cops and we do still have an imperfect justice system. It is important to highlight these topics and share them for many might not even know these things are going on, and it is impossible to be a good police officer/have a good justice system wherein racism is prevalent. But now onto the negatives BLM has some violent/extremist members (like all movements do) that actually make situations worse. They turn peaceful protests into violent riots and spout racism against white people/violence towards police officers. Neither of which helps the BLM movement.They sometimes protest before due diligence is done. I've seen a number of smaller protests thst happened because a young African American man was shot by the police without anyone actually learning why. The man in question assaulted an officer and was shot in self defense but some people still protested it as if the officer had gone out of his way to attack the African American man/assuming the officer in question was racist. Another instance happened between an African American officer and an African American suspect, yes African Americans can be racist against themselves but they were still some yelling about white cops and white peoples in general. Now this doesn't take away from the overall message that there is racism inherent to our system but it does show people \u201cjumping the gun\u201d and being \u201cprotest happy\u201d. Or just wanting to protest something so badly they neglect to appraise the actual situation.Many feel it's a less inclusive group. Yes most memebers of BLM do believe that all lives matter but want to highlight violence towards the African American community, however the number of extremists put a very bad light on the movement as a whole. Like I said before there are some members of BLM who try to spread anti white/racist ideologies, most members don't but some definitely do.In some places white people weren't aloud to protest in solidarity with the African American community. Again mainly because of the small number of extremists inside the group. But a group against racism shouldn't be racist.So basically the only thing wrong with the movement are a few of its members. Most members are peaceful and just want to be heard. They stand up against injustices and try to outline what is wrong with our current system in an attempt to help us understand. It's a good movement but it has been trivialized by the actions of a few of its members. I do believe that Black Lives Matter and I will continue to support said organization as long as I feel the message and community as a whole is geared towards a better more inclusive future. I however do not condone the actions of racism and violence perpetrated by a few of the members. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a fundamental contradiction here. The black murder rate is so high, it hard to get your head around. Blacks have a murder rate 5.7 times higher than non-hispanic whites in 2018 according the FBI. Yet the narrative is they are brutally policed. I don\u2019t think anyone disputes police enforcement inhibits crime, so why are these numbers so high? It\u2019s pretty much a given the truth of any liberal claim is exactly the opposite, that\u2019s how they keep the franchise going, with a media reality suited to their fascist goal of total control of money, power, behavior, and thought. Blacks are just a pawn in the liberal elite game. They fund movements like BLM to inhibit police enforcement to keep the crime rate high, which guarantees lots of crimes. This means there will be really nasty, poor black areas they can splash on TeeVee, to keep the race business going strong. This allows them to manipulate people out of their votes, money, and independence, and it\u2019s working a treat. We spend a $trillion dollars more per year than we have, but if Trump tries to cut a program 5 cents, there\u2019s howling to the moon. Propaganda induced lunacy. I would also note the majority of blacks murders occur in about 10 hot spots in the country, not cities, but individual neighborhoods within a city. All out enforcement, shooting gang bangers and dealers on sight could end all this in about 90 days. I\u2019ve read you only have to shoot about 1 out 10, and the rest will change. So we could shoot about 1000 guys and end the black poverty and crime problem for generations. Murder Rates by Race White (non-hispanic) 9.7/million Hispanic 20.6/million Hispanic/White 2.1 Black murder offenders 55.6/million. Black/White 5.7 Percentage of All White Homicides by Police: 3% Percentage of All Black Homicides by Police: 1% Black Murders by: Blacks 89% Whites (non-hispanic) 3.4% Hispanic 2.8% White Murders by: Blacks 16% Whites (non-hispanic) 56% Hispanic 24% ",

            "answer_text": "People are always quoting statistics and statistics is a valuable tool in determining outcomes. However the cold hard facts of what really takes place in \u2018race \u2018 interactions are much harder to define. Another way at looking at the truth is not just about the ratios of police killings between black and white people but the amount of interactions that people have with the police and how they are handled. How many times does a black person get stopped by police, not just in their cars but in the street or sitting at a bus stop. How hard is the law enforced for misdemeaners. What happens in society that makes them suspect that they are going to get arrested,fined and are more likely to experience, a \u2018second rating\u2019 in all kinds of ways from being served in a store to even selling a house. Recently a case was posted up where a couple were selling their house. They had it valued and they felt for the area it was undervalued. The husband was white his partner black. She removed all evidence of a black existence in the house, no family pictures, no celebratory cultural motifs and had the house revalued, with only her white husband present. The price went up by a 100,000 usd. The perception that I can fully understand is when you are stopped by the police as long as you've done nothing wrong, it's just a stroll in the park. It just isn't going to be that way for many people, for many black and brown people and that doesn't mean you are going killed but that if not handled correctly could be life changingly bad. We have recently seen this in Central Park NYC. A white woman calls the police, because a black man asks her to put her dog on a lead. She claims he's being aggressive, with the possible threat of violence. This as you know was being recorded and was blatantly not true. This was from a high status white women, that you would not normal think of as being ignorant. There comes a time when people think, when they they get stopped on the street in the car after so many other times, has their number been called. Statistically so I'm told it isn't., but statistics are not about how you feel, society is. Do you feel good in your society has Trump made you feel better, does Biden make you feel worse? Black Lives Matter is about the black experience and the mistreatment that whole swathes of people suffer in American society. It has become, never intentionally, a bandwagon for a host of people, minorities and those that feel the protest/ debate is an examination of the notion \u2018 what is fair in society\u2019 and what is patiently not. When you're driving your car in downtown Jamaica, you know your not being stopped because you are black, you do not know that in America. ",

            "answer_text": "Alright. I\u2019ve been shying away from this question because I don\u2019t want to lose followers or lose my sister status. But here goes. I understand the general position. I live in Arizona where racial profiling has been a standard (not necessarily for blacks, but for hispanics). I get that this does happen and I do not doubt there are egregious violations of morals and the law. It\u2019s been shown that horrific things happen because of skin tone. But the range that this movement has and the offshoots of what this movement started bother me. Maybe it\u2019s because I just don\u2019t quite understand the issue. Personally, I don\u2019t care what color you are unless you act like an ass. I have met the literal stereotypes of most races (I have some of the Mexican ones in my own family). I have used racial slurs against those stereotypes. I expect I am now being unfollowed and blocked because of that statement. I can\u2019t apologize. To me, there is a difference. I have also met or seen exemplary examples of humanity in all colors. Maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t care what color or gender or sexuality people are that I don\u2019t understand or appreciate the lengths that BLM goes to. Maybe it\u2019s because I keep forgetting that in social media BLM stands for Black Lives Matter because in my work BLM stands for Bureau of Land Management. Maybe it\u2019s because my boyfriend has to keep pointing out to me that I\u2019m an exception, not the rule, in my beliefs. I know that peaceful protests can change a nation. It\u2019s been done before. But the tone of a lot of these protests isn\u2019t peaceful. It shifts from the original organizers of the movement to something darker (no, that is not a skin tone reference) as others pile on. Others with slightly different motives. And I don\u2019t want the darkness becoming the norm. ",

I can 100% know that, never needed anyone to explain it, but the words still sit there, oozing salt. First you have to keep in mind that level of 'not mattering' you have to achieve to be genocided into extinction the way we were in Operation Storm. I mean, the first thing that comes to an American's mind when they the hear the word 'Serb' are the words 'genocidal maniacs.' And I can't talk about what really happened, who was really doing who, without somebody throwing that at me. I mean, think about it, the minority culture (Krajina Serbs) that produced Tesla is now gone forever. A couple more generations and nobody will even be claiming that identity. All that suffering for so many generations, to end up like that. It was 600 years of struggling to survive that horrible predicament, colonized, enslaved, exploited people, less than human, raped, powerless. And then there's the runaway slaves that we were, sitting in the no-man's-land on the other side of the border fighting those mf's who had our brothers and sisters in bondage on the other side of the border. That was 350 years stuck in a vibe like buffalo soldiers fighting the Civil War. That's the kind of crucible that produces a Tesla -- us inferior, stupid people, the gorillas of Europe. And where did it go? All that heart for nothing. And all the mindless turmoil roiling through my family, adrift here with no memory of ourselves, no clue why we were such a mess -- all lost except who was familiar -- that spun me out into such a maligned life living on what the world thought was the wrong side of the color line, reaching for something that just mattered so much that was never really mine. And never will be. So every time I hear that name I feel some salt in that wound. If there was any discussion when the name was being decided on that maybe it would make some people feel left out or ignored, an obvious decision was made that, no, we don't matter. And I'm asked to be sensitive to people who are being insensitive. And what they appear to me is callow youth who have some growing up to do. After forty years on what this culture thinks is the wrong side of the color line I have reached an impasse. I am not going to make an effort to make allowances and understand people who are not making an effort to do the same for me. It's full equality, or it's nothing. I want to talk about what that word really means. ",

Then you have to try to backpedal and say that no, of course everyone gets that, but people are acting like \u201cBlack Lives\u201d don\u2019t matter. Which, I agree is an actual problem that needs to be addressed. But which reads poorly. The point gets buried down deep under a stack of other reactions which aren\u2019t intended. The people you are most trying to reach are the ones who get the message wrong, and it sticks in their craw. This isn\u2019t a good way to get people on your side. It\u2019s sort of like the current catchphrase \u201cLove Trumps Hate\u201d. Sounds good, assuming you read it as \u201cLove\u201d trumps \u201cHate\u201d. But there\u2019s a presidential candidate, now assumed president-elect, named Trump. So you might be saying Love \u201cTrump\u2019s Hate\u201d. IS love better than hate, or are we embracing the hate that Trump is spreading? This confusion is again the hallmark of a sloppy catchphrase invented on the spur of the moment. But nobody is taking that and defiantly turning it into the name of an organization. So far, anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "Although I generally support Black Lives Matter, I do have a few criticisms. At first, I thought that while they were effective at getting the word out about violence against black Americans, they lacked a cohesive approach towards policy change. Now that they do have a platform based around policy, I find it unwieldy and too large. For instance, I don\u2019t fully understand why their platform includes military cuts and a statement on climate change. I personally feel they would be better off allocating their resources to a focused policy and liaising with other activist-organizations that focus on issues like climate change. The launch of their platform was marred by a media focus on BLM\u2019s anti-Israel, pro-Palestine stance. As someone who is pro-Palestine, I totally get it \u2014 but still, is it really part of American domestic race issues? I also believe that organizations focusing on change in race in the U.S. will fare better in the long run if they can create bonds with white blue collar workers. Although race issues have a dimension beyond class struggles in the U.S., I also think that the white blue collar worker is the demographic to be most likely against racial equality in the U.S. Yet, many African Americans and lower-class Americans face similar struggles to access equal services and equal opportunities. As long as conservative politicians use race to antagonize lower-class Americans against minorities, it will be difficult for the country to truly integrate. Lastly, I would say that whenever I hear/read a statement by BLM activists, it always seems a little too idealistic \u2014 a little too much like the activism on college campuses. It might speak to my age that I don\u2019t always find that appealing or the best approach. I feel that some of the activists do not consider the wide-ranging audience of all demographics who might be listening. If they are truly to have a lasting national impact, I think they need to move beyond an internal language and shift to a broader, more powerful rhetoric. ",

Why is it a travesty that a cop kills or beats someone who is actively breaking the law but the young black kids who are shooting each other or dying from drug abuse are just sacrificed to the system on a daily basis? Layers and layers of corruption and racial tension stem so much deeper than a cop using excessive force because that's what they're trained to do. Do I believe the cops are targeting certain CLASSES of people? YES! These classes of people are not JUST black. They're poor. Because the true root of all evil is money. And to live without it is the ultimate sin. Police assume if you are poor you are a criminal. Poor people, like police, like assholes, come in all different colors. If BLM was a legitimate movement, what's the plan? Why does no one have step by step guidelines to make it better for blacks and other people targeted by ANYONE? Actually, I read an interesting article the other day about Martin Luther King Jr's plan. Yeah, he wrote it all out! And then he was assassinated. And that plan, that speech, exists still. It contains very legitimate legal procedures to reform police, economic, welfare, and educational systems. Yet no one ever gave it another shot. Is that white suppression? Maybe! But if it still exists and people know about it, maybe it's time to actually DO something. As Americans, we love our protests. Sit ins, stand ins, yelling slogans. For some reason, we genuinely believe that by sitting around and whining about what we don't like that we will get important things done. That, my friends, is American privilege. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me start the by saying that I agree with the concept that police shootings should ideally have no base in race or gender. With that said, the number one thing that prevents me from caring much about BLM is\u2026 the overwhelmingly more prevalent discrimination. Here is a breakdown of fatal police shootings by race and gender:  Notice anything? Now, keeping in mind that there are ~5.7 white people for every black person in the US, and roughly 1 man for every woman, we can calculate the following: If you are black, your chance of being killed is ~105/180*5.7 = 3.325x that of a white person.If you are male, your chance of being killed is roughly 365/20 = 18.25x that of a female.I\u2019m not saying that the protest is wrong. But when I see a black woman discussing how she\u2019s afraid to go out at night because of police, despite the fact that she\u2019s 1-(5/171*5.7) = 83% less likely to get shot than a white man, the racial aspect strikes me as rather superficial. I have no critique of the BLM advocacy; black people should not be killed by police at a higher rate than white people\u2026. But it\u2019s hard to get worked up about a movement where half of the people involved already have it much better than you do, and are campaigning to have it even better than they currently have it. If I\u2019m not motivated to protest the more egregious sexual discrimination for my own sake, then I really can\u2019t motivate myself to protest the lesser racial discrimination for theirs. ",

So, lying is not a good start for a movement. All lives matter. That\u2019s a non-racist politics, so the problem is violence, absence of understanding, not racism. Those are strong enough critiques for anyone to realize that this is a death at the birth situation. See\u2026 let\u2019s solve it\u2026 from now on, black people can no longer be killed, yeah, but neither red, white, or yellow, nor albinos, indeed, humans can\u2019t be killed by humans, intentionally, I mean. What is going to happen to the violent people, especially in law enforcement, if they decide to kill only the red, or yellow, they would choose the white instead? No, that\u2019s absurd, they continue to kill the poor, but not the black. The blacks are poorer because they were slaves back a century ago, but same happened to red, yellow, and white. The Slavers are rich people, not colored, their color is money, gold, diamonds, precious minerals, rocks, not trees, cattle, or people, that\u2019s blindness to us all. It\u2019s \u2026 ridiculous a campaign restraining rights to this or that color. We preserve culture, not colors, we\u2019re humans, all of us, from any color, and also albinos. Human\u2026 we are human, all of us and violence is against poor, rich black are not killed by the police with a knee on their neck. Let\u2019s face it, the problem is social, not race\u2026 We\u2019re one only species, each of the same kind and capabilities of any other. Let\u2019s not direct it to mediatic colorific business\u2026 Life is not a paint and if it was, what\u2019s so problematic with the colors God used to make us different beauties among ourselves? We\u2019re all different, and hypocrisy is the name of our common disease, our inherited plague, in ourselves, perhaps in the DNA itself, since we don\u2019t realize it for ourselves. The Sunlight makes our skins more yellowed at East, redder at West, more whitish those up North and darker at South because in the South the Sun spends more time than in the North, every year, every century, and perhaps\u2026 all the millenniums. The pyramids exhibit that prism, any pyramid, anywhere it\u2019s found, it\u2019s human-made, to understand we\u2019re Sunlight oriented on our skins. We\u2019re not blue, nor green, and green is the grass wherever it may be found, and some under the surface of the seas and our rivers. Color is abundant in nature, but not in humans? We need to pay more attention to who really we are. We\u2019re divine, with or without God, life is a present, always and \u2026 not our future. We are learning beings\u2026 and that\u2019s why we learn from our past. What color was Adam? And how about Eve? We\u2026 all descend from them. ",

They have every right to be angry, and I would be angry as Hell if I were in their shoes. Anger is not enough. Real change requires solutions. Solutions require understanding all sides of a dispute. Understanding requires people to hear each other out, and to articulate their experiences. If we as a society are going to solve this problem, we need to find answers to some key questions: How can we bring police officers and the communities they serve together, so that they know, understand, and can trust each other?How can we change the way civilians and police interact, so that everyone leaves these interactions alive?How can we channel the anger and mistrust into positive changes that make the sacrifices of the many good men and women on both sides who have died meaningful?BLM and all the other parties need to focus on those core questions. They need to sit down together and start working on the hard solutions. The vast majority of Americans want an end to the killing of black civilians. The vast majority of Americans want an end to the killing of police officers. Americans as a whole want solutions to this problem, and we need to make finding solutions the focus. I see anger, and I get that this anger is justified, but for these tragedies to mean anything, we need solutions. We need voices from all sides, and understanding of each other, to solve these problems. That needs to be the focus: how do we solve these problems. Not whose hashtag is better, not whose lives mean more or less, not even who did what wrong: how do we stop the killing and bring people together. The day that BLM makes that their focus is the day I will support them with all my heart. Until then, I can only shake my head in frustration at the many distractions people are fighting over. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s based on lies. Police do not kill blacks disproportionately, this is a lie based on faulty statistics. These statistics use general population but do not adjust for crime. There is also no evidence that these killings are racially motivated. 95% of those killed by police are male. Does this show that police hate males? Or is it because males commit most crime? Blacks make up 24% of those killed by police, but commit 27% of crimes, and about 30\u201350% of serious crimes. This lie is perpetuated by media reporting, who hardly ever report when whites or even Hispanics and Asians are killed by police, even though they are killed more frequently. Three people are killed by police every day, but a black person is only killed once every 1.5 days. This also does not adjust for age - the typical white person in America is 58 years old today, while the typical black person is 26 years old- who is more likely to be shot by police? The other lie is that police killings are a \u201cgenocide\u201d or \u201cpublic health crisis\u201d when the fact is that police make 10 million arrests per year and only 1,000 result in a shooting, that\u2019s 99.99% success rate. Out of the 1,000 shootings, over 90% were armed and threatening the officer, and out of the unarmed shootings that includes people trying to run over the officer with their car, reaching for the officer\u2019s weapon, fighting back with fists, etc. Of the unjustified shootings, most of the time the officer was charged. The goal of BLM is Marxist revolution. note- this is not to say racism, legacy of racism, and institutionalized racism in the justice/prison system do not exist in America. Or that crime is correlated with poverty. Or that police reform is not necessary, and that policing cannot be improved. However it must be noted that BLM does not directly address any of these things. Although they take in millions, even billions of dollars in donations, it seems like all BLM does is promote demonstrations in the street. ",

            "answer_text": "I encourage those in the BLM movement to take a page from the Black Panther Party, if they haven\u2019t already. I\u2019m writing of the original BPP here. The original Black Panthers used to give out tracts and pamphlets to community residents, particularly young black men, with printed advice on them about what to do if they were stopped by police. They would patrol communities and when they saw a resident stopped by police, they would watch from a legal distance to observe the encounter. This can be done far more easily these days with cameras. If the police officer noticed them watching and told them to move along, they would quote from the Constitution and from local statutes that described how a police encounter could be legally observed from a specified distance. The BLM could have tutorials for residents throughout the country on how to speak, act, and move when encountered by police. They could have legal teams they could call to help people with bail, trials, and filing complaints of police abuse. They certainly could fund raise to help offset legal costs that are incurred by community residents when arrested. And, they could provide instruction and guidance for residents to combat crime in their communities, including helping start town-watch patrols and setting up personal security systems. These are not criticisms, I know, but I feel there will probably plenty of critical views available. ",

Whenever I watch them in one-on-one interview settings, be it CNN or where ever, they usually come across like arrogant, one-note jackasses. I get the youthful energy and all of that. We all think we know more than we do at that age. But these guys have a way of turning off people who actually agree with them. Evidently, somewhere in their relatively short lifespans they bought into the notion that diplomacy and \u201cbig picture\u201d persuasiveness is a sign of weakness; and that somehow being narrow-minded and stubborn is a show of strength and character. I would advise that they consider the temperament of a gentleman like CNN\u2019s Van Jones, who is no doubt an advocate of the BLM cause, but leagues more personable to a larger swath of people. (2) The fact that BLM is more of a spiritual/sentiments/ideas movement, and not so much a full-fledged organization, leaves a lot of room for confusion. It seems that anybody can go out and do whatever in the name of BLM. Sometimes that\u2019s a good thing. Sometimes it\u2019s a really bad thing. (3) As others have said, it is difficult to applaud a movement dubbed \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d that seems so fixated on police-based homicides yet so dismissive of non-police homicides, which needless to say outweigh the former. Indeed, it comes off as a rather glaring contradiction at best. But if that\u2019s what the movement is about, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about, and what it isn\u2019t about is probably not worth a long, drawn-out squabble. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m generally a supporter. But I\u2019m not uncritical. A few come to mind: Some followers have tried to tie BLM with the anti-Zionist BDS movement. I would like to believe that this is based on ignorance of BDS\u2019s goals. In any event, I believe this tie is unnecessary, uncalled for, and in fact detrimental.At times, I believe some BLM supporters reflexively recirculate questionable narratives. I fully believe in the existence of systemic racism in many institutions in society. I also believe that altogether too many incidents of police violence involve racism. But I do not believe that one should rush to judgment or disregard evidence to the contrary. Yes, there should be examination of incidents. But it should be fair examination, not prejudgment. Critical appraisal of all allegations is essential for a movement to have moral authority.There are occasions where I find some \u2014 remember, the word is \u201csome\u201d, not \u201call\u201d \u2014 BLM supporters to be intolerant of viewpoints other than what they deem to be appropriate. This can take many forms, including insistence on particular jargon. In my view, this tends to lead to diminishment of authentic communication and the perpetuation of a sort of group-think.Every so often, I\u2019ll run into a BLM supporter who tries to tell me that I can\u2019t possibly understand any of the issues, or that I must necessarily defer to their point of view, merely because of the color of my skin. That\u2019s just silly.I emphasize: these are occasional and situational issues, and I should be viewed as generally a supporter of BLM. I tend to have considerably more, and louder, criticisms of their opponents. ",

Which, while certainly being a heart wrenching story, is entirely incorrect. When you beat a person\u2019s head into the sidewalk, you\u2019re inviting lethal force be used against yourself. Much of the movement has continued on in the same fashion. Ferguson Missouri was where I first became aware of the movement, following an altercation between Mike Brown and a police officer. For weeks the movement repeated the lie that he had his hands in the air when shot, while the coroners report showed otherwise. Ultimately, I believe that to be the biggest criticism of the movement. It\u2019s based on a victim-hood mentality that resorts to making the available evidence fit a pre-conceived idea, as opposed to allowing an investigation (or the evidence) come to light in a manner such that we can have a rationalized conversation on the topic.

I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019ve been lied to.Black people are statistically more likely to break the law at some point in their life. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re all criminals, or that they can\u2019t turn around. They\u2019re just more likely to.Black Lives Matter is a section of the Social Justice movement, which is the mother of Third Wave Feminism, and the notion that only Caucasians can be racist, since they supposedly are the only race that benefits from racism.Many of the boys and men killed by police officers had or still had ties to criminal activity at the time of their untimely death.The movement is indirectly responsible for the modern coining of the term \u201cwhite privilege\u201d, which is just not true. If it was, Barack Obama couldn\u2019t have been nominated as the American Democratic Party\u2019s lead candidate, or have been elected President of the Unites States altogether.Many protests for Black Lives Matter have become violent, yet the movement has been compared to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s, 60s, and early 70s.",

One of the 10 has to do with getting rid of community policing, but there are some huge benefits to community policing.Methods and Means. Some of the methods seem questionable. Some of this is that people take advantage of the movement. True non-violence protest wouldn\u2019t seem to spill over into this violence and chaos.I think the way the movement is framed creates lots of distractions, as opposed to focusing on the real issues.  I\u2019ll say the violence and chaos seems to depend a bit on the city, although there has been some everywhere. It\u2019s worth noting in the case of the early June outbreak, the primary issues were around 5 pm to midnight. Although, I think curfews were declared between 8pm to 10 pm in many of the cities. In Washington DC the extent of the violence and the source of that violence seemed to be mixed. I\u2019m glad to see that the 2nd Saturday of marches finally subside. The problem with the marches that turn violent is they only escalate the rationalization of the violence used against them. There are videos of individual groups doing good and these should be highlighted. Violence in the movement doesn\u2019t solve anything. And its terrrible, terrible PR for the movement.  To the extent that the leaders of BLM have failed to denounce violence and actually encourage it in various interviews and news coverage, Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s Letter from a Birmingham Jail is insightful as a critique. King in some sense is also a critique of the CRT model of approach to race issues. ",

Here\u2019s the reality: Most teens and young adults on the internet are not intentionally racist, they understand it is wrong and they strive to do better. Most adults and elderly too recognise a change and support it. There are racist people and those whom are racist will stay racist even if you scream until you\u2019re blue. When teens post photos or protest in the name of BLM, it reaches an audience of thousands of teens who are doing the exact same thing! They don\u2019t need to be convinced, they already are. The people that need to be convinced are the ones who can\u2019t be convinced and that is why the frustration within this movement is so evident, the sad truth is that whilst black lives matter, we will not be able to reach true equality within this generation. It will be the children of these internet savvy teenagers who will be raised to know that racism is UNACCEPTABLE. It will be their generation in which true equality will be founded. It is an ugly truth but a truth nonetheless. Yes, we must still fight for change, but the reality is this, BLM is an important cause that can\u2019t change the minds of those who make their cause needed. Racism is institutionalised in our society, we need to change our society and then we will rid ourselves of racism.  ",

Yet the media did not heisitate to put extra gas on the fire, after all that\u2019s how they make a living. And so there goes this so called BLM movement. Blaming won\u2019t help anyone. Unless the black community as a whole decides to make a change from within, the situation is not going to change. US is a liberal country, that means nobody should tell you what to do, but it also means nobody would help you unless you decide to help yourself first. Since helping you before you show your intention equals to telling you what to do. Like if I told any black people how they could put more decipline in themselves in order to improve their condition, then I were getting over myself. Unless they are already doing that. Yet if they are already doing that, there would be no need to say anything. ",

And because, you know, we're all equal before the law. Are people unable to think critically about the logical implications of what they say? This morning I woke up to a video of a husband and wife in NY trying to defend themselves from looters. 4 men then proceeded to beat them with fists and 2x4 planks of wood. This was an older woman, and I watched it from several different angles. I'm not even going to post the video. Given the expert intersectional unlogic that so many of my well-intentioned but ideologically deluded friends have provided for me, I am not allowed to opine that smashing innocent women in the face with a 2x4 isn't an acceptable protest or acceptable reaction to their grievance. I should just shut up and flog myself to rid myself of my privilege, apparently. This is just one example of the many ludicrous slogans repeatedly plastered over my feeds but the only one I feel like addressing at the moment, for cathartic reasons. ",

            "answer_text": "Black Lives Matter came about mostly because of the Mike Brown case in Ferguson, Mo. I know that wasn\u2019t their actual start, but that is when they picked up steam. This movement (or organization) claims that black men are being killed in disproportionate numbers when compared to white men. If you look solely at the numbers this is blatantly false. About twice as many white men are killed each year by cops than black men. If you dig just a tiny bit past that you\u2019ll see what they\u2019re talking about though. If you adjust the numbers by population you\u2019ll find that white men have a 0.000246% chance of being killed by a cop. That number more than doubles to 0.000567%. This is clearly proof that cops are racist against black men, right? After all, if you have a higher chance of being killed because you\u2019re black that means cops are bad. It might mean that, if you decided to stop your research exactly at the point where you find the numbers that you want to find. So let\u2019s look at it a little bit more. Men (white and black) have a 0.000608% of being killed by police and women have a 0.000042% chance. Huh, so men are killed at a rate of 15 times higher than that of women. Maybe they should rename the movement Male Lives Matter. ",

What BLM actually does: -Riot. -Block Roads. -Loot businesses during riots. -Condone through silence racial hate crimes done against Caucasians, such as #BLMKidnapping. -Complain about White Privilege. -Expect to be respected despite all of the above.

And just the other day a video came out of a young unarmed white man being killed by police in Fresno, California. New video shows portion of deadly Fresno police shooting \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d isn't focused enough, not to mention it makes people mad. It seems to me that the real issue is \u201cSuspects\u2019 Lives Matter,\u201d which sadly doesn't make a very good chant. Once someone is a suspect, some police officers seem to be so on edge that anything unexpected can be interpreted as a threat to their lives, and then anything can happen.

More effective policing would put a dent in that and save\u2026..black lives. The only lives BLM are concerned about are black folks killed by white police officers. That number was ten (10) last year. Turns out that 9 of the 10 were not unlawful. The tenth case was prosecuted. That black men are being gunned down in the street by racist police officers is just not true. It is a delusion perpetrated by BLM and related groups. BLM is a violent political group piggybacking on a black community long manipulated by the American left. the goal is, and always has been\u2026..power. ",

How hard is it to come up with slogans that protest racial injustice and police brutality that don\u2019t make conservative white people feel like they\u2019re being personally attacked, or (even better) actually appeal to the things they say they care about, like accountability and responsibility? There are more effective ways of getting your message out than a slogan that\u2019s going to antagonize people whose support you need to actually change things. ",

Honestly, they do more harm than good for their cause. I mostly agree in principal, but the execution is goddamn terrible.

Seeing their grievances as statistically plausible claims is a bit harder and then letting them drive the show with my backing is just really hard. ",

BLM has a lot of both throughout the world. Minority empowerment movements are nothing new, the 1960s and 1970s spawned many of them including the Black Panthers and the growth of the Nation of Islam to name a few. What makes BLM unique in my eyes are two things: the growing numbers of white people involved in their cause and of course my least favorite action the burning of American symbols and destruction of businesses (many ironically owned by minorities). The fact that they have recruited or attracted white people definitely separates them from other movements that didn\u2019t want to do that. The extreme radicals within their movement have not been called out by peaceful members in large part and that fact has placed them all in the eyes of many with other historical terrorist groups. ",

In fact, White criminals are killed by the police twice more often, both in total and per criminal.

Also, BLM used for a pretext the case of a felon who, as we know now, died from overdose while resisting arrest, and not by the officer.

We as black people are simply saying we matter, too. I would never discredit the life of someone else, especially based on their race. But, what is happening is, we are being refused to be treated as equals. We are being shot without question, jailed without evidence, and killed without reason. What is happening is a revolutionary movement that is going to become so powerful that no one can stop it. Either you are on our side or you are the enemy. Many lives will be shaped or destroyed based on the events which are about to take place. Racism needs to come to an end and equality needs to be given across the board. If this does not happen, I fear for the lives of those who side with hate. ",

Black Lives Matter is an important struggle, but when that war is won there are so many more battles to fight. The sooner we realise that the real enemy is fear, not hate, the sooner we can find a way to deafeat it.  ",
