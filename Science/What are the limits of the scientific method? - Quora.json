            "answer_text": "The modern scientific method is fairly well limited to the study of cause and effect within the four dimensional world that we appear to live in.  The scientific method does not seem to do well in attempting to answer other questions pertaining to existentialism or religion. Such philosophical questions may well apply to dimensions beyond our apparent four dimensional reality.           Many scientists seem to have the mistaken belief that because in the last few centuries the modern scientific method has successfully and rightfully undone or disproven so many former \"religious beliefs\" that therefore, no religious beliefs could possibly have any validity.  Furthermore, many such scientists seem to now have begun to carry this logic even further and to have started investing into science the same types of \"blind faith\" that were formally accorded primarily to religious beliefs.  \"Blind faith\" is nearly always problematic, both in religion, and even in science. For example, blanket pronouncements that the modern scientific method has already reasonably proven the extinction of consciousness upon the annihilation of the brain are a bit presumptuous as any such claim would necessarily have to be based upon the presumption that the exact nature of consciousness was already a reasonably well settled scientific matter.  Any quantum physicist will readily admit that the whole idea of what it means to be an observer, or being \"conscious\" is something that science has only recently just begun to crack the door open upon, and which is yet far far from being a well settled scientific matter. The modern scientific method can easily and handily point out the moment when a flame has extinguished itself.  This would be the moment when the production of heat ceases in the given instance of combustion.  In order for the modern scientific method to be capable of pointing out the moment when the ability to observe, or \"consciousness\" might be extinguished, it would also have to first have a similar understanding as to what exactly consciousness is. The modern scientific method correctly reveals that combustion is a heat producing process, and therefore it can easily monitor its presence or absence.   To this day, the modern scientific method has failed to enable a precise definition of, or a full understanding of the exact nature of consciousness, therefore how could the modern scientific method be capable of enabling the slightly presumptuous claim that the exact moment when consciousness is no longer (is extinguished) has been easily determined?  A recent study into exactly this question unequivocally proved that infact consciousness, with full awareness of one's surroundings, certainly is capable of persisting well after the shut-down of one's brain. Instead, many scientists seem to prefer to make the leap of faith that is required whenever anyone states anything to the effect that anything that does not support our \"credo of materialism\" is by definition impossible, and therefore false.  The credo of materialism being the belief that: \"nothing exists beyond time and space.\"  The same credo itself, becoming all the more ridiculous, as highlighted by the fact that most theoretical physicists even now acknowledge that there was indeed \"something\" that existed, even before time itself, \"time\" being widely recognized as only having started, as we currently understand it, at the time of the \"Big Bang\". Scientists who would make such sweeping claims about the supposed abilities of the modern scientific method to answer such philosophical questions would do well to instead acknowledge that the level of comprehension of the universe so far achieved by the modern scientific method, as Einstein once described, thus far resembles to him the level of understanding of a small child pondering over a great library, who has not yet even learned how to read. On the day that the disciplines of science, philosophy, and religion finally begin to properly recognize the value of one another, and begin to widely acknowledge their own respective limitations, perhaps only then will we begin to have a more truly whole and complete understanding of the universe which we inhabit.

            "answer_text": "Every theory that scientists produce is defined by its boundary conditions. This is a recognition that theories only apply to what they can apply to, so it would be pointless, for example, to take a hypothesis derived from Quantum Theory and try to use it to predict the behaviour of people buying onions. In the most general terms, much of our established science is based upon two principles: 1. That phenomena are consistent and reliable; and 2. That we can exercise complete control over the experimental situation. This has resulted in great success and amazing discoveries, leading to numerous useful applications in everyday life. But there are many phenomena that lie outside the boundaries defined by these principles \u2014 telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, hauntings, time slips, UFOs, glitches, and others less well defined. Many people who regard themselves as scientists, or at least supportive of scientific method, will automatically reject such occurrences, and instead of explaining them will try to explain them away. They are not rejected because there is no evidence for them \u2014 indeed there is a mountain of evidence \u2014 but because they violate the two basic principles and cannot be predicted or controlled. So we have a situation where some scientists reject certain phenomena because they cannot be investigated as other phenomena can, while others have tried to study at least some of them using experimental means. All we can do otherwise is to collect data and employ inductive methodologies to derive hypotheses about their mode of operation. This situation will likely continue for decades to come. ",

            "answer_text": "What is science? It is the process of making a hypothesis, and then testing, observing, repeating, and recording the findings if the hypothesis is true or not. If testing is done vigorously at different conditions and times by different people, we can probably conclude that the hypothesis is correct. Note, though, science deals with things within the universe - all time, space, matter and energy. The laws of motion, gravity, relativity, quantum mechanics, etc. all deal with matters within the known universe. Science does not deal with the metaphysical - things that transcend all time, space, matter, and energy. Science, by its very nature, is limited, even if can explain the things we do not know now. It cannot explain everything. It can explain the process of how things come about and develop, but it cannot explain the agency and reason for the process. As an example, science can explain why the water in a kettle boils. But it cannot explain the reason for my motivation for turning on the kettle in the first place. Science also cannot cause anything to happen. Science is observed, say as the gravitational law, but gravity itself cannot cause anything. Science is intrinsically descriptive, not prescriptive. Science describes what happens in reality, but it does not cause things to happen in reality. Laws of physics don\u2019t have causal power and cannot make things, create things or cause things. The law of gravity doesn\u2019t actually cause your body to remain on earth. What it does is it explains how your body remains on earth. The gravitational force is what keeps your body on earth. The gravitational law simply explains how the force acts, not causes it to happen. All laws, including scientific laws, as far as we can see and observe, come from a lawmaker. Laws are not accidents. They come from a mind. Science, as humans know it, is only discovered as we learn more about our world. Scientific laws existed before we discovered them. Where did the laws of gravity, thermodynamics, magnetism, chemistry, physics, quantum mechanics, etc. come from? When we arrive at a traffic intersection and discovered that there are traffic directions, lights and signs, we know that someone created those directions, lights and signs. They did not pop up by themselves. There were government and police people who created those traffic laws. Scientific laws are not physical in nature. They are not tangible. They can be seen through physical objects, but the law themselves are non-physical. They are mental concepts - which comes from a mind. They were not just accidents. They come from an intelligent mind who puts all things together. Scientific proof or evidence is not the only way we can have any evidence of something. Science is based on gathering data of repeatable and observable events and then make a conclusion about those events. But many things around us are not repeatable. Apart from science, there are also common sense, maths, logic, philosophy, forensics, and history. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. Science is truly a wonderful tool in the quest to understand reality, however it has limits. Many people tend to forget the scientific method has limits and try to explain our reality using science alone, which will inevitably hit brick walls due to its limitations. Here are some limits of the scientific method off the top of my head: It\u2019s limited to what we can control.It\u2019s limited to falsifiable concepts.It\u2019s limited by our current understanding.It\u2019s limited to the material world.It\u2019s limited to what we can test repeatedly in a lab.It\u2019s limited by what we can observe/record (i.e. the quality of our testing equipment).Science can, and has been, limited by the pre-existing beliefs/biases of those attempting to apply it.Worst of all, it\u2019s limited to discoveries that happen to be made by those who have been officially accepted by the scientific community due to their prior, often unrelated, academic accomplishments.Science is perhaps the most powerful tool we have when attempting to understand our reality better. However, those who treat science as a religion or the be-all and end-all of intellectual progress are artificially limiting themselves (and others) significantly. They are also opening themselves and others up to the potential of mass manipulation if they automatically believe anything from the scientific community and nothing else. Any time that only one source is assumed to be correct, while all others are automatically ignored, that creates an incredibly high potential for mass manipulation or concealment of information. In my experience, those who view science that way will dismiss questions that science can\u2019t answer as though they don\u2019t exist. The odd thing is these questions *must* have an answer and that fact can be proven scientifically, but if science alone is incapable of finding the answer then they dismiss the question (and potential answers) entirely. Many of the most important questions about reality can\u2019t be solved using the scientific method due to its many limitations. That does not make the question any less real or less important and it doesn\u2019t change the fact the question must have a real answer. That answer must in turn affect the rest of reality in many ways\u2026 and that is being dismissed too. ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean the scientific method itself, there is basically nothing wrong with it. However, if you mean, \u201cis science perfect?\u201d the answer is no. Science is really great at science, but it is less great at a few things: Science is in important respects less conservative than philosophy. Which basically means that to understand something it needs to make mistakes. To a philosopher, if there are possible logical errors involved then that means none of the results are trustworthy. For the philosopher, Hume\u2019s Arrow and the Cartesian Demon are better forms of Occam\u2019s Razor, thereby making science impotent to draw real forms of knowledge. Traditionally science can respond though that \u2018It\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got\u2019.However, another weakness is in predicting or even supporting after-the-fact major rationalistic conclusions. Science might say, well if you could even consider God as a hypothesis, the system has to be wrong. But it turns out, that rules out a lot of rationalistic systems, because a lot of rationalistic systems believe in something called ideas, which can at least be thought about as-if-they-exist even if they don\u2019t. But to the scientists that\u2019s wrong, and in that way they are assuming that many ideas don\u2019t exist. And another point is that if there is knowledge, true genuine knowledge that is not supported by the scientific method, or even not supported by the habits of scientists, then this is assumed to be wrong simply because it does not have obvious empirical evidence in the laboratory. This is yet another way that science could be wrong. For example, some knowledge systems, even ones that seem arbitrary to mathematics may predict abstract information structures which are just as important as scientific results with empirical data. In this way, rationalism along with conservatism may be being ignored.Not to mention that B.F. Skinner made his daughter live in a cage as a Behaviorist experiment, and scientists are some of the biggest torturers of animals, which seems to speak against their legitimacy from a sheer survival standpoint. What would such a person do when given more dangerous responsibility? It looks not infinitely apart from psychopathy. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a method, not a result: \u201ca method of procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.\u201d The scientific method is a method, but many people think of it as an answer. Belief in the scientific method needs to be completely separated from belief in any conclusions drawn from using the scientific method. The method is a continual process, creating new hypotheses, generating new experiments, observing and measuring new results, coming to new conclusions. The scientific method does not find facts, it attempts to validate hypotheses, to link theory and practice, so that we can move forward to find and study a new hypothesis. Often, the scientific method upends the hypothesis being tested, much to the dismay of the researchers. The shortcoming of the scientific method is that it tells the truth - even truths we are not so eager to hear. There are many more shortcomings that come to light when we actually attempt to put the scientific method into practice. Most medical uses of the scientific method, for example, are specifically designed to PROVE the efficacy and safety of a new medical product. The scientific method is \u2018used\u2019, or perhaps we should say \u2018abused\u2019, to ensure the answer necessary for marketing. When someone has a lot of money at stake in the result of a clinical study, the method quickly becomes unscientific. Unfortunately, there is no method called the \u201cunscientific method\u201d, it\u2019s called the profit motive instead. We often think of clinical studies as part of the scientific method, but for the most part, they are generally conducted counter to many principles of the scientific method. There are many ways for this to go wrong, to fail the principles of the scientific method. When clinical studies claiming to use the scientific method show undesirable results, they are ignored, not published, and new studies are designed to show desirable results. The scientific method is based on openness. When a clinical study shows that a new medicine benefits x percent of patients, there is no attempt to understand why 100-x percent of patients were not benefited, nor even to understand why x percent did find benefit. The scientific method proceeds with a new hypothesis, to better understand what happened and why. The clinical study method proceeds to the next steps of approval and marketing. Most clinical studies make no attempt at compete understanding, because they make no attempt to cure. Medicines don\u2019t actually cure diseases, if you don\u2019t believe it - check the label. Try to find a medicine that says \u201ccures\u201d on the label. The only medicines that claim to cure are those aimed at diseases caused by parasites. The word \u201ccure\u201d does not appear in many medical dictionaries, and cure is not defined in any medical treatment reference text. Clinical study\u2019s use of the scientific method is not interested in cures. Cures don\u2019t sell and medicines don\u2019t cure. The legal method often overrides the scientific method - especially in clinical studies. New medicines are patented, and people who do not own the patent are forbidden, and constrained legally, from using the scientific method to conduct studies of the medicine and its effects. This is not science. Most of the current limitations of the scientific method come not from the scientific method, but from the way we abuse the scientific method, and the results of the scientific method, for propaganda purposes - to sell medicines that make no claim to cure, that cannot cure, and do not cure any disease. to your health, tracyFounder: Healthicine ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question! The scientific method is limited to studying empirical and utterly shareable experiences of nature such that nature causes nature, and there are no metaphysical or supernatural causal explanations, such as supreme beings, souls, ghosts, spirits, etc. The necessity for universal replicability limits the scientific method. The results of measurements, tests, or experiments should be potentially demonstrable to anyone, anywhere, and anytime. There is no Chinese, French or American theory of gravity, just like there is no Jewish, Buddhist, Muslim, or Christian calculus. The scientific method is bound to the limits of detectability to achieve mutually agreed upon experiences of nature. For example, a predictive or retrodictive theory suggests \u201cit ought to be there if we look.\u201d In concert with this is a consideration of whether we are truly seeing how nature behaves, or are we seeing the results of test and measurement instrumentation. Do we \u201ccause\u201d what we see? The scientific method is limited to making probability statements and is not about certainty. Inductive logic, quantum mechanics, and chaos theory definitively teach us this. All scientific theories exist on a continuum of probability ranging from falsity (storks deliver babies) to near certainty (heliocentric solar system). The scientific method is limited by its root paradigm that presumes the scientific explanation of nature is necessarily rational. This gave Einstein a \u201ccosmic religious feeling.\u201d Why must nature be rationally explainable? These are my initial thoughts; there could be other limits. I will enjoy thinking about this more. Thank you for the question. See my eBook (ISBN: 978-1-7924-0855-7): Critical Thinking in a New Information Age: The Nature of Intellectual Inquiry ",

            "answer_text": "Reality. The scientific method is bound by definition and by practice to what is real. This backs the very notion of what it means to be scientific. Many scientists underestimate how limiting this is. Reality excludes our imagination, perception, and intuition. The scientific method fails to entertain us with Harry Potter, to account for our thoughts, and fails to justify our gut. If anything, non-fiction is boring, the universe without experience is lifeless, and life without intention is death itself. Equally, many non-scientists underestimate the power of science. We can deconstruct Harry Potter for how it is entertaining, we can dissect the brain and reverse engineer how our perception really works, and we can use science to correct our intuitions to accurately align with what is possible and what must be done. The limits of science aren't in what, where, or how. It is in why. This can be seen through the language of science. What is in common with how all science is taught or documented? Science can only speak in the third person. It can never speak in the first or second, because it can never speak on behalf of the mindful and intentional. All documentaries are in third person unless they are journeys. The scientific method can never explain why it is we do what we do. It cannot explain the self. But does that make us unreal? Far from it. It is however the limit of what can be covered in science class. Science can never be about one person, nor a group of individuals, and its only intuition is to quickly dismiss all of us -- the mindful, the intentional, and the living. ",

Neither the scientific method nor computers have stopped evolving. Just as we are continually innovating and improving computer technology, we are also exploring and improving the philosophical principles, mathematical tools and the balance of techniques that provide optimal predictive and explanatory power intrinsic to the scientific method.Differing scientific contexts require different configurations of the scientific method just as differing computational tasks require differing types of computers. Just as the CPUs in gaming computers are best in the context of the need for rapid graphics rendering, differing configurations of the principles and techniques of the scientific method are optimal for differing realms of science. The face of the optimal scientific methodology is far different in cosmology than it is in psychology. We\u2019ve just started teasing out which precise configurations of the scientific method work best in which contexts.Just as we can\u2019t predict the manifestation and utility of computers very far into the future, we can not predict what elements might be added to improve the efficacy of the scientific method, nor can we know what new domains of knowledge we might eventually apply scientific methodology to. Just as the power and utility of computers we experience now was unimaginable three decades ago, it is very likely the power and application of the scientific method a few decades from now will be quite surprising. And the introduction of AI as an aid in analyzing data and generating and testing hypotheses will likely significantly accelerate this evolution of the scientific method.",

You can use it to find your lost car keys, but it does not apply directly, for example, in questions of optimal value, effect, or existence. Second, the Scientific Method works by elimination; you can arrive at the 'right' conclusion only if it is one of the hypotheses that you have considered. You can't find your car keys if they happen to be in a place that you do not consider. Third, the Scientific Method is subject to the practical limitations of the practitioner. For example, if you are blind, you cannot consider hypotheses that require you to have sight. You cannot constrain the nature of the past if you cannot go back into the past to validate those constraints. You cannot constrain the nature of reality if you cannot provide any necessary link between your perceptions and reality. Fourth, the Scientific Method generally assumes that the test environment is static. You may not be able to find your car keys if someone keeps moving them. ",

Sometimes, when the stakes are high enough, people are tempted to bend or ignore or exaggerate data. Historically this hasn\u2019t been a major problem, because there wasn\u2019t much to gain from it.

There may be \u201cfake news\u201d or conceivably even \u201calternative facts\u201d but there\u2019s no fake data: just data and garbage.The bigger problem is that it also relies on the review by scientific peers and preferably also on replication. But given a choice between breaking new ground vs. replicating old results, under the constraint of limited resources, it is not attractive to replicate old results. As a result there are lots of studies with controversial interpretations that have not yet been verified as reliable.",

In my opinion, this just changes the order of operations, not the operating themselves. There are no major shortcomings, but minor shortcomings are a source of endless debate. Experimentation is not always possible; uncertainty is hard to measure; and since there is no way to observe (or to record) everything, there is no way to be certain that all relevant results get recorded.

How it does that, exactly\u2026 still some mysteries there.

            "answer_text": "Before I begin my answer, just want to clarify, some people think Science is all about Physics, Chemistry, Biology etc and Social \u201cScience\u201d is not a Science. The definition of Science as as expected by the nature is adaptive and it means \u201cSystematic Study of any natural domain\u201d, it need not be linear in nature as Traditional or Empirical Methods (Scientific Methods if you will). To answer your question, as already many people have mentioned, Scientific Methods are best on Closed system where multiple factors are tested with one factor variable and other fixed. This helps in understanding effect/impact of the factor in consideration on the system in test. This is very expensive and time consuming method, something like Brute force attack. Also it requires process to remain constant and it is tried to have minimal external impacting factors. If anything is missed, you are done. This is very difficult to conduct on Live/Real time environment, where that \u201cexternal impacting\u201d factor is Time. Everything is ever changing. You cannot hold a group of people and change one behavior at a time and study something. It is possible but not feasible (humans grow and die!!). So the best way is Statistical Methods and Data Analysis. Where you collect as much data sets as possible and try to find correlation between variables. Good thing about this is, as new data is available you can tune in the previous models. Thus Statistical Methods and Data Analysis have become one of the Scientific Methods, just as intended to be adaptive. ",

The reason for this is the nature of the scientific epistemology. Science is based on the methodological naturalistic epistemology. This epistemological model is limited to naturalistic question. Preternatural entities are outside of methodological naturalistic epistemology. They (preternatural entities) might find their natural place in reform epistemology. Moreover, science is in the business of probability and not facts. That is, a scientific theory might be 99% accurate but not 100% (scientific theories can be changed if need be via new data). Therefore, science does not give us the truth about the world but the probable truth about the world. I believe it\u2019s fair to say that science (or the scientific method) is limited. ",

For example, if you want to use strength of religious faith as a dependent variable, your study will be undermined by the intangible nature of your dependent variable. It may be meaningful to a theologian, measuring it empirically may be an insurmountable problem. If you have an independent variable like adherence to a strict moral code when others are not watching, you have to measure something that cannot be verified by other observers. Religion does not have to be involved for a question to be unsuitable for scientific research. Anytime a construct that can't be reliably measured is involved or depends for its existence on assumptions which cannot be tested, you are outside the range of the scientific method. ",

Fortunately, it's not the only tool in scientists' belts; they will often do exploratory, qualitative work to generate new ideas. That can be theoretical, or survey-based, or informally trying different things  and observing the results. The theoretical and survey-based work can be rigorous enough to add to our scientific knowledge base, but the informal \"trying different things\" needs to be followed up with rigorous experiments utilizing the scientific method in order to be meaningful.
