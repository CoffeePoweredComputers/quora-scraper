            "answer_text": "I would say that the condition you describe is not normal. Everyone should be able to view clearly with both eyes. Unless of course you need prescription glasses. On the other hand, if you are talking about having a dominant eye: that is normal. And by that I mean that when you need to aim for, say a microscope or crosshairs, your dominant eye will tend to take that task. A very high percentage of people will have a right dominant eye, but we, the lefthanded ones, tend to have a left dominant one. I hope this answers your question. ",
