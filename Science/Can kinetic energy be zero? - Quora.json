            "answer_text": "Can kinetic energy be zero? Seeing that absolute zero temperature can only be approached and not achieved, the kinetic energy, equal to zero, of an object has never been achieved, only approached, even for relatively motionless objects, because the atoms and molecules which make up the object aren\u2019t motionless until they achieve absolute zero, which hasn\u2019t been achieved yet and probably never will. It\u2019s like Zeno\u2019s rabbit; if each hop only halves the distance to the goal line, the rabbit will never reach the goal line. So kinetic energy can\u2019t be zero. ",

            "answer_text": "Kinetic energy is a zero when an object is entirely motionless. A block of wood rests on a lab bench. Is it motionless? Only when considered with respect tot he lab bench, but as a part of a planet that is not only rotating about its axis but also revolving about its star and rotating with that star\u2019s solar system about the central black hole of the Milky Way Galaxy which itself is . . . and on and on and on.

            "answer_text": "One agreement is that an object, motionless, has no kinetic energy. on paper this may be true, but in reality, nothing is truly motionless, from being on a rotating planet, to having internal heat. but, for the sake of argument, and passing high school physics, an object must have mass and be in motion to have kinetic energy.
