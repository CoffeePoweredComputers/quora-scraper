            "answer_text": "When soap molecules are present in water, the molecules arrange themselves in the form of a cluster in such a manner that their hydrophobic ends are away from the water molecules and their hydrophilic or ionic ends are towards the water molecules. This is known as micelle formations. Cleaning action of soaps: The dirt (oil and grease) present on clothes is organic in nature, and insoluble in water. Hence, it cannot be removed only by washing with water. When soap is dissolved in water, its hydrophobic ends attach themselves to the dirt and remove it from the clothes. Then, the molecules of soap arrange themselves in micelle formation and trap the dirt at the centre of the cluster. These micelles remain suspended in water like particles in a colloidal solution. The various micelles present in water do not come together to form a precipitate as each micelle repels the others because of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dust particles remain trapped in the micelles (which remain suspended), and are easily rinsed away by water. Hence, soap micelles remove the dirt by dissolving it in water. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the mechanism of cleaning action of soap? Soap in its various forms is simply a wetting agent or surfactant. Other forms of soap exist not just the solid fat based ones we are familiar with. Liquid soaps have a diferent chemical composition but the same function. Many plant leaves have the capacity for saponification or wetting surfaces. Gardeners also use surface wetting agents to wet the plant to get fungicides to stick to the surface. Mostly we use soap to wet surfaces so that dirt or other contamination can be removed because it becomes wet and detaches. One action of soap as a wetting agent is to emulsify oil or fat so it can mix with water. This is most useful in washing greasy dishes or pots and pans or getting grease out of clothes. While emulsified the fat does not cling to surfaces so dishes and glass come out clean and non greasy. On body surfaces natural body oils are emulsified by soaps or detergents. People with dry skin usually have less natural oil on the skin so washing with soap or shampoo can further dry out their skin. ",
