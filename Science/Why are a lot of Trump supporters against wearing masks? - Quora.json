            "answer_text": "A long time ago, Trump\u2019s campaign and (later) staff took up the seemingly impossible task of making truth political. Now, if you believe truth, you\u2019re a libtard, and if you want to be a card-carrying conservative, you must essentially blanket-reject science. The only acceptable facts are \u201calternative\u201d ones, which can be identified by having come out of Trump\u2019s mouth and, also, by being false. Real facts are liberal propaganda. Universities in particular exist to brainwash your children and turn them into libtards who make a lot of money and don\u2019t do what they\u2019re told anymore (sinners). In the modern world, this requires impressive mental gymnastics, so by the time your mind is flexible enough to partake of the wisdom of the Right Wing, it is also flexible enough to believe that everyone with an education level beyond high school is simultaneously in a giant globe-spanning conspiracy to take away your guns, destroy freedom, make your light-bulbs dim, make you flush twenty times and rape your children in bathrooms, in order of apparent levels of giving-a-hoot. There are only two sides in American politics right now. Trump and his team is on one side, and everyone with any kind of expertise in any subject are on the other side. These sides are carefully maintained, because Trump doesn\u2019t have any ability to bring people together. He\u2019s only useful as a politician if he has a \u201cthem\u201d to attack. \u201cThem\u201d at any given time is the last person to contradict him in public (however accidentally - many of his past staff have been tripped up by Trump changing his mind between his morning Tweets and his evening ones). Right now, all the people contradicting him in public are doctors and infectious diseases experts. So wearing a mask is a political statement now, because you are taking the advice of experts over that given by Trump, which demonstrates disloyalty. Please don\u2019t inject bleach into your lungs. Please wear a mask in public. Stay safe. ",

            "answer_text": "First, what exactly IS a \u201cTrump Supporter\u201d? If I agree with at least ONE of his policies, am I a \u201cTrump Supporter\u201d? Do I have to take a special pledge, or a test? Is there an officially/universally accepted definition of \u201cTrump Supporter\u201d somewhere that I have missed? If there\u2019s no official definition of \u201cTrump Supporter\u201d, how do you know if \u201ca lot\u201d of them do or don\u2019t wear masks? I don\u2019t know if the premise of your question is true, but if it is then I would have an explanation. It\u2019s common knowledge that Republicans in general are for \u201cless government\u201d, wanting less interference in our personal lives and rights. Keep your hands off my guns, don\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do, as long as it doesn\u2019t actually infringe on the rights/lives of others. The news media outlets have done a world of harm by misrepresenting the truth. So much so that \u201cthe truth\u201d now has a brand: Left and Right. As if there can be two different realities. There has been so much disinformation regarding Covid, on *BOTH* sides, that it is hard to trust science, since science now also has a brand of Left or Right. A lot of libtards like to shout about how great they are at following \u201cscience\u201d and how stupid they think their conservative counterparts are for questioning things and rebelling against \u201cthe man\u201d because it\u2019s just another potentially pseudo authoritarian set of ideas and philosophies used to control us as a people through fear, uncertainty, and doubt. I am one of those who likes to question everything, pull things apart, find the bias and motivation behind why people do and say what they do. You might even call me a \u201cTrump Supporter\u201d. However, I wear a mask in public. But I understand why others might choose not to. ",
