            "answer_text": "This question lacks enough information to give a quality answer. In my limited experience thin blankets are about 60% of the weight of a heavy blanket. Thus 2x60% is heavier than a single heavy blanket and would be warmer. Heat is lost both above and below.. two thin blankets joined into a sleeping bag might be warmer. But rolling yourself up like a cigar in one or two blankets might be warmer still. Moisture: moisture is the bane of keeping warm and comfortable at home or camping. Sleeping bags used in the winter can double their weight as the accumulation of perspiration passing through the blanket is trapped and accumulates in the insulating fabric. In such cases two thin blankets allow the blanket to air out and dry better. Insulation compression as woven and constructed: Tightly woven \u2018heavy\u2019 blankets might not have the trapped air voids that a less heavy blanket and weight being equal two thin blankets might be warmer. The weight of blankets on the market will often be a reflection of the material used. Thin cotton vs. heavy wool and materials have different insulating qualities. Lacking more information I would opt for two thiner blankets. Joining two blankets might eliminate the ability to add or remove layers to match the need as the environment changes. If the two were offered side by side a visual inspection would make it obvious which was \u201cthicker\u201d and thickness is commonly warmer. Lacking the ability to visually inspect for \u201cloft\u201d this is a pig in a poke question. When weaving or making a blanket with a specific material there is an ideal density. A heavier blanket might be less insulating per unit weight than a pair of thinner but optimum woven blankets. Speculating is foolish\u2026 it is easy to test with a thermometer, hot (or cold) water bottle and timer. Fill up a pair of 2 liter bottles with hot tap water at the same temp. Place under the single heavy blanket and two layers of thin blanket and check the temp some time later. Modern thermal-couple sensors allow time and temp curves\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Because the blankets don't insulate. Air insulates. That's a simplification, but it's generally true. Stagnant air is a very, very good insulator, far better than any solid or liquid that I know of (air only transmits heat effectively when its moving). The vast majority of insulating materials you'll find work by simply trapping air as effectively as possible. That's certainly of the fibers in blankets. Given blankets of the same material, how well they hold in warmth should relate directly to how much thickness is there. If you have two blankets of half the thickness of a thicker blanket, the insulating power should be the same. BUT, the two thinner blankets will hold an additional pocket of air between them, and that thickness of air provides additional insulation. As a rough estimate, you could look at the total thickness of the two blankets, including the air between them. A single blanket would have to be as thick as all of that to be roughly equal in warmth. ",
