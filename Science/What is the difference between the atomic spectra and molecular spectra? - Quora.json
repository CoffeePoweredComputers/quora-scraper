            "answer_text": "Atomic spectra are the transitions of electrons between electronic energy levels in isolated atoms. They are affected by interactions of the transitioning electrons with the nuclei spins and with the other electrons in the atom.Molecular spectra involve transitions in molecules with two or more atoms [either the same or different]. Since the valence electrons are now in different orbitals from the atomic orbitals and the orbital structure has changed the electronic transitions are different. However, inner electron transitions[ Xray spectroscopy] remain the same as the atomic spectra. Molecular spectra have additional modes, rotational and vibrational that are a function of the molecular structure. The modes are observed discretely usually in the infrared, microwave and radio frequencies and are also fine structure imposed on electronic transitions. [Because of this overlap of modes molecular spectra are broader in frequency range than atomic spectra.] Also included are the magnetic spectra Electron Spin Resonance and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance that study the energy states of magnetic nuclei in an imposed magnetic field. The various molecular spectra provide information on the molecular structure of a compound and are invaluable in studying molecular structure, internal conformations and interactions in molecules, interactions between molecules, reaction kinetics, qualitative and quantitative analysis, and probably many uses I'm ignorant of. Each is a study in its own right and most chemists have a working or detailed knowledge of at least some of them. ",

            "answer_text": "Atomic spectroscopy concerns only the properties of atoms, whereas molecular spectroscopy concerns the molecules which are infinitely more numerous. With atomic spectroscopy you can find the nature and the amounts of a given element in your sample. Molecular spectroscopy concerns all the interaction of electromagnetic waves with the matter and gives you much more advice than atomic spectroscopy especially about chemical functions, structure of matter. Hope this helps! ",
