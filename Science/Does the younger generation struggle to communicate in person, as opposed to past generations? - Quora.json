            "answer_text": "Yes but no. Given we use technology more now then we ever did before ex: phones, computers, etc, this can prevent us from looking up and socialising in person, however because of these, it allows us to talk to our friends even when we come home, video chat our parents while we go to college, meet new people, etc. If you\u2019ve ever been in high school recently you rarely see students sitting alone on their phones unless its their alone time to take a break, but overall many kids have friends, and use their phones to continue conversations with those who aren\u2019t around to verbally communication. Because of technology, now those who have social anxiety have a chance to be able to communicate with others easier without causing anxiety attacks, while job/schooling allows them to work on the social anxiety. There\u2019s a healthy balance that allows us to talk in person, and continue conversations with those that aren\u2019t around us while allowing those who can\u2019t necessarily talk, let it be because social anxiety, being mute, deaf, or disabled, then technology allows them to have a say.

            "answer_text": "I have experienced the individuals from the younger generation that sit behind computers all day playing games or in chat rooms, or perhaps on their cell phone constantly, run into some sort of invisible impediment when they find themselves around people in social situation or in public. My guess is that there is an ambient sense of security behind a device, or maybe there is mkre confidence with an ability to edit your interactions, or maybe the lag allows them to develop perfect responses. There seems to be something lost when people arent exposed to embarrassment, failure or having to improvise on the spot. In addition the interpersonal aspects of body language and other non-verbal cues seem to be missing. ",

            "answer_text": "I see it differently. Before I phones there was a subset of society who had social anxiety. They can communicate much better by texting than face to face. To them the Iphone is a boon. So I think in that sense there are fewer socially isolated kids than before. There are kids who can express better in writing than face to face. Maybe those are the ones that are being counted as struggling to communicate in person. They would have had to struggle anyway. The other thing to note is that thoe who like to communicate in person use the iphone less. Or the FB page less than those who had a problem to start with. ",

            "answer_text": "Young people have in general always had some difficulty through a lack of life experience. Many young Americans do seemingly struggle a bit more now - and that is a result of bad parenting and an over-reliance on devices. On the other hand, those raised by good parents, the ones that required good face to face communication skills and didn\u2019t slack on home communication generally are no worse than others. Much like the butterfly emerging from chrysalis, try and try again, and learning from the failures, is how you overcome social anxiety and in turn, make yourself more able to engage in mature and intimate relationships.

I would challenge them to go a day a week w/o the phone when it is not absolutely necessary and they might find out it's not as necessary as thought. ",

The younger generation now is always on their phone texting, but when they finally truly interact with the ones they have been on their phone but now in real life, they would either feel awkward or embarrassed because they\u2019re not used to it. I would know because I'm part of the younger generation, but this never happened to me because i rarely use my phone, but i have seen and heard my friends having this problem. ",
