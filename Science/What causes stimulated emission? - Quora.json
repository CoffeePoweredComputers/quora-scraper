            "answer_text": "One could probably cheat and argue via a time reversal symmetry,but here is a hopefully less evasive answer: An eigenstate is roughly one in which a particle can sit in comfortably without jumping into another state. Now for atoms that constitute a laser, the atomic levels are eigenstates when there are no electromagnetic fields present. The presence of an electromagnetic field (light) changes the hamiltonian that an electron sees. That is--> the electron does not just see the nucleus any more it now also sees the electromagnetic field. The state in which an electron sits in an atomic level without being kicked out is now no more an eigenstate/stationary state. In fact the electromagnetic wave is varying in amplitude very rapidly at its frequency. The true \"solution\" of the Hamiltonian in the presence of this electromagnetic wave is now a state in which the electron is kicked up and down the atomic levels. When it is \"kicked\" up it absorbs a photon and when it is kicked down, it emits a photon. The point is that photons disrupt the pretty little steady states that electrons sit in around the nucleus. This disruption does not care about whether the electron initially began in an excited or lower state. Thus you have both emission and absorption caused by the presence of light. If you desire more rigor you should read up Fermi's Golden Rule/ Time Dependent Perturbation Theory in your favorite quantum mechanics book. ",
