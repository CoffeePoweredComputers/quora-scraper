            "answer_text": "Physics is a driving force for technologies as the advanced physical experiments require extreme conditions and apparatus creating and controlling these conditions. It is specially seen in the domain of the high energy particles physics which requires the edge technologies to perform the experiments and as a byproduct develops or even invents the new technological solutions. At CERN, the doors are wide open for technology transfer\\ ",
