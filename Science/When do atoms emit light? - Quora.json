            "answer_text": "The electrons in an atom can only occupy certain allowed energy levels. When an electron drops from a higher energy level to a lower one, the excess energy is emitted as a photon of light, with its wavelength dependent on the change in electron energy. Explanation: The electrons in an atom can only occupy certain allowed energy levels. This was one of the early results of quantum mechanics. Classical physics predicted that a negatively charged electron would fall into a positively charged nucleus emitting a continuous spectrum of light as it did so. This is obviously not the case as if it were there would be no stable atoms. It was discovered later that this didn't happen because electrons can only occupy discrete energy levels within the atom. When an electron drops from a higher energy level to a lower one, the excess energy is emitted as a photon of light. Only certain energy levels are allowed, so only certain transitions are possible and hence specific wavelengths are emitted when an electron drops to a lower energy level. Conversely, an atomic electron can be promoted to a higher energy level when it absorbs a photon. Again because only certain transitions are allowed, only certain wavelengths can be absorbed. ",

            "answer_text": "First, we need to understand that all tangible bodies in the universe emit energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. This energy is perceived by the human eye as light. When we say that the bodies emit energy, we mean that the atoms constituting the body emit energy. Now, even though we have established the fact that atoms emit electromagnetic radiations, we can\u2019t always see this light. The reason we usually cannot observe this radiation is that bodies at room temperature(and consequently their atoms) emit predominantly light from the infrared spectrum, which is not visible to the naked eye. When these atoms reach high temperatures, e.g. when metals are heated the radiations emitted by them are in the visible spectrum. In these cases we can see the bodies emitting light and say that the atoms are emitting light. ",
