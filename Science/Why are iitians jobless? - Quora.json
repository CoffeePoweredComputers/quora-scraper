            "answer_text": "I am unemployed. I started my own company after college. It was running good and then things took ugly turn and it closed down. Technically I remained unemployed for a year. I did not try to find jobs nor am I sure if anyone will be interested. I had ample money ,so I did nt care either. I have started up again after a lull of a year. I did apply for few jobs in management section but the dirty little secret is no one even replied . Whatever happens, happens for good. Chill. ",

Counting number of students who are employed after completing the course is not the right yardstick to decide. However, expectations of students to get employed after the course irrespective of their calibre (even IIT it varies because of reservation or further studies) are not the way to approach any course and it should be out of interest and prospects ",
