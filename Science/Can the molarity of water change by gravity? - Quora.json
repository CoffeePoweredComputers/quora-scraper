            "answer_text": "Since water is very very slightly compressible, a mole of it it would in theory occupy a very very slightly smaller volume in a high-gravity field (or, for that matter, in a tall thin container rather than in a squat one. And if the volume occupied by a mole decreases, the molarity increases. However, the difference would be minute to the point of undetectability. Certainly increasing the weight of the water does not change its mass, nor the number of moles in a sample. ",
