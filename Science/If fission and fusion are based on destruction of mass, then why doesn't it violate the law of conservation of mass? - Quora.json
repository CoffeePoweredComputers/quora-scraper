They merge to from a single , now twice the size of a single droplet. Now again this big droplet splits and gives two single droplets. Imagine fusion and fission as such events. Now , was mass conserved or destroyed! Physical laws should not change. Because those are fundamental blocks. As we don't know infinity, let's stick to what we can understand and keep searching.

            "answer_text": "It does violate the law of conservation of mass. The law of conservation of mass doesn\u2019t hold at such levels. Due to Energy-Mass Equivalence, (a.k.a. E=mc^2), the missing mass at the end of the nuclear reaction manifests itself as energy in the form of heat (that is, kinetic energy of particles). Sidenote: You have just begun. Turns out, no law is 100% true. Even law of conservation of energy is violated at cosmic scales due to asymmetry in time dimension. Even linear/angular momentum conservation laws can be disobeyed under appropriate conditions. To learn more on this, refer Noether's theorem - Wikipedia. ",
