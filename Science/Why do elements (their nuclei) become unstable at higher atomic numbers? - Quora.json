            "answer_text": "the argument available in standard nuclear physics textbooks followed internationally goes as follows, Nature does not prefer either protons or neutrons while making nuclei light and lighter-middle mass nuclei generally have equal/roughly equal number of neutrons and protons these nuclei are also generally nearly spherical as an element gets heavier, its atomic number - equal to the number of protons in the nucleus - increases coulomb repulsion now becomes something to reckon with therefore, intermediate mass and heavy nuclei invariably have N>Z so as to offset the disruptive effects of increased coulomb repulsion a larger number of neutrons provides the additional binding at this point, the \u2018liquid drop model of the nucleus\u2019 needs to be invoked the most basic tenet of this model is that, a nucleus resembles the drop of an incompressible liquid as you have experienced in a fine drizzle, very tiny droplets of a liquid are spherical light nuclei are also quite nearly spherical and, they are also tightly bound however, it should be clearly borne in mind that if only coulomb forces were present, a spherical shape would be least stable the coulomb force would tend to throw the protons apart then, how do we explain the stability of light nuclei? because, a nucleus also necessarily possesses a surface and, hence, naturally the property of surface tension just like in a liquid which is a binding force as opposed to coulomb force which is necessarily disruptive for a given volume, the spherical shape has the smallest surface area this makes tiny droplets/nuclei spherical now, as the number of nucleons increases, continuation of spherical shape becomes untenable increased number of neutrons provides extra binding but the nucleus also tends to deform from spherical shape so as to achieve a larger surface area, and, hence, an increased surface tension energy for providing for offsetting radially outward disruptive coulomb repulsion larger drops of a liquid are also necessarily non-spherical they tend to flatten heavy nuclei are also invariably deformed as evidenced by their possession of large quadrupole moments a heavy nucleus such as U235 possesses 143 neutrons as against 92 protons besides also being heavily deformed it is thus, actually, an interplay between two forces coulomb force tends to disrupt a nucleus at any mass number surface tension tends to hold all the nucleons together but, there will also be a limit to extent of flatness of a liquid drop you will then call it a \u2018blob\u2019 not a large drop when a nucleus becomes very heavily deformed (imagine a longish spheroid) you can clearly identify two different proton groups inside the nucleus separated by a distance even the increased surface will not be able to withstand the strong coulomb repulsion between these two proton groups and the nucleus will break into two fragments this is how spontaneous fission is explained on the liquid drop model the greatest success of LDM very large drops of a liquid do not exist there is an upper limit to stability of a collection of nucleons to be eligible to become a bound nucleus you try to increase the number of nucleons further, this collection becomes energetically unstable very heavy nuclei do not occur naturally finer details are available in that nuclear physics masterpiece by Irving Kaplan ",

            "answer_text": "There two main types of nuclear decay that can change the size and composition of a nucleus, each caused by different forces: a) Beta decay - most common type of decay in lighter elements. It is caused when a nucleus has unstable neutron-proton ratio (based on Pauli exclusion principle). It has two variations, \u03b2- changes a neutron into a proton, and \u03b2+ changes a proton into a neutron - emitting beta particles(leptons) in both case. The number of particles in the nucleus stays the same, only the quantity of protons protons changes. Very similar to beta decay is the process of electron capture, which absorbs one of the atom's own inner electrons and changes one of its protons into a neutron. b) Emission - Caused by either the strong force and electrostatic repulsion of protons in the nucleus, and has several multiple subtypes: Alpha decay - Most common type of emissive decay, caused by repulsion of protons, ejects an alpha particle consisting of two neutrons and two protons from the nucleus, decreasing its atomic mass.Spontaneous fission - Entire nucleus fragments into two smaller daughter nuclei (often also emitting neutrons). Caused by repulsion of protonsNeutron and proton decay - Usually occurs in very light elements, is caused by repulsive effects of nuclear force at too short distances (normally, nuclear force is attractive)Reason why heavier nuclei are more unstable lies in electrostatic repulsion of protons, which is stronger than the nuclear force at longer distances. Nuclear force, which binds protons and neutrons to other protons or neutrons in the nucleus is significant only in very short distances, becoming unnoticeable at ~2.5 fm(femtometers). However, many atomic nuclei are much larger than 2.5 fm in diameter; Uranium-238 nucleus is around 15 fm in size, and each proton or neutron only interacts with a few other which are the closest to it. To reduce the repulsive force between protons,  it must have a lot more neutrons than protons (92 protons, 146 neutrons), increasing both the net value of nuclear binding force and the distances (and therefore reduces repulsive forces) between protons.  When it comes to superheavy elements, most common type of decay is definitely either alpha decay or spontaneous fission. There are two major forces which govern how resistant are nuclei going to be in against those types of decay, those are the strong force and electrostatic force, difference between them gives a binding energy. Binding energy of all nuclei heavier than lead 207 is less than 7.87 MeV per nucleon, making them all inherently unstable. Beta decay commonly occur in isotopes of very light elements and is not based on the mass of a nucleus, but alpha decay is only possible for the very heavy elements.   ",
