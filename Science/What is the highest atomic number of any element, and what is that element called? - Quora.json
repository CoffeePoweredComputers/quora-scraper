            "answer_text": "Ununoctium is the systematic element name given to #118, the highest-Z element yet created. (Z is the usual symbol for the atomic number.) It follows the IUPAC rule that a new element, until a formal name is decided upon, is named from the digits of its atomic number. 'Un' is used for the digit 1; 'bi' for 2; 'tri' for 3; 'quad' for 4; 'pent' for 5; 'hex' for 6; 'sept' for 7; 'oct' for 8; 'enn' for 9; 'nil' for 0. The symbol for the element is the initials of the three syllables. Since #118 has two 1s and an 8, its provisional name is un + un + oct + the suffix -ium, or ununoctium, with the symbol Uuo. #109 was called unnilennium (Une) before it was named meitnerium; #124 would have the provisional name of unbiquadium (Ubq). edited to add: Ununoctium was formally named oganesson in November 2016, honoring the nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian who has been a leading figure in the synthesis of the later superheavy elements.
