A very famous physicist, Richard Feynman, took considerable joy in things \u201cdiscovered many years\u201d prior and rebuilding them from scratch. This means he probably understood those things better than most and afforded him the ability to extend those ideas. You see \u2014- until you really understand the foundation built by others, and in your own unique way, it's very difficult to extend that knowledge into new areas. No one on the planet can have totally unique contributions. Knowledge is built on the sweat, pain, and joy of our predecessors. ",
