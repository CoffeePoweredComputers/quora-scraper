            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t. Science is nothing more than a set of rules, guidelines and practices with only one purpose. Finding out about the truth about the world. The reason we need those practices is that our brains are easily fooled by preconceptions, wishfully thinking, and a host of logical fallacies. None of the gods of various religions, both extant and extinct, have presented themselves for scientific analysis. Therefore, science can say nothing about them. Conflict can arise, however, with some details, like origin stories. Whether you believe is the piling mud on a turtle to make the land, or incestuous gods, or \u201clet there be light,\u201d chances are your cosmogonic myth does not jibe with what we\u2019ve able to find out about the early universe in the last century. The vast majority of religious people don\u2019t have a problem with this. They move with the times and take the stories as metaphorical. It\u2019s really just a relative small number of bumpkins in a technologically advanced, cultural backwater that insist that their particular holy book has all the literal truth that is worth knowing. Their particular conflict with science also stinks of ulterior motives, as many of them make a lot of money off industries that science is telling us might have serious negative consequences. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: How does science defy the existence of God? A: It doesn\u2019t, science renders gods obsolete, providing as it does far better, far more useful ideas and techniques than any religion ever did. In fact, whether it was called science or not, everything religions claim to have accomplished, has been entirely down to science, every building, every work of art, every artefact, all the psychological tricks they use to brainwash and retain believers, all of it was misappropriated from a process of trial and error, science. Nothing any religion ever did was accomplished to the magic they claim exists, not one temple sprung from the ground, not one verifiable miracle, not one magically appearing scripture. Science does everything, religions just stir up trouble and take credit for things they never did. There\u2019s no defiance of gods on the part of science, only the denial of reality by people who believe in gods, that\u2019s why they get so angry when their beliefs are challenged, and why they have invented an excuse for using terror tactics, by inventing \u201cblasphemy\u201d, a way of persecuting unbelievers, and terrifying believers into remaining faithful, in order to avoid the fate of people accused of blasphemy. Gods are irrelevant to everything but religious people, and the people whose lives have been impoverished, or cut short, by religions. ",
