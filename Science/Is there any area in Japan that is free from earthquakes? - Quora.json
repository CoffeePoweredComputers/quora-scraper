            "answer_text": "I think it is not fair to ask which is the area in japan that is free fromm earthquakes. Japan is tectonically and seismically very active since it is an island located on the three plate boundaries namely Eurasian Plate, Philippine Plate and Pacific Plate. Japan\u2019s Eastern Border is full of volcanoes as it lies on the \u201cRing of Fire\u201d. Whenever Seismic Hazard analysis of an area is done, it involves the seismic data obtained from previous earthquakes to model the area. Earthquakes History over the area is studied and a Probabilistic Seismic Hazard map of the region is generated. Thus, the parts of area are defined as Less hazardous or More Hazardous / More Seismically Active region. Below images shows the historic magnitudes and earthquakes of japan, those are probably more prone to earthquakes and thus are more seismically active while other regions are less hazardous. In Quantitative terms, whole japan is prone to earthquakes   ",

            "answer_text": "None at all. Japan, and the areas surrounding it, is the single most active area of the world. [Japan is located in one of the most seismically active areas of this planet. Four major tectonic plates abut beneath, or near its landmass. Continuous friction and abrasion along these plates means that 11% of the Earth\u2019s seismic energy gets released annually in this region. At time of writing, there have been 374 earthquakes, of magnitude 1.5 are over, below or near Japan in the last year. In fact, there have been four over 1.5 this day and, as I write, it is still only two pm. They are such a regular feature of life that only a powerful one receives more than momentary attention. The southern half of Japan's landmass sits upon the Eurasian Plate, and the northern half on the North American Crustal Plate. Furthermore, the Eurasian Plate meets the Philippine Sea Plate under Shizuoka Prefecture, where the dormant but still active Mount Fuji is located (see map). The beautiful Izu Peninsula, 120 km south of T\u014dky\u014d, sits upon the Philippine Sea Plate. Nearby, the Suruga Trough is one of the areas seismologists have long believed will soon be the epicentre of another major earthquake. In addition to causing local fatalities, they fear that it will trigger secondary earthquakes that could devastate the Kant\u014d Plain. There is precedence for just such a scenario]. source ",
