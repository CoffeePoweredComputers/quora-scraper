            "answer_text": "As the youth of this country, we have an opportunity to contribute to the country in many ways. But before we jump into anything, it is very important that we enhance our own abilities and competence, because just a desire to contribute is not enough. We must have an equanimous mind which allows us to apply ourselves in every situation. But at the same time, we must be do our jobs with full exuberance. This is necessary so that our work is effective enough. Coming to how we can contribute, there are a variety of issues in our country. We need to be observant enough to know what is best needed for the people around is and to enhance their lives. The issues can be divided into local issues and issues which may cover larger territory, maybe, a district, state, or country. Your observation and attention is needed to identify the local issues and innovate ways to solve them. If you look carefully, every district or every state represents a distinct set of problems. However, most of them could be solved if the local issues get sorted out. Because ultimately, the state issues are more or less a reflection or net summation of various local issues. Essentially, I feel it is important to work at the grassroots level. And just not your contribution is enough. We need youth from all over the country to take responsibility. The policies brought on the state and the national level should support the activities taken up on the grassroots. Only then we can see some significant change. ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t tell if this question is about how you, personally, can improve society, or whether it is about what it is going to take to improve society. But I\u2019ll take a crack at each. What an individual can do to improve society For you, personally, to improve society, basically means you have to be able to organize people together into an organization that can make improvements for vast numbers of people. Some people do this by starting businesses that improve the lives of vast numbers of people. The founders of companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Tesla might be able to make arguments that they have accomplished this task. Others attempt to improve society by organizing people to push for government policies that will benefit lots of people, such as making sure that everyone has a job, or everyone has access to health care, or everyone will be taken care of in their old age. Sometimes people work for policies that indirectly affect these things, by working for policies that will protect the planet we depend on by reducing pollution or keeping the weather from destroying places we live in. To organize people to work together, you need to have ideas and you need to be able to convince people to work together to accomplish that idea. Generally, you need to be able to meet their needs while they work together, so it is easier to do this in an organization that makes money, then by asking people to volunteer, or by having to ask people to donate money to the cause. The easiest way to build an organization that can improve society is to build a business that sells products that people want. If you start a non-profit organization, you will always be dependent on other organizations for donations. If you try to organize a government, you will also always be dependent on other organizations for donations. You will always have more capability if you are independently able to build the resources you need to organize than if you depend on others for donations. How to improve society Generally people want their lives to be freer. They want to be free from struggle and free to express themselves as they choose and free to do what they want. Most people want to feel safe. For human beings, this generally means feeling connected to others in a way that seems strong and unlikely to be broken. Our greatest survival trait has been our ability to cooperate with each other. So the best way to improve society is to improve humans\u2019 ability to cooperate with each other. However, there is a lot of disagreement about how to accomplish this goal. Some people believe that cooperation can only be managed from a central power source. Others believe that a central power source cannot effective manage everyone, and the only way to generate cooperation is by empowering individuals to work on their own behalf. Evolution is a process where living organisms generate all kinds of strategies for survival, and they compete with each other using these strategies. The strategies that are most successful end up being taken up by more people. It is not clear whether a centralized managerial source or individualized management or some combination of these alternatives is best. Different groups of people use a wide array of combinations of these strategies all over the world. They each generate different amounts of success and distribute that success in different ways. People have opinions about which method works the best, but there\u2019s no objective way to decide. Only time will tell. So which method should you choose, when it\u2019s not clear which method works best? You probably have an opinion, and your opinion is no better and no worse than anyone else\u2019s opinion. You opinion may or may not be shared by many others, but that probably has little effect on your ability to build an organization that can provide the resources to improve society. So the best thing to do, I think, is just go with your current opinion, and start working to build your for-profit organization. Most people who are successful in building an organization to improve society seem to have few doubts. I don\u2019t know if they would ask a question like this. They seem to start at an early age, and always know what they want to do without question. They try and they usually fail many times, but that never stops them. They try again and again until they find an idea that appeals to many others. They never seem to run out of energy and never give up. They keep on trying, failing many times along the way, but eventually start building the resources they need to improve society. I have a feeling that asking this question probably means you don\u2019t have what it takes to improve society in a big way. However, you may be able to make a smaller contribution. You could work within one of these organizations \u2014 choose one that fits your values the best. You\u2019ll do your part in improving society, although not many people will know your name nor credit you with what you have done. That may or may not matter to you. However, most people who actually improve society are more interested in improving society than in getting credit for it. They work hard just because they are driven to work hard. The credit comes later, and doesn\u2019t matter that much when it comes. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. This is a huge question and could take you in many different directions depending on how you begin to answer it. So I\u2019ll focus mainly on that beginning. In order to ferret out how you - with your unique values, resources, perspective and abilities - can best contribute to society, you will first need to: Clearly define your personal, interpersonal and social values. I saw that you began to do this in your response to one of the answers here, but IMO you could really drill down deep to understand and document what you think is most important in your relationships, your personal standards of ethics, and in what you believe to be societal standards and mechanisms for good.Clearly understand what you bring to the table. What are you strengths, aptitudes, skills and resources? What is your work style, relationship style and communication style? What are you really good at, and what do you enjoy doing the most?Begin to explore how your values intersect with your individual strengths, aptitudes, skills and resources. This can be the trickiest part of the process, and it is important to avoid locking yourself into a single trajectory too quickly - instead, you can remain open, and look at what is already being done in the world that resonates with both what you care about, and what you are good at.Identify communities, collaborators and institutions that support your values and strengths. Make an extensive list of these, research them online, and talk with as many people as possible about the options that already exist (there are likely many!). There are probably whole communities whose philosophy of values and approaches to societal contribution align closely with yours.Try things on for size. Try out a number of different possibilities that you think will allow your values and strengths to be put to good use. Take some classes in a promising field, do some volunteering at a promising organization or work in an entry level position, engage in some activism with a like-minded group of folks, etc.Be willing to start something on your own if you need to. For me, it became clear after a few decades of \u201ctrying things on for size\u201d that there wasn\u2019t a prefect match for me already out in the world in terms of a career, volunteer organization, community, etc. So I started my own business, wrote exclusively about what I was passionate about, and began more informally connecting with folks who had similar values and concerns.This can be a lengthy process - it took me nearly twenty years to figure all of this out. So be patient, and persistent. Also, to begin with step #1, check out the Self-Assessment Resources on my website: Other Resources | Integral Lifework. I hope this was helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, I'd like to appreciate the person asking the question. Not everyone wants to contribute towards society, rather they just expect what they want from the society and do nothing about it. There are many, many, many and yet many ways to contribute towards society. Listing a few points off the top of my mind -1. You could contribute to the cleanliness of the city or protection of nature by participating in volunteer driven programmes (there are a dime-and-dozen of these!)2. Knowledge is indeed power. You could teach people who cannot afford an education on various topics. In this process, both they and you become proficient in whatever you're teaching so it's a win-win!3. Charity. We spend knowingly/unknowingly on some things we really do not have a need for and waste a lot of money/ food. Donation of money and food is really something worthwhile and gives you a sense of satisfaction.4. Try to support people who are oppressed and discriminated. Be it kids who go through bullies, be it women who go through harrassment from their spouses or in-laws, or eve teased, be it poor people looked down upon by the so called \"higher class\". Stand up and speak out. Even a small effort of support is highly appreciated by people who are good at heart. And many many (did I say many? It's worth saying it again. Many!) more ways you can contribute. You could contribute in your own way to make someone smile, make someone's life worth living, make someone's burden reduced to a great deal. Appreciate your question and hope you contribute to the society and get a lot of good wishes in return! :) ",

Now that being said, in know way am I implying that you do so. Now everyone thinks doing good deeds is a favor good enough for the society. Well that is not enough 1. Be nice to your parents, especially if you are a dependant. Your parents bring you to this world, and raise you to survive. you got to be grateful for that, no matter how bad they were at parenting. Chances are they weren't. As you are nice to them, they too Will positively impact their peers, their subordinates etc. They will also feel less stressful and motivated. 2. Be humble. Humility is a trait that many people lack. Atleast that's how I feel and I would be the happiest person to be proven wrong on this. By being humble you don't only build a wise character but people gain respect for you, and you will definitely serve as an inspiration for them. As they say, be the change you want to see. But don't overdo it and don't let anyone step over you either.3. Be dead against  gluttony. One thing on which I ll agree with the bible. Gluttony is a sin. While many such as my former self would argue that there is no gluttony existing as one makes up for the consumed or wasted content with currency. That, no matter how logical, is absolutely immoral and unfair. Assume I am a millionaire. I can easily afford a heavy meal for myself 52*7. I lay out on the table, food which collectively weighs 5 kgs. All sort of garnished crap etc all for myself.  Now a man at one sitting can not consume more than 2 kgs. And the fig of 2 kgs is a heavy exaggeration btw. Now the rest, instead of giving it to a person who can't afford it, I throw it away. That is practically stealing the right of a person. Raking in more than you could possibly consume is not fair and definitely stealing from the society. This is what drives Warren buffet to donate. He says you can't possibly spend a billion on yourself. It's fine not to donate, but not switching the lights off when you leave is NOT okay.4. Talk. Talk to the auto driver. Talk to your cook. Just be nice. You might find a great mind somewhere there 5. Never humiliate someone. Ok now i am taking like a hypocrite. Skip. Dont do it unless heavily provoked 6. Study well. Do good. And choose the field in which you can be efficient in. You don't necessarily have to enjoy your job. But if there is anyone unemployed who can give his/her 100% to the job and let's say you are giving like what 81% (still pretty good I would say) you are not exactly giving back to the society. Your efforts might generate a job for the second guy(without harming your ambition) 7. Be optimistic. I live in India. Everyday I face an army of People who hate our country. No matter how good we do,  they will point out a flaw which has probably been marked by some western newspaper and then will act superior just because they know what a better system is. Don't be a part of that army. You gain the right to criticize only if you are doing something for it. And no giving spare change to the beggar doesn't count (tho its a good thing to do)8. Plant trees. Everyone can afford a tree. It doesn't have to be in your backyard. Like say plant or sponsor a given number of trees on a special occasion like a birthday. 9. Pay your taxes responsibly. You (not necessarily the asker)would want to argue that your taxes will end up in some babu's (beurocrat) pocket. That must not concern you. You pay your taxes the right frikkin way even if it ends up funding a friggin KRK movie. 10. Do fight for the right use of your taxes btw ^Real 10. Social service. With family can create a better bonding than a picnic Enough said. 11. Don't raise your children to be entitled *****. 12. Now it's pretty much impossible to not to bring your toddlers on public transportation, just ensure that you and your kid don't Cause any inconvenience. 13. Don't litter on the roads (duh) 14. Raise your kids to respect women 15. Just raise your kids right 16. Don't watch roadies big boss splitsvilla17. Be a law abiding citizen. Yeah pretty much. And if you think this style is boring, you are a hippie. Hippies are cool tho, but still. This is what I feel. Feel free to correct or contribute. ",

            "answer_text": "Many people assume that contribution to the society is the responsibility of those who are already well settled in life and have nothing else to do; because, even if the average person tried to contribute to the society, it wouldn\u2019t make much difference. How wrong! It is the little drops of water that make the mighty ocean. Every person can make a difference to the society if they have the will to do so. You need not donate millions of dollars to feed the hungry or do some heroic act in order to make a difference. Little act of kindness, small changes in lifestyles and being a responsible part of the society will do the trick. Here are 10 out of 100s ways in which you can contribute to society to make a difference. 10. Improve Yourself: By picking up your own life and being a productive member of the society, you will be contributing to your community in a positive way. People with criminal tendency, addictions or other vices, often feed on the goodness around them, without giving back anything to the society. Therefore the first step would be to improve yourself so that you don\u2019t start leeching from your surroundings. 9. Improve Your Social Skills: Be humble, polite and have a smile on your lips. Even though you may not think of this as a great act, it goes a long way in making a difference to the society. Negative emotions and bad attitude tend to create bad vibes that spreads around, which is picked up by other people. By improving your social skills, being friendly and approachable person, you do a lot of good to your community. 8. Plant a tree: With depleting forests and increasing pollution, planting a tree will do a huge difference to our environment. A single tree will absorb nearly a ton of carbon dioxide during its life time, so by planting a seed today, you will keep contributing to the society even when you no longer live in it. 7. Strictly follow the 3 R\u2019s: You will do the society a huge favor if you strictly follow the 3 R\u2019s \u2013 reduce, re-use and recycle. Remind yourself that you are contributing to the increasing pollution and destroying the environment by choosing disposable products, especially the carry bags. Use reusable products and save the environment. Recycle the products you can. 6. Donate Blood: Shortage of blood has taken many a lives. You can donate the life saving fluid and save lives. By donating blood, you are not only saving the life of the needy person, but also have the benefits of your own blood being screened for infections like HIV and Hepatitis C before being transfused to a patient. If any life threatening infection is seen, the donor will be informed by the doctors. 5. Family Planning: Population explosion is the major concern of our world at present, as there has been a significant increase in population in the past 50 years. Our planet may not be able to sustain present or larger numbers of human population for long. You can help not only by keeping your own family small but also by spreading awareness about the downfalls of having bigger families to people around you. 4. Drive with Caution: Don\u2019t drink and drive. Be cautious and careful on the roads. It is not only your own that is at stake but the life of others as well. Reduce the number of deaths and injuries on the roadways by being aware of the safety rules; in addition, you can spread awareness among the drivers, pedestrians and cyclists regarding road safety. 3. Save Fuel: Walk and cycle whenever possible; it not only saves fuel and prevents harmful emissions, but is a wonderful exercise for you. Keep your vehicles well serviced and keep the tires properly inflated so that the lifespan and mileage of vehicle increases. Use carpooling and mass transit transport system to commuting to school, college or work. 2. Be a Volunteer: Keep some time aside for volunteering to help an old age home, disability center or a hospital which is falling short of staff. It benefits you in a great way, because, the satisfaction and pride that comes from helping others can be life changing. 1. Be a Good Samaritan: Don\u2019t turn a deaf ear and blind eye to the elderly person struggling with a door, a person who met with an accident or a child separated from a parent. Lend your helping hand to those in need. Make that call to the concerned official when you see something amiss your neighborhood.

            "answer_text": "Sometimes I think how solipsistic and detached we've become. It seems like the main driving force for most of us is to simply get done with school, then college and then score a high-paying job so that one day we can afford a big house, an expensive car, eat at posh restaurants and support our families before we can live out our retirement days as a respected member of the senior community. In a world where we have poverty, hunger, pollution, overpopulation, government corruption and so many other issues, we ignorant and lazy humans (myself included) choose to live secluded lives within a small circle where our sole motive is to fend for ourselves. Well we all know this, and sometimes we even think about it. So what can we do about it? What can a one person really do? I'm not Bill Gates that I can donate millions and billions to charities. My opinions have little influence as I don't have any authority or power. So what can I really do? Well to be honest we can\u2019t really make a huge difference in a few days or all by ourselves. But we can do some very simple things like the ones that I have listed below on a daily basis that can make a huge collective difference in the course of time.  \u00b7        Treat people, anyone, the way you wish to be treated, with respect and genuine sincerity. \u00b7        Cheer people up who are struggling or having a bad day. \u00b7        Never discriminate on the basis of sex, colour, religion, hometown etc. \u00b7        Protect the weak. \u00b7        Be a good listener. \u00b7        Donate blood. \u00b7        Donate some money every once in a while, even if it\u2019s a small amount. \u00b7        Never miss a chance to help someone directly like helping an elderly to cross a road, giving your burger to a homeless person or helping a struggling stranger lift something heavy. \u00b7        Smile is infectious; make sure you put yours to good use. \u00b7        Volunteer to work for a charity of your choice; raise money and awareness for the cause. \u00b7        Become an organ donor. \u00b7        Don\u2019t accept or offer bribes. \u00b7        Help in keeping the streets clean like your house; use garbage bins. \u00b7        Respect and adhere to the traffic laws. \u00b7        Don\u2019t be greedy, the real pleasure lies in the art of giving. These are very basic things which I can think of off the top of my head. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other ways to make positive differences in our society. Just make a start by doing small things on a regular basis till it forms a habit; you\u2019ll be amazed to see how effectively you spread these vibes around you and inspire hundreds of others to do the same.

            "answer_text": "From my perspective humans are not very good in large crowds. There is a reason there is a saying such as mob mentality. I think people should break up into reasonably sized communities and just get to know each other. In that way people would have a legit community to rely on and not some demented idea of civil services. The more we rely on a form of government to dictate our actions, and our support systems the more we lose freedom. People need to become accountable for their own areas/land and how they interact with others. Walk around a city in the United States, if you observe you will see people who are just barely surviving a day, and I\u2019m not talking about homeless people. I\u2019m pointing out that people work themselves to the bone just to be allowed to have a roof over their head, and maybe some food. The systems we have in place literally prevent low income citizens from moving up. Either because of the family they come from, or their literal lack up upward mobility. People are choosing working and surviving the week vs. having the luxury of being able to really plan anything out. Consider for a moment luxuries that are now mandatory for survival in western society. Infrastructure such as water treatment, sewage, waste disposal, internet, Television, Radio, vehicles, public education, fuel, air conditioning, and roads. These all cost money to use, most of which some people cannot afford even after a full week of work. The reason for this is because everyone is so damn greedy. Property owners in low income areas charge insane amounts and barely (if at all) do maintenance on the location. The mandatory need for internet just TO GET A JOB can cost amounts some people simply cannot afford, and public libraries are closing. The price of food alone has skyrocketed to a level in which a single person now spends around $100.00 - $200.00 on their food budget for 2 weeks. The social support systems are over burdened by people that literally need assistance and can\u2019t help themselves because the area they live in does not pay a living wage, nor provide and medical benefits. People literally die before going into medical debt, because the result is the same. Medical costs are insanely high, anyone who defends the current United States free market for profit system of medical care is a jackass that needs to learn that this system is preventing people from getting medical care in the first place. Last I checked western society was supposed to be the forerunner of progress, medical wise this system is a meat grinder chewing people up like payday loans did. Imagine for a moment you are in distress, experiencing a real crisis and can\u2019t even make a sound well thought out conclusion. Then visit the emergency room or a doctors office, you cannot in any way in the time required make a well thought out choice. This medical system preys on that, and its horrifying. In my opinion Bernie\u2019s single payer idea seems like a great way to fix that. However it would be foolish for me to assume I know enough to attempt to fix any of these massive issues. It\u2019s all just %*^#@$. ",

            "answer_text": "In what ways do you want to support the society? Cleaning it: Stop littering : Seiously, we have enough waste to give reasons to Brits to still call us dirty, poor, filthy Indians. If we stop littering then there is a possibility that waste can be cleaned. Suppose that we have 1000 kg of waste in our house. You can at your best clean 100 kg of waste everyday but you litter 200 kg of waste everyday day. Then you won't able to clean anything. Moreover, your waste will double up in 10 days.Create Awareness : So, you protested against Delhi gangrape? Protest for Lokpal Bill? Protest for swaraj? Great! I support that too. But then what? What did you do? You threw all the banners and plays cards you brounght on the ground and went home. You didn't gave a damn about cleaning. Whereas, in Hong Kong, people protested for democracy. They littered. But they returned back. Returned back to clean what they and others threw on ground. Japs, after their team lost in FIFA WC, cleaned the stadium. They clean toilets of their school and don't feel ashamed. This is the basic thing and should be taught in school.Organize a cleaning day per week : And everyone should participate in it. I am sure that not more than 50-100 families will be required to clean a block. Duty of RWA  is not just to get legal help for the residents but also cleanliness of the society.  The time you waste criticizing the dirtiness of society could be used to clean it.Employ Poor To clean your locality : Already suggested by Vanitha Muthukumar, it will be more than useful. Lets say you live in Block C and want to get your block cleaned. Count the no. of houses in your block. Say 200 and you want to employ someone to clean it. Collect \u20b9500 from each family.  Lets says 100 of those houses have given one of their floors on rent. Now you will get(300x500) = \u20b9150000. Now you can easily employ 6-15 people to clean your block. One arrow two targets. You will be satisfied with yourself that you are helping to eradicate poverty.Stop Spitting : Seriously? You need to spit on road or on wall after you chew tobacco or paan? Thats disgusting, gross and no one would like to clean it. It just doesn't feel right.Stop sticking billsStop laughing at those who cleanShare it like you shared ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.Spreading knowledge : You can make parents aware of benefits of education.You can yourself teach the poor kids.Subjects like English will help them communicate with wider range of audiences in countries like India.Charity : One of the best and hassle-free way is charity. You can donate something for the poor/ victims of natural disasters, etc.You can donate money, food, clothes, water, medicine, blood and volunteer for services.",

The reason I mention this because people choose to emulate or neglect. If we do our parts people will emulate There is no real answer, but society makes us believe that this world is going to hell. There is so much separation and media, religion, and other aspects make society believe that there is a LARGER problem that exists and that we can do \u201cour part\u201d. Knowing that we tend to feel that the problem is much bigger than us, we tend to believe that our part has a small value in the things we do. However, our value is much higher than many of us believe. Our actions play a large role in the way that the world and society will protray what is right and wrong. So be that person and show the ones around you that this world and our society can and will be diffrent. I truly believe that you don't have to worry about EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE AND THE WORLD. It's simple, help 4 people. Your \u201cneighbors\u201d to your left, Your \u201cneighbors\u201d the right, Your \u201cneighbors\u201d in front of you and behind you. Work on that and if people choose to emulate. Our society becomes stronger as a whole. Don't think you can fix the world but know that your can set a standard for the world around you. Just my opinion.. . Enjoy ",

            "answer_text": "1. Choose to Buy Hybrid Cars. If you want to buy a car, you may be considering buying a traditional one that is fossil-fueled. On the other hand, there are hybrid cars that almost have the same price as conventional cars. In fact, you can even find some cheaper ones. The reason why it is better to choose to buy a hybrid car is that it doesn\u2019t produce the same pollutants that a fossil-fueled car does. With this, you can contribute to the worldwide campaign against global warming. 2. Use Green Web Hosting. Green web hosting or green hosting is a trend in which web hosts choose to utilize renewable energy to power their servers. If you have a website, you will surely need a web host, and there are a lot of web hosts out there you can choose from. The best way is to choose a green host. There are instances that a web host would tell you that they are green, even if they are not. To better identify them, pricing is the key. Green hosts offer Green hosts offer a cheaper price because they save a lot of money using renewable source of energy. Choosing a green host for your website is a significant contribution to the environment. 3. Recycling. Recycling is broad. It covers government programs, private sector initiatives, community effort, and individual contribution. It is true that recycling is already being implemented by the above institutions using state-of-the-art technology. However, all of these are not enough to address waste disposal problems. RECYCLING starts from home, individuals. Before you thrash out your waste, pick up the things that you can reuse and recycle. Hard objects contain toxins when burned. To reduce this effect, recycle some hard objects that can still be reused. 4. Use Solar-Powered Technology. Nowadays, there are many household devices that are solar-powered. These are: Solar ChargerSolar LightSolar HeaterAside from the above items, there are still more devices that are solar-powered. Otherwise, you can install some solar panels at home, so you can generate your own electricity which you can supply to all your household devices. At home, you can contribute to the environment by using solar energy. If you are a drone enthusiast and wish to fly one soon, you can choose a solar-powered drone, so you won\u2019t have to keep on recharging at home as it can recharge while it flies.  5. Tree Planting. You can join some tree-planting activities or donate to certain groups that have tree-planting programs. This way you can help accelerate the process of healing the wounds of the earth\u2019s ozone layer. Every tree absorbs carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and CFC. At the same time, it produces oxygen that thickens the earth\u2019s atmosphere against heat radiation from the sun. Furthermore, trees can reduce flooding in some areas. This is because a place without trees can easily become a dry land where other plants cannot grow. By planting trees, you are restoring the natural ecosystem that promotes life. ",

            "answer_text": "Often in India, we hear that the world is mean and cruel (or simply corrupt). Every one of us hears this and yet the reality is such that the majority of people are not actually corrupt. Then why is the society as a whole corrupt? Nexus There is a well-known nexus of bad citizens. The corrupts protect each other and the try to monopolise power. However, good citizens work in isolation. Therefore at some point, they find it difficult to survive, and they give up and adjust themselves in the corrupt work culture. In order to change the situation, a nexus of good citizens is also required. Good citizens should support each other and protect each other so that society proceed in the right direction, even if the change is minuscule. Apart from the above fundamental action, the good citizens should take a pledge to do the following things: Vote. Exercise your power to elect the right candidate and spread awareness among your immediate friends and relatives. By not voting you only give other voters more power over the election of a candidate. Even if you don\u2019t like any candidate, vote NOTA, but do vote.Say no to corruption. Never engage in collusive corruption. If corruption is coerced, complain to Anti-Corruption Bureau in your state. Use RTI as a tool to gain information. This requires courage and significant resources, but someone has to do this, if not good citizens then who?Take action. Whenever you see wrong things happening (for e.g. corruption), take action and don't be just a bystander. If government departments are giving suboptimal services, do not tolerate, complain. In most cases, some action will be taken. The central government has created a grievance redressal portal for institutions/departments that are under the central government. Use this portal (CPGRAMS-Home) to complain if government services are not being provided as per the rules. State governments too have similar portals which can be found through google search. For example, the Delhi government has https://www.pgms.delhi.gov.in/ and the Rajasthan government has http://sampark.rajasthan.gov.in/. Use these portals to complain against state government departments for suboptimal services. Change starts by raising a voice. Here it starts.Be informed. Information is power. In most cases, government servants are able to overpower citizens because citizens lack information about their rights, procedures for redressal etc. Know about IPC, CrPC, Citizen Charter, etc. so that no government servant can take advantage of the information asymmetry that exists in the current system. Recently, the central government has created a unified portal (India Code: Home) which is a depository of central and state Acts. Use such portals to gain information.These four things are the only things that are expected of citizens. Be responsible, lawful, vigilant and active. If we can create a citizenry like this, India will progress much faster than ever seen. ",

            "answer_text": "Think global act local\u2026 many social reformers came and gone, society is more or less continued with same rhythm and velocity. Day night going and coming. What you can do is make an ideal family at your level, family is the smallest unit but society is a composition of multiple families. If family is good then society is good. To make a god family first an individual needs to become a good human. If you are accountable for your family then family is accountable for you, later families are accountable for society and society is accountable for the families. If such things are happening in real then there must be no mismatch and much fluctuations. After you made a good family co-relate and connect with similar families then hopefully we may find some certainty at certain extent. For example if we talk of our modern society, there is no scarcity of food-grain but many people are at hunger amid plenty. So those who are hungry if not taken care will of course demand food through pledge, trick or force. Same way societies all world, except few in Asia are endorsing animal slaughtering for food whereas there is no scarcity of food, result is in front of us despite increasing birthrate many people are dying in conflict, disease or other reasons. In this way harmony is the only way to make a better society- harmony within, harmony in family, harmony with nature as well as harmony with society. ",

            "answer_text": "Our society is surrounded by the myriad of problems.I'd like to mention only two. Child labour -I feel very bad when i see this.  (source: google images) Solution - Try to teach as many children as you can, if you don't have time i have another option just adopt one child of a poor family in your locality, or your maid's daughter or son, a rickshaw puller's child, a beggar's child etc . Give more preference to a girl child (my personal opinion). What i meant by adoption? Just take care of her/his studies, send her/him to a good private school (we know the condition of government schools in India)or any Kendriya Vidhyala (if the budget of private school burns a hole in your pocket) at your own expenses. Ask your family friends relatives to adopt only one child(if they want more they can :) and bear her/his expenses at-least till intermediate . This will surely change the life of her/his family and now no future generation of her/his house will follow the same practice.  (source: google images)  Why i shared only this problem? The reason is that, it is the solution of each and every problem, if these kids have books and a proper guidance they will change the fate of many. Their health will improve, thinking will improve, no more juvenile crimes, they will have skill, means they can secure their future in a much better way. Good for them and for our GDP too.Poverty is inversely proportional to number of educated children in the society. (source: google images)  The second problem.  (source: google images) What message does this movies gives to you? Ans. Gandhigiri. No, what i learn from this movie is the concept of 2nd innings house.  (source: google images) Yes all elders citizen of our mother land, who have no one around to take care of, their holy kids left them due to some holy reasons needs our help. They all deserve the 2nd inning in their life.  (source: google images)  (source: google images) These hands can only give blessing, such intangible thing might bring tangible tears to your eyes or can help you in future if you believe in karma. Helps those hands in which ever way you want, listen to them love them. I'm not sure whether you think above two can help our society, if you disagree than  i have another way how you could help our society. Just imagine yourself, write down on a piece of paper the problems you have faced in your life. Rate them according to the hardship faced by you and voila. Some of those problems are common to society, you're aware of the hardship involved and the repercussions. Pledge to remove those hardships from the life of masses. You will achieve your target. Good luck :)    ",

            "answer_text": "First of all we human being should clearly understand the thing that by helping the society we are indirectly helping ourselves.Only after having understood this thing we can find out the means to enrich our neighbourhood ,town,state,country and world society at large.                                        Now comes the different roles for different people of the society.One thing which is eminent here is -DO YOUR DUTY.However while pursuing his /her duty people should always keep in mind the ultimate outcome of the action..Here comes the importance of gandhiji's talisman-THINK ABOUT A POOREST MAN YOU HAVE EVER SEEN..That fellow can be a rikshaw puller or a peanut seller along the road side.                                        Now lets again focus on the question..What do you think-CAN THERE BE A SO CALLED 'BEST WAY TO SERVE THE SOCIETY'.My answer would be big-NO. A best way for whom and for what.For instance a best way for developed societies can be of no use for developing societies and same analogy can be drawn between burgeoise society and labour class society.                                        The way to serve the society by doing their duty should be aimed towards developing inclusive and sustainable society. So that ultimately a form of society can be developed WHERE THE HEAD IS HELD HIGH AND MIND IS WITHOUT FEAR.. ",

A person who doesn\u2019t know him- or herself won\u2019t be able to work effectively at anything, and can often get in the way in one way or another. The clearer you are about yourself, the better you can see what you want to do, and how you\u2019re going to do that. You make better choices. Secondly, have a clear idea of the goal you want to achieve, or try to help achieve. Have a clear idea of the things you feel should be changed, and in what way. Be clear about what should replace them. Be prepared to be persuaded by other ideas that would work better on the way. Find others who want the same things, get involved in groups, and start working for those changes. Good luck. Have a great life. And have fun. ",

The first thing is to observe the Golden Rule (whatever religion you follow or none) at all times and in all situations: Treat other people the way you would like to be treated yourself. Make sure that the way you earn your living is useful to society by filling some real need and does no harm to anybody. Given that, you can choose among things that you will enjoy doing for the whole of your working life. What comes last is how much money you will make and what kind of social status you will derive from your work. You can give whatever part of your income you can spare to the charities of your choice. Real charities, not symphonies and art galleries but the ones that provide food and housing to people who don\u2019t have those things. Those people are part of your society. You can volunteer for some kind of community service, whatever you\u2019re good at and can bear to do.

You can be like her: Pratima Devi is a rag-picker and lives in a parking lot of an area considered as one of the swankiest in South Delhi, Saket. You cannot ignore her for a simple reason that she isn\u2019t just a normal morning to evening rag-picker who is seen on roads picking the left-over joys, sorrows thrown by you and me. She is also a messiah of dogs who are living a blessed life.Devi has been single-handedly feeding over 70 dogs since almost 30 years now and was awarded with the Godfrey Philips Bravery Award in the year 2009 for her \u2018social bravery\u2019. She refuses to stay with her own children and rather calls these innocent animals her own kids.

For that let us take a recent example of vandalized [1] luxurious hi-tech super fast Tejas express train from Mumbai to Goa. Many people laughed at the luxury provided in the train by saying: \u201cwhat kind of an idiot puts LCD TV and headphones and hi-tech toilets on an Indian train? What did they think? That the public would sit and use everything decently and go back home?\u201d [2] The travelers/passengers of the very first ride of this train proved these people absolutely correct by stealing headphones, damaging the LCDs and what not..!!   We must change this kind of attitude. First of all, I think we need to implement these two measures that can be implemented by every individual in India. Not damaging public property and maintain cleanliness at public places.Stop being a mute spectator and protect public property from vandalism.For contributing to the betterment of society you don't need a higher position in social hierarchy. No doubt you can take big measures for betterment of society if you are at higher position but every person belonging to a society have to contribute towards the positive change. Let us do this first, we will think about other ways to contribute for betterment of the society after this. Jay Hind!! Footnotes[1] Windows smashed!

If I never hear the word again, my life will improve immensely and so will everyone else\u2019s. \u201cShit\u201d, is another one. I have a brother-in-law I have known for a decade and I can\u2019t recall one swear word EVER passing his lips. Around him I find my own language improving, if not perfectly, surely a lot more civil. Put Sex of all kinds back where it belongs: in the private quarters where it usually takes place (the \u201cAll-Fuck\u201d that occurs in the warmer weather in Highland Park by Queers, notwithstanding) and get it into perspective. Sex is the single most exploited aspect of human existence. IT pervades our lives in nearly everything we see and hear. If I want to look at airbrushed women with only thong-like bras and panties I should not have to see it on 100 x 50 foot billboards along the highway. We are bombarded by sex 366/24/7 to sell everything from paper clips to artichokes. The 7.6 billion people on earth need to take a dominant role in changing themselves, and forsake trying to change others. The earth-shaking power that the people have to change things is galactic in its size and omnipotence if only it could be harnessed Ironically, it takes no great efforts to effect change. If every one is fully, accurately, and factually informed about, say, the effect of fossil fuels on themselves. Let\u2019s dispense while we are at it, with the complete LIE that is used by environmental exploiters: Mother Earth being destroyed, climate change being the death of Earth. Once Mother Earth has had enough of our abuse she will simply shrug us off her fruited plains, and majestic mountains and go about doing what she has always done since the Big Bang, soon be pristine again and ready for the next assault, should we somehow arise like the Firebird, from the ashes. Owning the responsibility for our preservation of our eco-habitat is paramount. Servicing our environment thru simple common sense measures, easily applied, would assure a millennial long solution to many of our environmental problems, like the oceans that are now depleting or poisoned by humans. If we must stop consuming fish, then so be it, until stocks return to normal. I can give up fish. How about you? ",

Let's first ask ourselves, What is Society?- the aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community. By Betterment of Society What do we Wish to Do? Upliftment of Society?Qualities to Improve Collective Action?Friendship and Mutual Support?Science and Education?Spiritual and Moral Upliftment?Individual and Social Transformation?Global Solidarity?Gender Equality?Mutual Respect?The Fact is, we already know what we need to do for the betterment of the society, What we need to figure out is \"How\"? Pick an area on which you wish to work on, and discuss with an open perspective and absorb what you feel about it and keep exploring by talking about what you feel with your circle, but don't form an opinion yet. Slowly, Start Expanding your Horizon of Knowledge. And soon what you will do will start affecting people around you.   Society is held together by our need; we bind it together with legend, myth, coercion, fearing that without it we will be hurled into that void, within which, like the earth before the Word was spoken, the foundations of society are hidden.

Once you have a confirmation of you moving in the right direction, you will find that your surroundings, your values, and your world - will change to reflect that new you. Hence, you will be changing the world, one person at a time. If you need a step-by-step process breakdown, as anyone would, you can peruse the description of life of Mother Teresa , who had accomplished much while remaining just one person from a quite unremarkable origins. Admittedly, she said that she did not set out to change the world, just help one person at a time. Her modus operandi was kindness and simple hard work - some prayers sprinkled in-between, but you can certainly skip those. ",

To be perfectly honest with you, I am no longer sure I believe that we can change the world or society. Maybe society does not want to be \u201chelped.\u201d Sometimes I suspect that society is happily going to hell in a handbasket and there is little that you or I can do about it. Having said that, it doesn\u2019t mean we should give up. My mother used to say, \u201cDo your best; that\u2019s all we can do!\u201d and \u201cBrighten the corner where you are.\u201d So this is what I recommend: Be the very best person that you can be, spiritually and socially. I endeavor to be a clear channel for Love, light, peace, grace and holy wisdom. Even if we cannot control external events and the actions of other people, we can be a source of goodness and kindness in this world.Do whatever you can on a practical level. This includes voting, making your voice heard, and participating in good work. Use your particular gifts, talents and experience for the highest good of society, to the best of your ability.Thank you for asking this question and wanting to be part of the solution. ",

Donation is not restricted to money only. It can be your time, blood, books, food etc.  3) Try to keep your surroundings clean. Swachchha Bharat :-) 4) If you have some time, go to an NGO, just talk to the people in there. I am sure you will find many new ways after hearing their stories. 5) Pass on the knowledge you have. Make people aware about various things. 6) Take a lead to solve a problem. Take initiative to change what you feel is wrong in society. For an example, if you think, women are not respected in India, YOU be the one who respects them. Charity and CHANGE both begin at home. :-) Thank You Ashish Johri for A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Only under rational process run rational social system, an individual is able to do the most contribution to the society. Because under the natural process, everyone is forced by the stable behavioural strategy in the natural process to compete for his survival --- he is forced by the process in this system that he cannot act freely according rationality that conform the ultimate interest of the society --- he is forced to be short term self- interest oriented in the natural process. and the coincident of all the individuals\u2019 action in natural process is the destruction of the manmade social system and the supporting natural systems of the planet. So say people is not rational is not correct. It is his physical existence in that gaming environment conditions (the competition environment conditions) that forced him by his physical survival needs to behave in a set of behaviour --- that is to say, his rationality level is confined to the range his physical survival allow which is the stable behavioural strategy in natural process for process level natural selection. But in manmade social system, this winning behavioural strategy for process level natural selection is also the losing behavioural strategy for system level natural selection. So the natural process in manmade system is that --- natural process locks human behaviour in the stable strategy and forces them to stay on the process towards extinction. That is the way nature select rational being from irrational being by its system level natural selection. So, the only way human can reach far future (I mean the endless future) is to change from natural process to rational process in rational system. Only when human rationality reached this level to make this change, this human race can be selected by nature to survive on in the universe. 1. Therefore the greatest contribution of an individual is to join force with others to realise this process change. 2. To live a materially minimised life, and comply with one child policy that is the secondary level of contribution because that only work under the rational process runs rational system. 3. As for whether you can contribute to the effective information evolution efficiency of thinking and biological information, you can relax on that part and do what you can, you should keep in mind your greatest contribution is on the preservation of the limited real value which is the material base that determine the evolution conditions and evolution time and that determine the evolution level human can reach that finally decide the fate of human race, because the rate of the evolution is intrinsically controlled by the thermodynamic process. What we need to do is to keep this process last the longest time span in best possible conditions. ",

            "answer_text": "The individual, such as yourself, may consider an idea that is not widely expressed: each human has the authority to choose beneficial behavior. This is so, because the human individual may control personal energy during every moment of life and may balance three external powers everyone continuously faces. Unfortunately, existing cultures inculcate the belief that an individual needs a higher authority. Ironically, the higher authorities are typically weak and ineffective. Therefore, a person who does not accept personal authority may wander from authority to authority and thereby waste a human life. Unfortunately, it happens often. The second idea that is not widely expressed is that conformance to society does not satisfy pursuit of individual happiness. The individual wants but does not articulate private liberty with civic morality, where \u201ccivic\u201d refers to individuals who collaborate for mutual safety and security more than for a municipality, doctrine, or tradition. In a civic culture, collaborating citizens discover and benefit from actual reality or the-objective-truth rather than conflict for dominant opinion. Consequently, civil order, both civilization (coercion) and government (force), conform to the-objective-truth. Peoples who may adopt these concepts might develop distinct cultures, because, like individuals, nations have differing perceptions of happiness. However, civic nations commit to comprehensive safety and security. But not everyone participates. For example, some people erroneously think crime pays. So the need for statutory justice never ceases. However, since justice is discovered on the-objective-truth, criminals (who also have individual authority) appreciate it more than law from arbitrary opinion. Therefore, crime lessens as statutory justice increases. In this post, I have touched on four authorities some human beings may learn to balance: individual authority, the-objective-truth, mankind\u2019s civil order, and private liberty with civic morality. The latter is the un-realized American dream. ",

The taxes you pay go to lot of worth while things like funding emergency services and wellfare for people who need it, yes it funds other things that are less benificial but ultimately if more goes in more comes out.. The things you buy support bussinesses and jobs, you can donate money to charities of your choice, you can use you extra free time to volunteer and help people. As much as people think earning money is an exclusively greedy thing you cant deny how a rich person can do so much more than a poor person purely because they have more resources. Doing these things dont make you a better person you cant buy morals, but provided a rich person and a poor person have the exact same morals and levels of charitablity, they are just as \"good\" as eachother.
