            "answer_text": "Edit: The original question was: Scientific Method:How can I learn to ask good questions? That's a good start. The purpose of asking questions is to either end up with answers, or even more questions. You're trying to learn new things and, to do that, you need to (a) discard as many of your assumptions as you possibly can, and (b) learn to distrust expectations.  Just keep questioning everything -- even if, in the beginning, your questions don't lead you anywhere -- and you will get better at it. I have also found that it helps to reject reductionism, and most other tools you might have picked up from studying science. Read books on philosophy, and expose yourself to ideas from academic pursuits outside of science -- that's one of the most effective ways of widening your perspective, and will eventually help you question things you would otherwise take for granted.

            "answer_text": "The original question had parentheses encapsulating the word good. This insinuates a particular type of emperical question. The word scientific was also added which means a formula question which means producing the expected green. During my lifetime, censorship has remarkably changed. James Jones tryed to write like people talked ,had sex, and and spelled. Now a machine changes our words making us sound ridiculous. The length and esoterica of a question are at risk. To write a good question, keep it simple ,but with a twist that lures people in and keeps their interest. Know your audience. Create a following.look at other people's good questions and you will see a commonality.follow the emerging patterns. ",
