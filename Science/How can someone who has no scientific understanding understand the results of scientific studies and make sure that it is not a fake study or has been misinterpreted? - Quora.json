            "answer_text": "They can\u2019t. That\u2019s a very difficult thing to do. We defer partly to reviewers - if it was published in a peer reviewed journal, hopefully the reviewers will do that job. In addition, there are so many studies to read, that it would be very hard for anyone to collate the information - that\u2019s why review papers are published, which summarize the evidence and evaluate the studies. Writing review articles is also challenging. I know about this, because my spouse does this. Here\u2019s a recent report she was involved in: Gender Differences in Response to Alcohol Use Disorder Treatment. The reference section (including references that might have been relevant, but which turned out not to be) is 155 pages long Here\u2019s part of the abstract: After screening 13,771 citations and reviewing the full text of 1,434 \u00a0publications, we identified 24 original studies with findings reported in 63 \u00a0publications and four systematic reviews that met inclusion criteria. Studies \u00a0assessed gender differences in the efficacy of a treatment modality or the \u00a0efficacy of an intervention only in male or female study participants. While \u00a0some individual studies found evidence of gender differences, we did not find \u00a0evidence of systematic gender differences in treatment effects across studies. \u00a0The analysis did not detect systematic gender differences in treatment response \u00a0in studies reporting outcomes for both men and women (DiffoDiff 0.42; CI \u20130.80, \u00a01.64; 7 RCTs) or in indirect comparisons across studies (DiffoDiff 0.03; CI \u2013\u00a00.28, 0.34; p = 0.840). Direct comparisons found conflicting results in \u00a0individual studies for treatment compliance, but no statistically significant \u00a0effect was detected in indirect comparisons across 11 RCTs (DiffoDiff 0.31; CI \u00a0\u20130.03, 0.65; p = 0.073). Only two studies reported on adverse events, and both \u00a0evaluated naltrexone: The studies reported more findings of nausea in women \u00a0taking naltrexone than in men. (Rates of nausea were not related to rates of \u00a0heavy drinking.)\u00a0",

By studying science.By finding someone with the patience to explain using analogies that you can relate toBy searching science related sites on the internetBy realising that science is funded entirely on success. That concocting nonsense and faking results leads to irreversible damage: to a scientist\u2019s reputationto their career and income, thus their entire life plan/future to their family and friends to the willingness of others to work for or with them to future funding prospects to their credibility on any aspect of science to anyone else utilising their fake results, burning time, effort and funds to future job prospectsReligion on the other hand is completely devoid of any accountability, even its criminal element are enabled and afforded desperate protection.
