            "answer_text": "I like a not so recent paper from a few years back from the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford based on he thoughts of a member of the IPPC scientific panel.  He discusses some specific non-linear effects that could play a large part in a \u201crunaway\u201d climate change scenario, hastening the rapid change from our current, relatively stable state, to one that would be much different and probably detrimental to humanity.He discusses just two specific mechanisms: large scale forest fires and arctic tundra melting, both of which have the potential to provide very strong positive feedbacks into a global warming scenario.  Forests, and vegetation in general, are key to the fixing, or sequestering, of carbon through their natural process of taking in carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.  This process increases as vegetation gradually expands due to a warming climate, which can have a stabilizing effect on global warming.  However, large vegetation burning episodes, like those in Australia in the last few years, lead to a rapid and significant release of CO2 into the atmosphere.  If we enter a phase where large fires contribute huge amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of additional fires, an unstable positive feedback loop can form.  For example, the heavily forested tropics, which don\u2019t currently experience large scale fires due to humidity levels, could rapidly become sources of carbon instead of sinks if they dry out enough to become flammable.Likewise, the rapid melting of arctic ice can release massive amounts of sequestered methane (a much more potent GHG than CO2) and CO2, leading to additional ice melting \u2013 the same type of unstable feedback mechanism.There is more complexity to this, of course.  For instance, expanding vegetation north and south towards the poles, driven by milder temperatures and shorter winters, has a mitigating effect on global warming as discussed above; however, it also replaces light colored tundra and ice with darker vegetation, reducing the albedo of the Earth\u2019s surface and increasing the absorption of energy.All of this points to an urgent need to continue development of complex, coupled physical models of our climate system, so we can understand better the magnitude and direction of all of these interrelated effects.  The biggest problem with these non-linear effects is, of course, that once we help get them started, we do not have a mechanism to stop them.  It is entirely possible that we could pass a threshold without knowing it until it is too late (sort of like recessions \u2013 they are never official until a few quarters later, when the data can be analyzed).

            "answer_text": "The feedback loops both reinforcing and stabilizing are always present. Occasionally for a short time the reinforcing feedbacks could overwhelm the stabilizing feedbacks, but never \u201cirreversibly\u201d. Are we in one of those periods now? Unfortunately the climate models, sophisticated as they are, don\u2019t really give any conclusive indication. They are not sophisticated enough. So far at least, while the reinforcing feedbacks are growing, the stabilizing feedbacks have prevented a \u201crunaway\u201d worst case scenario from happening. In fact the so called \u201chiatus\u201d isn\u2019t a reduction in warming or a cooling, it is the pause of the acceleration of warming. So the period we\u2019re are in now the stabilizing feedbacks have completely eliminated any \u201crunaway\u201d warming. Still warming at a more or less steady rate though. That could change, but so far no evidence of it. Without evidence, there is no way to claim it. In conclusion I would say that yes it is possible, but so far looking pretty unlikely. ",
