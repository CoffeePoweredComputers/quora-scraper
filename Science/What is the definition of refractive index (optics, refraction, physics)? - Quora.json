            "answer_text": "The refractive index [math]n[/math] is the factor by which an electromagnetic wave slows down relative to the speed in a vacuum [math]c_0[/math]. Given this, the speed v of an electromagnetic wave is [math]v = \\frac{c_0}{n}[/math] [math]c_0[/math] = 299,792,458 m/s The refractive index can be calculated from the constitutive parameters. These are the relative permittivity [math]\\varepsilon_r[/math] and relative permeability [math]\\mu_r[/math]. [math]n = \\sqrt{\\mu_r \\varepsilon_r}[/math] Here is a video explaining how the speed of a wave is what causes refraction:  If you want to learn more about this, checkout the series of excellent and graphical videos under Topics 3, 6 and 7 here: Electromagnetic Field Theory - EMPossible ",
