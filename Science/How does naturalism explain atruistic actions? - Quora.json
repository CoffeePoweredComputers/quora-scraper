            "answer_text": "Two excellent answers so far. Let me add some more evolutionary perspective. Evolution in a biological sense means changes in the gene pool over successive generations. Given that, here is what evolution is not about: Survival of the fittest. Why do I say that? Because the truth is that every single individual of every species does this: They die. Now, if every individual of a species dies, then the species goes extinct, right? \u201cNo!\u201d you say. \u201cWhat an idiot!\u201d You think. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that Schardl guy know that organisms reproduce?\u201d Bingo! The only evolutionary meaning we have is based on reproduction, and how that process contributes to the gene pool, and how that helps ensure the continuation of the gene pool. So, are you with me? That\u2019s really obvious so far. Right? But there are some things that aren\u2019t as obvious, yet are just as important: Reproduction doesn\u2019t mean making copies. Yes, some species can reproduce that way, but it\u2019s a losing proposition unless, every so often, a couple of individuals get together and recombine their individual bits of the gene pool (sexual reproduction). This has two effects:Enhances the prospects for survival of the gene pool.Allows the gene pool to change in a way that further enhances its survivability even in the face of changing environment or ecology.An individual can contribute to the continuation of the gene pool without actually reproducing. Think about that. How often do you hear of a hero who sacrificed their life to save the lives of other? Such actions tend to help promote the continuation of the gene pool. That\u2019s altruism.",

            "answer_text": "If naturalism does explain altruistic actions, which is not exactly clear, one explanation is \u201ckin selection.\u201d The genes are not in fact solitary or selfish, they are part of a system. The selective advantage of certain genes, for example those of a queen ant, may depend upon the survival of other genes, for example those of the worker and male ants, or even upon the survival of aphids that the ants tend for food.
