            "answer_text": "This is a lovely question that needs quite a long answer to explain it, and strikes at the whole idea iof how we relate to the world. It appears that we are not born with our brains as a completely \"empty slate\" .  It seems that we have some inbuilt \"models of the world\" that are so universal that it is hard to believe that they might just be cultural, ie learned beliefs and behaviours. Anyway, rather than deliberate on the \"nature vs nurture\"  debate, we can look at a little bit of what we know about the way our thinking has changed.  We seem to have a kind of built in model of physics that the mind uses that is based on learning from limited inputs. That is the first point that science has revealed, just how limited the experiential range of biology really is. Life exists in such a narrow window of possibility.  When we discovered glass making we discovered how to bend light, scoping. How to make microscopes and macroscopes, or telescopes as we prefer to refer to them by an engineering characteristic. And we can confirm first hand the reports that an upward change of scale reveals mainly empty space. But the same report  from those peering downward is not so publically available. Why not?  Well because light itself runs out. The ability of a microscope to resovle an image depends on the very wavelength of light we use, which is finite. In order to get smaller images we need spcialised equipment, or the power of the human mind. Or both. But even an electron microscope will struggle to image the relatively low energy electrons that are stuck into atoms. The closest we have ever got is a fuzzy blurred shape of atoms that requires some reconstruction to produce such remarkable images. You can find examples on line, and here in Quora.  So to get into an atom, we cannot use light or particles, we have to use models. Of which we have excellent information available. Logically we  we cannot expect that something much smaller than visible light will exist in a form that we can describe using terms taken from our narrow scale of everyday existence. How can it make sense to talk about colour for example,  for objects that are now smaller than light itself? Of course we cannot. This is our second lesson. That concepts we take for granted can become meaningless.  It is not an easy mental trick, as humans we are not used to giving up on the natural expectations of everday reality, or of its underpinning conceptions, except perhaps in dreams, or altered states of consciousness. To follow science is to expand consciousness without needing drugs, new ideas are trippy, but they do require some mental hardwork and preparation. The mind has to construct alternative reality, but one with strict rules, rather than some dreamy anarchy. So here we are now in the world of atoms,  a strangle land where everyday concepts are suspect.  The third lesson we have discovered from science  is that there is a world of \"properties\". The question you asked was indeed about one such property, the relative separation of parts. Does space run out too? We suspect it does, but not just yet, not at the scale of atoms or even the scale of its tiny nucleus. Luckily it seems ok the treat space as continuous at atomic scales. But since Edison, Marconi, and  Faraday's time (et al) we entered the electric age,  and other properties of the world have taken their places alongside Newton's forces and masses.  The properties have turned out to be critical to our explanations, and to our new models  of reality. And the rise of mathematics too, has had a tremendous effect in how we must relearn concepts that we take for granted.  Also we have been shown by Einstein the power of the, \"gedanken experiment\". Using the mind to explore new ideas. Or as they said in the sixties \"take a trip without ever leaving the farm\".  So think about force now. You can experience that intuitively through your own body. What is the difference between a soft and a hard surface? The force profile. How steep and quickly the force rises with distance. Could it be that the concept of a pure or flat hard surface is,  like infinite colour,  a mental myth? Appropriately evolved to operate simply and effectively in the scale of living creatures? We suspect our own limitations, there are limits to how perceptively we can sense this mental ideal of \"flatness\".  So really it comes as no surprise when science informs us that flatness is mere illusion. The microscope was even enough to acheive that. Perceptions of flatness and hardness  belong to a Platonic constructed mind-verse of idealised reality, and have long since been given up. We live in a world of forces now, not the world of  \"matter\"  in the sense that was used by the ancient ones.  This  does not put the idealised \"instinctive\" world to rest. Not only is the simplified and now abondoned instinctive world more reassuring physically, it is also the basis of ancient thought for a socially idealised world of moral certitude. Continuous surfaces with no gaps are perfectly suited to moral universe with no gaps. The spiritual realm that can be explained to children will be one imbued with magical fluids.  Indeed, if we think about how we \"naturally\"  think, we will automatically think about force the way we think about space,  as a kind of invisible water without the wetness,  or air without windiness.  So the fourth lesson is that we can be  misguided by our natural instincts. What is natural is highly valued, and people will not easily give up on beliefs, that natural in any sense must be good and right and correct. Or that physical objects can be \"imbued\" with \"superrnatural\" properties or qualities.  What we have instead is a whole new theory of reality called the quantum theory, that is full of startling new ideas involving probabilities and corelations. The simple naive ideas of particles and empty space have all gone out the window. So the question as asked contains assumptions that make the question a bit meaningless. The problem is that reality,  as it is now to he understood, is not easy. Not so trivial. It has become less accessible.  Now we have bundles of properties probabilistically distributed in space. Empty space is a meaningless term. How does a particle occupy space in the first place? If you presume that this particle A is here, and that one B is there, then already you have made too many assumptions. Each particle occupies space to some degree. This is a new concept. So our fifth lesson occurs. We need new concepts. We are used to thinking and talking of existence in boolean terms, true or false, but what do we make of \"could be\" as a principle in the physical world, not just in human affairs? It turns out that the vacuum itself has this nature, a seethng quantum foam of virtual particles.  ",

            "answer_text": "Look at this picture of silicon atoms. Does that look like 99% empty space to you?  That is a real picture of real atoms taken with a scanning tunneling microscope - probably the highest and clearest resolution pictures ever taken. You undoubtedly ask this question because when you look at a brick in your hand, it doesn't look like 99% empty space, so our common sense tells us that this idea must be wrong, but you want some reassurance that it is right with some sort of convincing explanation. Or, the alternative is that your intuition is correct, the atom is not 99% empty space and it is the scientists who are wrong. Getting back to the picture of the atoms, we can see individual atoms which appear to have a very distinct shape with a bump on top and each atom completely fills the space it occupies like a hard little brick with distinct edges and boundaries. I would say that 'seeing' is believing because the reasons for scientists for believing in the tiny nucleus are mostly mathematical. This is very much like firing bullets into a black box and trying to figure out what's inside by what bounces back out. This is a very crude method compared to the scanning technique used by the picture I showed. If you want to go into the possible details of what you are actually looking at, which is a space filling atom which occupies practically 100% of the space, then you can read about an alternative theory of the atom which explains it. http://vixra.org/pdf/1303.0184v1.pdf This paper also casts great doubt on the Rutherford scattering experiments which are what are used to justify the current atomic model at 99% empty space.
