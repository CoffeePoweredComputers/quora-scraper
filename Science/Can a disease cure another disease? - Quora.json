The best-known examples are Edward Jenner's use in 1798 of cowpox to prevent smallpox and J.B. Haldane's 1942 observation that erythrocyte disorders such as thalassemia and sickle cell disease modify the severity of malaria. Patients with and carriers of cystic fibrosis may have genetic resistance to tuberculosis and/or secretory diarrhea. The beneficial effects of undernutrition have led to therapeutic diets for seizures, celiac disease, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. Finasteride for prostatic hypertrophy was developed after the observation that patients with male pseudohermaphrodism resulting from 5-alpha-reductase mutations do not develop prostatic hypertrophy. Rh immunoglobulin for Rh hemolytic disease prevention followed the observation that ABO incompatibility prevented Rh sensitization  ",

Look at the people who are prone to this disease, they always have roots in places where Malaria is prevalent. Cystic Fibrosis: Highly prevalent in Eastern European Jews. Because of the thickened lung secretions, CF traits offer protection against Tuberculosis, a common ailment among Jewish \u201cghettos\u201d. Kidney Disease and Hypertension: African Americans are plagued with issues with hypertension and kidney disease that tends to respond well to decreased sodium intake. When slaves were brought over in less than ideal conditions, they were at risk of dying from dehydration due to vomiting and diarrhea. Those with super efficient kidneys were the ones to survive and pass on their genes! ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps the most notable example is the so called \u201cmalariotherapy\u201d, practiced by Julius Wagner-Jauregg, who was awarded with Nobel price in 1927. Malariotherapy is used to treat tertiary syphilis, via deliberate infection of malaria parasite. Before the advent of penicillin, it was the only means of curing syphilis. Another example is virotherapy for cancers. It was originally identified that some patients experienced remission after viral infections. Examples include a woman who spontaneously recovered from cervical cancer after receiving rabies vaccine (a live vaccine), and several leukemia patients who recovered after flu or measles infection. Since then there're some practices of treating cancers by deliberate infection of viruses (e.g. measles, mumps), but most of them yielded little efficacy. The field of oncolytic virotherapy experienced a renaissance in 1990s, when reverse genetics was developed. Reverse genetics enables direct manipulation of viral genomes, which makes viruses safer and more effective. The first oncolytic virotherapy, Imlygic was approved in 2015, and many others are under development. Notable examples include PVSRIPO and Toca 511 for glioblastoma(both of which won the BTD) and JX594 for hepatocellular carcinoma. ",

Found that they were cured after surviving malaria. The reason was that the temperature at which the Treponema pallidum which causes syphilis can survive, is in a very narrow range. Very close to human temperature. It could not withstand the body temperature of up to 40-42 degree Celsius that can occur during a fever attack. So if they survived the malaria attack, they got cured from Syphilis. ",

The only thing I can think of right off the top of my tiny head is how rabies is sometimes able to infect a non-vector animal because said animal is sick and has a fever.
