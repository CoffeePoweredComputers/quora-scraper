            "answer_text": "Number of proton in an atom is always equal to the atomic no. Of the atom. Most cases, no of electron = no of proton . Proton is the subatomic particle of an element that has got positive charge. It basically determines the electron configuration for e.g. Oxygen is 2.6 since it has got 8 atoms whereas Carbon is 2.4 since it has 6 atoms.Not only that, it also determines the placement of that element in the periodic table.. How? Well, potassium has the electron configuration of 2.8.8.1 because it got 19 electrons and hence it has one valence electron. Why one? Because it is in the first group. In contrast halogens (group 7). Example..chlorine has atomic no 17 which means it has 17 electrons and the electron configuration will be 2.8.7 and hence it has 7 valence electrons because it is in the 7 th group. Last one, noble gases or group 0, has 8 valence electrons and are stable elements because of their proton nos. let's take neon as an example. It's electron configuration is 2.8 and since it's second shell is completely filled, we say it's stable and does not need to react with others to gain/lose electrons.In a nutshell, the the group the element is placed in depends on the electron configuration as the valence electrons found in the electron configuration indicate to us which group the element should be placed in .. eg. (Alkali metals/transition metals/metalloids/halogens/noble gases)",

            "answer_text": "It determines which element the atom is. It was known as Atomic number before anyone knew what it was. Later it was realised this was the number of protons. This in turn determined the number of electrons the atom would have when electrically neutral, and this was the basis of all chemistry. The number of neutrons determines what Isotope it is. Chemistry is almost identical between isotopes. Hydrogen alone can manage with just a proton. For heavier atoms, there are many more neutrons than protons. ",
