A PROTON, , has SPIN, and CHARGE \u2026. and it thus propagates a magnetic field. And the proton responds to the different electronegativities of the atoms to which it is bound by SLIGHTLY varying its magnetic field. When a sample is placed in a (powerful) magnetic field, the protons it contains have TWO orientations, UP or DOWN with respect to the applied magnetic field \u2026 by applying a radio frequency, the proton may be flipped up or down so that it is resonance with the applied field. And the frequency of resonance is PARTICULAR to that PROTON in THAT chemical environment. And while this may seem a bit abstract, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a powerful, and DIRECT method of characterization, and analysis. NMR spectroscopy can be applied to , and other nuclei, and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy is a very powerful means of chemical analysis\u2026when a new organic compound is published, details of its proton and  NMR spectra must be supplied\u2026 ",
