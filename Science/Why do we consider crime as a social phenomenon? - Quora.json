            "answer_text": "Because said crimes occur in every society throughout human history. It seems some humans don\u2019t have their ancient barbaric instincts under control at all times. Non violent stealing, and violent stealing are commonplace in all modern societies for example. Society itself is not the cause for this human behavior, rather many variables effect how humans react/behave within a society, such as government corruption, human genetics, labor policies, economic policies, political policies, discrimination policies, and poor rearing are some examples. I can safely make a prediction, if a society eliminated all negative variables effecting citizens there would still be some crime. There will always be small percentage of a society who either enjoy committing crimes or acting barbaric, and others are simply mentally unstable, both groups will never follow any accepted norms of a society. Point being society is created, maintained, and governed by people. Ultimately it is the individuals within a society that are responsible for crime within said society assuming it is democratic form of government. I hope this aides your query, squeezed synopsis of an entire book into one paragraph. ",
