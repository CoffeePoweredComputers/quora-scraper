            "answer_text": "Gravity is a force as defined by the great genius Isaac Newton. It is indeed a force that can accelerate an object if acts on it. It is equal to g= 9.8 m/s^2. Gravity is not warping of spacetime as proposed by Einstein. It is totally incorrect. Space is continuous through out the universe. It goes through every thin i.e. quarks, protons, neutrons, electrons, atoms, planets, stars, galaxies, mass, gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Nothing exists without space. Space is not affected by anything. It has no center or boundary. It is infinite. It exists. dimensions X, Y AND Z are not for space, but for objects. There is no grid of points in space. One cannot locate points in space or measure distance between points in space. But one can locate points on/in objects and can measure distance between point on/in objects. There is no sunrise, sunset or changing seasons in space, there is no change in space. There is no time in it. Space and time are related to each other at all. There is no east-west, north-south or up-down in space. Spacetime is not real and ir does not exist. It is nothing but \u2018luminous spacetime aether\u2019. Warping of spacetime cannot accelerate any objects. Acceleration needs force. In SR, Einstein equated gravity and acceleration. It was totally wrong. he did not understand laws of motion and gravitation proposed by Newton. There is no such thing as free fall and there is no such thing as free rise either. Gravity does not disappear in free fall or free rise. ",

            "answer_text": "Gravitational pull is like the tension of a gravitational force field (over a distance or surface, or volume). It is determined by the distribution of mass density in our universe. According to Newton\u2019s Gravitational Equation, it is directly related to (increased by) the forces two masses have on one another (mass squared) and indirectly related (decreased by) distance between the gravitational wells of those masses. Of course if more than one body is involved, we have a many bodied problem like the pull on our oceans by both the sun and our moon (Tidal Variations - The Influence of Position and Distance ). n-body problem - Wikipedia ",
