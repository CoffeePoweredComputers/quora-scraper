            "answer_text": "Firstly, try to put the copper wire on a small piece of styrofoam on top of water, then place the magnet close to the copper piece but don't touch it. Then if it moves away, the copper's purity is above 95% But if it gets pulled to the magnet its lesser than 90% copper. This is caused by the diamagnetism of copper, it's diamagnetism is so weak that if other metals were mixed in it would change it's magnetic properties. ",
