            "answer_text": "Yes, most definitely! When fast asleep, your breathing or oxygen levels will decrease by quite alot, your heart rate will decrease by quite alot as well. Your body core temperature decreases as well, your eyes or pupils don't dilate to light i believe, it's like your dead but you're obviously not, though ofcourse you will never know this, due to the case of you being in a state of unconsciousness. The oxygen levels decreasing when unconscious or when in a deep sleep is because the brain that controls voluntarily stuff, such as oxygen for example is pretty much deactivated, and i believe the reason for that is, to save or conserve the energy for when we awake once again, because the brain knows that we or it will be using up alot of energy throughout the day, probably more than say 12 to 18 hours, depending on the human themselves, so the brain obviously realises this, so it has to take persuasive action lol, too much oxygen is very bad, so the brain to keep us safe has no choice but to sort of put oxygen and everything else offline for some hours or so ",

            "answer_text": "It shouldn\u2019t change much in a normal healthy person. The real danger is obstructive sleep apnea - cases where the victim tends to snore loudly and stops breathing for a considerable amount of time. Pulse oximetry has shown that PaO2 may go down to as low as 80 from a normal of 98. This is the reason for the popularity of CPAP devices that are becoming so ubiquitous. ",
