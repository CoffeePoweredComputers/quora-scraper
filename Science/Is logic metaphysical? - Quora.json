            "answer_text": "No. Logic is a different branch of Philosophy. It deals with correct form of reasoning. It helps us differentiate between a valid argument and an invalid argument. For example: All insects are animals. All beetles are insects. Therefore, all bettles are animals. Here, we try to find out if this argument is valid or not, what's the form and mood, what kind of inference is this,etc. We also study formal and informal fallcies and how to identify them. Only one answer exists for each problem. Logic intersects the field of mathematics. Metaphysics on the other hand deals with understanding the reality and Nature of the universe, human being and the purpose of everything in general. For example it attempt to answer such question: What will be the end of universe? Does God exist? Is there anything such as re-birth? Is everything a stimulation? Do the things we see really exist the way we see it? There are various ideas put forward by various philosophers and thinkers. Realism, Dualism, Idealism, Materialism etc. Many answers to the same question are often considered acceptable and form the part of study and speculation. ",

            "answer_text": "Logic exists within the confines of our 4 dimensional spacetime. Outside of our universe, we just don\u2019t know what laws of physics govern the hyperdimensional spaces we are expanding into, assuming that there is something beyond our universe. Metaphysical ideas deal with concepts beyond/outside of our spacetime bubble. There may be a \u201clogic\u201d outside of our world but it is likely very different from our logical reasoning that we (hopefully) employ everyday. For example, it is logical that there is only one line that passes through a point near another line that never intersects with the second line (Euclid\u2019s 5th postulate). However, in Lobachevskian hyperboloid spacetime, there are infinite lines passing through this point that won\u2019t intersect with the line in question. If you live in a world of Lobachevskian spacetime (e.g. near black hole), then this fact of infinite lines passing through a point that never intersect the original line would be \u201clogical\u201d to you. In Riemannian (spherical) spacetime, no such line exists. We largely live in Euclidean (flat) spacetime. Logic as we use it is very much rooted in our local physical world in which we exist and thus the local laws of physics that governs this world. We can get into quantum mechanics and \u201cspooky\u201d action at a distance or quantum tunneling through a barrier and then that gets even weirder and \u201cillogical\u201d from the standpoint of someone who exists in a largely classical world.
