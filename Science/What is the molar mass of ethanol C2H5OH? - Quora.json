            "answer_text": "Long answer: Ethanol, C2H5OH, has 2 carbon atoms, 6 hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. Firstly, what is molar mass? Molar mass is the amount of grams in one mole of substance. A mole is a quantity of substance. It was defined so that every mole of carbon weighs 12 grams. Which gives us [math]6,022x10\u00b2\u00b2[/math] atoms of carbon. And if we take [math]6,022x10\u00b2\u00b2 [/math]atoms of hydrogen, it would give us 1 gram, and 16 grams for every mole of oxygen. If there\u2019s 2 carbon atoms per molecule of ethanol, we do the math: 12 grams per mole x 2 atoms per molecule = 24 grams of carbon per mole of molecules Same for hydrogen and oxygen: 1 gram per mole x 6 atoms per molecule = 6 grams of hydrogen per mole of molecules 16 grams per mole x 1 atom per molecule = 16 grams of oxygen per mole of molecules Now we add 24 grams of carbon + 6 grams of hydrogen + 16 grams of oxygen per mole , it gives us a total of 46 grams per mole of ethanol. If every mole of ethanol has 46 grams, then that is the molar mass of ethanol. Short answer: Ethanol has a molar mass of 46 grams.  ",

            "answer_text": "The molar mass (M) of a substance is the mass of one mole of that substance. For a molecule, the molar mass is calculated by multiplying the subscript of each element by its molar mass, which is its atomic weight on the periodic table in g/mol. C2H5OH is the formula for ethanol. The molar masses of each element in the ethanol molecule are: M C = 12.011 g/mol M H = 1.008 g/mol M O = 15.999 g/mol When calculating the molar mass of an alcohol, the subscripts for hydrogen can be combined. The formula for ethanol can also be written as C2H6O. M C2H5OH = (2 \u00d7 12.011 g/mol) + (6 \u00d7 1.008 g/mol) + (1 \u00d7 15.999 g/mol) = 46.069 g/mol Answer: The molar mass of ethanol, C2H5OH, is 46.069 g/mol. ",
