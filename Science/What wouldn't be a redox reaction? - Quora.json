            "answer_text": "Any reaction that doesn't have at least one atom that increases in oxidation number during the reaction and at least one atom that decreases in oxidation number during the reaction is not a redox reaction. The atom that decreases and the atom that increases can be atoms of the same element. Examples: 2H2 + O2 --> 2H2O ( Atoms of elements have an oxidation number of 0, so that the hydrogen atoms change from 0 to +1, which is oxidation, while the oxygen atoms change from 0 to -2, which is reduction. So the reaction is a redox reaction.)  An example of a reaction in which atoms of the same element undergo both oxidation and reduction is: 2 MnO4- (aq) + 5 Mn (s) + 16 H+ (aq) -> 7 Mn+2 (aq) + 4 H2O (l). (In this reaction, 2 manganese atoms change from +7 to +2, which is reduction, and 5 manganese atoms change from 0 to +2, which is oxidation. )  An example of a non-redox reaction is Pb(NO3)2 (aq) + Na2SO4 (aq) ---> 2 NaNO3 (aq) + PbSO (s). (No atom changes its oxidation state in this reaction.) ",

Examples of non-redox reaction; Neutralization reaction.Double decomposition reaction.These reaction occurs both naturally and artifialy in everyday life, but its reactant undergoes no changes in Oxidation states before and after the reaction. Thus, due to no change in Oxidation states it can be considered as Non-Redox reaction. ",
