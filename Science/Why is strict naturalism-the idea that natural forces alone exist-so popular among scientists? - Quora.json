            "answer_text": "By \u2018forces\u2019, I think you mean \u2018things that control behaviour of things\u2019, rather than a strict physics definition of forces. Science is the attempt to reduce everything to causes. But the dilemma is that only data and causes discernible by man are available for consideration, by the definition of science. In other words, science is naturalistic by nature, and therefore it is geared to looking for and finding naturalistic answers. That\u2019s why scientists tend to venerate naturalism. It\u2019s likely to be inherent in their worldview, because it\u2019s how they are trained to think. That\u2019s not necessarily wrong, and the hard sciences have achieved a lot. But it is worth being aware of the potential limitations of this method and outlook. otherwise, like many, we may get blindsided by the very word \u2018science\u2019. Maths, and Godel\u2019s incompleteness theorems in particular, point us to the fact that science pursued in this way is actually not entirely logical! Godel proved that for any set of self-consistent axioms, there are statements not governed by these axioms, and that the system itself cannot prove that the system itself is consistent. Stated more simply, no closed system of axioms is ever logically complete, even if the axioms themselves are self-consistent. There\u2019s a rather strong hint in here that the scientific method, naturalistic reductionism, is a fatally flawed exercise if your goal is to bring it to final completion. Stated another way, science as we perform it is not a good vehicle on which to arrive at final truth. Stated yet another way, good science is possible, perfect and complete science almost certainly isn\u2019t possible. Regardless of how long and hard you pursue it. Here I\u2019m talking about \u2018hard\u2019 science, with attempts made to conform reality to a concise mathematical model. A lot of science is nowhere near as logically rigorous as this even, and represents simply a possible narrative over a set of data. That data is often patchy. Hard Darwinism springs to mind. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea is to try to explain something with as few loose ends as possible. In general, explanations that include \u201cinvisible people\u201d are way more complicated than explanations that only include \u201cinvisible forces\u201d. Forces are simple \u2014 you measure a few numbers, make a few definitions, and you\u2019re done. But with invisible people, you have to explain who they are, what they want, what they did, how they did what they did, why they are invisible, how invisible people exist in the first place \u2014 there are a million loose ends. For example, I lose my keys, I look around the house and I find them on the counter. The simplest explanation is that I had them and I put them down and then forgot all about it. It\u2019s consistent with the evidence and it has no loose ends. A more complicated explanation would be \u201csomebody took my keys and put them here\u201d. But now we have a bunch of loose ends: Who took them? Why? When did they do this? How did they get the keys in the first place? So I have a lot more work to do to finish this explanation. I\u2019ve got to interview potential suspects, explain their motivation, prove they had the opportunity, and so on. An even more complicated explanation would be \u201cthe ghost of my father took my keys and put them here.\u201d Now you have a huge number of loose ends \u2014 you have to explain what a ghost is, what it\u2019s made of, how it does things, why it does things, and so on. Chances are, if I worked for the rest of my life on this explanation, I would never finish it. Naturalism is not some kind of absolute law or some kind quasi-religious faith that scientists have. It\u2019s a heuristic. A rule of thumb. It\u2019s related to other guidelines like Occam\u2019s Razor (\u201cthe simplest explanation is probably right\u201d) or Parsimony (\u201ckeep your answer as short as possible\u201d). Science doesn\u2019t say that explanations with invisible people are wrong \u2014 it only says, look I have this explanation here that is plausible and simple, so let\u2019s work with that (at least until somebody finds a way to show it won\u2019t work). And if you think about it, science uses a lot of invisible things \u2014 gravity, for example, isn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d thing. What\u2019s real is the way things fall. The \u201cinvisible spring\u201d of gravity is metaphysical \u2014 the philosopher\u2019s word for \u201cthings that you can\u2019t see or touch but we believe in them anyway.\u201d So science doesn\u2019t have a rule \u201cno invisible powers!\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s not perfect naturalistic. It just prefers simplicity to mystery. ",
