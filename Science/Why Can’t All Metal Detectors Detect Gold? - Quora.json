            "answer_text": "First off, not all (theoretically possible) metal detectors work the same way. As the excellent response from Mr. White pointed out, the simplest and most inexpensive metal detectors are essentially magnetometers; I.e; they work exactly the same way that WWII mine detectors did (the steel spring used to keep a mine from exploding until pressure was applied and then released) made the surface mines readily detectable. However, a changing magnetic field will induce an opposite magnetic field through induced current on the surface of any electrical conductor nearby. That\u2019s why a Wally-tally will often \u201csqueal\u201d when placed too close to a metal surface while operating. Detecting such signals is arguably harder than just checking latent magnetic fields, but it also offers some advantages, in that you can detect metal objects deeper in the soil. Last in the kit is magnetic resonance imagiing. On the scale of cost and difficulty, this is at the top of the list. All atoms have nuclei with magnetic moments (alright I\u2019m exaggerating slightly, but allow me a moment\u2019s digression). What I should have said is that all atoms when squeezed by sufficiently powerful magnetic fields will temporarily have a magnetic moment. You can think of such moments as spinning tops, which are temporarily pushed off-axis by the external magnetic field. When the external magnetic field is turned off, these \u201ctops\u201d suddenly right themselves, and in so doing throw off a radio signal which is characteristic of the structure of the atomic nuclei involved. There\u2019s good news and bad news. The good news is that it can not only tell you what atoms are in the sample, but which isotopes they consist of. The bad news is that the powerful magnetic fields required will rip any iron or steel right out of the sample. (People ask why it doesn\u2019t rip the iron in your blood hemoglobin out of you, and the answer is that hemoglobin offers such a weak induced field, it isn\u2019t affected \u2014 much). It does turn out to heat the blood volume slightly; a little known fact that even MRI techs rarely know. If the sample happens to be you, that could lead to a bad thing if you suddenly remember just at the last instant as the MRI tech flips the switch that you have a steel-jacketed pacemaker. Oops. In theory, if you put a lump of gold ore in an MRI and rejiggered the settings slightly, you could see the bright glow of the gold flecks in among the ghostly outline of the dross. Again, presuming that you could apply this same methodology to the ground, you could spot all those buried Inca tombs filled with gold, or maybe a missing pharaoh or two. Of course, you still have the slight problem of toting a multi-ton MRI. or its equivalent out into the jungle or desert. ",
