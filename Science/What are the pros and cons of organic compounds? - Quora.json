            "answer_text": "There are more organic compounds than all the other compounds combined. That\u2019s heck of a lot of compounds. I don\u2019t really understand what you mean by pros and cons of organic compounds. Nonetheless, it\u2019s too big of a divers group to generalize. If you mean organic food, that\u2019s an entirely different beast. \u201cOrganic\u201d means different things to different people. If by organic you mean home grown without any pesticides and you just harvest whatever is leftover after insects/bugs/critters etc help themselves to their share, they can\u2019t be unhealthy. I can\u2019t say whether they are healthier than others since I haven\u2019t conducted an experiment myself nor have I read up enough about the subject matter. If by organic you mean selective breeding plants that are insect/bug/critters resistant, they can be unhealthier than the ones you get from the grocery store. Think of why the insects aren\u2019t interested in consuming it? There\u2019s a chemical warfare inside the plant. Whatever you read about \u201corganic\u201d food, just read it carefully. See if they claims are supported by studies. Random blogs aren\u2019t the best place to get accurate information. This applies to pretty much anything you read on the internet. ",

            "answer_text": "Organic compounds are carbon-based compounds. All living things are made up of organic compounds. All substances that come from living organisms are also made up of organic compounds. That's a LOT of things. It doesn't really make sense to talk about their pros and cons. Maybe you meant: what are the pros and cons of using organic compounds for ______ (insert whatever application you are interested in). Or maybe you wanted to talk about organic foods, in which case the term \"organic\" means something completely different. ",
