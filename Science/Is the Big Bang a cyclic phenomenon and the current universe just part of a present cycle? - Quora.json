            "answer_text": "This is possible, but cannot be proved. This theory was promoted by Fred Hoyle, who was against the theory of the Big Bang (he also coined the term to ridicule it, but it caught on anyways). When the CMB was discovered by Penzias and Wilson in the 60s, Hoyle tried to explain it by the cyclic universe. The universe contracts, but there is enough energy to create a Big Bang, therefore creating a CMB. However, this is not possible to prove, so we will never know if this really is how our universe was created. It is doubtful that there is a cycle, especially since the universe is accelerating in its expansion. Since we do not yet know how dark energy works, the universe may as well suddenly contract in the future because of dark energy. But we will not know for now. ",

( Ekpyrotic universe - Wikipedia ) It would plausibly be a repeating event. There are some other ideas in this same direction, but all of them are speculations at this point. ",
