            "answer_text": "The pope emeritus will receive a monthly pension of 2,500 euros, according to Italian newspaper La Stampa. That translates to almost $3,300, or close to the monthly maximum of $3,350. There are some articles that tell us the Pope's income is in millions of dollars.  But that is all donations from different sources for charity works all around the world, and cannot be considered as the personal income of a Pope even if he has control on it.  Remember nobody consider the national income of US as the personal income of The President of USA. The current Pope is just one , although it sounds obvious only exists in the world a fee or what is the same since there is no equal , this means the great salary and wealth it possesses . Francisco I chose this name because of being Latin American making mention of San Francisco de Asis a noble Franciscan saint delivery to the poor and extreme humility that says the pope himself represent the renewal of religion. After the papacy of Benedict XVI on March 13, 2013 I was elected a bishop Francisco Jesuit cardinal scores but the story is what really wins the Pope? The first is that the potatoes do not have salary since it is an honorable position for them in addition to the vow of poverty they do to get elected , that simple popes do not enjoy the satisfaction of having money or gold in their hands (well gold if since all their ornaments and jewelry are of that material ) but otherwise their needs are covered by the government of the Vatican , which means they buy the home you want , you buy an iPod to Tweet and we buy almost everything .

            "answer_text": "The President receives a salary of $400,000 / year, with an expense allowance of $169,000 / year. The Pope does not receive a salary for his position. In fact, because Pope Francis specifically has made a vow of poverty, he is unable to own any property other than that which he is custodian of by virtue of being the Bishop of Rome. Other popes who have not made a vow of poverty are free to receive a salary, and Pope Emeritus Benedict has a pension of 24000 euros / yr. The Pope does have access to hundreds of millions of dollars each year, which are intended for charitable use and Church activities. None of that money is to benefit the Pope personally. The Church as a whole ensures that all of the Pope's needs in terms of clothing, shelter, and food are provided. So the Pope's salary is non-existent, his pension is about 1/10th the size, and his allowance is hundreds of times greater. ",
