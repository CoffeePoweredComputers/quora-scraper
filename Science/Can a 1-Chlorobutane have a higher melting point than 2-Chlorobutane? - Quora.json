            "answer_text": "Mpt 1-chlorobutane = -123 degC = 150K Mpt 2-chlorobutane = -140 degC = 133K Therefore the higher mpt compound is 1-chlorobutane. Explanation: Since both isomers have the same mass, they will have the same KE distribution at the same temperature. Breaking free of the solid structure (or the liquid surface) to change phase requires energy. Melting and boiling are effects largely affected by Kinetic Energy. The higher the temperature, the greater the movement of the molecules, the higher the KE and vice versa - EXCEPT during a phase change while some extra energy is being used to do the work of separating molecules against the forces of attraction (ie work = force x distance) - hence the constant temperature at mpt and bpt. At first glance, it might be expected that the two isomers would have the same mpt and bpt since they have the same mass. The data contradicts this. Examining the molecular structure gives the clue\u2026 Showing only carbons in the chain and the position of the Cl\u2026 1-chloro butane = C-C-C-C-Cl the molecule is very assymetrical with a strong dipole across the molecule. 2-chlorobutane = C-C-C(Cl)-C the molecule is almost symetrical resulting in a very weak dipole across the molecule. The effect of the C-Cl dipole is mitigated by the mesomeric effect of two neighbouring C atoms. The logic is: The stronger the dipole the greater the extent of attraction between molecules (Van der Waal\u2019s force)\u2026therefore the more work (= force x distance Joules) must be done to separate the molecules\u2026therefore the greater is the KE needed\u2026therefore the higher the temperature must be.The same logic applies to the explanation as to why 2-chlorobutane has the higher boiling point of the pair. Extension: An interesting and important feature of this logic applies to water which has much stronger hydrogen bonds between molecules and so has a more significant effect on mpt and bpt. Without the intermolecular attraction, water would have a boiling point (estimating by comparing with H2S) in the region of -100 degC and a melting point in the region of -175 degC, whereas with the hydrogen bonds, the boiling point is actually +100 degC and the mpt is 0 degC. This little fact is part of the explanation about why liquid water exists at the temperatures it does and why life as we know it has the narrow \u201cgolden\u201d temperature range to exist in. Another interesting fact is that water is the only liquid to freeze to produce a lower density solid (ice) which floats on the top thereby insulating the relatively warm liquid from a colder environment above the ice. In deep water this prevents water from freezing, making it possible for life to survive and also gives hope that life may exist on the frozen moon, Europa, which has liquid oceans beneath a thick ice crust. Water is the only liquid which has all of these properties (not to mention its incredibly unique chemical properties) and why it is essential for the search for life on other worlds. ",
