            "answer_text": "There used to be. I was partnered to a man named Jerry for 13 years. It was a dysfunctional relationship in a number of ways, but it also worked. Our lives became so intertwined that I couldn\u2019t imagine getting along without him. The thought that it might end scared me, I didn\u2019t think I could manage. As time went on, there was more negativity, as we had issues which we weren\u2019t addressing, and they just got worse. Finally I came to the conclusion that I had to leave, because I was losing myself in the relationship. I had compromised so much of what I wanted, how I felt, and what I believed, I was losing all sense of myself as an individual. I put up with so much mistreatment & bad behavior, because I was afraid to leave. With a few year\u2019s counseling, I finally made a plan to leave. I had intended to sit Jerry down & explain why I was leaving, allowing him to have his say as well, but in the end I chickened out. I knew, if he asked me to stay, I wouldn\u2019t have the strength to say no. And I knew him-he\u2019d promise to change, possibly even get counseling himself to deal with his issues. Things would be better for a time, then we\u2019d slide back into our old patterns of interaction. He hated change, and said all the time that he couldn\u2019t change if he wanted to. you don\u2019t just get rid of something like that with therapy. In the end I told him I was going to spend some time helping out my aging parents (giving me an excuse to bring all the stuff i use every day, instead just a few changes of clothes) and got my brother to bring me back to our parents\u2019 home. i still wasn\u2019t 100% sure I was leaving for good, but it was definitely on my mind. Once at home, and had the support of my family, I decided I was done and wasn\u2019t going back. I was actually coward enough to break up with him via Facebook messager! I regret that to this day. If somebody did that to me I\u2019d probably never forgive them. Well, life has a way of putting a twist into every story. Almost exactly a year after I left, Jerry died of lung cancer. He had been diagnosed 2 weeks prior, it was very advanced (he hated doctors & never went unless it couldn\u2019t be avoided) & he didn\u2019t have much chance of survival at that point. I\u2019d seen him a couple times since leaving, when i came back to get the rest of my stuff. You could feel the hostility coming off of him in waves. Again, totally understandable considering the circumstances. I just hate that it ended that way, I wish we\u2019d gotten some resolution & closure. Now it will never happen. I still grieve for him, and I\u2019m sure I always will. You just don\u2019t spend that many years with somebody without them becoming a part of you. ",

            "answer_text": "I have been travelling the journey of loss since 2015 and when I first read your question, my first thought was\u2026 my son. He died at 18 years old in a vehicle collision and never came home after that night. My heart was shattered and I remember the statements I made\u2026 \u201cNo!!! I don\u2019t want to be a Mom who had a child that died!\u201d Here I am, going into my 5th year without my only son and somehow I have survived. Does it still hurt? ABSOLUTELY! There isn\u2019t a day that goes by that I don\u2019t speak or acknowledge my son in some way\u2026 but it\u2019s different now. My entire belief system has been revamped and things I never even considered years ago, are now part of my daily thoughts. I believe we go on after this lifetime. I have had so many signs from my son and heard others share the same stories. I may have thought I could never live without my son in the beginning of this tragedy but now I know I don\u2019t have to. He\u2019s with me any time I need him. I can feel his presence when he\u2019s near; a shift in the energy. He is not gone. He has only moved on to the next phase of his journey, wherever that realm happens to reside and one day, I will go to where he is too. If you\u2019re interested in reading about all the signs I received during the first year after my son passed, I documented everything.
