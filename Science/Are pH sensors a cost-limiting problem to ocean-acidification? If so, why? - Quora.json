            "answer_text": "pH meters vary in price and functionality, for sure. But the expense of these meters isn't really the major limitation to studying ocean acidification, it's the way they work. The the very basic level, a pH meter functions like a battery. From How do pH meters work?: An acidic solution has far more positively charged hydrogen ions in it than an alkaline one, so it has greater potential to produce an electric current in a certain situation\u2014in other words, it's a bit like a battery that can produce a greater voltage. A pH meter takes advantage of this and works like a voltmeter: it measures the voltage (electrical potential) produced by the solution whose acidity we're interested in, compares it with the voltage of a known solution, and uses the difference in voltage (the \"potential difference\") between them to deduce the difference in pH. Very quickly we come across three major issues:(1) the meter effectiveness will degrade over time,(2) this degradation means the device must be recalibrated routinely (likely twice per day), and(3) the seas have a massive array of extreme variables (salinity, temperature, depths, etc.) that the equipment must work uniformly and reliably in. #1 and #2 are why most ocean acidification studies are done either near the shore or along a vessel transect because the equipment has to be maintained and calibrated so often. Currently there's just too much human interaction required to do long-term studies in remote areas. #3 means that we have to have more equipment than just the meter in order to obtain an accurate reading. (For instance, a pH meter effectiveness can vary based on external temperature and pressure [depth].) To be confident in your readings, you really need to have full CTD data (equipment to measure salinity [conductance], temperature, and depth, among other things), which adds to the expense of your pH meter rig. And that's why we get the problem posed by the X Prize Foundation. From their Competition Guidelines (the PDF on the linked page): Ocean acidification is well documented in only a few parts of the world\u2019s oceans relatively little is known about pH in the high latitudes, coastal areas, deep sea, and marginal seas. In order to better understand and adapt to the threat of ocean acidification, we must have better pH sensing systems to monitor and collect ocean pH data. The reason we have poor documentation in these areas is because most are difficult to get to and stay at long-term. So there is certainly a cost issue, but it is really more of a functionality issue.
