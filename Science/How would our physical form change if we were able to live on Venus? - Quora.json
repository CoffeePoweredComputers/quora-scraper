            "answer_text": "Living on Venus would present three main challenges. The first is the heat. Surface temperatures on Venus average around 870 degrees Fahrenheit (465 degrees Celsius). That\u2019s hot enough to melt lead. The second is the pressure. Atmospheric pressure on Venus is 90 times that as on Earth, and is the equivalent of being under .6 miles (1 km) of water. By comparison, the world record for deepest dive without equipment is only around 700 ft. The third is the composition of the atmosphere, which is 96% carbon dioxide and unbreathable. It would take some pretty radical changes to human physiology to even come close to surviving that. ",
