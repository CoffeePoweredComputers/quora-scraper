            "answer_text": "I don't think I need to worry about spoilers - the movie is 15 years old, and anyone who wants to see it probably already has. So, here's the overview - (1) yes, it had to be gory...it's a horror movie; (2) Dr. Weir was the antagonist the whole time, but he had his reasons. As to what happened in the movie, the Event Horizon was an experimental vessel designed to test out a novel faster-than-light (FTL) drive system. It essentially operated via a wormhole - one end opened in front of it, the other at its destination. What wasn't taken into account, however, is where the ship goes in between. And, it turns out, that happens to be a hell dimension, where people are driven mad and turned on one another. Weir\u2019s dead wife is presented to him by the now-sentient Event Horizon, and his entire goal is to be reunited with her, which provides fodder for the ship (and the remnants of its time in the other dimension) to slowly work on him until he's ready to send the ship back to hell, essentially erasing all evidence of its existence and of what happened to the crew.

            "answer_text": "My answer is different from others it seems. The ship had bad CO2 scrubbers and thus the crew started hallucinating, from time to time, bringing out their own fears and paranoias. Being in deep space all alone on a ship that some horrible accident/atrocity happened makes it even worse. Humans tent towards paranoia and superstitions at the best of times. The greatest threat is our own psychic and fear to face it. ",
