            "answer_text": "There are three factors involved: Stoichiometry. This falls out of the balanced equation for the reaction and an awareness of the limiting reagent. It gives you an idealized \u201ctheoretical yield\u201d for the reaction.Conversion. How far toward completion did the reaction proceed? This can be influenced by things like the temperature and initial concentration of the reactants. Also some reactions are equilibria which will not proceed past a certain point.Selectivity. What percentage of the starting materials are converted to product versus the percent going to side products?So your actual yield is going to be (theoretical yield) x (conversion) x (selectivity)",
