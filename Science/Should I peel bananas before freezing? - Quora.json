            "answer_text": "I peel banana before freezing it. I find the skins turn a very unappealing black colour in the freezer. I also notice the skins tend to become harder to remove and can leave some of that dark colour on the banana. I usually peel and mash the banana into a plastic container or into a freezer bag. I also try to get the banana frozen into premeasured size that works in the recipes I use. Most of my banana cake or banana bread recipes ask for two large bananas which is normally a cup and a half of banana. Smoothies usually call for one banana, which is somewhere around three quarters of a cup of banana. If I freeze bananas with three quarters of a cup in a small freezer bag they are easy for me to use in my recipes, whether it is for puddings, smoothies, or cakes. ps: with freezer bags instead of plastic tubs the banana can be flattened out before freezing and is easier to thaw or break into chunks when needed.

            "answer_text": "To be honest I am not sure about this one. I think you can freeze them without removing the peel. I know eating the banana, peel and all is very good for you, but personally I have never done that, although I have washed unpeeled bananas, chopped them up and made smoothies with them, skin and all, and thoroughly enjoyed the velvety chocolaty taste of it. I do know that commercial companies blanch bananas before freezing them. I also know that the unpeeled bananas that are frozen will have their skin blacken, (apparently this has no detrimental effect on the benefit of the frozen fruit), but I am not sure about how easy or difficult it would be to remove the skin from the frozen banana whilst still frozen, having not tried this myself. (yet). ",
