            "answer_text": "In my opinion Human are animals \u2026yes, biologically But what you are asking is wrong since consciousness is what both human and animals has; what make us different from them is our intelligent and moral. Now our intelligent is a progress of learning,analyze in formations , and most of all having ideas to came up with inventions that help us to survive in this harsh world; all of that throughout times and million years of evolution we became more and more intelligent that animals are falling far behind us. But intelligent just isn\u2019t enough for us to be human. Why? You see if there\u2019s a man that can wear clothes, speak English, can do math,and so intelligent just like a normal human but never get any educations or taught by a human, just live by instincts like animals and if you put a gun in his hand and taught him to shoot without telling him that killing is bad;eventually he will use that gun to slaughter other animals, people just for food,for joys and would you then still call that man a human? What make a human human is our moral; it come from sympathy, compassion and love. It what make us decide which is good and which is bad, what is right and what is wrong. We have our moral because we can feel pain and when we see other pain we can feel it and we know that we shouldn\u2019t hurt other and that form sympathy among our species that is the foundation for us to make rules. These rules are what keeping us from hurting each others, to show sympathy and to avoid whatever is bad, we taught our children to follow these rules and time through times rules became part of us so that now we all know how to contain the animal part inside us, control our emotions and became more and more humane,we became civilized.That\u2019s what make us human.

            "answer_text": "All animals are conscious to a certain degree. Humans are mutant brain apes that are crazy super conscious. We take self introspection and thinking to a ridiculous level, so much sometimes that we are incapable of even basic animal functions like mating or eating without brain overload. We have so much self doubt, it is a wonder we can do anything at all. Yet, we put down fellow humans that act quickly without much analysis as \u201canimals\u201d. What other species do naturally without thinking about we work very hard at and call \u201cmeditation\u201d to try and turn down our thinking process a little. Yet we are so enamored with our brains that we smoke and drink coffee to ramp up even more. We can get so wrapped up in our heads thinking about and planning for the far future that we totally miss out on what is happening right now all around us. We have to drink large quantities of alcohol and take other drugs just to relax our brains a little. We strive so hard for things that we think will make us happy that often never do and we often can\u2019t even tell if we are happy or not in the here and now. We are usually lost in the symbols and icons that represent things that we are isolated from the real things those symbols and icons stand for. We are so obsessed with conflicting emotions and motives about everything, it is a wonder that we can do anything logical at all. There is a very high variability in our actions from one human to another and even in the same human over time. This diversity in thinking and values creates an incredible amount of conflict between us and even within us. Our brains have so much more things stuffed in them to make us different. All these things make humans highly unpredictable and very dangerous, prone to violence and self destructive acts. ",

There are animals that do all sorts of incredible things and we are a species that does many amazing things. \u201cConsciousness\u201d - well, as others have pointed out \u201cconsciousness\u201d is hard to define but whatever it is, many other animals have it. In fact, the more we learn about other animals, the fewer ways we seem to be unique. We are not the only users of tools, not the only users of language, not the only users of math\u2026.etc. Nevertheless, there are some descriptions that are unique to humans. We are the only featherless biped. Mark Twain noted that we are \u201cthe only animal that blushes - or needs to\u201d. We are the only ape that dances. We use language more than any other animal (at least, as far as we know). We are the only animal that has writing. ",

            "answer_text": "Humans are animals. Is it just consciousness or is it something else that distinguishes humans from other animals? I\u2019m not exactly sure what consciousness is, but I\u2019m pretty sure that whatever it is, the people I know have it, and the animals I know don\u2019t have as much of it. One aspect of consciousness is an extensive language, a language that can be used to communicate with others and to remember things, and in the last 5000 years a language that can be written down to communicate with others. Certainly that distinguishes most humans from most other animals. Still, some particular apes such as Koko can also use language to communicate. Nonetheless an extensive language is a big part of it. Are there other aspects of consciousness that distinguish humans from other animals? There have been psychological studies to see if animals recognize themselves in a mirror. That is an aspect of consciousness, and apparently at least apes, elephants, dolphins, and magpies do, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if several other animals do. Still, self-recognition is only one aspect of consciousness. Various other animals have some characteristics of consciousness. All of them seem to suffer from pain. Many mammals suffer emotional distress. Perhaps that is associated with memory. The more ability to recall past events allows for better decisions in the future. Consciousness is not an easy thing to define, but however you define it, it is something that humans have a lot of and most other animals not so much. ",

Humans are animals themselves, and we tend to show a bias for our own species. Our own tongue/dialects, must the sound unintelligible save for, tones to other animals. Animals such as elephants show: high intellect, empathy, interspecies interaction/language below our hearing. For instance an elephant will have \"funerals\" for the dead, and visit the bones. Yet, they often will kill lion cubs, who grow up to kill their young. Plants to show intelligence, much like bees. Collectively they are smart, when they work together. Altruism is much more common, than you think. Among plants sibling roots share nutrients, but will pray upon non sibling roots. Plants like bees, communicate among each other, and animals. This is done via, chemical paths/scents called pheromones. How can we then, be the only creatures with a conscious? ",

Many other animals are conscious, e.g. dogs and cats, though ones run by instinct like insects are unlikely to be conscious in any sense like ours. However we are the only known animal with a *rational* consciousness: i.e. we think, and are capable of not only abstractions from concretes (e.g. \u201cdog\u201d, a concept covering a host of individual dogs), but abstractions from abstractions to an unlimited extent, all the way up to moral abstractions (justice, honesty) and even imaginary ones (gods, angels). So you could say that we are animals with a rational consciousness, but it is far from such a mere thing we can call it \u201cjust\u201d. It has made us what we are and given us the power to transform the world and send our machines to the stars. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do you suppose that animals are not conscious? Some animals having very small brains probably aren\u2019t conscious; sponges, jellyfish, clams, and insects probably fall into this category. But birds and mammals have the ability to plan their actions, taking circumstances into account. Animals ranging from ravens to chimpanzees can think far enough into the future to create simple tools. Animals have limited ability to communicate, not in sentences, but using very simple words. Lab rats are able to navigate through mazes using maps they keep in their heads (a couple of years ago the scientists who worked out some of the neurophysiology for that got a Nobel prize). A few animals respond to their image in the mirror the way we do. If a researcher puts a spot of paint on the animal\u2019s face, the animal looking in the mirror can see that and try to remove the spot. Elephants, apes, and dolphins can respond that way. Even animals that don\u2019t try to clean their faces, recognize that mirror images are not real animals. Some animals imitate others. Chimpanzees can learn how to extract termites from a nest. Some birds learn their songs from others. Animals can certainly feel pain. In recent years animal rights advocates have begun pointing out that even fish can experience pain and therefore conventional rod and reel fishing might not be humane. I cannot claim that any animal has the level of self awareness that we do but this is only a mater of degree. I do claim that we have a vastly greater ability to communicate with others about our conscious experiences than other animals but being unable to talk about something doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have it.

Of course, the very existence of consciousness is a subject of innumerable discussions and examinations (both serious and pop-philosophical): are we actors or mere observers in our heads; how do we know that other people experience the same kind of \u201cfeeling of consciousness\u201d as we do; after all, how do we know that the external world exists outside of our consciousness (or illusion thereof)? All this is, of course, far beyond the scope of this answer. But, back to the question, yes, we are animals with consciousness and culture- We should keep this in mind when we are tempted to elevate our value too high above that of our cousins. ",

Like all animals we have a consciousness as a group of conscious cells working together. The idea that any living thing is stumbling around unconsciously as a chemical automaton is nonsense.

To me humans massive processing power has enabled us to plan for the future (including with abstract thinking), picture it, imagine it, and then go and create it. I suppose we don\u2019t know how much of what we do some higher animals can do, were are not in their heads, but certainly our abilities in this respect are far greater than other animals. Here is something I\u2019ve written on this topic in the past, that the mental attributes that make us humans arise out of greater processing power (I know, kind of a \u201cduh\u201d to some extent) due to the advantage of collecting and holding more information about the environment as well as using it in our \u201cstruggle for life\u201d: David Kincade's answer to What is the source of human consciousness? If DNA is the basic element, does it posses this consciousness? Does human DNA really die? ",
