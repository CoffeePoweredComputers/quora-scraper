            "answer_text": "To find mass percent of an element in a compound, first add up the molar mass of the compound. Then as you do, sum the contributions to the total mass of each element separately. Then, take the mass of that element and divide by the total mass of the compound and multiply by 100. % of one element in a compound= (mass of that element in the compound/ total mass of the compound) x 100% ",
