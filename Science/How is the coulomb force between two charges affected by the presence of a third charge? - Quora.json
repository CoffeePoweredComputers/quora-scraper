            "answer_text": "The electrostatic force between two point charges will not be affected by the presence of a third charge (or any number of charges) because it is a two body interaction. However the total force on any one of the charges will be the vector sum of all the electrostatic forces acting on that charge (according to superposition principle). Think of a system of two charges A and B. Now a third charge C is added. Let us consider the total electrostatic force on A. The total force on it of the charges will be lesser or greater than before ( i.e. before C is added). But that does not mean that the force on A due to B has changed. It only means that a force (due to C) acts on A in addition to that due to B and the total force on A can be found out by the vector sum of the forces due to B and C on A (considering the angles between them). Hope this helps you. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t. And a good thing, too, or freshman physics would be a lot harder than it already is! Electric fields, and the resulting Coulomb forces, are purely additive. So while the net force on either of those two charges will be affected by the presence of the third charge, the result will just be the sum of the force between the original two charges, and the force between either of those charges and the third. The force between the first two is completely unchanged. ",
