            "answer_text": "No, if it\u2019s reached the stage where mould is visible, it\u2019s far too late. Uncontrolled mould can concentrate unfavourable chemicals and create some new. What inorganic nanotechnology can do is increase the shelf life by making the food more hostile to foreign bacteria, yeasts and fungus. Organic smart/self-folding proteins i.e. the \u2018real\u2019 nanobots are unlikely to work if there are no pumped blood veins to deliver them through the food. This is more likely what you would be eventually prescribed if you eat such contaminated food, but these are in pre-clinical trial days at the moment. ",
