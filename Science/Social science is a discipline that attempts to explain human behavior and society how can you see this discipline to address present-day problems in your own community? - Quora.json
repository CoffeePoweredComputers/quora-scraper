            "answer_text": "As we are sinking into an ever deeper socioeconomic crisis all over the world, social science would be extremely important to help us understand the root cause of our problems and find solutions for them. After all everything - including governance, economics - are simply external representations of the social connections in between people. The question is if the \u201csocial science\u201d we have today is efficient, professional enough to detect and solve the fundamental problems between Human beings? Looking at the results we need to say that it isn't. All the \u201cdiagnosis\u201d, \u201csolutions\u201d, all the ideologies, theories, methods make everything only worse. Why is this so?! We are all born with an inherently self-serving, self-justifying, egocentric and subjective nature. Instinctively - knowingly or unknowingly - we are all surviving at the expense of everything and everybody around us. Most of the time we are unaware of what desires, intentions drive us, so we are very offended by the above \u201cdiagnosis\u201d. But the bottom line is that whatever Humanity had invented, built, developed up to this point was designed by the above mentioned egotistic, individualistic, subjective program for the sole benefit of the individual Human ego. This is why - even when we start with seemingly positive, helpful, humanitarian intentions - sooner or later the project, ideology, system becomes corrupted, distorted and falls apart as each and every Human civilization for millennia, including our present one. Thus if we want a \u201csocial science\u201d that can truly help us first recognize and then treat the problem - our own nature - that ails Humanity, we need the appropriate, purposeful and practical science that is based on Nature's unbending, strict laws of integration - that keep the balance and homeostasis life depends on - instead of relying on our instinctively egotistically biased mind.

            "answer_text": "First I would say that social science is not only about interactions between people it also looks at groups, society and culture's interacting. It must be remembered that all relationships are dynamic and are constantly changing if incrementally. This leads me to consider your question. I think that the various methologys used in social science are just as valid in todays society as previously. For example social science can evaluate how society is changed by events. For example where as online shopping and electronic payments have existed for some time the current pandemic has seen a marked movement towards online shopping and using cards instead of cash. Home working is another area which has become normal. The growth in these areas of activity may decrease but for many they will become permanent. These are some areas that the various branches of social science will explore together with effects on society. These are just my views but I hope they will give you food for thought ",
