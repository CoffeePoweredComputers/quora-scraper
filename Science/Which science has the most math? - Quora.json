            "answer_text": "I would say physics uses the most math, and certainly the most advanced mathematics. A lot of the most advanced and abstract physics is mostly math, and it\u2019s essentially impossible to be a physicist without having a grasp of that math. (And no, \u2018mathematical sciences\u2019 is not a science. ) Biology and chemistry use a good deal of math, but it\u2019s not quite as abstract - I\u2019d say it\u2019s usually at an undergraduate level whereas physics uses the highest levels of mathematics. Computer science, of course, uses a lot of mathematics. But despite its name, computer science really isn\u2019t a science either. It\u2019s composed of algorithm design, engineering, and analysis of various types. Why do I say these fields are not \u201cscience\u201d? As I see it, a science uses various techniques (aka \u2018the scientific method\u2019) to investigate the physical world. Mathematics and computer science do not follow the practice of formulating hypotheses and seeing how well they fit real-world data. Mathematics is about the relationships between various abstract concepts. It\u2019s not about testing the theories vs real-world data. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe the answer would be Mathematical Sciences . Mathematical sciences is a group of areas of study that includes, in addition to mathematics, those academic disciplines that are primarily mathematical in nature but may not be universally considered sub fields of mathematics proper. Statistics, for example, is mathematical in its methods but grew out of scientific observations which merged with inverse probability and grew through applications in the social sciences, some areas of physics and bio-metrics to become its own separate, though closely allied field. Computer science, computational science, population genetics, operations research, cryptology, econometrics, theoretical physics, and actuarial science are other fields that may be considered part of mathematical sciences. Nuclear Engineering and Engineering Physics also have a considerable amount of math. ",
