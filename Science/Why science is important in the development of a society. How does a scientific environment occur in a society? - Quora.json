            "answer_text": "For the last 120 years science has been a foundation of our technical societies. In 1945 the wonder of science produced an atomic bomb and less than 20 years later, thanks to the higher consciousness of one Russian captain of a ship that was ordered to fire a nuclear weapon, and begin \u201cArmageddon\u201d, we are here today. He chose not to fire the weapon. The oceans are polluted with plastic bags and the cities are polluted from motor cars and industries. For over 60,000 years the indigenous Australians were guardian's of the land mass that we call Australia. Over the last 25,000 years they began to experience fourth density consciousness. They did not \u201cneed\u201d science to achieve a state of higher consciousness. Self-respect and unconditional love did it. We are all now facing the same choice that the Russian captain faced 57 years ago. Will we poison our children from 5G microwave radiation, COVID-19 vaccinations and a morally distorted and lying media. These three ingredients will work together to create a very deadly virus that will depopulate the planet by around 7 Billion people within the next few years, if we choose to believe in \u201ctheir\u201d science. There have been 2000 studies done on the detrimental effects of microwave radiation on the water molecules in our bodies. By introducing heavy substances like Mercury, Nickle, Aluminium and other stuff through vaccination's, our systems become more susceptible to 5G technology when it is ramped up a few notch's. Science is OK if people remain human and only use it for the good of the whole. There is absolutely no sane reason to weaponize it against our fellow human beings. The only reason people do what they do with science is for personal greed, selfishness and an innate need to control others. These are all symptom's of lower consciousness development that is just past the animal stage of development. ",

            "answer_text": "Expanding on Constantin Lupu, science is the professional way of thinking rationally, using data and logic to understand the world. Hence, science is often necessary to make rational decisions, even though humans do also need empathy and love (see below). Do you prefer a leader who asks you to pray for rain (like governor Rick Perry in Texas) or scientists and engineers who find a scientific solution, such as desalinating ocean water or irrigation? Compassion is important because you have to think of the consequences of science too, which is often too successful. Developing better ways to produce food and medicine has led to human overpopulation and the destruction of nature, so compassion for the rest of the biosphere is important in order to keep our planet intact. Religious people may be compassionate but without science and reason religion is deadly. For exmple, Pope Francis suggested that every woman should have 3 children, \u201cbut not breed like rabbits\u201d which, objectively, is a contradiction and recipe for global disaster. ",
