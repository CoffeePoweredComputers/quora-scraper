            "answer_text": "Q: Why can we not rely on Covid antibody tests? A: Actually you can, now. But . . . You have to understand their limitations. PCR testing (ie, nose swab) is more accurate overall, and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 much better for detecting whether you have COVID-19 right now.You have to get a reliable test. Basically this means an antibody test NOT made in China![1] The tests made by Abbott Labs (USA) and Roche (Switizerland) are highly accurate and well validated.You have to get the test performed by experienced operators. There are many ways to mess up these tests. Currently, you can get an antibody test either for FREE or for $10 from Lab Corp. [ LabCorp Covid-19 Antibody Patient Portal ]. You will have to physically go a LabCorp site to have a small amount of blood drawn. (You can also pay Quest Labs $119 for a antibody test . . . but I assume you\u2019d prefer \u201cFREE\u201d to \u201c$119\u201d. FWIW, neither I nor any relative or friend has any connection to LabCorp that I am aware of!) So why isn\u2019t everyone doing this? As mentioned above antibody testing is NOT ideal for diagnosing a new infection with COVID-19.Knowing that you had Covid-19 in the past, or have Covid-19 but are symptomless or are recovering has limited value. Not no value. But limited value.Even if an antibody test shows that you have had Covid-19 in the past, there is not yet any guarantee that a PAST infection equals PRESENT immunity. Scientists suspect you will be able, eventually, to get Covid-19 AGAIN, even if you had it in the past. And right now, they don\u2019t have any good ideas about how long \u201c eventually\u201d is.So with all those limitations, what is the value of antibody testing? Right now, the biggest benefit is for epidemiological studies trying to determine how many people, in a population or area, have already had Covid-19, even if they never had symptoms. Current testing indicates that in various regions of the US that the actual infection rate ranges from 2x to 10x the confirmed or reported rate.Of course, that is of no particular value to YOU..But antibody tests can give you a moderately reliable indication of how great your current risk is, since you are MUCH less likely to get a bad infection in the near future, if you have ALREADY almost certainly had an Covid-19 infection in the recent past.And that can matter. We\u2019re going to get tested, because my 60+ year old wife is going back to school next week as an elementary school teacher. And in my area, kids from 8 - 20 account for the MAJORITY of new infections. Kids won\u2019t wear masks reliably. So we want to know how great the risk it \u2014 probably \u2014 to her. If we\u2019ve already had Covid-19, and we think we all had it in March, then her risk is pretty low, and she can prudently be a little lax in personal protection. But if we probably have not had it, then her risk is pretty high . . . and she will need to be VERY conscientious with masks and sanitizer and no-face-touchee-please..Antibody tests could also be useful for large-ish companies and agencies, to track infection rates. They are, or at least can be, fast, cheap and easy, which means companies could set up rapid weekly testing of all employees. This would allow them to ID and quarantine symptomless infected employees, not perfectly, but much better than without the test. And there other uses. Unfortunately, they are not yet being used widely, or to their best utility. And like Covid-19 itself, you can, with considerable justification, \u201cblame it on the Chinese.\u201d (I realize that some people will consider this unfair. So I\u2019m posting a small section of the FDA banned list below, with indication of whether the company is Chinese or not. ) You need to understand that, early on, when nobody understood anything about antibody tests OR Covid-19, everybody INCLUDING the \u201cexperts\u201d were casting about for a great solution. And, true to form, Chinese companies \u2014 many with US or UK operating units \u2014 rushed to marked with garbage kits. I know. I spent $400 buying a useless set of tests, back in April, from this company \u2014 which IS Chinese, in spite of the name \u2014 now on the FDA banned list: RayBiotech Life, Inc. Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) IgM and IgG Dual Combined Antibody Detection Kit for Serum Removed - Should Not Be Distributed[2] I should have known better. In fact, I did know better, but I let my anxiety get the better of my prudence. Of course, time will tell, and it has told. The Chinese tests are junk, and have \u2018muddied the waters\u2019 so nobody knows what to trust. It didn\u2019t help that, early on after the release of the much better Abbott and Roche tests, that inexperienced lab workers messed up a bunch of them. But the labs are experienced now, and the tests are well validated.  The moment in the drafty church at smokerise  The long list is the A-H portion of the FDA\u2019s list[3] of antibody test makers whose product has been listed as \u201cRemoved - Should Not Be Distributed*\u201d. The point is that almost all of these companies are Chinese, or US operating units of Chinese companies. I quit after doing the \u201cH\u2019s\u201d.

If test is taken in window period, it will not give accurate result. So to rely on test result, it should be done after completion of window period. ",
