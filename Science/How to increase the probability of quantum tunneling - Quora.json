            "answer_text": "There are three main options; either increase input energy, decrease the thickness of the barrier, or lower the barrier energy. Increasing the input energy increases the transmission, but once the incoming energy exceeds the height of the barrier it is no longer tunneling. Lower thickness will result in greater tunneling transmission as shown below.  This is a plot of tunneling through a a rectangular potential barrier with height [math]V_b = V_{\\text{barrier}}[/math]. Curves for three different barrier thickness are shown, which shows that lower thickness is better for tunneling. The transmission intensity coeffiicent for tunneling is given by the following expression [math]T =\\left(1+\\frac{V_b^2 \\sinh ^2\\left(\\frac{a \\sqrt{2m (V_b-E)}}{\\hbar }\\right)}{4 E (V_b-E)}\\right)^{-1} \\;\\;\\;\\; E<V_b \\; \\;\\;\\;\\text{(tunneling)}[/math] Where m is the mass of the tunneling particle and [math]a[/math] is the thickness of the barrier. Lower mass particles will do better, all else being equal. ",
