            "answer_text": "\u201cWhen an electron is excited from external energy like heat, it gains that energy and transit to higher state. Similarly, when transiting from higher to lower orbital, electrons emit energy E=h\u03bc.\u201d \u201c The emitted energy isn\u2019t continous but comes discretely as energy packets or Quanta each of which is multiple of h/2\u03c0. The radiated beam is nothing but shower of photons or energy packets or Quanta\u201d This is how Quantum Mechanics sees and accounts for the movement of electrons. Now look at the LED or incandescent bulb. How is the light coming from the device? There is a steady quantum transition of electrons due to an applied energy (in turn, from the supply mains) and thus a steady flow of electrons emitting light or a photon shower. I hope you got the answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi\u2026 Thanks for asking this\u2026 According to the structure of atom, there are two types of charges positive and negative. A force of attraction exist between these positive and negative charges. A certain amount of energy is required to overcome the force and move the charges through a specific distance. Now all opposite charges posses a certain amount of potential energy because of the separation between them. This difference called as potential difference. In electrical terminology it's known as voltage, denoted as V or v. The free electrons available in all semiconductive and conductive materials. These free electrons move at random in all direction within the structure of materials in the absence of external pressure or that voltage discussed in the first section. If a certain amount of voltage is applied across the material, all the electrons move in one direction depending on the polarity of the applied voltage. This is how electron flow. And this movement of electrons from one end of the material to the other end constitutes an electric current, denoted by either I or i. Remember that conventional direction of current flow is opposite to the flow of -ve charges, I.e. The electrons. Regards, SaV ",
