            "answer_text": "It really isn\u2019t \u201cturned into carbon dioxide\u201d. When substances (such as wood, petroleum, cells in living organisms, etc.) containing carbon are subjected to heat the bonded oxygen atoms (O2) required for oxygenation are separated and a heated carbon atom slips in between them. Voila, carbon dioxide. Simple as pie! The notion carbon dioxide is converted into oxygen by plants is KOOKY, to say the least, but I\u2019ll not get into this insanity, here as there are a plethora of reason why this does not and cannot occur. All carbon dioxide goes UP to the edge of the stratosphere where it is \u201cstored\u201d until it is attracted by heated hydrogen atoms (see Jianqi Qin, Lara Waldrop. Non-thermal hydrogen atoms in the terrestrial upper thermosphere. Nature Communications, 2016; 7: 13655 DOI: 10.1038/ncomms1365). The whole notion that the atmosphere is a \u201cmixture of gases\u201d is bullshit. It is a structure consisting of paired nitrogen atoms (\u201cinert\u201d means not easily moved) which form a gridwork (the Nitrogen Grid, \u00a9 2015, DL Turner) in which all other atmospheric atoms/molecules move up, down and horizontally and are regulated by atomic weight. Hydrogen atoms, heated by the sun (clouds) attract cold carbon dioxide and form water - RAIN. Simple as pie. ",

            "answer_text": "The process of respiration. As long as you know about digestion and transportation in human beings, you'll know how glucose gets to human body parts. If you do, skip to the third paragraph, otherwise read on. First, we eat food, which is categorised into minerals, vitamins, Carbohydrates, proteins, etc. Each of these has a different digestive process, but ultimately is absorbed in the small intestines. Carbohydrates is absorbed in the form of glucose (C6 H12 O6). This is then transported by oxygenated blood throughout the body using a network of blood vessels, arteries and capillaries (not veins, they carry stuff towards the heart and not away from it). Next, blood carrying oxygen gets to the body needing energy, where the glucose is burnt in the presence of oxygen (dissolved) to provide energy in the form of heat, decomposing glucose into water and carbon dioxide.C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 ---Combustion---> 6CO2 + 6H2O + Heat The water is absorbed by our body and the carbon dioxide is released into the air.
