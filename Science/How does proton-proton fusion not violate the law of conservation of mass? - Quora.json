RE: \u201cHow does proton-proton fusion not violate the law of conservation of mass?\u201d Even in the core of the Sun, a proton will persist for over a billion years before it happens to be close enough to another proton as one of them reverse decays to a neutron and a positron, allowing the formation of a deuterium nucleus. This is the only source of neutrons in the core of the Sun Even inside nuclei, I think that two protons always have a neutron between them. proton-proton fusion does not yield He2. ",
