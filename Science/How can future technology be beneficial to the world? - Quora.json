            "answer_text": "Sometimes we see the world in a very monochrome, binary way,\u201d says Williams, a historian, scientific adviser and futurologist. \u201cFor instance, technology is seen as good. But advanced, sentient machines that can feel, think and mimic human behaviour and thus one day rise up and take control of society is bad. How on earth do we reach such conclusions? Because we fear change. We\u2019re naturally suspicious of advances, especially in science. We like our rules, regulations and order. We don\u2019t relish disruption. Yet science has always disrupted society and society has always adapted. And let\u2019s not forget, it has always advanced, too. Certainly, we\u2019re in the midst of one of the most exciting periods of scientific change that the human race has ever experienced, yet it\u2019s not something we should fear.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "In future technology is going to be more and more advanced which is present now. The more steps taken in the technologies like Artificial intelligence and Robotics may lead the world infinite opportunities to reduce the human work load and use technology as a helper for humans. But, by the technology gets more advanced,and the substitution of robots in the place of humans may lead the unemployment and poverty among the countries . That means , while the technology got improved , it affects humans in positive and negative ways.all the rich persons became more and more rich and others will become zero. ",

            "answer_text": "Human Being. Thats the technology thats been evolving and is most beneficial to the world (Of course, from human being\u2019s perspective). It will continue to be so. With the efforts being put in understand the nature and influence of energy sphere on a human body, mind and health, I hope it will lead us to healthy future for us, filled with in-living with nature. Soul dancing to the tunes of branches of the trees, rivers flowing with crystalline water, animals allowed their freedom in deep forests. Lesser explosives, fuller smiles. We should realise ourselves as human beings first, rather than citizen of a country, a religion, a caste, colour, etc. We are the one of the best technology. We still don't understand ourselves completely. Ask a top scientist how a brain works, why does our behaviour change with exposure to certain kinds of energy fields - no one has a confident answer. So, the answer is Human Being. ",
