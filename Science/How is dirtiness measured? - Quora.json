            "answer_text": "Colloidal graphite dispersions (Aquadag or Oildag trade names) are available to put a standard soil onto clean, white cloth. These grey stained cloths are then used to measure the effectiveness of washing detergents and washing cycles. As far as I know, the stained cloths are only used to compare effectiveness; there was no actual density measurement done, although that is not ruled out. You could use a reflectance meter to measure the whiteness of the cloth, and calibrate your washing cycle accordingly. ",
