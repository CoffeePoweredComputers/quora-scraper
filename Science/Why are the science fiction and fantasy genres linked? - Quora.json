            "answer_text": "The argument about what the key difference is between Science Fiction (genre) and Fantasy (genre) is legendary. However, there is more agreement on how they are similar. SF & F, along with Alternate Histories (Hypothetical Historical Scenarios), are usually grouped into the category of \"speculative fiction\" and it is common for people to be fans of all three. All fiction plays the \"What if?\" game but speculative fiction plays it with the world. Instead of simply proposing fictional characters and personal situations in our real world, speculative fiction ponders a world that is different from ours in some significant way, and it is often said that because of this, the setting is a major character in the story. This means that a good portion of what is appealing in the story is experiencing the novel setting and the story is often how the characters respond to the challenges of that setting. Very broadly, in SF the alternate world is expected to mostly match our understanding of science and reality, but be different because it's in the future, with new technology, or off on other planets, or elements such as these. In fantasy the alternate world is fantastic, not a world that ever was, could be, or could have been, and in alternate history it's our world but with a significant difference in its past that is fundamental to the story. One reason there is so much debate about where the lines fall is much SF contains elements broadly viewed as fantastic (such as Warp Drives) and the line is blurred. So the genres are linked because they all explore new and alternate worlds, and to a lesser degree revel in setting. There are other genres that revel in setting (such as historicals and exotic-location stories) but they are not usually grouped with speculative fiction because they don't posit something important about the world which doesn't (yet) exist. The skill of writing grand speculative fiction has a name: world building -- and there is generally some world building in all such stories. ",

            "answer_text": "The most sensible way to look at the relationship between science fiction and fantasy is to see them as part of a larger genre which is often called speculative fiction. Speculative fiction differs from fiction grounded in the world which we know in positing fundamental changes in the way in which the world works. Good speculative fiction always follows the ideas set out in Tolkien\u2019s essay \u201cOn Fairly Stories\u201d. It is grounded in what Tolkien calls secondary belief. The world of a work of speculative fiction is different from the world we know, but it is plausible given the series of assumptions that the writer makes, which must be sufficiently coherent to hang together plausible. The distinction between fantasy and science fiction lies in the nature of the assumptions. To take two extreme examples: Charles Sheffield\u2019s The Web Between The Worlds, about the building of the first space elevator, is completely grounded in real-world technology. (A space elevator has three components; a space station in geosynchronous orbit, a ground station directly beneath the space station, and a cable with something on it to hold materials or passengers connecting the two. Once created, the cost to move materials from earth into space becomes much lower.) It would be immensely expensive, but it could be built today or in the very near future. That is one pole\u2014science fiction. The other pole could be Tolien\u2019s Lord Of The Rings, with the elaborately imagined and details alternate world, with its own history, languages, and forms of power in magic. Somewhere in the middle you would find Randall Garrett\u2019s Lord Darcy series, which combines a science fictional alternate history premise\u2014Richard I did not die of a crossbow wound but had a long and successful reign and established a Plantagenet dynasty still in control in the 20th century, Martin Luther as Pope and hence no reformation\u2014and what might be called a fantasy premise\u2014no development of scientific rationalism but instead the development of magic as a force than can be manipulated by individuals with a talent, and with its own precise laws. If we move towards the science fiction pole, which is characterized by extrapolation from the present to the future, we find the use of tropes that are contrary to what we know in physical science\u2014notably FTL travel, time travel, and things like the Star Trek transporter (which, from the viewpoint both of energy-matter conversion and quantum mechanics is pure fantasy). As we move towards the fantasy pole, the connections to the world in which we live become more and more tenuous. Using a framework like this, it is easy to see the continuity between the two poles. I would add one other thing that is common across the entire spectrum of speculative fiction. A very large percentage of works in the genre use some form of the hero\u2019s journey archetype, particularly on the fantasy side, or the mystery story archetype, which is closely allied with the hero\u2019s journey, on the science fiction side. Asimov\u2019s Second Foundation is a mystery novel\u2014where is the Second Foundation? Vance\u2019s Cadwall Chronicles are, among other things, mystery novels, as are the Demon Princes novels. ",
