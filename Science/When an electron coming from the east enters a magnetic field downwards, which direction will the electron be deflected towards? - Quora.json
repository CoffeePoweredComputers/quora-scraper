But in case of electrons, the direction of force will be opposite to that in case of a positively charged particle. Therefore, the answer which you need is north. EDIT : Thanks for pointing out my mistake. I have made the necessary corrections. ",

Sit on your left hand. For an electron, which has a negative charge, fold your thumb across your hand like so:  (knock-off Rolex watch not required), and point it west. Rotate your hand (still with thumb pointing west) till the fingers (representing the field lines) point down. Observe which way the palm is facing: that\u2019s the force. ",
