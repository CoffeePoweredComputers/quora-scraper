A new electron microscope unveiled at the UK's national SuperST\u200bEM facility images objects at an unprecedented resolution, right down to the individual atoms. That's because electron microscopes use a beam of electrons rather than photons, as you'd find in a regular light microscope. This Microscope Can See Down to Individual Atoms  ",
