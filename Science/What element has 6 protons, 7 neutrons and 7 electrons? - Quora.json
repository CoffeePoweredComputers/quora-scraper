            "answer_text": "Any atom with six protons, regardless of how much other stuff it has, is a carbon atom. Having 7 neutrons, this would be an atom of Carbon 13 (C-13), a stable isotope of carbon making up 1.1% of natural carbon in the atmosphere and near the Earth's surface. As for the electrons, Carbon has six, but atoms may temporarily pick up or lose electrons in the hurly burly of chemical reactions, solar radiation and so forth. This is a negative ion of C13, which will soon pass on its extra election to an atom which needs it (a positive ion). ",
