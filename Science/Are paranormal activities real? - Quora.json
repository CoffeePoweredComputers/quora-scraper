            "answer_text": "I'm seeing a lot of answers from people who believe it because they've witnessed it but I'm afraid that you are not as credible as you think you are because for all we know and all you know your brain wasn\u2019t quite working correctly at that time. I hear you chant \u2018but I was there!\u2019 and \u2018I know what I saw\u2019\u2026 but I'm telling you that so few are the experiences of your brain getting things wrong if you're otherwise healthy that you aren't capable of knowing when it has happened: you really shouldn't trust your perception quite so much. I hallucinate daily due to a neurological condition. I say this without exaggeration: I've been attacked by a dragon. I am not even close to joking, it was terrifying and I had these nice new white pants on and I threw myself into mud to dodge it. However I had already learned not to trust my senses as my condition manifested several years before so I got up after my friend laughed at me and I joined in because for once I actually reacted instead of shrugging it off. I have a fairly positive mentality about it all. Take it from someone who sees and hears and touches things that are not real on a daily basis: your brain isn't perfect. The most obvious answer is that you aren't aware of how your brain can make mistakes and usually with bouts like this the reason you think it is real is because the brain is not able to self-analyse or self-correct during these times. This is especially true for people like me as the part of the brain dealing with recognising damage is itself damaged. I have a weird abnormality with my schizophrenia (as I'm not just schizophrenic apparently - it all gets complicated) because unlike most I am typically able to tell that what is happening around me isn't real\u2026 but then again it comes from nowhere and besides dinosaurs don't exist and then it vanishes a moment later no harm done\u2026 it is logically inconsistent and if a dinosaur showed up it would cause years of panic and concern. In fact it would completely change the world forever\u2026 but my condition comes and goes and so do the symptoms. Nobody I've ever met believes that a dinosaur once came walking down the street and of course it didn't and that\u2019s why I tell every story in an amused style because even though I could smell it that thing wasn't there. I could feel the flames from the dragon but then again I've been on fire before so it makes sense that my brain was reliving that memory. In short never underestimate how easily the ridiculously complicated processes of the human brain can mess with your perception of reality and at least attempt to be incredulous even if every fibre of your being is screaming at you saying otherwise. I typically use the same mental process when I'm watching a movie and something looks so real\u2026 I'm like \u2018'how did they do that?\u2019\u2026 I ask my brain \u2018Where did you get the smell of a dinosaur from? Have you ever been to a zoo with a big lizard or heard something in a film about what it smells like?\u2019. I don't always get a satisfactory answer but then again I would rather there weren't dragons and dinosaurs roaming around my city so it's easier to dismiss it. I also would really rather not be a ghost when I die as that seems horrific. I also would really rather not have someone read my mind so hey I'm biased against these phenomena even though from a developmental and human potential point of view it would make the world a lot more interesting if telepathy did exist as then we could study it. Until then Quora will have to transmit my thoughts for me. =) ",

            "answer_text": "They are true It is practically experienced. I know that the ghost, if you go in a house ghostly haunted, if you chant Hare Krsna mantra, they\u2019ll go away. They cannot tolerate. In my life there was several incidences like that. In my household life, I was doing business in Lucknow. So there was one house, very big house, worth thousands of rupees\u2019 rent, but it was ghostly haunted. So nobody would take that house. I took it at two hundred rupees, (laughter) and very big house. And I was\u2026 All the servants, they complained, \u201cSir, there is ghost.\u201d So I was chanting. He was living in several spots, especially on the gate side. So I could understand, but I would chant Hare Krsna, and I was saved. Everyone was saved. There was\u2026 And, say, in 1969 I was guest in the house of John Lennon in London. So there was a ghost in\u2026 It was a big plot. There was a guest house. So they complained, \u201cSir, here is ghost.\u201d So I advised them to chant Hare Krsna, and the ghost went away. Yes. This is fact. When there is Hare Krsna chanting, these ghostly, demonic living entities, they\u2019ll not be able to stay there. They\u2019ll go away. Those who are very sinful and attached to their family, house, village or country do not receive a gross body made of material elements but remain in a subtle body, composed of mind, ego and intelligence. Those who live in such subtle bodies are called ghosts. This ghostly position is very painful because a ghost has intelligence, mind and ego and wants to enjoy material life, but because he doesn\u2019t have a gross material body, he can only create disturbances for want of material satisfaction. It is the duty of family members, especially the son, to offer oblations to the demigod Aryama or to Lord Visnu. From time immemorial in India the son of a dead man goes to Gaya and, at a Visnu temple there, offers oblations for the benefit of his ghostly father. It is not that everyone\u2019s father becomes a ghost, but the oblations of pinda are offered to the lotus feet of Lord Visnu so that if a family member happens to become a ghost, he will be favored with a gross body. However, if one is habituated to taking the prasada of Lord Visnu, there is no chance of his becoming a ghost or anything lower than a human being. In Vedic civilization there is a performance called sraddha by which food is offered with faith and devotion. If one offers oblations with faith and devotion\u2013either to the lotus feet of Lord Visnu or to His representative in Pitrloka, Aryama\u2013one\u2019s forefathers will attain material bodies to enjoy whatever material enjoyment is due them. In other words, they do not have to become ghosts. [SB 4.18.18] The word eka-pada, \u201cone-legged,\u201d refers to ghosts, for it is said that ghosts walk on one leg. [SB 4.29.2] Because of his desire to enjoy the material world, the living entity is dressed with the material gross and subtle bodies. Thus he is given a chance to enjoy the senses. The senses are therefore the instruments for enjoying the material world; consequently the senses have been described as friends. Sometimes, because of too much sinful activity, the living entity does not get a material gross body, but hovers on the subtle platform. This is called ghostly life. Because of his not possessing a gross body, he creates a great deal of trouble in his subtle body. Thus the presence of a ghost is horrible for those who are living in the gross body. [SB 4.29.6] Sometimes the living entity is forced to give up his body and enter another one according to the judgment of Yamaraja. It is difficult, however, for the conditioned soul to enter another body unless the present dead body is annihilated through cremation or some other means. The living being has attachment for the present body and does not want to enter another, and thus in the interim he remains a ghost. If a living being who has already left his body has been pious, Yamaraja, just to give him relief, will give him another body. Since the living being in the body of the King had some attachment to his body, he was hovering as a ghost, and therefore Yamaraja, as a special consideration, approached the lamenting relatives to instruct them personally. Yamaraja approached them as a child because a child is not restricted but is granted admittance anywhere, even to the palace of a king. Besides this, the child was speaking philosophy. People are very much interested in hearing philosophy when it is spoken by a child. [SB 7.2.36] After giving up the body, one is transferred to another body, but sometimes, if one is too sinful, he is checked from transmigrating to another body, and thus he becomes a ghost. To save a diseased person from ghostly life, the funeral ceremony, or sraddha ceremony, as prescribed in authorized sastra, must be performed. Ravana was killed by Lord Ramacandra and was destined for hellish life, but by Lord Ramacandra\u2019s advice, Vibhisana, Ravana\u2019s brother, performed all the duties prescribed in relation to the dead. Thus Lord Ramacandra was kind to Ravana even after Ravana\u2019s death. [SB 9.10.29] We have heard of people\u2019s being haunted by ghosts. Having no gross material body, a ghost seeks shelter of a gross body to stay in and haunt. The Sakatasura was a ghost who had taken shelter of the handcart and was looking for the opportunity to do mischief to Krsna. When Krsna kicked the cart with His small and very delicate legs, the ghost was immediately pushed down to the earth and his shelter dismantled, as already described. This was possible for Krsna because He has full potency. [SB 10.7.9] If a man becomes disappointed and he cuts his own throat or hangs himself, some way or other, eats some poison, to finish, does it mean that he is finished? Na hanyate hanyamane sarire. He is rascal. He does not know. By finishing this body he is finished\u2013no, that is not possible. The result is, because he violated the rules of nature, he becomes a ghost. That is his life. One who commits suicide, he becomes a ghost. Ghost means he does not get this material body. He remains in the subtle body, mind, intelligence. Therefore ghost can go because he is in the mind. Mind speed is very strong. If you have got this material body, you cannot go immediately hundred miles off. But if you are in the mental body, you can go immediately, thousand miles immediately, within a second. So the ghost, they can play something wonderful because\u2026 But they are not happy because they have no gross body. They want to enjoy. He\u2019s materialist. He has committed suicide for some material want. So he is want of material\u2026, fulfilling material desire. He could not fulfill in this body; therefore commits suicide, but the desire is there. The desire is there, and he cannot fulfill it. He becomes perplexed. Therefore the ghost create disturbance sometimes. You mention ghosts. So far I have experience, the best way to remove them is to chant Hare Krishna very loudly and have jubilant kirtana until they leave. In England, on Mr. John Lennon\u2019s house where I was staying in 1969, there was one ghost. But as soon as the devotees began chanting very loudly, he went away immediately.

            "answer_text": "From my perspective, paranormal events are something that occur outside of a strict definition utilizing scientific methods. Since science is NOT the determining factor, those whose only faith is in science have no paradigm for anything outside of their own logic boxes. However, for the rest of us, we must first dig a little deeper into identifying what is taking place. Paranormal events are things that occur in the invisible realm. Our eyes only see things that absorb light in a very limited range of frequencies from red through violet. But, all frequencies from the ELF radio waves through gamma rays would present different colors if we were able to see them. I merely use this as an example to show the limitations we have as human beings to only rely on what we can see with our eyes or measure with an instrument. I am not saying that dark matter and dark energy are part of the paranormal; however, they do represent something that we know is there yet so far are invisible to our measurement or seeing. The next question to look at is; If there is an invisible realm, how can we \"see\" it and interact with it? Seeing something has a broader definition of perception, comprehension, understanding, etc. We cannot understand the invisible realm if we insist on seeing it only with our eyes. There are at least five other ways including touching, hearing, tasting, smelling and discerning. However, all of these things require first and foremost a change of a mindset that says the invisible does not exist. Without that, everyone will see exactly what they expect to see i.e. NOTHING. So then, if there is this invisible realm, is our interaction merely at an impersonal level much as I would respond to an empty box on the floor, or is it with sentient beings? The obvious answer and, often the one hardest for pure science types to absorb, is that we are not alone and that life is not our mere fleshly existence on the earth for however many years we live. But, the answer to this question opens up a universe of additional questions which cannot be answered in this short, Quora, format. But, let's try to look at a few. If there is an invisible realm with beings with which we are able to interact at a personal level, does this not also demand a hierarchy? The obvious answer is, YES. The very fact that there are personalities requires that there be a governing authority of laws and rules. No interaction of personalities can exist with a laissez-faire, Kumbaya, let's all float around and get along relationship where our concept of time is insignificant. And here is where we can really get muddied and muddled. So, let's again look at a couple questions. If there is this invisible universe surrounding us and the beings occupying it are able to easily see us, but we cannot see them, do they not have the advantage over us and would be able to influence us, or even aid us, without our own perception of these activities? Again, the answer is yes. So then, there is a hierarchy, there is interaction with us, and we are able to see it/them and have our own response as well. This last aspect requires at least three things from us to not be destroyed by our own choices. One, we must train our senses with a like-minded small group to help each other, confirm/refute what we are seeing, and love each other through the process. Two, we must align ourselves with the ruling hierarchy. The only answer to this question is the God of the Bible. I challenge you to read Francis A Schaeffer's book, \"He Is There Any Is Not Silent\" for a much more in-depth answer. Amazon.com: He Is There and He Is Not Silent (9780842314138): Francis Schaeffer, Charles Colson: Books Three, we must stay humble and be teachable recognizing that you will never stop learning and growing in your understanding of this amazing kingdom.

            "answer_text": "For many years, the Skeptic and conjurer James Randi has run his \"Million Dollar Challenge\".   The challenge being that if a person could demonstrate \"paranormal\" powers under controlled conditions, he could win the prize. No one ever has. All manner of people have tried.  They fall under two categories, frauds and the deluded.   Randi has unmasked a long list of frauds, most famously Uri Geller and Peter Popoff.  He has also proven that many sincere persons who thought they had genuine \"powers\" did not.  They were deluded.  Even proving to them that the powers did not work did not dissuade them. In addition to Randi, there are a wide variety of other skeptics and critics of such things.   There is a scientific organization which used to be called CSICOP or \"The Committee For The Scientific Investigation Of Claims Of The Paranormal\"... Which has since changed it's name to the shorter \"Center For Inquiry\": Home | Center for Inquiry  Which investigates such claims as well and has done so for a very long time.  You can find copies of the organization's magazine, The Skeptical Inquirer, at any bookstore or library, and an archive of many of their articles online. I might also mention the progenitor of this sort of research, Harry Houdini, the famous stage magician and escape artist.  He became involved with debunking the popular practice of \"spiritual mediums\" at that time since he realized they were using the techniques of standard \"magic\" to perform their tricks. Finally, you should be aware that during the 70s and 80s, when the New Age phenomena was in full swing, there was hardly a university that did not open a Parapsychology department (or at least a \"chair\") to research paranormal phenomena. These are all gone today....So far as I know, every single one.  Nothing was ever found except as the result of bad methodology, poor controls, or outright fraud. Finally... Again at this time.... The US government and the Soviet union both invested millions of dollars researching the possibility of \"psychic\" espionage.  Remote viewing, etc.   How handy to have your psychic spies sit in an easy chair and ferret out your enemy's secrets!    Alas, after millions spent, both nations abandoned these efforts. For a fun take on the whole affair, watch the George Clooney movie, \"The Men That Stare At Goats\". ",

I love it when people have a long list of things that don\u2019t exist and only silly and stupid people believe them. The list assumes that if you believe one thing on the list, you believe it all. That\u2019s just pure ignorance. They\u2019re so sure none of these things exist but I would bet that a tiny fraction of them has any knowledge at all about any of those subjects. If you want to be taken seriously, you always deny those things exist, with a laugh, as if you couldn\u2019t possibly be that stupid. Whatev\u2026I\u2019m so past that point. I\u2019m not a stupid woman and I have enough confidence in my ability to think critically. Things happen that can\u2019t be explained yet. Denying those things doesn\u2019t make them go away and all it does is prevent subjects that could really benefit from some serious study from becoming a reality which is not a product of peoples\u2019 imaginations or lies. And in the end, who cares if someone believes in ghosts or aliens? Who does it hurt? It\u2019s quite different than believing in a god, because religious beliefs get drug into politics and pushed on everyone. ",

            "answer_text": "I've had a series of unexplained things happen, it all sure sounded real and it felt real. Some of the sounds it appears I was the only one that heard these strange noises going on every night and often throughout the day for beginning couple of weeks. In fact, just before these noises started my dog began to act really strange, appearing terrified of something. Constantly shaking and panting, he wasn't a dog that had ever dug through carpet, but would for a while begin shredding my carpet in my apartment. These were new behaviors for him. Right when the sounds began which were so loud I couldn't get back to sleep, I went to make a noise complaint and was rather surprised to learn that I was the only one to say something, since there was no construction going on during those times and the apartment next to me had been vacant. It was all very strange and I can't explain it. Rather than just chocking it up to the paranormal I could have been having daily auditory hallucinations, but that doesn't explain why my dog was starting to act very strangely first and he'd continue to do so.  I also don't know what the maximum time is for an Auditory hallucination. Seconds? Minutes? Thirty minutes? An hour? So this has kept me searching for some rational explanations. I'm fully aware of the power of the mind being able to pull tricks, I'm just not that knowledgeable to say that it can do so every day for four months. Even a partial seizure can give you an experience, but it doesn't last very long at all. It can take some time afterward to put things back together again as your brain somewhat readjusts - as is my understanding. In all that happened during that time, I cannot conclusively say yes, nor can I say no. ",

The name \u2018Spock\u2019 has been a metaphor for the precise logical basis of science for the past few generations of Americans. Yet psi phenomena seem anything but logical even though a few brave scientists have tried to make logical sense of psi. It would be nice to think that science has progressed far enough during the past two millennia so that questionable ideas such as those implied by psi phenomena could be handled with the respect that all of nature deserves, but the existence of psi still raises emotional and unscientific responses from its critics. Yet some well-known physicists are willing to entertain the possible existence of psi while others are willing to go further and accept its existence in some as yet undetermined shape or form as well as publicize their views. The number of scientists in this category is growing very slowly and psi is slowly, if not begrudgingly, merging into mainstream physics. The Search for Spock!

            "answer_text": "A2A by Shyamli Shukla Question asked: Are paranormal activities real? From what I know, paranormal activities, or to put it more accurately, phenomena, are simply naturally occurring events that science cannot explain presently. There was a time when the Northern Lights were believed to be caused by spirits on their way to Valhalla (Norse equivalent of Heaven). We now know that they are formed when charged particles from the sun interact with the earth's magnetosphere. Ball lightning too, used to be considered as spirit manifestations. We now know that they are formed by charged particles that accumulate near non conducting materials, like wood. People can be fooled by their own brain. We can be made to see things in such a way that it appears to be real. That's why we sometimes think there is a ghost in our bedroom, only to switch on the light and are hit with the realisation that it was nothing more that the shirt you are going to wear the next day, draped on the chair.  As children, one of our leisurely pastimes was to find shapes in clouds. We see unicorns, or giant eagles, or some familiar shape in wisps of cloud. This particular tendency to see recognisable shapes in random objects is known as 'pareidolia'. Over the years, science has given us pretty mundane explanations for many such other-worldly phenomena. I'm not saying outright that phenomena like telepathy, NDE etc. do or do not happen. All I'm saying is that if science cannot explain something now, it will definitely do so in the future, when the technology to do so has been developed. ",

My reply is simply that extraordinary claims, which the paranormal certainly are, demand extraordinary proof. That\u2019s a tired cliche but true. If you want me to believe that a paranormal event has occurred, it beholds you to support your claim with incontrovertible evidence. So far, in all my years, I\u2019ve never seen anything that comes close to evidence beyond blurry photos and eyewitness reports. Neither qualify as evidence in my view. The wording of your question implies that if they are not real they must be fake but that isn\u2019t so. People can be mistaken, can misinterpret what they see or hear and genuinely believe that they have witnessed a paranormal event. Undoubtedly the majority of stuff I see on Youtube and similar sites is faked but some can not be explained. That doesn\u2019t constitute proof though. Unexplained is just that - unexplained. ",

            "answer_text": "That's a good question, but it's not as easy to answer as you think. First of all, I've been Watching Paranormal videos for a few years and doing a lot of analysis. there's definitely a lot of paranormal videos on youtube that are, unfortunately, fake. you have to question a lot before you believe anything, no matter how realistic it may seem, there's a good chance it's all fake, because there may be people who can do it just to get views but that doesn't mean there's a fake rate in every incident, don't you think it's a bit silly to call everything Fake? I can definitely see that people are always saying that if the popular paranormal events on the internet are real, why are the image quality low and the quality of the cameras so bad? for example, the image quality may be bad because it is impossible for the camera to focus on every scene. if someone is experiencing a paranormal event and is recording it, they probably won't even be able to focus the camera because they're afraid. if it comes to cameras, it's a little complicated. I mean, Why do cameras always shoot everything so badly? isn't that an easy sign that it was a fake? I just want to say that the cameras are really bad in most cases, and you're right, it's a strange and thought-provoking thing. but what you need to know is that we don't know how high quality the camera used is, and it's a bad and pointless thing to talk about without knowing. I just wanted to prove that these two factors are not 100% proof that a paranormal event is fake I have a suggestion for you if you are going to watch a paranormal event and want to interpret it if there's a history of that please don't forget to look into it. one of the best things to know if an event is real is to look at whether that thing has a history. I don't want to extend the topic much longer, but like I said, there are no doubt a lot of fake paranormal activite videos on the internet, and I can never say it's wrong and I can't tell you to believe it all, but saying everything is fake Is worst thing you can do, please remember that we are not alone in this universe TL: DR There may be a lot of paranormal events that are fake but they are not all fake and I'm sure there are paranormal videos that are real ",

Here is a breaking news report for you- Jack Parsons, the man who created the both the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, certainly knew it was real- and, GASP, he was a scientist. I have met and befriended scientists, doctors, lawyers, professionals in other fields- all of whom know that the paranormal is real. We do not want the public to know the factuality of it, because it would discredit the public view of us as individuals in our profession. We know something that the masses do not believe in, and would not understand even if we gave up our secret and occult knowledge. We know that people are always going to be obtuse when regarding the truth, so why bother trying to convince the masses otherwise. ",

I recommend the books by Dr. Jim B.Tucker about children\u2019s apparant past life memories, the case of the Enfield Poltergeist, this: The Roman Ghosts of York , this Strange But True? programme about time slips:  and perhaps the case of the Hexham Heads.

I'm skeptical of it all, but having had experiences myself I cannot just close the book on the subject.  From my experience, the paranormal, UFO's, and other strange phenomena are all tied together. Possibly, there is an energy or non-human consciousness on this planet that interacts with humans occasionally. This cannot be proven of course. There is one study on earth lights that is interesting. The earth lights appeared to exhibit some type of intelligence when it interacted with a human being. I think the percipient influences this energy to some degree and helps create the experience.  Again, all of this is anecdotal evidence, but I don't think we should dismiss the experiences people have just because we can't explain them. ",
