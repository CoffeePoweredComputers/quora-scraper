            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going with the Shackleton expedition on this one. Chances are greater by far that you would win the lottery, rather than doing what Sir Ernest Shackleton accomplished. Many of you reading this now understand his story. (BELOW: Shackleton and his crew on the ice with Endurance.)  After his Antarctic expedition became stranded when his ship Endurance was trapped in the ice, Shackleton pulled off the most incredible feat of survival in human history. There are survival stories. Then there is Shackleton. Shackleton and his crew spent 492 days camped on ice floes after the Endurance finally sank with the breakup of the big ice. They spent five additional days traveling over rough seas until reaching Elephant Island, an uninhabited freezing rock not much better than the ice floes.  (ABOVE: The launching of the modified lifeboat, James Caird, from Elephant Island.) Then Shackleton and five of his men somehow crossed 800 miles of open water to South Georgia Island in a lifeboat the carpenter converted by raising the sides, toughening up the keel, and making other improvements. During some of the trip, winds reached hurricane force and they landed on the WRONG side of South Georgia Island. Rather than trying to circumnavigate the island in the rough seas, they decided to cross the snowbound mountains leading to a whaling station on the other side of the island. They made it to Grytviken, barely recognizable as human beings. Not long afterward, the remainder of his crew on Elephant Island were rescued. Shackleton lost none of his crew, which was amazing in itself. In my opinion, this is the greatest human endeavor ever accomplished. It will never be matched. The miniseries with Kenneth Branagh is probably the best rendition of the Shackleton story. ",

I mean we left our planet and stood upon another terrestrial object, yeah I know its not that far away and its not even outside the earths gravitational influence but the effort and innovation to get it done was amazing. As yet, despite a lot of looking, we are yet to find evidence of living life on other planets or indeed intelligent life anywhere in the universe. Our achievement in travelling to the moon means by extension, we have the means of populating other parts of the galaxy. That would be the ultimate in human achievement. ",
