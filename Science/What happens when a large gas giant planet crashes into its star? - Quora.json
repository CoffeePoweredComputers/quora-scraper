            "answer_text": "It depends on the context. Is the collision head on? Or a glancing blow? Also the velocity of the planet relative to the star is important. The mads of the planet and star are also factors. As in the previous answer, a planet would most likely approach not head-on but on a curved orbital trajectory. In this case the gravity of the star would pull a gas giant apart before it hit the surface and you would get rings (accretion disk). some material would fall on to the star but it would be a rather leisurely affair, certainly no explosions. A head on fast impact with a heavy gas giant, say one with 10 times the mass of Jupiter, into a sun-like star would be far more energetic. The reason being that a heavy gas giant is very dense and would have a strong gravitational field. The would mean it would (mostly) reach the surface of the star intact. On reaching the surface, the outer layers of the planet would swell up and disipate into the star. The dense core would carry on, forcing its way down through the star, shedding layer upon layer of its material as it went. In the end approx 5 jupiter masses of the core would impact the fusing core of the star. There would be a enormous explosion; the pressure of the core of the star is momentarily released back through the Jupiter sized tunnel left behind by the planet. The result would be a huge solar flare from the star along with the star swelling up a bit and turning bluer with heat. Any life bearing planets caught in the path of the flare jet would be sterilized. For many centuries afterwards the star would have many major flares and unpredictable magnetic cycles as it settles down. The end result would be a slightly hotter and brighter star due to it gaining mass. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t happen the way you might imagine: what happens is that it goes around the star in an ever tighter orbit, not that it \u201csplashes\u201d down into the star head-on. As it approaches the star, it will be torn apart by tidal forces and spread out in a ring. The debris will be gradually slowed in its orbit by interaction with the stellar wind and/or stellar atmosphere, and slowly \u201crain\u201d down on the star. The star won\u2019t notice; the planet is tiny, a hardly noticeable contamination. Careful spectral analysis before and after the event might be able to discern that something happened. ",
