            "answer_text": "Q: Will the universe eventually collapse, create another \"Big Bang\" and start all over again? A: To the best of our knowledge and the available evidence, the universe can no longer collapse. The density is too low. On the contrary, the expansion rate is going up. The current hypotheses of the end of the universe is the Big Chill or the Big Rip, not the Big Crunch. The Big Chill, also known as the Heat Death of the Universe, is the scenario where the universe expands and gets colder, until it reaches maximum entropy in about a million googol years, there is no free energy to do work, and nothing more ever happens again. The other scenario, the Big Rip, is a lot less likely. In this scenario, the expansion rate increases until it even beats the strong and weak nuclear forces, leading to all matter ripping itself apart in some 20 billion years.  There may be a new big bang afterwards though, but not through a collapse. There is a fun idea by Roger Penrose (who just won a Nobel Prize in physics for his work on black holes) \u2013 an idea that he himself thinks is probably not right \u2013 that if proton decay happens and matter decays into photons, and if Hawking radiation happens and black holes slowly evaporates, then the universe will eventually just be filled with photons. Since photons go at the speed of light, then from their frame of reference, they don\u2019t experience time. So they are basically there the moment they are emitted. But if there is no other reference frames than that of photons, that means that they are everywhere at the same time. And if every photon is everywhere at the same time, that means that the universe suddenly has infinite pressure, which is basically the conditions of the Big Bang. So in that way, you could hypothetically get a new Big Bang. ",

            "answer_text": "All evidence indicates that our universe is not only expanding but the expansion is accelerating due to a mysterious energy that we do not fully understand (hence named \u201cdark energy\u201d), that is pushing things further apart. Our latest understanding is that the universe will ultimately become a cold, dark, infinitely vast expanse of space. There will be no other galaxies visible in the night sky because they will have drifted infinitely far apart from each other. The only stars visible will be of your own local galaxy. Thinking of this fate ending up alone in your little galaxy unable to see the beauty of the vast cosmos, the birthing of new stars in distant galaxies, makes one kind of sad :(. In terms of birthing a new universe a popular theory often speculated in the scientific community is that black holes could possibly spawn a new universe inside them. Perhaps our universe itself could have birthed inside a super-massive blackhole of another universe? There could be many parallel universes like ours existing inside each black hole of each universe (and more universes inside the black holes of those universes\u2026 think \u201cInception\u201d). Another theory speculated in the field of string theory is that there are parallel universes existing in higher dimensions (think of them like membranes) that have quantum fluctuations all the time. These fluctuations can cause the membranes to randomly wave/vibrate. Sometimes the membranes collide releasing a massive amount of energy (since energies of two universes are colliding). These collisions could be the cause of the big bang and the energy released in our universe could be the impact energy released in that collision. Since these higher dimensional membranes are waving around all the time, there could be other collisions causing other big bangs and possibly spawning other universes. The above 2 are examples (among many) of different possibilities speculated upon in the scientific community. There is a whole field of science that studies \u201cmultiverses\u201d and parallel universes where some of the theories can be really mind-blowing. Hope this helps! ",
