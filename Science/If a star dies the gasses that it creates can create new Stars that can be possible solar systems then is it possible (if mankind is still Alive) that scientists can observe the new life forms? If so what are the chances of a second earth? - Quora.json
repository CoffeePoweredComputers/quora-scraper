            "answer_text": "When a star dies, it spews some of its matter into interstellar space depending on the mass of the star. The matter gets intermixed with the atoms from other dead stars, and then collects in pockets around the galaxy. When new stars systems are born, they are made from the recycled material from probably at least millions of previous stars. It takes millions of years for new stars systems to form, and if Earth is any example, hundreds of millions of years for life to emerge. It takes billions of years to establish multicellular life. Life on Earth was all single-cellular for the first 3 billion years or so that life existed. There may be other \u201cEarths\u201d with life like ours all over the galaxy. There may be none. We don\u2019t know. Scientists don\u2019t have the tools to see if life exists outside of our solar system, but if they did the first thing they would see would be chemical signatures of life, like oxygen. Observing the life forms directly isn\u2019t something we could expect to do without being able to go there. When we did, we would just see them as they were once they were established \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t see them actually emerging because it would take too long, hundreds of millions or billions of years. If you are asking whether our solar system will create a new solar system and a new Earth by itself, in kind of a perpetual cycle, then no, that won\u2019t happen. Each new star has millions of progenitors, and often hundreds or thousands of stellar brothers and sisters are randomly made out of the same cloud of dust at the same time. Most or all of the new star systems may form planets, but we can\u2019t predict what the planets will be like.  The Orion star-forming nebula, showing protoplanetary disks around new stars. There are 328 yellow dots, each representing a newly forming star with its own protoplanetary disk. The protoplanetary disks will eventually condense to become planets \u2014 possibly some like Earth. Sci-News. ",

All of the element heavier than lithium in the solar system came from precursor stars. then is it possible (if mankind is still Alive) that scientists can observe the new life forms? Maybe, and likely indirectly, due to their effect on their planet's atmosphere. If they broadcast radio signals we could detect those. If so what are the chances of a second earth? Nil. They are unlikely to resemble us in any way beyond the superficial. Planetary ecosystems, biological & geological evolution, life-form psychological makeup & any historical events of another planet will be randomly different. ",
