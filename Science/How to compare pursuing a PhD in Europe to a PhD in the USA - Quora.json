            "answer_text": "I also found myself asking this question and hope I can provide some input based on my experience. I am a PhD candidate in materials science. I started a PhD in the US, at Boston University. After two years, I moved to Germany to begin a new PhD program, also in materials science. Let\u2019s begin with the caveat that it depends very much on your research field, and on the country in which you are pursuing the PhD. In my American research university, materials science was very badly funded. Funding was not guaranteed for the full duration of the program, with the exception of students who had won fellowships. On the other hand, biomedical engineering was very well funded and most PhD students knew they had funding for the duration of their program. In Germany, there are different types of PhD positions. The one I have is considered a scientific employee, hired essentially as support staff to a project for which a professor has funding. Because labor rights are very much in favor of the employee in Germany, I am treated very well. I have a fixed contract which guarantees my funding for the duration of my contract. I have a salary which is comparable to the starting salary of an engineer in industry with a Bachelors or Masters degree, with which I can afford my own apartment and regular travel back to the U.S. In the U.S, the monthly stipend for PhD students, no matter the department, is not high enough to live like an adult. That can be fun if you like living with roommates in a big city, but can also reduce your quality of life. Worse than the low salary, however, is the fact that at the end of every semester I lived under constant stress as to whether funding would be available. I applied for many grants, which in materials science are not as common as other fields, and was rejected. In Germany, PhD students do not apply for their own funding, it is considered the responsibility of the professor. However, as I said, there are other types of PhD positions in Germany. A very common one that foreigners have is called a DAAD fellowship, where the German government funds your PhD directly for 3 years. You are not an employee, but rather enrolled as a student at the university. There are some perks to this program, including German lessons for one month before the program begins, greater flexibility in work hours and more academic freedom in terms of defining your own project. However, there are some negatives. Because you are not an employee, your montly stipend is much lower (half that of a standard employee contract). You are not guaranteed vacation time, and once your stipend is over, you have to be finished with your PhD. It is very difficult to extend. My experience is very specific to materials science, which is an area of interest for industry in Germany and therefore well funded. Basic science like chemistry, physics and biology has a very different set of conditions. This includes a salary that\u2019s much lower per month (1/4 that of scientific employees). In computer science, I think people have an even better deal. There are a lot of foreigners in computer science PhD programs in Germany, because the undergraduate curriculum for CS here is not really academic. They are also paid very well, and on top of that, are eligible to apply for a \u201cBlue card\u201d, essentially a permanent resident permit in Germany, within one year of arriving here. Teaching responsibilities have also been significantly different in Germany and the U.S. In the U.S I was a teaching assistant for a lab course with a total of 50 students, which I had to supervise for 9 hours a week, attend trainings for 2 hours a week, and correct 100 lab reports every week, which required about 15 hours per week. As you can see, this adds up to more than half of a normal work week on teaching assignments unrelated to research. In addition to that, I still spent at least 40 hours per week on lab work. This was rather burdensome, and many of my colleagues felt the same way. In Germany, as a teaching assistant for a lab course, my responsiblities were split with another PhD student, and I taught a maximum of 10 students for 10 hours a week, with about 2 hours per week needed for grading lab reports. In both countries, I supervised bachelors projects, and in Germany I supervised Masters projects as well. That work, in both countries, was less burdensome and quite enjoyable. Another big difference between German and American research in general that I find quite striking is the availability of resources. Even in a well-funded department, the equipment availability in U.S research institutions is much lower than in Germany. There are far more shared facilities, perhaps with newer equipment, but what that means is that they are constantly booked and the only way you can use them is by working until 5 am on a Sunday. In Germany, every research lab I have worked in has its own dedicated equipment, which means you can keep more regular hours. Other commenters have already talked about the duration of the PhD, but I\u2019d like to confirm that from my own experience. In Germany, a 4 year PhD is considered too long, whereas in the US some of the smartest people I knew took 9 years. I agree with other commenters that this has significant implications for the level of work with which a doctorate is finalized. I only really began to understand my field in the third year, and my doctorate is already coming to an end. The depth with which I can explore scientific questions is therefore quite limited. This may be because it feels like a doctorate in Germany is more an exercise in research management than in depth scientific research. This point is substantiated by the fact that none of my German colleagues in the doctoral program continue in academia, with every one of them going into industry, either as engineers or R&D managers. This has some implications on the work culture as well. I like to work late, I like learning new techniques, and I like exploring the unknown. With limited time, that kind of attitude is not going to make life easier as a PhD student in Germany. In some labs, there is also a rather strict work schedule, of arrival by 9 am and no access to labs after 7pm. This would be unheard of in the U.S, at least in Boston, where I slept under my desk many times to keep working into the night. On the one hand, it means you sleep more and get to enjoy great German beer and visit other cities on weekends. On the other hand, it sometimes feels to me like people aren\u2019t as passionte about their work or as interested in pushing the boundaries of knowledge. This may also be because I\u2019m in a rather conservative field of physical sciences, and I can\u2019t say whether that\u2019s the case in computer science. Another key difference in bench science research between the US and Europe is the amount of nonscientific staff that support research. This has positives and negatives. There are a lot of technicians that help with sample preparation and equipment. That means you don\u2019t have to spend hours in the lab doing rote work that doesn\u2019t help you understand the science any better after the 100th hour. What that also means, however, is that in some research groups ONLY technicians are allowed to use essential pieces of equipment like microscopes, and you don\u2019t have the opportunity to develop those fundamental techniques that can get you a postdoc. As far as future opportunities are concerned, I don\u2019t think your choice of continent will ever limit you. I knew many postdocs in Boston at excellent research labs who had done their PhDs in smaller European universities and went on to get very good faculty positions in the U.S. Whether you do your PhD in the US or Europe, if you want to continue in academia you will most likely have to do a postdoc. The ability to get a postdoc out of your research group depends a lot on what skills you have in the lab, your publications, your group\u2019s network, your own ability to talk to new people at conferences etc\u2026That being said, a well funded lab will provide you with many more opportunities to develop technical skills and attend conferences, and sometimes even stay for a few weeks or months with a collaborator in another country. The last point is a very fun part of the PhD, and something that\u2019s much more common in German doctoral programs than in American ones. I know of other people who had opportunities to do that from other European universities as well. I\u2019ve really enjoyed reflecting on these differences, and thank you for posing this question. I hope my answer is useful for you, and would be happy to tell you more if you have followup questions. ",

            "answer_text": "I did my PhD in the US and therefore my response is a bit biased. In my mind the goal of the PhD is to train people to become independent researchers and to teach people how to generate data and to publish their results. Everyone takes different numbers of years to \u201cpeak\u201d and to figure out their work ethic, to mature, and to find those lucky breaks that allow people to generate enough data to publish and get out. My department chairman was an old school academic and his students were required to publish three first author papers before they could get out. It didn\u2019t matter if it took ten years for this to happen and some of his students were around that long! My lab was a bit more lenient but really you needed to have at least one first author paper and enough contributions in other areas to make a whole thesis. Now compare this to Europe\u2014i have worked with many PhDs and have reviewed CVs for countless more who had applied for roles in my companies. A surprising number of PhDs were completed in the 3 or 4 year time frame when the funding runs out\u2026but without any publications! Not even second or later authorships! This makes me wonder what these people actually did while in grad school. And it\u2019s makes me wonder whether these people would know how to independently do research or to navigate the academic publication machinery. I have also lost track of the number of PhDs I have interviewed (with or without publications) who could not properly explain their PhDs or who could not do so passionately. This tells me that they entered a lab, were told what experiments to do by their PI, they did them, and then they were booted out with their degree 3 or 4 years later. To be fair, there are far greater numbers of PhDs in the UK, at least, that are sponsored by industry. So in those cases there may be limitations to what you can publish. But in my mind, and with the biases I highlighted above, there really is no comparison. Maybe I\u2019m being a bit harsh. So please help prove me wrong. ",
