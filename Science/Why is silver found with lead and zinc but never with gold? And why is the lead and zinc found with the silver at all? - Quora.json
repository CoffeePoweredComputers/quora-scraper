            "answer_text": "Silver is found with gold, eg at Wanlockhead lead mines in the Southern Uplands of Scotland enough gold was found to make the crown of Scotland or at least some bits of regal tat, not sure of the details. Gold panners are still finding small nuggets of gold up there. Underground heat is from intrusive granite or from movement along a major faultline causing friction. It causes superheated superpressure water to circulate through the bedrock, and various minerals dissolve in the water. As the superheated water seeps upwards through cracks in the rocks, the pressure and temperature drop and various minerals precipitate out, forming mineral veins. So where there\u2019s one mineral, there will often be others. The Caldbeck Fells in northern Lakeland, England, have lead, copper, zinc, tungsten. Not far away are (or were) gold and graphite. Lead, silver, zinc precipitate out at roughly the same temperature/pressure point so are quite often found mixed up together. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not have access to chemical phase diagrams, but to put it simply lead-silver and gold have substantially different solubilities in high temperature (hydrothermal) solutions, the agents of transport of dissolved metal ions in the ore-forming environment. Another factor is source of the metals, such as the lead (and minor) silver of the so-called Mississippi lead-zinc deposits, which are devoid of gold. In claasic volcanic quartz vein deposits, lead and silver will come out of solution (precipitate) at higher temperatures than gold, and thus will be found deeper than gold, which will be found at shallower, cooler depths, sometimes associated with silver. There are many variants because the chemistry of a hydrothermal solution can vary greatly, the temperature and pressure regime, the influence of the chemistry of the rock the solution passes through etc. ",
