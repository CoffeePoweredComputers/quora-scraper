            "answer_text": "At that time scientists were very curious to know about what is there inside an atom after the discovery of an atom . Different scientists studied and gave their own individual theories and conducted many experiments , out of which only some were accepted until a corrected version had to replace it . Like how Rutherford model replaced Thomson's. As the scientists that time didn't have proper experimental setups , it was much easier for them to detect charged particles in the atoms than to even take a moment to think about neutral particles . As Rutherford model changed the basics of understanding an atom, scientists took few years to develop new theories and experiments to understand the proper shape of an atom . It took a long time to understand what was happening in the atom and how the particles are arranged in an atom. It took some more time to measure the mass of an atom and then to find defects why many atoms weigh more than expected . So then they got to know that there are uncharged particles which has some mass in the nucleus . This led to the further development of the nuclear structure and also about nuclear fission . Then Japan got bombed while the periodic table was being setup . Hence , it took some while to discover neutrons . Late, but at the wrong time we can say . ( Only if it was discovered after the world war had Japan been saved ). ",

            "answer_text": "A discovery according to me can be done in two ways: When you imagine anything (here a particle) and you carry out experiments to prove its existence.When you encounter the \u2018particle\u2019 by accident and study its properties.In the case of neutrons, it was almost impossible to imagine a particle like it as there was no reason to imagine it. All a neutron does (it may not be all) is to hold the nuclei strongly amidst the coulombic repulsion between protons. And this quality was only found after the particle was discovered. And hence case 1 gets ruled out. Neutron are charge-less particles. They are not affected by electromagnetic fields and thus are hard to identify. Also isolating a neutron is very hard as they decay very fast after isolation. Case 2 ruled out. Note: Ironically when neutron were discovered both of these cases occurred. After Rutherford presented his (breakthrough) model of the atom in 1911, the disparities in the atomic numbers and atomic weights of the elements made him think of these uncharged particles which had weights approximately equal to proton. He called these particles neutron (case 1). And finally in 1931, Bothe and Becker discovered a penetrating radiation. It was thought that they were gamma rays due to the similar properties. Yet many disparities arose and Chadwick who was searching for Rutherford's neutron throughout the 1920s finally confirmed these unknown radiations were neutrons. (Case 2) ",
