            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the answer I got from google about why fluorine is so electronegative: \u201cFluorine is the most electronegative element because it has 5 electrons in its 2P shell. The optimal electron configuration of the 2P orbital contains 6 electrons, so since Fluorine is so close to ideal electron configuration, the electrons are held very tightly to the nucleus.\u201d I\u2019m a student too, but my impression is that having the electrons that close to the nucleus makes fluorine quite the powerful little magnet. I picture it like being closer to a powerful little sun. Chlorine has a 3p shell, which is farther away from the nucleus, so the pull from the nucleus isn\u2019t as powerful (although chlorine still manages to attract plenty of partners). ",

            "answer_text": "As we know that,chlorine atom has more electrons and protons than florine so chlorine has to be more electro negative than of florine but it is wrong because florine has 2 shell i.e. K,L where as chlorine has 3 shell i.e. K,L,M so its proton can not hold its electron tight as compared to fluorine so it does not attract electron more than florine so its electronegativity is less than fluorine Electronegativity order: F>O>Cl~N2>Br>I ",
