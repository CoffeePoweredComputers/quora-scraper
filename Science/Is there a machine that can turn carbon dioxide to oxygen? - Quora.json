            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s say there were. What use could it possibly have? You probably think it could be used to combat climate change \u2026 wrong. We get a tremendous amount of energy when carbon sources are burned (C + O2 => CO2) and to reverse that process, you have to put the energy back! In other words, it will take as much energy, actually more because the process will require energy, to reverse the creation of CO2 than we got from creating it in the first place. This simply exacerbates the problem. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume that you already know that this is also done by plants in a process called photosynthesis. recently, researchers have also developed artificial leaves which essentially turn CO2 into O2 and are about 20 times more efficient than plants. this is because htey are specialised to turn CO2 into 02. another group of researchers have managed to make oxygen out of C02 by zapping it with a laser: Scientists Turned Carbon Dioxide into Oxygen by Zapping It with a Laser ",
