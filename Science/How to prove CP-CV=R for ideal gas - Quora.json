            "answer_text": "The above equation is known as Mayer\u2019s equation and its derivation can be found easily in any standard textbook of physical chemistry and thermodynamics. We have the equation for enthalpy change  (1) Assuming a constant pressure process and solving for 1 mole of ideal gas  and  Hence,  Now, we know that  and  From ideal gas law, we can write,  and  (for one mole of an ideal gas and for constant pressure process) Substituting all the values in equation 1, we get  Dividing by \u2206T on both sides,  Hence,  ",
