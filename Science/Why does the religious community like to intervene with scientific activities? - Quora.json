            "answer_text": "Answering: \u201cWhy does the religious community like to interfere with scientific things?\u201d Full disclosure, I am a scientist and an atheist. First off, religion does not directly interfere with scientific study in the modern era. Historically this has been very much the case. Religious entities no longer have the power or authority to unilaterally shut science down like they used to. In fact, from my experience, as far as direct interaction goes, religion serves much more now as a source of moral and ethical complaint against certain routes of study which even a sane and rational (in my opinion at least) atheist such as myself have. For example against human genome experimentation and biochemical warfare and weapons research. That much though I think is completely reasonable and should be accepted. The case for indirect interference is much more interesting though. Certain religious zealot individuals and institutions (most of which even frowned upon by mainstream religion) attempt to interfere in education. Now while this is not directly a \u2018science\u2019 entity it does play a significant role in shaping the public opinion and support of science through the teaching of it. This is perhaps best seen in the attempts of certain groups to force the teaching of creationism in science classes and the ban on teaching of evolution. It also would not be the first time I\u2019ve got in to work and found an email condemning me to hell for my teaching of \u201carts of Satan that deny the true nature of the creation of God\u201d and threats of violence if I continue to do so. Now a lot of this was stopped by the separation of Church and State. Religion was stripped of its authority over the functions that are deemed part of state affairs, which includes education and science. However we do still have certain religious zealots in positions of power (state power) that misuse that position to press religious beliefs into state issues. This is not as big an issue in the UK where I reside and work, but is very much so in the US. Of course the main difference causing this that I can see is the US seems to have unspoken requirements that their political leaders must be religious (regardless of denomination) whereas in the UK a politician mentioning their religion in anything but a passing manner is tantamount to career suicide. So directly, no I don\u2019t think they do. Indirectly though, almost certainly and as for the why, because people of significant religious overzealousness perceive science as an enemy that challenges their world views and calls them wrong. People don\u2019t tend to like that very much. ",

            "answer_text": "The \u201creligious community\u201d \u2014 whatever that is \u2014 has no identifiable record of interference with science, at least not in the modern era. Certain fundamentalist sects, however, have a clear and disreputable record of interfering with certain aspects of science, mostly focused on the Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. Unfortunately, this can affect much more than biology, such as geology, paleontology, cosmology, chemistry, and planetary science. This program of sabotage, which continues to this day, interferes with public education and feeds the culture of science denial in general (e.g., climate science, medicine) which tends to sabotage public policy. The motive behind this meddling is an arrogant conviction that religious beliefs are intended to take precedence over scientific facts, not just for the believer, but for the society in general. ",
