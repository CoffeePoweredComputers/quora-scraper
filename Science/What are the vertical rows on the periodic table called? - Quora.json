Some of the \u201cfamilies\u201d have names \u2014 like \u201calkali metals\u201d and \u201calkaline earths\u201d for the first and second columns \u2014 well except in the first column H is not counted as an alkali metal, because H is not metallic (under any near ordinary conditions). The last column is called the \u201chalogens\u201d and the next to last column the \u201cchalcogens\u201d. Some other columns are given names also, but in any event the columns are usually described by a number - though there are different conventions, and one entails an further identification or A or B (& rarely C). The elements in a column share some certain characteristics or properties. ",
