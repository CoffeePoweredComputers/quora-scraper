            "answer_text": "You might consider travel a chain of cause and effect. My right foot moves forward, pulling my body forward, followed by my left foot, in a continuous chain of cause and effect. Typically one describes the propagation of light through a vacuum as a changing electric field causes a changing magnetic field causing a changing electric field\u2026. This sounds a lot like a chain of cause and effect. The flaw with this is the equations are completely reversible. So can we really saw we have effect and then cause? Maybe it cause and then effect\u2026. As such the description gives us no definitive answer if light travels. In fact if you could travel faster than light you would still observe light travels at the same speed, but you might disagree on the direction of travel. It turns out this same vagueness applies to all fundamental particles. There is no chain of cause and effect as an electron moves though a vacuum. It is only by interactions do we and effect that needed a cause. So we cannot consider travel a continuous chain of cause and effect. Instead we can define travel as any journey ends in a effect that requires a cause. Under this definition we cannot truly say something is travelling until we are certain the journey will lead to an effect. This fits very well with quantum mechanics which tells us we cannot be certain where a photon will hit a screen in a diffraction experiment until we measure it. But this extends this concept further. Not only can we not say where the photon will arrived, we cannot say where it travelled. In fact if it can miss the screen we cannot even say the photon did travelled. So we only know a photon, or any particle has travelled there is evidence of travel. Light does not seem to be special, but the concept of travel just got much weirder than I thought before I started to answer this question. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Light really travels through space. Light propagates as spherical waves of energy carrying energy radially outwards from its source. There are trillions of waves in just one second passing through space, each kicking the one in the front. The distance between two waves ( we call it wave length) is extremely small. Its frequency ranges in trillions per second. This is how light makes it own medium to propagate. This is why light does not need any other medium. There is no other medium so compact. While traveling through space, light encounters various energy fields, objects with mass which absorb its energy. After traveling through space for a long time, light gets red shifted. We do get highly red shifted light from galaxies 13.8 billion light years away. This light did pass through space. Light travels at 300,000 km per second. It has speed. This also indicates that light always travel through space. It does take time to travel from one point to other point in space. Space exists. It is continuous through out the universe. It cut through all objects in space. It is inside and out side of atoms, planets, stars, galaxies, etc. Nothing exits without space. Light needs space to travel through. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, light can definitely travel in space. This is how scientists estimate distances to far off stars and galaxies. There have been interesting apprehensions about how light actually travels in space.  When Newton's laws of motion were given acceptance, an immediate repercussion of that was the concept of \"Relative speed\" which denied the notion of absolute motion of any body in space. Having said that the next question to what is the computed speed of light relative to. It was then proposed that the entire space was filled with an imaginary substance called ether and light always traveled relative to the speed ether propagated in space. But later, based on experiment results it was formulated that light always traveled with a fixed speed in any frame of reference, even with reference to the another light beam travelling in the same direction. This result was a consequence of a new theory where, like speed, the notion of time was also considered to be relativistic and not absolute. Now, time is not how we see it. ",

If by \u201cto exist\u201d means that we can go to x, y, z, t and find it there, then light does not exist.If we have an expensive laser that only delivers one photon at a time, we can get a pretty good idea of when the photon comes into existence by noting the time we threw the switch on the laser, and perhaps we could make some measurement of the energy that disappeared from that device. From then on until such time as it shows up as a scintillation on a detections screen. Richard Feynman says that a photon goes by all possible paths to wherever it shows up. ",

Yes don't we all know this\u2026. Now comes the thing that must be taught. If Space exploration has taught us one thing that is that space, is a cold, dark, Abyss. It is unforgiving, and it is unrelenting. It is a vacuum. Or it is as close to a vacuum as doesn't matter at least for the sake of this answer. Now in a vacuum, we can't breathe as there's no air. So we can't live without a space suit. Now we crave sustenance which requires us to build our space stations! Then we need people to man them and conduct required research. So we use rockets and space shuttles to send them up there. Astronauts have gone space-walking in this dismal vacuum. We now have rovers on - wait just a minute!! I think we can agree on vacuum, and obviously the stars. How do you see them then? You have your answer, I believe. Of course light can travel through space.

If you want to use a quantum mechanical model I would be inclined to say no. To travel implies a starting point , a definite path and an end point. For a photon, we can be happy that it left a disatnt star and it was detected after being capyured in accd at the end of a telescope. We have no idea of the path it took and we cannot say it passed through a continuous set of points between here and the star. All we can know is that we detected it. So to assert it travelled is probably a step too far. ",

It also can travel from the farthest reaches of the Universe, and now that we know the speed of light, we can calculate the age of the Universe. We depend on light being able to cross the interstellar voids, to be able to observe it. We can also bounce a lazer beam off the moon, so we are capable of making light go through space. There we go.

Light, composed of EMR (photons), does travel, but space is just an abstract concept, just an idea to enable us visualizers to visualize motion. What is the \u201cstuff\u201d that real things traverse? Nothing. Space is nothing, just a concept for us. Space is filled with real things, matter and EMR. Even a vacuum is filled with EMR. But space, it is just what the word implies, it\u2019s nothing, empty, space, zero. Just an idea, and somehow, it seems you realize that, thus your question. So, no, light travels through nothing, and the word we use to refer to the nothing that light travels through is: space. Now we have the union of two abstract concepts, space and time. Thanks to Hermann Minkowski (1908) who discovered that if you treat the metric of duration (time) as just another dimension like the other three (spatial) dimensions, you can make math equations which accurately predict the motion of real objects without having to directly observe that motion. So now we have this new idea, spacetime (new, only 110 years old). ",

If you imagine yourself to be on one of the photon of light there will be no such thing as time for you, you will never age and not experience anything defined by our knowledge of time as there is no such thing as time for anything travelling at the speed of light because it solely travels through space.

The answer, as revealed in qed if one can just understand the mathematical structure, is that in fact empty space is indeed really empty. The vacuum has no properties and does not constitute a medium. ",

The energy of light certainly travels through space as you can feel when sunbathing, or focussing sunlight with a lens. There is of course a whole spectrum of light/electromagnetic wavelengths outside of the human range of vision. However, when we talk about wavelengths and frequencies or travelling waves we get into more of the intricacies of physics. ",

Light at various density is the substance of all matter. Light is the galaxies that give the space between them definition. It would be fair to say light is space and not empty. ",
