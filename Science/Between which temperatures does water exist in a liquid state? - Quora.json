            "answer_text": "That depends on the pressure where the water is contained. If you have exactly 1atm, the water will be solid for any temperature below 0\u00b0C, it will be liquid for temperatures between 0 and 100\u00b0 and it will be steam for temperatures above 100\u00b0C. Please note that it is also possible to have liquid water at 0\u00b0 and at 100\u00b0 C. In this condition the fluid would be at a so called latent state. ",
