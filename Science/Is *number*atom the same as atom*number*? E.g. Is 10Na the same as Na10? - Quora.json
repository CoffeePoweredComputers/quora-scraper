            "answer_text": "No. 10 Na (note the space) means we\u2019re talking about 10 sodium atoms, all distinct. Na10 (note the lack of space, also if formatting permits the 10 would be a subscript) means we\u2019re talking about a single molecule or a kind of molecule. In this case, the unusual molecule we\u2019d be talking about is ten sodium atoms, all bonded together. Not something you are likely to see in real life. 10 Na is something you might see in a balancing equation: if it\u2019s on the left, it shows that 10 sodium atoms are consumed in a chemical reaction that produces some new molecules; if it\u2019s on the right, it shows that some chemical reaction strips 10 sodium atoms out of some molecules in the process of turning them into different ones. Na10 (if it were a real molecule) might appear in a balancing equation, but it also might appear anywhere a chemist might want to talk about the unique properties of this *type* of molecule. For example, CO and CO2 have very different properties (CO is much more toxic than CO2). In contrast, CO and 2 CO are pretty much the same (the second just refers to a slightly larger *amount* of carbon monoxide). ",

            "answer_text": "Without superscript and subscript, which I don\u2019t know how to do on this forum, it is not clear what is intended. As Mattias Martins said in his reply, in a chemical equation 10<space>Na means 10 separate atoms of Sodium, while Na<subscript>10 means the molecule contains 10 bound sodium atoms. I can\u2019t imagine what such a molecule could be. Perhaps some kind of multi-metal silicate mineral. In a different context, the atomic number of an element precedes the chemical symbol as a superscript with or without the mass number as a subscript, so <superscript 11>Na is the atomic number and chemical symbol for Sodium. If the mass number of the common isotope is included it would be <superscript 11 + subscript 23>Na. Normally the mass number is only included if it is an unusual isotope (such as <subscript 14>C. But this is read as \u201cCarbon 14\u201d so the mass number often wanders over to the other side of the chemical symbol, as in \u201cthe fissionable isotope of Uranium is U-235\u201d. To sum up: 2<space>H means 2 atoms of hydrogen, whatever the isotope. <superscript 2>H is wrong: element number 2 is Helium, He. <subscript 2>H means one atom (or nucleus) of deuterium. H<subscript 2> means there are 2 hydrogen atoms in the molecule. H<superscript 2> means you are in the wrong classroom. It\u2019s Algebra, not Chemistry. H2, H 2, H-2 could mean any of the above. You will have to work it out from the context ",
