            "answer_text": "They can be too far away. The intensity of the light they send decreases with the square of the distance (from the surface of the star to the observer). So a star that is twice as far from Earth must be 4 times brighter for us to see. If it is 3 times as far, it must be 9 times brighter. If it 100 times as far it must be 10,000 times brighter\u2026 However, the majority of stars are smaller than our sun. Then of course, you can see less stars with your naked eye than with instruments. Also, (the light of ) stars can be obscured, e.g. by the moon or some object further away. But if they are in a gas cloud, that cloud would ultimately heat up and be visible in infra red. Another form of being obscured is by the Earth itself, since you can\u2019t look through it. From your particular point on the Earth, say the northern hemisphere, you can\u2019t see the same stars as in Australia. Stars can even be so far away that the light they sent out has not reached the Earth yet, so we don\u2019t even know they are there. But we know they exist somewhere, beyond the horizon of the observable universe.  Sometimes you see stars that are not even there, e.g. when someone punches you on your eyes. Then there are stars you may wish to sleep with (Beyonce?, J. Lo?, \u2026) but since this ain\u2019t going to happen, they might as well not exist at all. However, it is nice to have something to dream about. ",

            "answer_text": "Roughly we are able to see 3000 distinct stars in our night sky with naked eye . All these stars belongs to very small surrounding of around our solar system within our galaxy. With the help of visible telescope we can observe distinct stars in star clusters and stars in other galaxies . Now there are many stars which radiates much in wavelength other than visible spectrum which makes their detection hard with visible range optical telescopes and thus they become invisible but such stars van also be observed via infrared , ultraviolet and other range telescopes .Further it's is difficulr to see distinct stars in far away galaxies which also makes them invisible to us .
