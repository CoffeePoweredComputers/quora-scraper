            "answer_text": "For this you have to imagine that you are shrunk to the size of nucleus and you are standing at safe distance from a lone stationary atom to avoid passing electrons. It is a dark and cold place because atom does not emit photons. Atom and electron exchange photon occasionally, but you can\u2019t see it because it never reach your eyes. you can\u2019t see nucleus because it is not emitting photons. If you direct your tiny torch light and fire photons at atom, occasionally you see a flash of light because of excited electron going back to its original position. By absorbing photon, the nucleus increases its oscillations taking electrons with it. I think you return back to your normal size disappointed. The world is shining because of electron and Sun\u2019s radiation (your tiny torch). ",
