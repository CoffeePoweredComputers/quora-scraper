            "answer_text": "Generally, they are just two expressions for the same thing, but as far as I\u2019ve seen in the U.S., \u201canimal biology\u201d is not a commonly used expression. However, in many universities, there is a difference between zoology and animal science. I went to Michigan State University as a zoology major, but there was also an animal science major. Zoology majors are generally interested in the biology of animals, either just for its own sake or for applied purposes. I was interested in such things as jellyfish, flatworms, animal behavior, invertebrate neuroscience, and spiders\u2019 eyes, for example. Animal science majors, however, focus on the scientific breeding and care of domestic animals, especially livestock (horses, cattle, goats, etc.) and poultry. An animal science major is typically found within a school of agriculture, and a zoology major within a school of natural sciences. This may well differ in other countries, though. Animal science is a huge field of study in India, for example, but I don\u2019t know how they classify it in academic institutions there. ",

            "answer_text": "Animal biology can range from studying the intimate and intricate anatomical details which are characteristic specifically of animals to their behavior, habitats, intra/inter-relationships, as well as the more general classification of each member in the animal kingdom. Now, zoology covers pretty much the same ground, so for all practical purposes, animal biology and zoology can be used interchangeably. ",
