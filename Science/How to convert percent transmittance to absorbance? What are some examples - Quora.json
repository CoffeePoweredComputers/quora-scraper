            "answer_text": "There are two methods to convert percent transmittance to absorbance Method 1: Calculation Method Use the relations given below to convert %transmittance to absorbance Relation between absorbance and transmittance A = -log T T = 10^(-A) Relation between absorbance and %transmittance A = 2 - log %T log %T = 2 - A %T = 10^(2-A) Method 2: Nomogram Method The figure gives one to one correspondence between absorbance and %transmittance. If you know one of these two values then the value corresponding to the other can be read directly from the figure.  Method 3: Experimental Method Take the sample of appropriate %T in a 1 cm cuvette and put in a spectrophotometer and directly read the absorbance of the sample from the instrument after subtracting the blank.
