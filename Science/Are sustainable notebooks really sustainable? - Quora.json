            "answer_text": "I think many notebooks that are marketed as sustainable (recycled, tree-free, Forest Stewardship Council certified) are a step in the right direction, if imperfect. I would recommend looking at marketing claims with healthy skepticism, reading customer reviews, and googling any terms the company uses in promoting themselves as sustainable. If the claims stand up to your scrutiny, the notebook still probably has some (nonzero) carbon footprint and probably generates some (nonzero amount of) landfill waste. Unfortunately, the state of the industry (and all industries) hasn\u2019t reached the point yet where a notebook can be manufactured, packaged, distributed and disposed of in a completely sustainable manner. However, I am in favor of expanding the market for companies that push the envelope in a sustainable direction, even if they are not sustainable in every aspect.
