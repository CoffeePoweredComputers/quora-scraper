            "answer_text": "Heya!! In a simple way, we can say that elementary particles are building blocks of atom or further of matter As, in lower classes , we know that matter is made up of atom which is the smallest particle( almost upto 5th class). Further, the new particles like electron, proton and neutron is considered as building blocks of atom i.e. the smallest particle ( almostly upto 10th class) . But, afterward you come to know that electron , proton etc are not the smallest particle. They are composed of quarks and leptons . Again, further they supposed to be composed of strings, as according to string theory or M theory. matter \u2014\u2014\u2192 atom \u2014\u2014-> electron, proton and neutron \u2014\u2014\u2014-> quarks and leptons \u2014\u2014\u2014 >strings ( not observed still ) These are the building blocks or what we say elementary particles . These are so called as because they can\u2019t be see by naked eye. They are observed at atomic level . Also, they are still not divided further. They are the building blocks of atom. So they are called as fundamental or elementary particle. HOPE IT HELPS UH THANKS!! ",

            "answer_text": "As we explored the world around us, it became necessary to postulate entities like atoms and molecules, ( first invoked to explain chemistry and behaviour of gases), electrons ( to explain electric discharge in gases under low pressure). Later on, the exact arrangement of electrons in different atoms was worked out to explain the observed spectra of elements, and finally the existence of protons and neutrons was needed to explain radioactivity. The discovery of other particles in cosmic ray showers and the need to put all observed atomic/ nuclear level phenomena finally has culminated in the Standard model of Particle physics, which explains them in terms of a few interactions between a small number of elementary particles, as subject to certain constraints of changes in some attributes like charge, spin , colour charge or particle number etc. in various reactions/ interactions. So elementary particles give us the means to understand a very large variety of material phenomena in terms of a few basic rules. ",
