            "answer_text": "It feels exactly like being hit by a solid object. The front of the shock wave is able to transmit energy and force directly to you, and the impact doesn\u2019t mitigate it very much. I know this because, when I was a teenager, I once threw a firecracker, and it went off about a foot or two from my open hand. I wasn\u2019t injured, but it felt exactly as if I had slapped a brick wall as hard as I could. Ouch. ",

            "answer_text": "I use to destroy explosives by burning them while that method was accepted in SLB, there was some protocol to follow for detonating cords which got to be cutted in short pieces, after a while doing that routine I became sloppy and skipped the procedure, just once but enough to learn by hard way, the fire was done at the bottom of a shore cliff and we were at top of it watching the smoke when the detonation did happened, the shock rise straight up (lucky we were not in straight line) and we felt the sudden air pressure increase, no one remains standing due to the physical push of the shock wave.
