            "answer_text": "Q: What does the Bible say about the creation of the universe? How does science agree with it? A: Genesis has a specific order of things. God creates heaven and earth. Earth was formless and a void, and there was darkness and water.1st day: God creates light, and divides day from night.2nd day: God creates a firmament, separating waters above from water below. He also calls the firmament \u201cHeaven\u201d.3rd day: God separates the waters below into one place so that dry land appears. He then creates grass, herbs, fruit-trees (i.e. flowering trees).4th day: God creates stars, the Sun and the Moon.5th day: God creates wild animals.6th day: God creates domesticated animals and humans.Big Bang cosmology, stellar formation, abiogenesis and theory of evolution has a completely different view of things: The universe comes to be. How is unknown. It is by this time incredibly small, smaller than an atom. We know this because the Cosmic Microwave Background is incredibly smooth in temperature.Inflation epoch. The universe expands rapidly. We know this because of the minute fluctuations in the CMB that are frozen in time.Matter forms. First as gluon/quark plasma, then as regular plasma. Nucleosynthesis happens and the first elements (deuterium, tritium, helium, beryllium, lithium) forms. Nucleosynthesis happens at about 2\u201320 minutes after the bang.Recombination: free electrons and atomic nuclei forms up to form gas, rather than plasma. The universe clears up. CMB is the afterglow of this event. This happens about 380,000 years after the bang.Dark ages of the universe. No stars have yet formed.The first stars light up. Population III stars probably burn fast and furious and then explodes, causing heavier elements and leaving neutron stars behind. Population II stars follow, and burn slower, also causing heavier elements and leaving white dwarfs and neutron stars behind. This happened about 0\u20135\u20131 billion years after the bang.Neutron stars collide, some white dwarfs steals matter from neighbouring stars to then explode. These explosions causes the heaviest elements to form.Population I stars form, with planetary disks formed by the heavier elements.On one such planet around one such star, life appears. Exactly how is unknown, although we have some pretty good ideas of the general process. This happened about 3.5\u20134 billion years ago.Evolution of single-celled organisms. Photosynthesis happens. The Great Oxygenation Event happens, killing off almost all life. Eukaryotes evolve as a response, about 1.2 billion years ago.Multicellular life evolves, first as colonies, then as multi-celled creatures.Life colonises the surface, first as lichen, then as other flower-less plants. Eventually, sea creatures evolve to live on land, around 600 million years ago.Land animals diversifies through evolution. Mammals branch off from reptiles about 240 million years ago. Birds branch off from dinosaurs about 70 million years ago. Flowering plants appear.One particular branch of mammals evolve intelligence, tool making, abstract language and upright stance, starting from about 3\u20137 million years ago. Our particular species appear 150,000 years ago. They start to domesticate animals and plants, starting with dogs around 20,000\u201340,000 years ago. Plants were domesticated around 13,000 years ago.To reconcile these two views of how the universe and us came to be requires a lot of squinting. I\u2019m not talking about the \u201cday\u201d thing in Genesis; that is a particular use in English, and the Hebrew word can be interpreted as \u201cera\u201d or \u201cepoch\u201d rather than \u201cday\u201d. However, Genesis and science do not agree on the order or even on the nature of things. For example, the Genesis story explicitly says that fruit-bearing trees (i.e. flowering trees) appear before animals; however, fruits are linked to flowers, and flowers require something to do pollination (insects or small birds) which are only created the following day. The Genesis story also places the creation of domesticated animals before the creation of humans; from archaeology and anthropology, we know that wolves were the first animal to be domesticated to dogs by humans. I won\u2019t mention the \u201cday\u201d thing So in order to make the Genesis story compatible with the evidence at hand, you have to squint a lot and assume that the Bible authors completely misunderstood when God tried to teach them about big bang cosmology, astrophysics and biology. But hey, that\u2019s at least expected by bronze-age goat-herders who have barely invented writing. You can also interpret the Genesis story as allegory and a celebration of God\u2019s creative majesty, instead of as a description and a science textbok. Then the point is that God created the universe and everything in it, but the \u201chow\u201d is more like poetry than an actual \u201chow\u201d. Or you can hold the Bible as literal truth, and imagine up a satanic cult of godless scientists trying to lead people away from God with their blasphemous science. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is yes, science does agree with the creation theory. There are no scientific theories that can prove creation theory to be false because it is neither verifiable nor falsifiable. But there is a great amount of evidence that points to the plausibility of the existence of God, and by extension creation theory. The most predominant theory today regarding how the universe came into existence is the Big Bang theory. According to this theory, the universe came into existence at a specific point in time, billions of years ago. In fact, that specific point in time was very likely the beginning of time itself because space, matter and time would not have existed before the Big Bang occurred. According to scientific principles, there is a cause for every effect in the universe - no cause, no effect. In the case of the universe, which is the effect, there must have been something that caused it to come into existence because it could not have caused itself to come into existence. Theists maintain that something is God. The most logical explanation, given all the other evidence of God\u2019s existence in the universe (e.g. cosmological, teleological, moral arguments), is that God caused the Big Bang to happen. Atheists like to call this \u201cThe God of the gaps,\u201d insinuating that theists always fall back on God whenever they can\u2019t explain something. On the contrary, we don\u2019t fall back on God because we have no explanation, but rather we feel that God is the best and most reasonable explanation. The basic argument goes like this: All things that come into existence must have a cause.The universe came into existence.Therefore the universe had a cause.Since the universe came into existence from nothing, before time, space and matter existed, there must necessarily have been something that existed outside of the universe that transcends time, space and matter. It would have had to have been something with unlimited power, and had a mind with unlimited intellect because, for the universe to have been brought into existence from nothing, it had to have been an intentional act. This is a very condensed version of the cosmological argument, but you can read more about it at this site. Defending Biblical Christianity | Reasonable Faith ",
