            "answer_text": "The substance is common salt and is written (by convention) as NaCl. What happens when you add it to water: NaCl + H2O = Na+ and Cl- and H2O In that process..by the salt \"dissociates\" in to Sodium Ions and Chloride Ions. As you add more salt to the water...That process will continue until the resulting solution becomes \"saturated\". Any additional salt added will appear in the bottom of the solution as a white granular precipitate. prof Doug  ",

            "answer_text": "NaCl + H20 \u2192NaOH + HCl Addition of Sodium Chloride to water results in formation of Sodium Hydroxide and Hydrogen Chloride. Both NaOH and HCl are strong electrolytes so they exist in the form of ions. Observations: After addition of NaCl to water, number of ions increased in water, as a result the colligative properties of the solvent changes. Elevation in Boiling Point, water boils at 100 C, due to addition of salt, the resultant solution boils at slightly higher temperature.Depression in Freezing point, freezing of the solution happens below zero temperature.Vapour pressure of the solution is less compared to pure water.And there\u2019s no change in pH.",
