Black hole is not a mythical or a supernatural thing.Black hole is a vacuum cleaner. Vacuum cleaners suck everything near BUT they do not catapult it through space if missed.There exists a parallel universe beyond the Event Horizon. Black holes are unimaginably dense, enough to bend space and time but opening another universe within them? What?And black holes are not \u201cHoles\u201d They are spherical, like our sun.",
