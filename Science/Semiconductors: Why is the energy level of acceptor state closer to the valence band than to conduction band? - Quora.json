            "answer_text": "If we talk about Donor levels and Acceptors level at 0K, there will not be any thermally generated electrons or wholes are present. Since the electrons present in the valence band or we can say the holes are in co-valent bond and are in the infulence of Nucleus. The acceptor level is neither of the valence band category and neither any thermal generated holes are there, Hence the Acceptor levels are given those allowed energy levels which are closer to the valence band. Similarly the donor level are below the conduction band as those are not thermally generated electrons. ",

            "answer_text": "As the name suggests it is the acceptor band ie it will accept the electrons. But where are the electrons present? In the valence band. So, the acceptor band being closer to the valence band accepts electrons from it and creates holes. Similarly in n type semiconductors the donor band lies closer to the conduction band as it donates it's electrons to the conduction band so that flow of charge carriers can take place easily. ",
