            "answer_text": "Hardboards are a cheaper option than plywood where strength is not required. Hardboard is made from wood fibre is extracted from chips and pulped wood waste. In the production process the pulp is exploded under pressure. Heat and steam is applies to leave a fine, fluffy brown fibres. These fibres are transformed into mats, which are held together with lignum and other glues. The mats are than pressed between steam-heated metal plates to give grainless sheets with one smooth, glossy surface and one textured surface. To prevent warping, moisture is added in a humidification chamber. Disadvantages: -Hardboard cannot be used outside because it absorbs water. Advantages: -There are three basic types of hardboard are available - standard, medium and oil-tempered. Oil tempered boards are impregnated with oil making them stiffer, harder and more resistant to scratches and moisture. A number of specially hardboards are available for specific purposes. These have either embossed, perforated, plastic-faced or veneer surfaces. Hardboard is made of sawmill or forestry remainders. Using steam and heat, the wood is mechanically broken down into fibres. In the wet production process, the water is extracted from the pulp by pressing the pulp against a sieve and then pressed into panels under high pressure. The natural wood resin serves as an adhesive. In the dry production process, the fibres are first dried and then pressed together using additional resin adhesives to form a panel. Depending upon the surface treatment, hardboard can be used for a variety of purposes. It is well suited for painting, varnishing, coating with films and veneer. The panel has a dark brown colouring. Its properties can be influenced through the addition of additional bonding agents. Hardboards principle advantages are its stable form, light weight, resilience and low cost. Hardboard is also available with film coatings e.g. in white or with wood patterning. Physical Hardboard Properties The physical properties of any hardboard are primarily dependent upon the wood furnished, the degree and uniformity of defiberation, the ability to properly form the wet mat at economical production speeds, the density to which the mat can be consolidated in the hot press and the degree of heat treatment after consolidation. Manufacturers have a varying degree of choice with respect to finished hardboard properties, depending upon their physical location and mill facilities. Ampersand\u2019s source for hardboard holds a prominent position in the hardboard industry. A number of wood species are available, making it possible to select the species according to specific property requirements of the end product. Slow-growth aspen produces clean, strong, highly-uniform fibers for our S2S hardboard. A fine fiber slush overlay provides S2S with an extra smooth surface for finishing. By fusing special additives into the cellulosic structure, they have developed a high water resistant board while maintaining the high quality finishing properties.Their aggressive manufacturing control systems and frequent QC testing, assure the qualities of flatness, dimensional stability, machinability, smoothness, and paint hold-out. The hardboard we use is highly engineered S2S (smooth two sides). The manufacturing process begins with slow-growth aspen that produces clean, highly uniform fibers making the S2S a dimensionally stable and consistently flatter board. The unique fiber slush overlay provides a superior smooth surface that leaves no ripples, dimples, or blemishes. This smoother surface is impeccable for wet or dry finishing applications, giving us a superior finished quality product. The following information compares Ampersand\u2019s Hardbord to the standard hardboard on the market: Tempered Hardboard S2S 1/8 Ampersand Hardbord S2S Basic Standard Untempered S2S 1/8 Density Lbs./Cu. ft 70.0 N/A Internal bond, psi >250 >130 Modulus of Rupture, psi >9000 >6000 24 Hr. Water Soak % Water Absorbtion <15% <25% % Thickness Increase <10% <20% Environmentally Safe and Superior Quality Our hardboard supplier does not use urea-formaldehyde glue in the manufacturing process. They rely on the natural lignin in wood for the bonding of the wood fibers, making our board environmentally sound. Ampersand\u2019s Hardbord is considered HWR hardboard (High Water Resistant) and is suitable for those applications where improved water resistance is required over normal hardboard. Special additives are fused into cellulosic structure to form a barrier against water absorption. This results in improved dimensional stability, so the products you make with HWR hardboard are far less likely to swell or warp. Aggressive manufacturing control systems and frequent quality control testing insure consistent results. These improved properties are achieved while maintaining the industry\u2019s leading finishing qualities expected for the hardboard we use. ",
