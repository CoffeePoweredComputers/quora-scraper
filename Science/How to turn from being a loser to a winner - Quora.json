            "answer_text": "Fuck it, you are as big a loser as you think you are. Its all in our mind and the day we can get rid of it is the forst step in changing ourself and our lives. It doesnt matter what age you are or what family background you come from, whether you have a talent or not. All these things will take you just so far and after that your success depends on your attitude. It s absolutely no big deal if you dont have anything as of now but you should have the attitude to keep working hard and smart no matter what happens and such an attitude will always take you towards success. Keep working hard, do what you like no matter what anyone tells you and bust your butt to make that dream of yours come true. Do not focus on your failures, learn from them and move on and never feel content with you success untill you reach the best you ever can. Keep striving for more and better and keep working hard. Best of luck ",

Wake up and take charge from now where do you want to move. Make a roadmap and stick to it. Generally depressed are those who don\u2019t have any work to do and that\u2019s why they love to stuck in past and self made worries. You have so much work in hand.
