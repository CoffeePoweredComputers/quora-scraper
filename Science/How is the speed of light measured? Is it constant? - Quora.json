            "answer_text": "The speed of light is constant in all reference of frames ( 299 792 458 m/s), there are different of ways to calculate the speed of light .. one of the, is The Kerr Cell shutter.. A beam of light is timed between an emitter and receiver while passing through a Kerr Cell.  The Kerr Cell consists of a (A) transparent container filled with (B) Nitrobenzene attached to two electrodes (C and D). A high voltage is passed through the electrodes which causes an electric field perpendicular to the transmitted light beam to be applied.. When the cell is activated the light beam is diverted and takes a different path to the receiver, this time difference is measured and the speed of light is calculated based on knowledge of the expected return time.

            "answer_text": "The speed-of-light cannot be measured: since 1983 it has been a defined constant. But if you have a good (atomic) clock and a suitably-modulated light source you can use the defined speed-of-light to measure the actual length (plus-or-minus some small error range) of a nominal \u201cmeter stick\u201d.
