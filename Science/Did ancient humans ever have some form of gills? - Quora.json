            "answer_text": "Did ancient humans ever have some form of gills? TL/DL: No. Longer answer: The \u201cAquatic ape hypothesis\u201d as it is called, is the largest load of Bovinae feces ever to be unloaded on the scientific community. Which is why it is not supported by the scientific community. It makes as much sense as the flat earth movement in that there is \u201csome evidence\u201d when you stretch that evidence and ignore other explanations that have further evidence to back them up. Predecessors of mammals had gills, so embryos pass through a stage where they have something that resembles gills. At this same stage most land life all looks the same, lizard, bird, mammal, higher, lower, no matter how you qualify it, we all show our ancestral roots by going through this stage. So, no, that does not in any way demonstrate evidence of an aquatic ape ancestor of man. A more recent ancestor would show evidence of these traits much more noticeably. We see demonstratable evidence of the mating of Neanderthal and Denisovan into the human stock even though it makes up only 2\u20134% of our genetic make-up. What does it mean to have Neanderthal or Denisovan DNA? In addition to the percentage of Neanderthal or Denisovan DNA, direct to-consumer testing reports may include information about a few genetic variants inherited from these ancestors that influence specific traits. Studies have suggested that certain genetic variations inherited from archaic humans may play roles in hair texture, height, sensitivity of the sense of smell, immune responses, adaptations to high altitude, and other characteristics in modern humans. These variations may also influence the risk of developing certain diseases. However, the significance of Neanderthal or Denisovan genetic variants on disease risk is still an area of active study, and most direct-to-consumer test results currently do not include them. We have a reasonable grasp on the history of human evolution. Even to our ape ancestors. So no sneaking in an aquatic ape.

What missing link?\u201d  So\u2026 no, no hominid had gills. You have to go back to when all life came from the ocean to find when all life had gills. Those were not hominids. That was when fish first walked on land and developed lungs and lost gills. ",

            "answer_text": "Did ancient humans ever have some form of gills? Short answer = No. Slightly longer answer = No, as ancient humans were humans, and, their ancestors were earlier hominids, and their ancestors were earlier primates, and their ancestors were earlier mammals, and their ancestors were earlier amniotes\u2026 and their ancestors were earlier reptiles. The ancestors of the earlier reptiles though, were earlier amphibians, and, some of those had gills, especially in their younger stages, such as tadpoles, salamanders, etc. The ancestors of the earlier amphibians were earlier fish, and these had gills in their adult stages. :D ",

The ancestors of land-based animals emigrated from the sea approximately a billion years ago. Mammals have existed for only some 100 million years and primates did not emerge until about 6 1/5 million years ago. What on earth would mammals do with gills that would be completely useless for the past 100 million years\u2014or what would their ancestors do with them in the roughly previous 900 million years? Many charts and description of how life evolved on our planet and the timelines involved are available in many places on the web. ",

The theory of recapitulation, also called the biogenetic law or embryological parallelism\u2014often expressed using Ernst Haeckel's phrase \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\" \u2026 is a historical hypothesis that the development of the embryo of an animal, from fertilization to gestation or hatching (ontogeny), goes through stages resembling or representing successive adult stages in the evolution of the animal's remote ancestors (phylogeny). It was formulated in the 1820s by \u00c9tienne Serres based on the work of Johann Friedrich Meckel, after whom it is also known as Meckel\u2013Serres law.  ",
